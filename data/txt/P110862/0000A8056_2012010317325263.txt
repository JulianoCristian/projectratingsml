                         The PFM project was started in July 2009 and will be completed in June 2013. The total estimated cost of the Project is US$18 million, to be funded by: i) US$16 million from the Iraq
                         Trust Fund, to be Recipient-executed; and ii) US$2 million from the ITF, to be Bank-executed.

                         Under the Recipient-executed Trust Fund, there are four components: (1) Strengthening Budget formulation (2) Strengthening Public Procurement Systems (3) Strengthening Budget

                         Execution. (4) Capacity Development and Project Management. Against a project cost of $16 million, after the lapse of 50% project time, only $446,000 (less than 3%) has been
                         disbursed; $6.92 million (43 %) has been contracted; and, $2.73 million (17 %) is under process of being contracted. The Consultants contracted have begun their work and should
                         be able to complete their task within the remaining project time. There are still $6.35 million (39 %) remaining funds under the project for which no plan has been prepared.

                         Following major reasons can be attributed to the slow progress under the project:

                         1. Three major terrorist attacks on the Ministry of Finance since the project start in which the Ministry of Finance building was heavily damaged leading to change of offices of the
                         Project Management Team (PMT) and consequent stress and fear in the minds of PMT staff.
                         2. 9 out of 11 staff of the Project Management Team (PMT), including the PMT leader, was working part-time on this project and were therefore not giving adequate attention to
                         project implementation.
                         3. There was inadequate supervision and implementation support from the Bank side. There were delays in giving 'no objections' and the PMT was not given appropriate guidance at
                         appropriate time leading to low disbursements, low commitments, large proportion of unplanned funds, and absence of an adequate M&E system.
                         4. There was inadequate supervision from the Ministry of Finance in so far as involvement of the Minister and high officials in steering the project is concerned. There was no stock-
                         taking of the situation under the project and no directions issued by the ministry to take necessary corrective measures.

                         Under the Bank-executed Trust Fund, there are two components: (1) Capacity Building of Board of Supreme Audit (BSA); and, (2) Strengthening Budget Preparation. Against the
                         project cost of $2 million, $692,000 (35 %) has been disbursed; $386,000 (19 %) has been contracted; and, $350,000 (17 %) is in the process of being contracted. Under this project,
                         the Budget Strategy for 2012-2014; Budget Call Circular for 2011; Updation and Administration of IMF Model in the 2012 Budget process; Conduction of Trainings for the BSA Staff
                         regarding Regularity Audit, Performance Audit, Risk based Audit, Integrity Audit, Procurement Audit, and Training of Trainers have been completed. The Clients are satisfied with
                         activities of the Bank-executed Trust Fund.

                         The Bank Supervision Team is of the view that the project’s impact would be significantly enhanced if an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) is also
                         implemented. Component 1 on Budget Preparation and Component 3 on Budget Execution Controls can deliver better results if implemented over an Information Technology based
                         Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). The Government has requested the Bank to reallocate unplanned project funds for completing IFMIS. They have given
                         an undertaking to provide the remaining funds from its own sources in regard to implementing IFMIS. It is also necessary from the point of view of utilizing the unplanned funds.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The Government will establish a Steering Committee of the Project under the chair of the Finance Minister. The Committee shall include the PMT Leader, Director General Budget,
                         Director General Accounts, Director General Planning, and Director General Training. The Steering Committee shall: (1) Approve the annual budget (2) Review the progress every six
                         months and (3) Approve any Restructuring Plans.
                         2. The Government will appoint five full-time staff to function as the Component Leaders in respect of (1) Budget Preparation (2) Public Procurement (3) Budget Execution (4)
                         Capacity Building (5) IFMIS.
                         3. As per government's request, the Bank team shall initiate a restructuring of the project by including IFMIS as the fifth component of the PFM Project. In the remaining one and half
                         years of the project, the Budget Preparation, Budget Execution, and Final Accounts modules of IFMIS will be implemented. The target shall be to prepare the Budget of 2013 using
                         IFMIS from June 2012 onwards and then use the Budget Execution and Final Accounts modules for Budget of 2013, from January 2013 onwards.
