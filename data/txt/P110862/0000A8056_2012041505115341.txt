                         The Project became effective on July 20, 2009 and is expected to close on June 30, 2013. The project cost is $16.00 million. At the time of mid-term review, in August - September
                         2011, the total disbursements under the project were only $446,000 (less than 3 %) - these have arisen to $1.687 million (about 11 %) at the end of February 2012. The project has
                         thus made some good progress during the past 4 months - a disbursement of $1.241 million (7.7 % of the project cost) in just about 4 months. However, the cumulative disbursement
                         rate of only 11 % in 67 % project time is far too low. The uncommitted funds are extremely high ($8.2 million) - more than 50 % of the project cost; and there are still some major

                         bottlenecks in the project implementation. The government needs to soon decide on the use of uncommitted funds and remove the implementation bottlenecks. The implementation
                         progress is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                         4. The PMT has dropped the activity of developing sector strategies under Component 1, as the same is being done by the government with the help of another donor.
                         5. The PMT has proposed to include following new activities in the project through restructuring: (a) IFMIS, (b) Case Study of Taxation of mobile phone companies, (c) Leadership
                         Training, (d) CPA Training, (e) Completion of IT-based Taxation System started by USAID, and (f) Upgradation of DMFAS
