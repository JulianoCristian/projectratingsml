the Public Finance\n            Management Project for Iraq were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was high, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Grantee performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: public financial management\n            reforms generally fall into two types: i) efforts to improve\n            budget transparency and classification; and, ii) those that\n            improve the scope and comprehensiveness of the budget. On\n            the other side of the spectrum are a host of reforms that\n            are neither particularly easy to implement nor which bring\n            the promise of substantial fiscal gains, at least in the\n            short-term. Some public financial reforms to improve the\n            scope and comprehensiveness of the budget are not\n            technically difficult to implement. However, unless\n            significant political capital is invested in overcoming\n            bureaucratic resistance, these reforms are unlikely to move\n            forward. Projects that are complex, multi-faceted and that\n            involve process and attitudinal changes from a multitude of\n            government actors require much more scrutiny, analysis, and\n            more informed project design from the outset. The critical\n            success factors for any Integrated Financial Management\n            Information System, or IFMIS project (large or small) are\n            quite clear: a full-time project coordinator is required;\n            there needs to be strong political will and a champion at\n            the political level; and the project needs to provide an\n            abundance of training."}, "docdt": "2014-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
