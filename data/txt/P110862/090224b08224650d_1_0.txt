                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Iraq Public Financial Management (PFM) project was started as an emergency operation in July 2009 under the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF). The project has been completed on
                         August 30, 2013. The total estimated cost of the Project was US$18.62 million: i) US$16 million being Recipient-executed; and ii) US$2.62 million being Bank-executed on behalf of
                         the Recipient. Under the Recipient-executed part, against the project cost of $16 million, $9.8 million (61 %) was disbursed. Under the Bank-executed part, against the project cost of

                         $2.62 million, $2.53 million (97 %) was disbursed. Against the total project cost of $18.62 million, $12.34 million (66 %) was disbursed.

                         It is especially noteworthy that since the the last ISR of March 29, 2013, the Project was successful in disbursing an amount of $ 5.8 million under the Recipient-executed part of the
                         Project between April and August 2013. This last spurt in project implementation resulted in 59 % of Total Disbursements and 36 % of Total Project cost being disbursed in the last 5
                         months of the Project. This would indicate the level of efforts that were put by both the Project Management Team and the Bank in managing the project deliverables and taking
                         timely decisions. It also indicated that the initial bottlenecks in project implementation were almost fully overcome towards the last part of the Project. The Disbursement Graph shows
                         a continuous acceleration in project disbursements since August 2011.

                         On the physical progress, following were the major outputs delivered by the Project:

                         1.         Work towards preparing a fully functional Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was initiated in 2009 and developed over each subsequent year until the 2014-16
                         Budget strategy round, with good progress towards establishing Iraq's Medium Term Fiscal Framework.
                         2.         The Iraqi Medium-term Fiscal (IMF) model was fully operational, tested and enhanced during the 2011 budget strategy process, and was applied to support subsequent
                         strategy preparation up to and including 2014-16.
                         3.         A comprehensive historical database of fiscal information is also in place. It covers fiscal, economic and related data from 2005 onwards and includes budget, budget
                         review, actuals for different accounting frameworks (and reported by different entities), spending unit bids, forecasts and approved ceilings.
                         4.         Cash Management and Commitment Control Manual prepared and piloted in Ministries of Education and Water Resources and Province of Basra.
                         5.         Sector Standard Bidding Documents (SSBDs) for Education, Health, Electricity, IT, Consultancy services, and Pre-qualification delivered along with the Training on their
                         use.
                         6.         National Implementation Manual (NIM) is developed, Training Curriculum prepared, and training delivered on using the NIM
                         7.         Training needs assessment on public procurement has been conducted, training strategy on public procurement for public officials has been developed and adopted by
                         MOP, and training of trainers has been delivered.
                         8.         Capacity Development Plan of the Ministry of Finance Accounting Training Center (MoFATC) has been approved and implemented by the government.
                         9.         Skills of Board of Supreme Audit (BSA) staff in financial, risk-based, procurement, and performance audit has been enhanced.
                         10. Capacity on oil audit, forensic audit, arbitration, contract management, auditing of World Bank-financed projects, and M&E has been built. Around 380 auditors, including 15
                         master trainers were trained with about 12,700 training hours invested and on e audit manual has been fully developed. The work on improving three audit manuals has been
                         initiated. Master trainers in their turn have disseminated knowledge gained to another 150 staff investing around 2,500 training hours.
                         11. Interim Reports for improving the adherence to the Budget Call Circular, and, improving the process of annual budget formulation and strengthening public financial management
                         framework were prepared.
                         12. Inception Report for developing detailed sector strategies and improving the methodology of investment project preparation and evaluation were delivered.

                         13. The report on Assessment of Internal Financial Controls, including roles of Internal Auditors and Inspectors Generals was delivered. This report provides a status analysis of the
                         current internal financial control arrangements in four ministries and a road-map describing the way forward in implementing reforms in the internal financial control environment. MOF
                         can build on this status analysis and road map to enhance the internal controls in Iraq, including the role of internal auditors and IGs.
                         14. An Intranet secure website of the Ministry of Finance was designed and developed covering Document & Content Management and centralized Help Desk with notifications;
                         Internet Portal covering News Bulletin, Calendar Events, News Bar, Currencies Exchange Rates, News Archive, Search; dedicated hosting services for 3 years; and Webmail with
                         help desk functions and secure shared directories.

                         Nevertheless, there were following short comings:

                         1. Under the Recipient-executed part, against the total project cost of US$16 million, US$6 million was allocated to a new component on Integrated Financial Management
                         Information System (IFMIS) through restructuring. The government had selected and negotiated a contract with Free Balance Company to design and test the IFMIS prototype. The
                         OPRC had given its clearance to the selection, but at the last stage, Free Balance Company was temporarily suspended by the Bank for its conduct in some other country. The Bank

                         team tried to get at least the design of the IFMIS prototype ready by the project end, but due to the lengthy procurement process, the selection of consultant could not be done in
                         time. Due to this, the new component could not take off from the outset, leading to a shortfall in disbursements.

                         2. Also, a contractual dispute had arisen between the government and eGen consultants under the first component on improving the budget preparation process. The government’s

                         view was that the consultant’s initial deliverables like the inception report were not consistent with the terms of reference and thus not in conformity with the contractual obligations.
                         The consultant’s stand was that the sequencing and content of different deliverables was discussed and agreed in the inception workshop and that their deliverables were consistent
                         with that agreement. There was a prolonged stand off, and finally, the contract was terminated with mutual agreement and payments commensurate with work completed were
                         issued.

                         Barring above two matters, all other activities under the project were completed within the project time. Considering the significant progress made by the Project in implementation of
                         project activities, submission of deliverables, and disbursements isnce the last ISR between April and August 2013 the rating of Implementation Progress has been increased from
                         "Moderately Unsatisfactory" to "Moderately Satisfactory".
