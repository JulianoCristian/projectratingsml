                         A recently completed Fiduciary Review carried out by UK DfID charts progress over the past three years in budget quality and credibility, budget linkages to policy priorities
                         (Component I), budget execution, accounting and reporting and external controls (Component III). The review reported progress along the main aspects of the Public Finance
                         Management Action Plan which serves as the basis for the project. Areas identified as in need of more attention in the short and medium term include commitment controls and cash
                         release systems (Component III). Progress on Procurement (Component II) continues to lag due to delays in the adoption of the Procurement Law.
