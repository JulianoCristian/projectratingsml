        The WB-Public Expenditure Review (PER) indicates capital spending efficiency rates for the Government of Iraq at around 55%. The PER obtained their data from Ministry of
      Planning (MoP) data sources. The ICR Review obtained development (investment) budget spending efficiency rates directly from the Ministry of Finance. Although, there is
      some difference in the measurement of capital spending efficiency rates, the conclusion remains the same:- capital budget execution rates did not rise to meet the targeted rate of
      85% as presented in this PDO indicator.




                                                                                              iv
                  2013). Without reviewing the 640 plus spending unit bank accounts at the Central Bank of Iraq, it is difficult to determine
                  whether Indicator 2 has been achieved.

                  The Project’s ISR-3 and 4 indicated that there was a reclassification of accounts in 2009, due to which the Cash Balances at
                  31 December 2009 were reduced to 3.843 trillion (5.5% of the Budget). The cash balances stood at 5.937 trillion ID on June
                  2011 (6.1% of the budget) as per the new classification. Thus, there is a problem in comparing the progress with the
                  baselines as the definition of indicator has changed. The outcome indicator and its baseline needed to be (re)adjusted.
                  The way forward with respect to measuring this indicator was to estimate the present cash balances as per earlier
                  classification by including provincial accounts, accounts of government trading enterprises, and purchases of vehicles.
                  However, this was not done and cannot be measured by this ICR. While the need to change the indicators may be identified
                  during the Mid-term review, indicators are changed through formal restructuring approved by the Board or Management (as
                  applicable).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

    1. The Project Development Objective (PDO) included supporting the
Government of Iraq's (GoI) efforts to develop more effective, accountable and
transparent public financial management (PFM). Cross-cutting PFM reforms were
aimed at addressing the national public financial system. The primary objectives included,
but were not limited to: i) Strengthening budget formulation, execution and control; ii)
Improving public financial reporting; iii) Strengthening public procurement; and, 4)
Developing local capacity.

    2. The Iraq PFM project was driven by the GoI’s multi-year public financial
reform strategy action plan (See Annexure 8) which laid out the GoI’s sequencing of
PFM reforms to the international donor community. The primary target group
included resource managers and their superiors in the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and
Ministry of Planning (MoP), as well as line ministries. In order to maximize project
effectiveness, international experts worked alongside key GoI officials in Iraq on the
practical tasks that need to be supported and strengthened.

 1.1 Context at Appraisal

     3. Iraq is resource rich and that benefited from a substantial increase in oil
revenues. Between 2004 and 2008, Iraq’s fiscal position remained strong as oil prices
were on the rise. Fiscal surpluses were achieved for four consecutive years prior to
project implementation due to rising oil revenues. The share of oil GDP averaged 61
percent during 2004-2008. Crude oil exports represented 98 percent of total exports and
oil revenues made up 96 percent of total budget revenue (excluding grants).

    4. Strategic resource allocations in Iraq suffered from inadequate attention and
integration of a medium term perspective to budgeting and financial planning.
Although a strategic medium term fiscal perspective existed, it was difficult to see the
connection between this and annual resource allocations. The problem was compounded
by the lack of effective integration between the recurrent and investment budgets both at
the national (aggregate) level and at sectoral level. An ongoing issue was the relatively
inadequate (low) capital investment budget execution rate.

   5. Weak line ministry project evaluation and appraisal capacity led to
inadequate project design and preparation. Annual implementation plans for projects
were unrealistic and subject to constant revision. Contractors lacked the capacity to
prepare contracts that meet the detailed specification required for the projects. The
payment process was slow with the system of cash budgeting adding to problems.

   6. Iraq used a predominately cash-based payments system, which provided
authority to make cash payments over the fiscal year only, thus precluding the ability
to make commitments when necessary. Independent audits of all Government budget



                                            1
accounts for any recent financial year were either not undertaken, or have not been made
available.

    7. The final review of the second IMF Stand-by-Agreement (SBA) took place in
October 2008 and was completed in December 2008. Completion of this review
triggered the third and final stage of Iraq's Paris Club debt reduction agreement, for a
total debt reduction of 80 percent in NPV terms. The IMF precautionary arrangement
expired on March 19, 2009. Iraq received extensive assistance from the IMF under three
consecutive programs (EPCA and two SBAs).

Rationale for Proposed Bank Emergency Project

    8. The Iraq PFMP was proposed as an Emergency Operation to be prepared
and processed under OP 8.00, Rapid Response to Crisis and Emergencies, and in
accordance with the Second Interim Strategy Note (ISN2) for Iraq. During this
period, all World Bank Projects in Iraq were prepared under OP8.00. While PFM per se
is not a sector typically associated with emergencies, it was seen that in the case of Iraq,
without improvements to the PFM system sustainable longer-term reconstruction would
be difficult. The WB PFM intervention sought to improve this situation.

    9. The Project was seen to fit at least four of the seven objectives (OP 8.00, para.
4) for the use of the OP: a) rebuilding and restoring physical assets; b) restoring the
means of production and economic activities; c) preserving or restoring essential
services; and d) establishing and/or preserving human, institutional, and/or social capital,
including economic reintegration of vulnerable groups. Finally, client demand to-date
indicated interest in the Project.

    10. As late as 2008 (See Concept Review) there was a high degree of optimism
(supported by very good background work and planning by the World Bank team.
There had been several encouraging developments: inter alia, Prime Minister Allawi had
visited with the World Bank and encouraged a broader Public Financial Management
project, a constitution had been ratified (2005), and serious discussions were underway of
a system of asymmetrical decentralization that would give a high degree of fiscal
autonomy to Kurdistan, Baghdad and the governorates to the South. And local elections
were set for early 2009 (and were held that January). Furthermore, as this ICR report
notes, at Appraisal “Iraq’s fiscal position remained strong”. With that information, the
Concept Note was approved with a vision that Iraq would not only soon re-establish itself
in the middle income category, but also go from “lower” to “upper” middle income to
join the ranks of, for example, South Korea.


BANK RESPONSE: THE PROJECT

Brief Description of Bank’s Strategy for Emergency Support

   11. The Second Interim Strategy Note for Iraq (ISN 2) was presented to the
World Bank Board of Directors on September 15, 2005. The Bank Group's work
program was organized into four pillars, supporting government efforts to: (i) restore

                                             2
basic services; (ii) enable private sector development; (iii) strengthen social safety nets;
and (iv) improve public sector governance. The endorsement of this strategy paved the
way for a US$500 million IDA 14 allocation for lending in priority sectors, and for the
provision of analytic and advisory work clustered around the four pillars.

    12. The Third Interim Strategy Note for Iraq (ISN-3) was presented to the
World Bank Board of Directors on March 19, 2009. Under ISN-3, the Bank's
assistance to Iraq was organized around three thematic areas of engagement: (i)
continuing to support ongoing reconstruction and socio-economic recovery; (ii)
improving governance and management of public resources, including human, natural
and financial; and (iii) supporting policies and institutions that promote broad-based,
private-sector-led growth, with the goal of revitalizing the private sector and facilitating
job creation. The preparation of this Project straddles both ISN-2 and ISN-3.

    13. The primary financing instrument to achieve these objectives was the
International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI). The IRFFI assisted
donors in channeling and coordinating resources for reconstruction and development in
line with Iraq's priority program. This was accomplished primarily through two trust
funds: i) the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF), and, ii) the UN Development Group
Trust Fund. The ITF financed eighteen grants totaling US$481.6 million.

    14. From the perspective of the GoI, improving PFM was a key strategic goal for
long-term improvement in public sector management. The Bank had substantial
previous involvement in assisting the GoI by delivering a number of analytical pieces.
The framework document for overall reform of the PFM system is the Public Finance
Management Action Plan (see Annex 8), the preparation of which was supported by the
Bank in collaboration with the IMF. The PFM Action Plan was part of the conditions for
the IMF’s Stand-by Arrangement.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

    15. The Project Development Objective is to support the Government of Iraq's
efforts to develop more effective, accountable and transparent public financial
management. Key Outcome Indicators at approval were:

-   Component 1: Capital budget execution rate increases by at least 10 percentage points

-   Component 2 Outstanding balances in Spending Units decline by 30 percentage
    points, as a share of the budget

-   Component 3: At least 50% of contracts above threshold awarded competitively

-    Component 4: Ministry of Finance training institute providing training in all
    operational aspects of PFM project

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
                                             3
    16. The PDO was not changed during the Restructuring of January 25, 2013, but
some indicators were changed and others were dropped. Annex 2 presents the details of
the changes to the Results Framework and Key Indicators. See also the aforementioned
table on Results Framework Analysis, as well as the discussion of components, for
evaluation of the validity of the original and revised indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

   17. The primary target group was resource managers and their superiors in the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Ministry of Planning (MoP), as well as the line
ministries. In addition, the Board of Supreme Audit (BSA) received significant support
and capacity building through the Bank-executed portion of the Grant.

Original Components (as approved) 3

    18. Component 1. Strengthening budget formulation and implementation (US
$3.95 million). The overall objective of Component 1 was to lay a stronger foundation
for credible annual budgeting framed by a medium-term perspective and complemented
by more rigorous selection and preparation of investment projects consistent with a
national development (and sector) strategies) Activities included: i) Developing detailed
sector strategies for two key ministries (Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education,
but this is to be agreed at Negotiations); ii) Strengthening investment project preparation
and appraisal; iii) Strengthening the capacity of the Economic Department of MoF; and,
iv) Improving the process of annual budget formulation and budget classification and
strengthening the public financial regulatory framework

    19. Component 2. Strengthening Public Sector Procurement (US$ 3.2 million).
Component 2 included: i) Supporting the public sector procurement system; ii)
Developing sector specific standard bidding documents; iii) Establishing a procurement
information and monitoring system; and, iv) Strengthening the capacity of key Iraqi
implementing institutions, NGOs, and private sector in public procurement

    20. Component 3. Strengthening Budget Execution and Implementation (US
$2.33 million). Component 3 generally provided technical support to improve
administrative and functional aspects of GoI’s budget execution operations. Activities
included: i) Introducing an improved cash release system; ii) Developing a multiple

  The component cost totals represent the best estimates for the cost of completing the ‘upstream’
consultant outputs within each component. However, they do not account for the numerous “downstream”
activities which will arise from the consultant outputs. Prior to those outputs, it is not possible to
accurately estimate the costs for these activities. For this reason, a large portion (20%) of the total Grant is
Unallocated (see also Annex 1). In the Allocation table in Annex 4, and in the Grant Agreement, the bulk
of the Unallocated has been included in the Consultant Services category, as this category represents the
majority of the downstream activities; this reduces the Unallocated to less than 10% of the Grant.


                                                       4
treasury model; iii) Introducing a new commitment control system; iii) Improving
financial reporting; iv) Assessing the internal financial control system, including the role
of the Inspectors General; v) Creating new IT networks to improve intra-ministerial
communications; and vi) Providing capacity development for line ministries to enhance
their ability to implement investment projects

    21. Component 4. Capacity Development and Project Management. (US $3.0
million). This component was designed to ensure the effective coordination of all of the
training and capacity building efforts provided in the first three components. The
component also foresaw a focused strengthening of the MoF’s internal training
department.

    22. Bank-executed Part of the Grant. At the request of the Recipient, a portion of
the Grant was allocated for Bank-execution. In addition to the advisory services to be
provided (as described above, and in paras. 47-49 below), the Bank-executed part of the
Grant allowed the Project to support the efforts of the Federal Board of Supreme Audit
(BSA) and other governmental entities. Specifically, support would be provided for
advanced training of BSA staff in public finance, legal issues, accounting, and auditing.

1.6 Revised Components

    23. At Restructuring, the original four components were retained, with some
reductions in scope (see below), and an additional fifth component was added:
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). Specifically,
Component 5 was costed at US$ 6 million and consisted of:

a) Phase 1 – Prototype Development and Testing for the Supply and Implementation of
   Integrated Financial Management Information System to be conducted in the period
   January 2013 to August 31, 2013; and,

b) Phase 2 – Pilot Implementation and Government wide Rollout based on the results of
   phase 1 comprising:
     i.   Phase2A – Pilot Implementation – To commence on January 1, 2014 and
          conclude on December 31, 2014
    ii.   Phase 2B – Government wide Rollout – To commence January 1, 2015 and be
          completed by June 30, 2016.
    24. Component 5 of the Project would support only Phase 1 of this plan.
Following the evaluation of Phase 1, GoI was expected to roll-out the IFMIS on a
Government wide basis (Phase 2). The justification for Component 5 was presented as
follows: i) Provide capability to automate the budget preparation process to ensure
complete and accurate budget formulation and presentation (to support Component 1); ii)
Increase the ability of the Ministry of Finance to undertake central control and
monitoring of expenditure and receipts in government Ministries, departments and
spending units (to support Component 3); and, iii) Provide the Ministry of Finance with
access to comprehensive and meaningful information on budgetary, financial and
operational performance during the financial year (to support Components 1 and 3).

1.7 Other significant changes

    25. Project closing date was extended to August 2013. In addition, funds were
reallocated to accommodate an additional Component 5: Development of an IFMIS
Prototype (see above).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

    26. The Emergency Project Paper (EPP) description of “Lessons Learned”
highlighted the following features: i) the importance of simple, well defined, and
flexible project design to allow for adaptation to changing circumstances in a context of
participation from the donor community; ii) the reality that Iraq presented additional
specific challenges, because it was (and still is) a country in conflict, and the institutional
weaknesses demand that project design not be overly ambitious; iii) limited possibility of
Bank staff to visit Iraq, and few international consultants willing to work there; iv) in
view of the above, higher than average costs for all projects, particularly to carry out
adequate supervision; v) limited institutional capacity; and vi) difficulty of successfully
implementing complex projects. In addition, with specific reference to fragile and post-
conflict countries, the EPP stated that, “The project also takes into account lessons
learned from PFM projects in fragile and post-conflict countries, including: i) ensuring
robust understanding of country context and dynamics; ii) providing adequate funding
and road map for capacity building upfront; and, iii) focusing on harmonization in the
field and ensuring that limited country capacity is not diverted for harmonizing donors.”
The EPP asserted that the design of the proposed project was to be kept simple, focusing
on a few critical activities which were deemed achievable in a relatively short time-frame,
and which will provide quick impacts throughout the PFM system. Factors that affected
quality at entry (QAE) project implementation and outcomes are described in greater
detail below (see Para 78-85).

2.2 Implementation

    27. Project design provided that a Project Management Team (PMT) would be
dedicated to this Project and would be supported by Component Technical Teams.
However, during implementation, it evolved that key PMT members were unable to
spend full-time on the Project. The PMT staff was obligated to continue with their duties
at the MoF 4 . Further, the Component Technical Teams (CTTs) were never properly
formulated.

    28. The PMT unit appears to: 1) Have had insufficient capacity to engage in
international bidding and procurement processes; and, 2) Lacked the pre-requisite


4
 Nine of the eleven Project Management Team (PMT) staff, including the PMT, worked at the PMT unit
on a part-time basis.


                                                 6
technical management to develop, manage, and follow-through on international tenders.
Further, the payment approval procedure used was not appropriate. As a result, there
were significant delays in PMU payments. All of the above factors contributed to the
lack of effective project implementation. 5 . The ICR provides additional mitigating
factors impacting the PMT unit below (Paragraph 38). Clearly, many of these factors
(risks) should have been more thoroughly scrutinized and a sufficient back-up plan
developed.

    29. Low willingness of international consulting firms to continue working in Iraq.
Of significant importance was the low willingness on the part of international consulting
firms to work in Iraq. As a result, all international contracting took substantially longer
than originally envisaged. In addition to the procurement delays, two important contracts
under Component 1: Strengthening Budget Formulation was cancelled due to poor
performance, and outputs for this component were not realized.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

    30. The EPP did not provide a detailed monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan.
The original intermediate output indicators were significantly more substantive (e.g. with
numerical targets) then the revised indicators from the 2011/2012 restructuring. For
example, the original intermediate indicator for the Budget Call Circular provided for a
hard target of a “new BCC with hard budget ceilings issued”. The revised intermediate
indicator called for “new BCC in use? Yes or No”. The revised output measure is not as
useful in measuring performance achievement because the government by law must
develop and provide a new annual Budget Call Circular.

    31. The monitoring and evaluation plan was meant to be developed early in
Project implementation, but that did not happen, and as a result, systematic
monitoring did not occur until much later in the Project. As the project accelerated
its component outputs some improvements were evidenced in reviewing proposed
outputs and outcomes. Nevertheless, systematic output monitoring has only taken place
since early 2012, and to some extent allowed more proactive evaluation by the task team.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

    32. The Financial Management (FM) and disbursement functions of the Project
were managed by a Financial Management team consisting of a part time Financial
Officer (FO), a full time Internal Auditor, and a part time Financial Consultant (FC).
Overall, the team managed the project’s FM and disbursement functions in a generally
satisfactory manner without any major complications. During the lifetime of the project,


5
  The ICR recognizes that the several factors impacted the performance of the PMT project operations,
including: 1) the lack of full-time staff; 2) initially low management and technical capacity of the PMT
unit in engaging in managing and procuring for such complex projects. These factors contributed to the
strain on PMT procurement processes.


                                                     7
the PMU unit encountered substantial turnover and several changes at the top
management level including: the appointment of a new Project Management Team
Director and Deputy Director.

    33. The Interim Un-audited Financial Reports (IFRs) were prepared in
accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and
submitted in a timely manner. The Project’s accounts were subject to annual audit
performed by an international audit firm acceptable to the Bank in accordance with
acceptable Terms of Reference (TORs). All audit reports have been regularly submitted
to the Bank without delays. The auditor issued unqualified “clean” opinions on all issued
audited financial statements. The last audit report will cover the period from January 1,
2013 until closing date (August 30, 2013) plus the four month grace period ending
December 31, 2013, due by February 28, 2014.

    34. The Project suffered from delays in processing payments to beneficiaries due
to a number of bottlenecks and redundant steps in the payment review procedures
within the PMT and MOF. The World Bank Task Team and the PMT worked together
to reinvigorate the payment process, to streamline procedures, and reduce a number of
redundant steps, agreed during the February 2012 Supervision Mission. A new design
for payment approval procedure was applied by the PMT, as of April 2012, and this did
lead to some improvement in physical progress.

     35. The Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) that was hired by the Bank for
fiduciary purposes was effective. FMA staff visited the PMT two to three times per
month on average to: (i) review the PMTs’ Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) and
reconcile the PMTs records to the Bank records; (ii) monitor unclaimed expenditures;
(iii) verify disbursement plan updates; and (iv) to provide on-the-job training in FM
matters. The FMA included the PMT-prepared IFRs in their quarterly reports, as well as
the adjusted IFRs (with their review comments and recommendations for the PMT IFRs).
The FMA also conducted, on a sample basis, pre-screening and post- review of
withdrawal applications for direct payments and reimbursements. Fiduciary compliance
under the Project was generally good. There were no significant waivers from the Bank’s
fiduciary policies and procedures during the implementation of the Project. The ICR
would like to note that the fiduciary monitoring agent (FMA) played a noteworthy
(valuable) role in this project. As such, one of the lessons learned is that the FMA (or a
similar arrangement) is an essential feature of World Bank projects not only in Iraq, but
likely in all post-conflict situations where normal Bank supervision is constrained.

    36. The Project’s procurement process itself proved problematic. Every
implementation status and results report through-out the life of the project emphasized
the challenges in the PMTs technical and management capacity, and ability to support
Bank procurement processes. From the outset, procurement processes and procedures
were slow to evolve. The PMT appears to have lacked the required technical
management and skills, to engage in relatively routine procurement processes and
procedures. The relative difficulties in completing procurement awards can be attributed
to a number of factors including, but not limited to: i) Changes in PMT management and

                                            8
project staff; ii) the Part-time nature of PMT staff; and, iii) Overreliance on PMTs
Procurement expert to: a) prepare the Terms of Reference(s) (ToRs) and Requests for
Proposals (RFP); b) process the selection and management of contract negotiations with
limited technical support.

    37. During the life of the project, the procurement processes did gradually
improve. Project documentation and archiving are considered to be satisfactory. Current
delays in contract evaluation and awards have been largely attributed to technical issues
rather than procurement specific issues per se.

   38. No Safeguard policies were trigged for this Category Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

   39. With the extension of Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) until December 2014 a new
Technical Assistance Project on PFM Implementation Support (TA-P149073-TAS-
TF016110) has been launched (under the ITF in November 2013). This technical
assistance is expected to carry forward those projects that the Ministry of Finance
considers priorities. The follow-on PFM project has four (4) components: (1) Design of
Integrated Financial Investment Management Information System (IFMIS); (2)
Conducting a Diagnostic Study on Public Investment Management (PIM); (3) Enhancing
Ministry of Finance Website; and, (4) Building Capacity of the staff of the Ministry of
Finance. The new Project’s cost is estimated to be USD2.48 million with a project
deadline of October 30, 2014.

    40. For the Bureau of Supreme Audit program: The independent evaluation report
and the knowledge dissemination support the report’s conclusions and recommendations,
and were taken into consideration while designing a follow up capacity development
activity. An approved grant of USD 0.4 million from the Iraq TFCBII fund as part of a
comprehensive FM program, is ready to be implemented.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

    41. The World Bank’s project objectives and strategy were closely aligned to
Iraq’s National Development Strategy. Bank support to Iraq over the period is based
on supporting the delivery of some of the country’s most important national priorities.
Bank support to Iraq emphasizes national programs to improve the lives of Iraqis across
the country including in the areas of health, education and public financial management.

    42. Relevance of Design: The relevance of project design is rated Modest. The
results framework did not present a convincing causal chain between activities, outputs
and outcomes with respect to the projects objectives. Projects that are complex, multi-
faceted and that involve process and attitudinal changes from a multitude of government
actors require much more scrutiny, analysis, and more informed project design from the
outset.

                                           9
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy)

    43. The Project’s initial design consisted of a combined total of twenty outcome
and output indicators. Of the four PDO outcome indicators: a) one indicator was
dropped entirely; b) one indicator was never measured during the life of the project so
there is no link to progress; and) one indicator is largely an output indicator which is not
S.M.A.R.T. compliant. Of the original 17 output indicators, four (4) indicators, or
approximately twenty-five (25%) percent, were dropped from consideration. Further,
two intermediate results output indicators appear to be so similar in nature, that it is
difficult to distinguish the unique characteristic of the indicator or the output achieved.

    44. The ICR rates achievement of the First Component as Unsatisfactory. A
brief overview of the outcomes and outputs is provided in the following sections:

    45. First Component: Strengthening budget formulation and implementation.
Effective budget preparation processes with clear linkage to a multi-year strategic
framework will assist the government in reducing budget variations, and improving the
quality and efficiency of government expenditures. At the outset of this project PEFA
(2008) describes the Iraqi budget call circular in the following manner: ‘The budget call
circular is issued late and does not provide expenditure limits (ceilings).’ The first
objective appears relevant.

    46. Outcome Indicator Component 1: Capital budget execution rate increases
by at least 10 percentage points. The capital budget execution rate was seventy-five
(75%) in 2008. The proposed outcome indicator for this component was to increase the
capital budget execution rate by ten percent (10%), to eighty-five (85%) percent.
According to figures provided by Ministry of Planning (MOP) project execution rates
reached seventy-eight (78.5%) percent in 2012. 6 The outcome indicator appears to be in
the correct direction, but has not achieved its predicated outcome. A variety of factors
play into this modest increase in execution rates: i) inadequate project design; ii) delay in
cash releases to line ministries; and, iii) from a medium term budget perspective an
inadequate linkage between medium term budget planning and near term budget
preparation process. In the section below the ICR reviews the performance of
Component 1’s output indicators.

    47. The intermediate results indicator for this component consisted of five (5)
output indicators. The actions and outputs in support of this component are discussed
below:




6
  The WB-Public Expenditure Review (PER) indicates capital spending efficiency rates for the Government of Iraq
at/around 56% for 2012. The PER obtained their data from various MOP data sources. The ICR Review obtained
development (investment) budget spending efficiency rates from the Ministry of Finance. Although, there is some
difference in the measurement of capital spending efficiency rates, the overarching conclusion remains the same:-
capital budget execution rates did not rise to meet the targeted rate of 85% as presented for this Project’s PDO indicator.


                                                           10
a) i. New budget call circular (BCC) designed and in use; and, ii. New budget call
   circular (BCC) in use. It is difficult to determine the actual output achieved as a
   result of this technical assistance intervention. GoI is required by Public Finance Act
   to produce two primary circulars (recurrent and investment) during a budget
   implementation period (See Results Framework Analysis, above). However, clear
   linkages between investment budgets and forward expenditure estimates are not
   readily observable. While some projects are selected based on sector plans, and some
   of these have recurrent cost implications, these estimates are not generally shared
   during operations budgeting. Moreover, the forward estimates that do exist are not
   developed from such costings. Expenditure ceilings are a major feature of the Budget
   Call Circular, but what is the relevance of expenditure ceilings when operational and
   investment spending rates are approximately 90% and 78.5%, respectively.

b) Draft Sector Strategies: The Project proposed developing sector strategies for two
   key sectors for Ministry of Water Resources and Ministry of Education. The drafting
   of these two sector strategies was cancelled because these sector ministries asked
   other donors to provide assistance. The cancellation of the two technical assistance
   contracts adversely impacted the Bank’s assistance with respect to the developing a
   medium term framework for two key ministries. There are only three (3) sector
   strategies that are available: Energy, Industries, and Education. At present, none of
   these sector strategies has been adequately reflected (integrated) in the Budget.

c) New Macro-Economic Fiscal Team Established in MOF – A Macro-Economic
   Fiscal Framework (MTFF) Team has been established with the Budget Department
   (and, not the Economic Department) since 2010/2011. The Iraqi Medium Term
   Fiscal framework uses the IMF financial programming modeling procedures and has
   developed a database of historical fiscal information. The MTFF supports estimation
   of fiscal forecasts and the annual development of top-down indicative budget ceilings.

   A rule-of-thumb measure for the usefulness of the MTFF, can it be used for
   assisting in other work? In fact, the MTFF has proved somewhat problematic in
   that it could not be used for some ESW undertaken in 2013 (e.g. Construction of the
   Boost data tool in the Water Sector). The MTFF is still largely inundated with poor
   or inappropriate data and the available information is considered to be generally
   unreliable. Moreover, the current MTFF excel file cannot be updated by Iraqi
   nationals-it has to be updated by an external consultant who comes once a year for
   such a purpose.

   The development of a Medium Term Expenditure/Budget Framework
   (MTEF/MTBF) has not been accomplished. At present, the Ministry of Planning
   has developed a 5-year Project Investment Plan (PIP). The PIP is combined with a 1-
   year forward operational budget to produce an annual budget. The MoF (operational
   budget) and MoP (development budget) work largely independently. It is difficult to
   consolidate budget data from both the operating and capital budget. Donor projects
   are not generally captured in the Iraqi budget. Donor grant-funded projects are
   captured in a separate database facility. Although policy discussions have been

                                           11
   introduced into the budget process, there is no effective bottom-up Medium Term
   Budget Framework.

d) New Procedures in Place for Project Preparation and Appraisal – A review of
   various ISRs (2009, 2012) indicates that there was effectively no improvement in the
   implementation of new projects. ISR (9/2013) claims a 10% improvement in capital
   budget execution performance as measured by MOP and other relevant entities.
   However, this did not take place. FY2012 capital execution rates as stipulated by
   MOP were 78.45%, barely 3.45 percent above the original baseline estimate
   established in 2008/09. Project execution rates estimated up and until October 2013
   are estimated at 40.3%. While new procedures and guidelines were presented to
   MOP, much of the on-the-ground technical assistance work and project preparation
   guidelines were established by USAID (which used the Project Management Institute
   Training Handbooks and Certification process) and Project Evaluation check-list.

    48. Based on the above assessment, the ICR rates achievement of the Second
Component as Moderately Satisfactory. A brief overview of the outcomes and outputs
is provided in the following section:

    49. Second Component:               Strengthening Public Sector Procurement
(Improvements to the System of Public Procurement). Effective public procurement
practices are the cornerstone of achieving any success in public financial management
expenditure efficiency, service delivery improvement and accountability.            The
intermediate results indicator for this component consisted of four (4) indicators.

    50. Outcome Indicator Component 2: At least fifty (50%) percent of contracts
above threshold awarded competitively. This PDO outcome indicator was dropped
due to inadequate baseline information, and no replacement indicator developed. Hence,
even if some of the intermediate outcome/output indicators were achieved (see below), it
is difficult to determine the level to which public sector procurement was strengthened.
In the section, below we review the performance, actions and outputs in support of
Component 2’s objectives.

a) Standard Bidding Documents (Finalized). The project completed seven (7) sector
   specific standard bidding documents (SBD) finalized in July 2013. These sector
   specific bidding documents appear on the MoP website(s). However, in order to
   make SBDs mandatory, these documents need to be tested or piloted. This process
   involved training the procurement specialists in understanding the SBDs, and then
   applying these SBDs to a procurement process.

b) National Procurement Manual (Finalized) The National Procurement Manual was
   prepared in line with the current National Procurement Law and submitted to GoI in
   Final Draft form awaiting their consent and final approval. The manual remains
   prepared but has not been finalized nor distributed. A national procurement strategy
   has been developed, and capacity building efforts have been adopted by Ministry of
   Planning.

                                          12
c) Procurement Bulletin Board. The existence and operation of a procurement notices
   via a single portal was to be the cornerstone achievement of this component.
   Regulations published in 2008/09 highlighted the procurement process with a clear
   time frame for resolution. Under the PFM project only the Terms of Reference (ToR)
   and road map for implementation were prepared in cooperation with USAID.
   However, the website itself has not been implemented, partly due to ongoing design
   issues. Ministry of Planning has allocated a budget to implement this procurement
   bulletin board (as part of its 2013/14 Governance Action Plan). The procurement
   bulletin board itself was not completed.

d) Training Needs Assessment. A national training strategy was developed and
   capacity building efforts in procurement established. The World Bank (and other
   Donor Agencies including USAID Tarabot) provided training on procurement
   policies and procedures. A number of training programs were provided for in the
   draft procurement manual, training on Standard Bidding Documents, and training of
   trainers.

    51. Third Component: Strengthening budget execution and implementation.
This component primarily is designed to improve the efficiency of government of
expenditures and provides important information on the credibility of Ministries,
Department and Agency (MDA) budgets. Credible MDA budgets facilitate realistic cash
flow forecasting and reporting, and mitigate the frequency of in-year requests (virements)
for adjustments to budget allocations. The intermediate results indicator for this
component initially consisted of seven (7) indicators. Three (3) indicators (33% of the
total) were dropped and one indicator was not achieved.

   52. The ICR rates achievement of the third component as Moderately
Satisfactory. A brief review of Component 3 is provided in the following sections:

     53. Outcome Indicator Component 3: Outstanding balances in spending units
decline by thirty (30%) percentage points as a share of the budget. The original PDO
provided that the outstanding balances in spending units as a share of budget in 2008 was
thirty-eight percent (38%). Such large cash balances as a percent of budget are generally
attributed to poor budget formulation, development projects that have been poorly
designed and are not at the stage where procurement would be effective, and in the case
of Iraq - prefunding of spending unit accounts. Further, large cash balances directly
reflect the inadequate linkage of procurement plans to ministerial cash management plans.

    54. Technical assistance was projected to translate to a 8 percent reduction in
cash balances as a percent of budget, or at the end of the project cash balances be
less than thirty (30%) percent of total budget. Three Project ISRs provided that the
cash comparisons of results with the baseline will be done, but no comparison with the
baseline was ever developed.




                                           13
     55. The Project’s ISR-3 and 4 indicated that there was a reclassification of
accounts in 2009, due to which the Cash Balances at 31 December 2009 were
reduced to 3.843 trillion (5.5% of the Budget). The cash balances stood at 5.937
trillion ID on June 2011 (6.1% of the budget) as per the new classification. Thus, there is
a problem in comparing the progress with the baselines as the definition of indicator has
changed. The way forward with respect to this indicator was to estimate the present cash
balances as per earlier classification by including provincial accounts, accounts of
government trading enterprises, and purchases of vehicles. However, this was never
done and cannot be done during this ICR. While the need to change the indicators may
be identified during the Mid-term review, indicators are changed through formal
restructuring approved by the Board or Management (as applicable).

    56. A quick review of the current status of a number of ministerial cash balances,
indicate that cash balances of line ministries are IRD 3.9Trillion (September 2013).
Without reviewing the 640 plus spending unit bank accounts at the Central Bank of
Iraq, it is difficult to determine whether Indicator 2 has been achieved. Further, it
is not possible to attribute this improvement directly to the TA provided under the
project.

   57. A review of the output indicators for Component 3 is as follows:

a) First round of training on new Cash Release System (CRS) completed with
   several ministries. The PFM project was able to introduce rules and guidelines for
   introducing a commitment control system and improving financial reporting. The
   Project Management Unit insisted on implementing the Commitment Control/Cash
   Release system before providing any Capacity Building Exercises. A capacity
   building workshop was held where 87 persons attended. The Cash Release System
   was not rolled-out.

b) Detailed Rules and Regulations for New Commitment Control System
   Developed. The PFM project introduced rules and guidelines for cash management
   and commitment control system and improving financial reporting. PMT insisted on
   implementing the Commitment Control/Cash Release system before providing any
   Capacity Building Exercises. Eighty – seven (87) persons did complete basic training
   on cash release systems. Training for other line ministries has not been extended.
   However, the ICR review questions the validity of this indicator which provides
   that the new system of commitment controls must demonstrate a 30%
   improvement in the coherence between cash releases and actual needs. What is it
   that this indicator is actually measuring?

c) Assessment of Financial Control arrangements completed. The Government of
   Iraq had contracted Ernst and Young (E&Y) to perform a status analysis of the
   current internal financial control arrangements in four ministries and a roadmap
   describing the way forward in implementing reforms to the internal financial control
   function in line ministries through the adoption of best practices. The study identified
   the need for developing a holistic public internal control strategy across the entire

                                            14
   public administration to establish complimentary roles for the various control-related
   institutions and activities and reflecting the objectives of this strategy in primary and
   secondary legislation. The study reported various gaps between the current status and
   international standards and good practices in the legal framework, governance, staff,
   infrastructure and operations. Building on the successful outcomes of this study and
   the reported short-Mid-Long term reform recommendations, the World Bank is
   currently providing Technical Assistance (TA) to the Ministry of Finance in
   implementing selective short term reforms that were reported on the study. This TA is
   financed by Iraq TF under the operation named "Improving Governance through
   strengthened FM program. Owning to the limited time-frame of this TA (12 months),
   and the significant and deep changes in the financial internal control structure as
   reported in the study, the TA is helping the GoI in the short-term reforms areas that
   are believed to be completed within the TA period.

d) Website being regularly updated. MoF hired Abacus Consulting and Ask Tech
   Links to upgrade its website with following objectives: i) Introduce a modern and
   sound Content Management System (CMS) & web portal using SharePoint 2010
   (Internet & Intranet) for MOF staff and general public; ii) Increase the operational
   efficiency and effectiveness of Ministry of Finance staff through automation of their
   files, directories and documents based upon their roles & privileges with the
   enforcement of the approval mechanism; iii) Ensure the availability of information
   with on as and when required basis through the implementation of Internet/ Intranet
   portal; and, iv) Facilitate MOF staff to manage support requests /issues with a single
   point on control through centralized Help desk application feature. During the project,
   amongst other things, the company delivered the following scope of work: 1)
   Designed and developed Intranet secure website covering Document & Content
   Management and centralized Help Desk with notifications; 2) Developed Internet
   Portal covering News Bulletin, Calendar Events, News Bar, Currencies Exchange
   Rates, News Archive, Search, Updateable content pages, Photo Gallery, Discussion
   Forum and Help Desk (customer care) features; and, 4) Provided dedicated hosting
   services for 3 years for internet website. The new website includes functionalities
   like secure Intranet, Webmail, help desk functionalities, secure shared directories,
   dynamic contents management, etc. Ministry of Finance has asked for additional
   refinements.

e) The following three activities and outputs were dropped from this component:
   1) New Financial /Fiscal Control System; 2) Training Materials for Financial-Fiscal
   Control System; and, IT assessment Completed and functional requirements for
   upgraded system.

   58. Based on the following assessment, the ICR rates achievement of the Fourth
Component as Moderately Satisfactory. The section below provides a brief discussion
and review of some of the key component outputs.




                                            15
    59. Fourth Component: Capacity Development and Project Management. The
activities and outputs under this objective were designed to develop the human resource
capacity of predominantly the Ministry of Finance and core line-ministries.

    60. Outcome Indicator Component 4: Ministry of Finance training institute
providing training on all operational aspects of PFM project. This “outcome
indicator” is inappropriate as it is too narrowly defined: even if MoF staff were trained on
operational aspects of this Project, it would not translate to progress towards achievement
of the PDO. A more appropriate indicator would have been, e.g. ‘Ministry of Finance
training institute providing training on all operational aspects of public financial
management”.

a) The key objective was the establishment of a fully functional training program at
   the Ministry of Finance Accounting Training Center (MoFTAC). This has not
   been fully achieved. A number of trainer-of-trainer programs have been held.
   However, a fully functional Finance and Accounting Training program has not been
   developed and implemented.

b) A review of the current progress of the Bank’s technical assistance inputs,
   indicate that a Training Needs assessment was completed, and a few training of
   trainer sessions were provided. A Training Needs assessment was completed, a few
   training of trainer sessions were provided. There is inadequate depth of training
   ability in any of the key components of public financial management. The detailed
   needs assessment provided to MOFTAC by Coffey LLC has been adopted by
   MOFTAC. MOFTAC has put forward a 5-year cumulative budget estimated at
   USD13.5 million with a detailed training plan.

Subcomponent on Board of Supreme Audit (BSA) (Bank-Executed Technical
Assistance)

    61. The technical assistance for the BSA capacity development program was jointly
designed with the BSA and was undertaken through a companion trust fund
executed by the Bank. As noted above, this Bank-executed part of the Grant was
designed to allow the Project to support the efforts of the BSA and other governmental
entities to reinforce their operational capacities. Specifically for the BSA, support was
provided for advanced training of BSA staff in public finance, legal issues, accounting,
and auditing, etc. The ICR rates achievement of the Technical Assistance as applied
to the Bureau of Supreme Audit (BSA) as Satisfactory. The following section provides
a brief review of the program as it pertains to the BSA (for more detailed discussion see
Annex 2).

    62. The BSA technical assistance modality was designed to cover the
performance of focused peer reviews based on pilot audits in cooperation with the
knowledge-providing peer SAI. The program completed this task in three primary
areas: 1) risk-based audit; 2) performance audit, and 3) procurement audit, in cooperation
with the UK National Audit Office (UK NAO), Netherlands Court of Audit (NCA), and

                                            16
French Court of Accounts, respectively. The technical assistance provided training to
more than 15 master trainers, 380 staff, on risk-based audit, specialty audits, performance
audit, and procurement audit, investing around 12,700 training hours. The effectiveness
of this program was put into action when a pilot audit of one of the Bank-supported
projects in Iraq was carried out by the BSA in compliance with international auditing
standards and following training on Bank project implementation and fiduciary
guidelines and knowledge exchange with a SAI which audits Bank-supported projects
(the NIK).

   63. The process of revising the risk-based audit manual was initiated through
cooperation with both the UK NAO and the Polish State Audit Office (NIK). The
development of the procurement audit manual was initiated through cooperation with the
NIK. The forensic audit manual was initiated through cooperation with the French Court
of Accounts. The program provided basic knowledge and exposed the BSA to
experiences in specialized subjects such as oil audit, forensic audit, arbitration, contract
management, governance, auditing of World Bank-financed projects, and Monitoring and
Evaluation. The BSA technical assistance program had addressed the organizational
capacity including strategic planning, annual planning, and exposed the requirement of a
change management process.

    64. Frequent evaluation surveys were run after each workshop to get the
feedback of the participants and guide further planning. A mid-term high
management level event joined by key global SAIs (NCA, UK NAO, French Court of
Accounts, NIK, Canada Auditor General Office, and Malaysia Auditor General Office),
CoMSEC, INTOSAI-IDI, and World Bank CFO, Country Director, and Sector Manager,
was organized to share knowledge on global experiences and providing advice to the
BSA. The program, as well, provided a platform for dialogue and joined knowledge
sharing among the pillars of public governance in Iraq, including the BSA, Commission
of Integrity, the Inspector General Offices, MOF, and internal controllers at line
ministries on cross-cutting topics such as control, audit, and inspection. One of the
program workshops provided a joint input to the Iraq Governance Action Plan. A stock-
taking was facilitated of the knowledge-dissemination process carried by the BSA trained
master trainers and conducted by the NIK, generating a set of recommendations. During
the program the BSA trained master trainers had disseminated training on risk-based
audit, performance audit, and procurement audit to around 150 investing around 2,500
training hours. A pilot audit of one of the Bank-supported projects in Iraq was carried out
by the BSA in compliance with international auditing standards and following training on
Bank project implementation and fiduciary guidelines and knowledge exchange with a
SAI which audits Bank-supported projects (the NIK).


    65. An independent evaluation of the technical assistance program provided to
the BSA was performed at the end of the project, by an independent evaluator, and
highlighted the successful achievement of the key project objectives. The program
was evaluated as having produced a perceptive and thorough analysis of the BSA’s
capacity development and training needs based on the best advice available – the

                                            17
guidance on SAI capacity building approved by INTOSAI, having delivered a
comprehensive Train the Trainers’ program for the BSA that introduced the organization
to modern, up to date audit methodologies relevant to its development needs, and having
the BSA taking active steps to implement these new audit approaches.


    66. Fifth Objective:  Development and Testing of Integrated Financial
Management System (IFMIS) prototype. On the basis of the approved indicators
(and, not on new indicators for a follow-up project), and based on the above
assessment, the ICR rates achievement of the new Fifth Component as
Unsatisfactory. The following section provides a brief overview of the components
outputs.

    67. Component 5 was started relatively late in the implementation cycle and is a
new component. The intermediate results indicators include: 1) Prototype for IFMIS
developed; and 2) Prototype for IFMIS tested. This was a Level 2 restructuring approved
by the Country Director However, the ISRs do not reference these (approved) indicators,
but rather provide: i) The development of a System Requirement Study (SRS) to be
completed; and ii) The Government’s preparation of a Request for Proposal (RF)
document that can be released for acquisition and implementation and implementation of
the IFMIS.

    68. Approximately USD 6.0 million of the original USD 18.0 million (or, 33% of
the original facility) was left unspent, with approximately 1 year left until project
expiration. In a bid to fully utilize these unspent resources (before project expiration),
an attempt was made to reinvigorate the project by refocusing these funds on a limited,
but ambitious, Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) prototype
project. The underlying premise of the project was to develop a prototype financial
management system using the Freebalance Inc. Accountability Suite V7.0. Freebalance
is the management system that currently underpins the Iraqi Ministry of Finance. The
Iraqi financial management system was largely not upgraded or expanded after 2006
when the prime contractor withdrew from Iraq. The award of a contract to Freebalance
for the development and testing of the prototype was negotiated, but the World Bank
temporarily suspended Freebalance, following which the contract could not be signed.
Many project team members however, point to the suspension of Freebalance as the
‘death knell’ of what could have been an otherwise successful attempt to introduce an
updated prototype management information system to Iraq.

    69. There were numerous risks that the Project Team did not appear to fully
appreciate when adding this new component under the project. Considering the
original project closing date June 30, 2013, the remaining time left under the project was
less than six (6) months at the time that the new component was added. If there were any
even slight delays, at any stage of implementation, there was a substantial risk that the
task would not be completed within project time. As a result, the Project team requested
and was granted a two month extension to end-August 2013. The question remains
whether this eight (8) month period still would have been sufficient.

                                           18
    70. The issue of project procurement also tends to be of overarching concern.
Every ISR review listed PMT procurement as a major impediment to project
implementation. As a result, delays in procurement of hardware and the software would
not have been an unwarranted concern. Discussions with PMT project team members
indicate that there was a general reluctance to engage in the procurement of Freebalance
for a variety of reasons. The most important consideration brought to the forefront by the
PMT management and operating team is that they did not fully understand how the
procurement of Freebalance (financial management software) was to unfold. There was
substantial apprehension among PMT members in understanding and negotiating the
software licensing arrangements. Even if the Freebalance procurement would have
unfolded, in all likelihood, there would have been a number of bottlenecks along the way.

3.3 Efficiency

     71. The EPP did not contain any cost effectiveness analysis, nor were any other
economic or financial analyses performed during Appraisal (e.g. NPV calculation,
economic or financial rates of return, etc.). In addition, there is limited useful
information available to compare this project to similar projects in other countries.
Another complicating factor is the large unallocated portion at Appraisal, which
accounted for 20% of the Project total (see Footnote 4 above). Therefore it is difficult to
rigorously assess the efficiency of the project according to the established ICR criteria.
Nevertheless, Efficiency is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory based on: i) the non-
utilization of most of the Unallocated portion, due first to the failure of any of the
envisaged downstream activities to materialize, and then the failure of the IFMIS
component; ii)the termination of several contracts due to poor performance, and hence
reduced outputs compared to the plans 7; iii), poor payment efficiency (delays in releasing
payments); and iv) higher than initially expected costs due to the cost of providing
protection and transport to the foreign consultants.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (see above)

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not Applicable

(b) Institutional Change / Strengthening

   72. The independent evaluation of the BSA technical assistance program
provided instrumental guidance for the BSA and donors while proceeding with a


7
  Points i) and ii) are largely responsible for the low final disbursement position – only US% million 9.78
disbursed of US$ million 16.0 allocated (61%)


                                                     19
sustainable institutional building process. More precisely, the evaluation advised the
BSA to invest in further structuring its professional training program, strengthening its
methodological unit and quality assurance arrangements, completing the revision of its
audit manuals, and in further developing its strategic capacity to prioritize its work and
activities in line with its strategy. The independent evaluation further advised Donors of
the need to define some precise medium term objectives for the impact of their support
on the BSA’s professional capacity and capability to ensure that the BSA continues to
raise the quality of its audit work in compliance with international auditing standards as
defined by INTOSAI.

    73. The ICR finds that with respect to Procurement there is some positive
institutional change. Although in a nascent phase, the pilot ministries are beginning to
use sectoral SBDs. However, it is clear that there is still substantial work that needs to be
undertaken to ingrain an effective public procurement process into the mainstream.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Not Applicable

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

   74. ICR did not undertake a beneficiary survey. A project wrap-up roundtable
was held with key stakeholders. A brief write-up is presented in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

    75. Rating: High. The achievement of the development objective is Moderately
Unsatisfactory reflecting failure of several key consultancies and project components to
deliver their intended outputs. In view of this alone, the risk to the development outcome
is High. The ICR team reviewed the provision of the technical assistance as applied to
the primary targeted beneficiary ministry (MoF):- there is insufficient evidence to
conclude that the capacity building activities of this Project significantly increased the
MoF’s capacity. For example, as discussed above, the outcomes related to budget
formulation and execution were not completely realized. The risk to the development
outcome remains High.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry Rating: Unsatisfactory.

   76. The Bank preparation phase consisted of intensive dialogue with the
government (primarily MoF and BSA) to determine where a Bank project could
most effectively intervene to support the government’s PFM Action Plan. The
specific project activities developed were considered to be appropriate and timely.
Importantly, the Bank worked to ensure that project activities would not duplicate the
work of other donors and organizations (especially the IMF, USAID, and DfID).

                                             20
    77. There were a number of key flaws in design, which can be seen as barriers to
higher Quality at Entry 8: i) insufficient understanding of the political economy of PFM
reform; ii) complexity of technical interventions (as opposed to the ‘simple’ design
described in the EPP; iii) inadequate understanding of and planning for the difficulties the
PMT would confront, particularly regarding capacity constraints and team composition;
iv) the large unallocated portion of the project due to over-ambitious expectations for
downstream performance, and inadequate back-up plan preparation in the event that
upstream components under-delivered; v) a challenging understanding as to how to
effectively coordinate Project activities with the KRG and, vi) there was no Monitoring
and Evaluation (M&E) Framework established prior to (or during) implementation. 9

    78. Political Economy of PFM Reform. During project preparation and entry, the
PFM Action Plan had been agreed between the donors and the GoI and the MoF appeared
to provide a reform champion at a high level. These factors combined to create the
impression that there was strong GoI demand for comprehensive PFM reform. While this
may have been accurate for some elements of the PFM sector, it became clear during
implementation that any such demand was not in fact widespread. It is less clear whether
the Bank team could have foreseen this lack of country counterpart buy-in considering
the speed of preparation. A more comprehensive political economy analysis may have
assisted the project preparation team in refining and narrowing the scope of the Project.

    79. Complexity versus Simplicity. The project design attempted to engage in
relatively simple technical solutions. Nevertheless, these solutions required significant
input from international consultants. This process turned out to be relatively complex.
Further, the total package of interventions was quite ambitious considering the fragile
conflict environment context and the capacity of the PMT.

    80. PMT capacity. The issues with PMT capacity have been raised above (Section
2.1, Other Factors), and are further elaborated in the Lessons Learned.

    81. Large Unallocated Portion. One of the key problems throughout most of
implementation was the very low disbursement rate compared to the total Project
allocation. Project design foresaw that upstream activities would be completed in the
early phases, and these would lead to demand for additional downstream activities.
However, Project design did not develop any adequate backup plan for the unallocated
funds in the event of slow progress, or failure, of upstream activities. The unallocated
funds created an overhang which skewed disbursement ratios.

    82. In retrospect, it would have been more appropriate to focus on a narrower
set of clearly defined outputs and have more specific (targeted) cost estimates. Once

  While the ICR finds flaws in QAE, these do offer important lessons for future operations – please refer to the Lessons Learned
section for further detail.
9
  In addition, the ICR questions whether the use of Emergency procedures was appropriate for this operation; that discussion is
elaborated in the Lessons Learned section.

                                                                 21
those materialized, the GoI could have returned to the Bank for additional funding
assistance. While the disbursement ratio issue is primarily internal to the Bank (and is not
insignificant), the client-side presents the larger problem. The issues with the IFMIS
gambit are presented in other sections. For the purposes of the QAE discussion, the large
unallocated portion remaining towards the end of the project without an adequate back-up
plan created difficult program choice incentives.

    83. Relationship with KRG. Representatives of the KRG government were present
in all phases of preparation, including Project Negotiations. As a result, Project design
planned for a robust framework for engagement between Baghdad and KRG authorities.
Early in implementation, an MOU was signed to formalize these plans. Unfortunately,
the political dynamic was significantly more complicated during implementation than
expected. As a result, the KRG did not participate as expected in the Project (though they
did pursue PFM reforms via other means).

    84. Lack of M&E Plan. The lack of a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework
(M&E) prior to implementation is a major shortcoming of Project preparation, and
clearly has led to difficulty on the part of all parties to assess Project progress and take
proactive measures as needed. In addition, it has made it difficult to assess Project
achievements at the ICR stage.

   85. Overall, while the relevance of the objectives and design are rated Modest,
and the PDO is relevant to the Bank’s strategy in Iraq, the above shortcomings in
design lead to an Unsatisfactory Rating for Quality at Entry.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory except Fiduciary which was Satisfactory 10

    86. The early phase (2009-2011) of supervision was characterized by an intensive
level of interaction with all main actors in the PFM sector. The second Project TTL
was based in Baghdad, and chaired the Public Finance Working Group. The PFM
Working Group comprised all main donors active in PFM and key members of the GoI.
This group met monthly and worked to ensure that the various interventions were
mutually reinforcing and to avoid duplication of effort. One of the main successes of this
early phase was the convening of a high-level Budget Strategy workshop in May 2010
(attended by the major donors and over 40 GoI representatives). As a result of this
workshop, a budget strategy for 2011-2013 and a MTFF for 2011-2013 was produced.
These outputs, particularly the budget strategy were expected to pave the way for greater
progress towards meeting the PFMP development objectives.

   (See Section 2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance, paras 37-44 above. Safeguard compliance is not applicable, as this was
Category C Project).



                                                               22
    87. By February 2011 ISR it was clear that whatever progress had been made
during the initial implementation phase of the Project was in jeopardy.
Implementation Progress had been downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory, with the
assumption that an upgrade would be possible if technical assistance contracts were
signed in a timely manner time. Delays in contracting, the lower-than-expected price of
the winning bids combined with the increasing level of unallocated funds were starting to
appear as major impediments to the successful completion of the Project. The
Unallocated funds prompted an early need to consider reallocation of some of the
proceeds. The MoF was already suggesting activities for the unallocated funds. Despite
these abovementioned issues, the Bank team noted in ISR-3 “good progress on efforts to
procure the consultants for the 5 large packages, covering all project components and
50% of project funds, and a sixth tender for the development of the MoF website…”.

    88. Mid-Term Review (MTR). During the mid-term review (MTR) in December
2011, progress remained slow. The MTR ISR noted, “There was inadequate supervision
and implementation support from the Bank side. There were delays in giving ‘no
objections’ and the PMT was not given appropriate guidance at appropriate time leading
to low disbursements, low commitments, large proportion of unplanned funds, and
absence of an adequate M&E system”. 11 Notwithstanding, approximately 43% of project
funds were committed and additional 17% were in the process of being contracted. But,
there was still 39% unallocated funds. The MTR also recommended changes to some
key indicators, particularly the PDO#3 on cash balances.

    89. In an effort to utilize the Unallocated funds and maximize the impact of the
Project, the Project Team embarked on establishing an Integrated Financial
Management System (IFMIS) prototype. The MTR recommended restructuring the
Project. The issues with the IFMIS prototype have been covered in other sections. For
the purpose of evaluating Bank supervision performance, the main issue is the timing of
restructuring (see below).

    90. Day-to-day performance of the project did increase towards the later stages
of Implementation. Several factors contributed to the increase in the project’s day-to-
day performance during the final two years of the project, with the most important being
a significant increase in spending efficiency (as measured by disbursement levels)
compared to the project’s initial two years. Project performance improved largely owing
to the Project team’s ability to work with MoF to streamline the payment system and
establish and utilize the Bank’s e-disbursement platform. In addition, the Bank team was
able to persuade the MoF to hire full-time coordinators for two components. Nevertheless,
this later stage of supervision was also characterized by failure of two key contracts. The
ICR notes that this is particularly due to the inability to move forward with the IFMIS,
due to the suspension of the contractor.



11
   This ISR also noted the issues with PMT staffing and MoF leadership, which is highlighted in the Borrower Performance section
below.



                                                               23
   91. At Project Closing, US$ 6.22 million (38%) was cancelled from the original
US$ 16 million. The ICR notes that the Bank teams worked diligently throughout
Supervision. While there are many factors involved in the poor performance of the
Project a few things stand out on the Bank supervision side including:

a) Quality at Entry. A number of QAE issues created difficulties from the beginning
   of supervision. However, the WB supervision effort was not sufficiently proactive in
   the early stages in terms of mitigating them, particularly regarding the monitoring
   system.

b) Lack of M&E Framework. An early effort was made to engage MoF on establishing
   the M&E system, but this was not systematically followed up. As a result – and
   despite mentioning the problem in all ISRs - no formal M&E system was ever
   implemented.

c) Fragile Conflict State Issues (i.e. Bombings at Ministry of Finance). During the
   project implementation period, the Ministry of Finance was bombed several times.
   This directly affected the efficient operations of the PMT, as they were forced to
   disperse among multiple office locations, making face-to-face collaboration much
   more difficult. Further, the Minister of Finance himself was replaced (twice).

d) Provision of timely support to the PMT, especially on procurement. The early
   phase of supervision did not adequately provide the support that the PMT needed in
   carrying out complicated international bidding processes. This was rectified to some
   extent by mid-Project and procurement actions.

e) Failure to increase staff availability. The lack of full-time staff for the PMT, which
   de facto meant a lack of full-time concentration on the Project, was a problem
   throughout implementation. The supervision teams made repeated efforts to
   encourage allowing PMT staff to have more time to work on the Project. These
   efforts were by-and-large were not successful (with the exception of the two full-time
   staff noted above, and this in any case came late in implementation). The ICR would
   like to stipulate in this section that the lack of a full-time dedicated team focused on
   implementing this complex project, as well as PMT staff turnover, was a major
   impediment to successful project implementation.

f) Delays in Restructuring. From the time of the first agreed discussions on
   restructuring (December 2011), it took over one year for the restructuring to be made
   effective (January 2013).

g) Delays in Modification of the Project Results Framework. The ICR considers the
   lack of early modification of the Results Framework as a major shortcoming in
   Supervision. From at least the MTR, it was clear that a number of the indicators were
   not appropriate, and needed revision. The MTR would have been the optimal time to
   revisit these indicators and propose changes. Such a discussion with MoF also might
   have acted as a catalyst towards establishing a primary M&E system.

                                            24
h) Of particular importance would have been to revise the Outcome Indicators for
   Components 2 and 3. Component 2 indicator was later dropped, and no replacement
   was created, leaving it very difficult to assess this Component’s contribution to the
   PDO. The cash balance indicator for Component 3 was known to be flawed, but it
   was retained throughout implementation. In fact, this indicator’s value was further
   reduced when it was changed to a simple binary “Y/N” during restructuring. Hence
   this indicator also is of little use in evaluating the component’s contribution to PDO
   achievement. The changes to a few indicators at restructuring appear to reflect an
   effort to retrofit the indicators to what might be expected at Project close.

i) Was Restructuring appropriate? Or would Cancellation have been a better
   option? The Restructuring Paper (RP) (Report No. 74235-IQ) provided a number of
   rationales for the restructuring. From the perspective of the achievement of the PDO,
   the RP stated “the Project’s impact would be significantly enhanced if an IFMIS is
   also implemented. Component 1 on Budget Preparation and Component 3 on Budget
   Execution Controls can deliver better results if implemented together with IFMIS.” In
   addition, the RP emphasized that the government was ready to add US$ 10 million to
   implement the Project, as well as emphasizing the history of IFMIS discussions, and
   the fact that IFMIS was part of the IMF Stand-by Arrangement. From a timing
   perspective, the RP sought the short extension (3 months) of the Closing Date.

   92. An addition to the Bank-executed portion was requested, in order to
capitalize on the success of this component, particularly with reference to additional
capacity building for the BSA. The ICR finds that only the additional financing for the
BSA appears appropriate. This component had clearly delivered and was exceeding
expectations, and had high demand and buy-in from the government.

    93. Extension of the closing date. This makes sense only for the BSA. The
performance up to that time on the other components does not suggest that an additional
three months would have made a significant difference.

    94. Would cancellation have been a better option? The initial impetus in late 2011
to develop an IFMIS prototype was clearly motivated by the good faith effort of the task
team to leverage project impacts to the client while also maximizing full use of the
undisbursed Grant funds. Assuming the IFMIS prototype could have been implemented,
the Restructuring would likely have contributed to the PDO achievement. Further,
successful implementation of the IFMIS prototype would have used most of the
remaining Project funds.

    95. The likelihood of success of the IFMIS prototype was low by the time the
Restructuring went forward in early 2013. The ICR suggests that in retrospect, it
would have been more appropriate to move forward with: a) Elements of the BSA
component, and something smaller and more achievable in the timeframe, e.g. the SRS,
“Plan B” noted in ISR-5; or, b) Elements of the BSA component and simply cancel the
remaining uncommitted balance immediately.

                                           25
   96. An early restructuring is a clear proactive measure. Cancellation would also
have been a clear proactive measure.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory.

   97. According to ICR Guidelines, Overall Bank Performance must be rated as
“Unsatisfactory if Bank performance was rated Unsatisfactory on both dimensions, OR
was rated Unsatisfactory on one dimension and Moderately Unsatisfactory on the other
dimension”.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

    98. This section of the ICR makes a distinction between the day-to-day
performance of the Project Management Team, institutional aspects within the MoF,
and within Iraq which may have contributed to sub-optimal performance. The ICR
notes that the members of the PMT worked diligently throughout implementation, often
under very difficult circumstances. Although numerous issues arose, the majority of these
are related to the overall operating environment and some design issues (described above).

    99. Prior to the project, MoF actively engaged with the international community
on the formulation of the Public Finance Management Action Plan. This plan
included an ambitious agenda addressing many key issues in the PFM sector. The GoI
agreed with the international community (primarily the IMF, World Bank, and USAID)
on a division of labor wherein the various elements of the plan would be undertaken by
the organizations according to their strengths. The allocation and harmonization of
dedicated technical assistance efforts by Donors appeared to seamlessly mitigate many of
the risks associated with such a complex reform effort. The international donor
community engaged in regular (monthly) PFM Working Group coordination meetings in
order to ensure coordination of activities.

    100.        Diminishing momentum and insufficient understanding regarding the
complexity of undertaking such a complex PFM reform. During the implementation
of the Project, momentum for the overall PFM reform agenda waned. There are many
reasons for this including but not limited to: i) Ongoing political and security issues; and,
ii) The substantial downsizing of the international community’s efforts after 2012-which
appears to have allowed the focus of reform to fade. This can particularly be seen in the
lack of effort to establish a Project Steering Committee, as had been agreed during the
MTR. Moreover, it now seems clear that the complexity – and crucially the long-term
nature of the reform efforts – was not well-explained by the donors, nor well-understood
by GoI authorities.

   101.      A Challenging Approval Process. The issue(s) with approvals from the
Bank have been documented. However, the Ministry of Finance’s approval process can

                                             26
also be characterized by an exceedingly top-down structure, in which it is very difficult
for managers of line units to make day-to-day technical decisions without approval from
the highest level of the Ministry. This was particularly apparent for the various
undertakings of the PMT and is a major factor in project delays (e.g., approval of TORs,
contracts, payments to consultants, outputs, etc.). This problem was compounded by an
extraordinary level of review of outputs by beneficiary units. In brief, it is the role of
beneficiary units to provide comments on consultant deliverables, and then for the PMT
to issue approvals. Instead, the PMT was waiting for the units to approve deliverables,
rather than taking decisions themselves. This led to substantial delays in payments to
consultants, and in some cases, led to various consultants cancelling further work.

    102.         Coordination with KRG. Project design incorporated benefits for the
KRG, in line with the established practice for all projects in Iraq. Besides the benefits
themselves, it was intended that the KRG would have a role in coordinating the project
activities. An MOU to this end was signed in June 2010, but little coordination ever took
place. It is not possible to quantify the impact of this lack of coordination, but it does
reflect a failure in achieving overall project objectives.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (As the Implementing Agency the PMT was
subordinated directly to the Ministry of Finance).

    103.        Part-time staffing of PMT. Throughout implementation, it proved
difficult to constitute a PMT of full-time staff members. The part-time staffing of PMT’s
operations resonates with this ICR as perhaps one of the most important factors in the
slow project implementation progress. The part-time staffing issue was raised in all ISRs,
and as late as the Supervision ISR of March 2013 (6 months prior to Project closing).
Experience shows clearly that without full-time attention, it is much more difficult for
projects to attain planned results, and it is likely that implementation progress would have
been improved if the PMT members could have spent more time directly managing the
project.

    104.        The full-time vs. part-time issue also reflects flaws in both the design
phase, and the Bank’s supervision effort. In the first instance, the design phase should
have taken a more rigorous evaluation of the real possibility that the PMT members
would be unable to work full-time. At design and implementation stage, key members of
the PMT were fulfilling important roles within the MoF. In spite of government
assurances, it now appears unrealistic to have expected that these key MoF staff would be
able to take significant time away from their regular duties in order to implement this
relatively small project. The MoF did eventually respond to the requests of the Bank and
the PMT by hiring one full-time procurement officer. The problems associated with part-
time staffing levels may reflect a degree of unwillingness on the part of MoF to change
Project arrangements, but it also must be seen as an unsuccessful aspect of Bank
supervision. As an alternative, it might have been possible to reallocate some project
funds to hire additional specialized staff for the day-to-day operations, while still
allowing the PMT leader to have a part-time oversight and approval role.


                                            27
    105.        Dispersal of PMT staff. While the part-time issue was significant, it must
be noted that the PMT’s functionality was also impaired because the staff were dispersed
among different locations throughout implementation. The original dispersal was the
direct result of multiple bombings of the Ministry of Finance in 2010 and 2011, which
necessitated staff being spread amongst numerous buildings. Being in different locations
made holding regular meetings difficult:- i) Transportation was not easy; and, ii) Staff
were understandably concerned for their safety.

    106.       On the government side, higher-level leadership in the MoF was
either unable or unwilling to modify work arrangements and/or add additional staff
to allow a full-time effort. Further, the dedicated Component Technical Teams did not
ever fully materialize. These teams were intended to provide technical support to the
PMT, especially in writing TORs and evaluating bids, thereby facilitating more efficient
work. Instead, the PMT received only ad hoc advisory services.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

6. Lessons Learned

    107.        Public Financial Management reforms generally fall into two types: i)
efforts to improve budget transparency and classification; and, ii) those that
improve the scope and comprehensiveness of the budget. Under the first area of
reform, an existing body of accepted practice exists to reform economic classification and
there are incentives to align accounts along standard international practice to facilitate the
production of comparable fiscal and economic data. While there may be some resistance
to such reforms stemming from basic bureaucratic inertia, no fundamental interests are
challenged or mandates threatened. Once implementation is complete, the reform itself
becomes part of the fabric of the system and endures.

    108.        On the other side of the spectrum are a host of reforms that are neither
particularly easy to implement nor which bring the promise of substantial fiscal gains,
at least in the short-term. Some public financial reforms to improve the scope and
comprehensiveness of the budget are not technically difficult to implement. However,
unless significant political capital is invested in overcoming bureaucratic resistance, these
reforms are unlikely to move forward.

    109.       At the strategic level, the Government must have all embracing buy-in
to the reform process and understand its implications. At the heart of any PFM
reform process is the desire to achieve a transparent, accountable government processes
that provide the mechanisms for improved service delivery to the citizenry. If there is
inadequate ownership of the reforms, then any ambitious public financial reform program
will have only negligible chances for success.

   110.     Was processing the Project under OP/BP 8.00 - Rapid Responses to
Crises and Emergencies (hereinafter ‘emergency procedures’) appropriate? The

                                             28
EPP made the case for use of emergency procedures on the ground(s) that: i) these
procedures had been used in all Iraq projects as of the date of this project; ii) emergency
procedures had been the default option under the Interim Strategy Note; and iii) the
project would address 4 of the key priorities of the OP. The EPP additionally made the
claim that “While PFM per se is not a sector typically associated with emergencies, it is
critical to sustainable longer-term reconstruction in Iraq. Several studies, by the Bank,
the IMF, USAID, DFID, and others, indicate that deficiencies in financial management
are leading to poor budget execution and difficulties in accelerating the pace of
reconstruction.” Additionally, the EPP was justified on the basis that emergency
procedures were needed in order that the project could be completed by the closing date
of the Iraq Trust Fund, and that the fund would be quick disbursing.

    111.       While it is accurate that a well-functioning PFM system could ceteris
paribus greatly enhance the sustainability of longer term reconstruction, this should
not immediately extend to the notion that the World Bank’s PFM intervention
should proceed on an emergency basis. The success of Iraq’s reconstruction efforts
rested on a multitude of factors, which required more deliberative thinking, and clarity of
vision with respect to execution and proposed outputs. Without robust political economic
and project design analysis it would be extremely difficult to implement a complex
project of public financial management reforms.

    112.        Engaging in a more thoughtful PFM project due diligence process,
combined with fewer but more targeted PFM reforms, would not have in any
manner adversely changed the dynamics of PFM reform in Iraq, and would not have
materially affected the sustainability of reconstruction efforts. In addition, project
justification constructed on the basis of status quo processes and ISN conformity, appears
at ICR stage to be opportunistic versus being based on rigorous determination of the costs
and benefits of moving more slowly.

    113.       The downside of following emergency procedures in fragile conflict
environments is the compression (reduction) of normal World Bank internal review
processes. Such compression does save time, but it also reduces the ability of the Bank
to adequately reflect on the Project, moving much of the review from ex ante to ex post.
Although additional clarifications for project implementation provided that project
management would incorporate lessons learned and keep objectives and goals limited and
the project design was considered to be simple, in reality, the Iraq PFM project was
multi-faceted and complex. Use of regular preparation procedures would have allowed a
more thorough review process during design, and might have suggested changes to
improve the project’s chances of success.

    114.      Projects that are complex, multi-faceted and that involve process and
attitudinal changes from a multitude of government actors require much more
scrutiny, analysis, and more informed project design from the outset. There are quite
simply too many moving parts in such an ambitious public financial management
program. Further, in order to enhance the flexibility of this project the initial project
design left a substantial portion of funds unallocated. However, once the various

                                            29
downstream tasks did not materialize there was neither a sufficient back-up plan to use
the unallocated funds, or government buy-in to move forward.

    115.       There are a number of questions and concerns that the World Bank
should reflect upon regarding this last ditch IFMIS Iraqi prototype financial
management system effort. The initial vision for the introduction of Component 5:-
“IFMIS Prototype” was one where the WB would engage in a “modest” risk – “high
reward” outcome (if it succeeded). The development of a ‘prototype’ effectively requires
an agreement on the functional requirements of the system, and the customization of that
software as a prototype. This in effect would limit this component’s outputs to very
discrete, measurable factors. Presented in this manner, the decision making process
within the World Bank and the project management team itself is readily understood.
However, the larger question is whether risks are the same in a fragile conflict
environment as they are in a middle income (non-conflict) country. As a number of
World Bank reviews indicate (Dorintsky et al: 2003, 2011) there is a very limited chance
that IFMIS efforts will succeed, in general, on time and on budget. Dorintsky (2011) in a
comprehensive study of IFMIS projects around the world concluded that: 1) only 43% of
IFMIS related projects are delivered as specified; 2) only 50% of IFMIS projects are
delivered on budget; and 3) only 21% of IFMIS projects are delivered on time. Although
the proposed Iraq PFM IFMIS project is only a prototype, the likelihood of developing it
on time, on budget, as per project specifications in the time frame allotted prior to the
project closing date appear low, even under the best of circumstances.

    116.        The rationale presented for establishing this IFMIS prototype was to
‘realize the project objectives and magnify the impact of other components.’ It is not
clear how this could possibly be achieved, considering that so many of the Public
Financial Management performance measures in (primarily) Component 1, and to a lesser
extent in Components 2 and 3, were largely unfulfilled and rated as moderately
unsatisfactory. Further, so many of the fundamental elements that are required to be in
place for a project of this magnitude - especially and singularly importantly ownership by
the Government of Iraq - appear not to have been firmly in place.

    117.        The critical success factors for any IFMIS project (large or small) are
quite clear: a full-time project coordinator is required; there needs to be strong
political will and a champion at the political level; and the project needs to provide
an abundance of training. Many government entities will reach out for an Integrated
Financial Management System solution believing that having the system infrastructure
alone will create the mechanisms for an appropriate public financial management
environment. However, an IFMIS is only a tool and needs to be supported by appropriate
reforms on a multitude of levels. Many of the basic reforms that would support a
restructuring of the project to support this prototype development (and, subsequent roll-
out if successful) are simply not in place in Iraq.

    118.       The independent evaluation report on WB’s BSA intervention
provided keen insight on lessons learned and reasons for success stipulating that “the
structure and processes that the World Bank put in place for planning and delivering the

                                           30
project had been instrumental in ensuring that the project successfully met its objectives”.
Three key factors contributed to the success of the program, including: (1) the strong,
consistent strategic direction by the program manager ensuring that all project activities
were targeted on meeting the overall aims and objectives that had been agreed for it, in
addition to ensuring close, strong working relationship with the BSA; (2) the
international consultant(s) with broad experience and strong links with the international
links of SAIs being able to identify the institutions best placed to provide the type of
professional audit training, advice and guidance that the BSA needed; and, (3) the local
consultant who is in frequent touch with the BSA, facilitating the communication,
gaining the trust of the BSA, and reasonably compensating for the limited access of
international experts and Bank staff to Baghdad and the BSA.

    119.       A key overarching lesson (or question) that the WB can take from this
project, and the ICR review, is whether the Bank has sufficiently flexible procedures
to adapt project design when the initial project assumptions (para 12) are too
enthusiastic, and/or the project design proves to be too complex? The Bank and
project management teams did not foresee –that in retrospect- the reform environment
would dramatically (and, quickly) deteriorate. Perhaps, the first lesson would be to
always go into fragile conflict environments with a simpler, more targeted, approach. The
review also points out the crucial importance for there to be clear and measurable
indicators, and an agreed monitoring and evaluation plan prior to Project start. At present,
task teams cannot change Results Frameworks (and hence indicators) without formally
restructuring a Project. It is worth evaluating whether Bank procedures can be improved
such that teams can modify especially Results Frameworks more easily.

    120.         Further, broad public financial management reforms as represented
by this project do not easily dovetail with emergency lending procedures. As
presented above, use of regular procedures would have allowed a more constructive
internal dialogue and improved project design. In particular, it now seems unlikely that
such a large amount of money would have been allowed to remain unallocated, and later
threaten the project and lead to demand-side response. Ultimately, the Bank needs more
adaptable and flexible procedures for countries that fall under the fragile conflict
environment umbrella.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors
(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies

    121.       Discussions with the Project Management Unit and Government
counterparts indicated that there were several issues that adversely impacted the
evolutionary flow of the Project, including: i) Weaknesses by the various
beneficiary entities in contract management; and, ii) Poor terms of reference
development. As a result, the PMT believes that many of the consultancies were poorly
designed, implemented and executed. The PMT ICR review agreed that that the change
in the PMT leader, procurement manager, and accounting manager weakened the
effectiveness of PMT project delivery. In effect, the reliance of an external funded
procurement manager, for a period of time, lead to delays in procurement and payment
release. Recommendations from the PMT include the following: 1) the schedule of more
                                            31
frequent consultation meetings with the World Bank (no less than 3 annually); 2)
additional assistance in the selection of eligible firms when it comes to the selection of
consultancies in international procurements; and, 3) more assistance from the World
Bank with respect to understanding and improving contract negotiation skills.

(b) Cofinanciers/Donors

USAID has been supporting Improving Iraqi Procurement Practices, Improving Program
Management, and assisting the Iraqi Government in streamline its onerous regulations to
a more business friendly regulatory environment.

Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

    1. Discussions with the Project Management Unit and Government
counterparts indicated that there were several issues that adversely impacted the
evolutionary flow of the Project, including: i) Weak comprehension by the various
beneficiary entities on contract management; and, ii) Poor terms of reference
development. As a result, the PMT believes that many of the consultancies were poorly
designed, implemented and executed.

    2. The discussion also pointed to some weaknesses in the PMT. The PMT – ICT
report agreed that that the change in the PMT leader, procurement manager, and
accounting manager weakened the effectives of PMT project delivery. In effect, the
reliance of an external funded procurement manager, for a period of time, led to delays in
procurement and payment release.

    3. Recommendations from the PMT include: 1) the schedule of more frequent
consultation meetings with the World Bank (no less than 3 annually); 2) additional
assistance in the selection of eligible firms when it comes to the selection of
consultancies in international procurements; and, 3) more assistance from the World
Bank with respect to understanding and improving contract negotiation skills.
