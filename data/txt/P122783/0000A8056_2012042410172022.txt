                         The operation aims to support the Government’s Growth Strategy, and its medium term policy framework to restore macroeconomic stability in the wake of the global
                         financial crisis. The operation will support the Government’s reform efforts in the areas of (a) fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stabilization, (b) improving public
                         expenditure management and Fiduciary Framework; (c) creating a conducive environment for private sector led growth, and (d) improving access and quality of basic
                         services.

                         The Third Poverty Reduction Support Grant and Credit (Grant IDA H7070; Credit IDA 49670) was approved by the World Bank's board of Directors on June 28, 2011 after the
                         completion of six prior actions. The project was signed on July 28, 2011 and became effective on August 30, 2011, after the conditions for effectiveness were met, including the
                         issuance of a satisfactory legal opinion. A single tranche disbursement took place on October 26, 2011.

                         The operation has achieved moderately satisfactory results so far, with slow but incremental progress towards the project development objectives. The Government continues to be
                         committed to achieving all the results indicator beyond the operation period, but faces considerable capacity and institutional weaknesses. The on-going fiscal crisis has also slowed
                         progress through taxing Government capacity. As of March 2012, of the six activities supported through the PRSC operation, the results indicator had been achieved for one (on
                         OVCs), and there had been progress on four. One indicator (on health) could not be verified.

                         Progress was achieved on all the developmental objectives.

                         The Government continues to progress towards fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stabilization in response to the decline in SACU transfers that started in FY10/11. In

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                          Report No: ISR4489



                         FY11/12, a number of expenditure cuts initiated the previous year were maintained and further cuts were introduced. These allowed the deficit to be contained at a projected 12.3
                         percent of GDP, compared to the budgeted 17.2 percent of GDP. The deficit was financed in large part through the use of cash balances maintained by the Government with the
                         central Bank. The use of these deposits limited the build up of debt, and despite the large deficit, Lesotho remains at moderate risk of debt distress. The budget for FY12/13
                         (presented in February 2012), indicates clearly the Government's commitment to continuing with fiscal consolidation, despite a significant increase in SACU transfers and the

                         upcoming national elections. The budget maintains tight controls on recurrent spending, holding it constant as a share of GDP at the projected out-turn for FY11/12. It projects
                         declines in spending on wages and salaries and on the tertiary bursary scheme as a share of GDP. Wage increases for FY12/13 were limited to lower than inflation, and the
                         Government maintained a freeze on new positions. As a result of these spending controls, the medium term fiscal framework published in the budget speech projects a steady
                         decline in both the wage bill and in the non-SACU balance till 2014/15, and redirects resources towards capital spending as supported by the operation.

                         On public financial management, the Government is moving ahead with strengthening its medium term expenditure framework through moving towards performance based
                         budgeting. Fifteen Ministries will implement program budgeting in 2012/13, and it will be phased in across Government over the next two years. A significant challenge for
                         Government in managing public finances has been dealing with the problems thrown up by the roll-out of the Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS). The
                         main problems are transactions that are partially processed in the system and errors made by end users, that have made it difficult to prepare accurate execution reports and financial
                         statements. These have hampered efforts to prepare timely public accounts for the years post IFMIS roll-out as required under the Public Financial Management and Accountability
                         Act, 2011 (PFMA). The Government is aware of the challenge and has been working with partners in costing and prioritizing an action plan to deal with these issues. This is now
                         ready, and implementation of the action plan is expected to start soon. In the meantime, a task team has been established to prepare the financial statements for FY09/10 and
                         FY10/11. The lack of timely public accounts however continues to hinder external audit and oversight. Progress has also been slow on establishing the procurement tribunal, with
                         positions not yet filled in as of March 2012 and procurement regulations still being drafted.

                         Progress was slow on creating a more conducive environment for private sector growth through reducing the administrative burden of starting a new business. Despite the
                         Companies Act (the drafting of which was supported by the operation) receiving Royal Assent in June 2011, the drafting of the Companies regulations, which are needed in order to
                         enforce the Act, had not been completed as of March 2012. This delayed the incorporation of companies' registration into the OBFC. Government has enacted the Land Act (2010)
                         that could help improve access to land for foreign direct investors. This was identified as a major constraint to attracting FDI, and easing it could help attract move investment into the
                         country.

                         Progress has been made in improving access and quality of essential services. The registration of Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs), supported by the operation, was
                         completed in April 2011. This provided the basis for rolling out the child grants program. Government was able to scale up the number of beneficiaries under this scheme rapidly, from
                         1,500 in 2010 to more than 27,000 by November 2011. In the Health sector, the PRSC series supported efforts to build capacity to improve access to anti-retroviral treatment (ART).
                         Government increased the number of sites providing ART treatment. It also revised national guidelines to bring them in line with WHO recommendations, providing for improvements
                         in the enabling environment to help retain people on ART. Information on the percentage of eligible people living with HIV/AIDs and receiving anti-retroviral treatment is still being
                         collected, but it is expected that this has gone up. In addition, in 2011, Government opened a new public tertiary hospital built under an innovative PPP model. This is expected to
                         improve quality of service delivery, and improve utilization. The Lesotho Demographic and Health survey and facility surveys, both reported quality of service at public health centers
                         and hospitals to be a deterrent to their utilization.

                         Overall the Government of Lesotho undertook serious reforms, both within the context of the PRSC series and beyond, that have helped Lesotho move towards achievement of the

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A satisfactory conclusion of the project will require concerted action by Government, particularly in terms of (1) Implementing the provisions of the Companies Act to incorporate
                         registration into the OBFC; (2) Establishing the Procurement tribunal, and (3) Implementing the IFMIS action plan and (4) finalizing public accounts and bringing them up to date as
                         required under the PFMA.
