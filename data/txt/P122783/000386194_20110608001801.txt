Assistance Strategy   Government’s reform efforts in the areas of (a) fiscal consolidation and
                      macroeconomic stabilization, (b) improving public expenditure management
                      and Fiduciary Framework; (c) creating a conducive environment for private
                      sector led growth, and (d) improving access and quality of basic services.
                      The proposed PRSGC-3 is an integral part of the Bank’s assistance to Lesotho
                      as outlined in the CAS for the period FY10-14. The CAS is built around
                      three broad areas of engagement: (i) fiscal adjustment and public sector
                      efficiency, (ii) human development and service delivery, and (iii)
                      competitiveness and diversification.
Risks and Risk        Macro-fiscal risk. A slower than expected regional and global economic
Mitigation            recovery would dampen demand for exports, reduce foreign direct
                      investment, and keep SACU revenues low. This would put enormous
                      pressure on what already is a tough fiscal adjustment process, undermine
                      fiscal sustainability and/or jeopardize necessary social and capital
                      expenditure. Government deposits accumulated at the Central Bank during
                      the years of SACU revenue boom provide some cushion from shocks.
                      Predictable and timely budget support and technical advice through the PRSC
                      series and from other external financing, including the IMF will also help
                      mitigate the risks.
                      Policy slippages. The Government’s reform program is centered around
                      ensuring fiscal consolidation through expenditure control, structural reforms
                      to boost economic growth in the medium term and improving service delivery
                      of key services. The run-up to local elections in 2011 and the National
                      Assembly elections in 2012 will test the political will to push through
                      necessary reforms and push forward the ambitious fiscal consolidation
                      program. This risk is being mitigated in two ways. One, by strengthening the
                      hands of the reform champions through the PRSC and more broadly the joint
                      budget support framework. Two, through conducting reviews of the
                      harmonized Performance Assessment Framework of development partners
                      providing budget support which also bring in civil society and key
                      stakeholders to monitor progress, strengthen accountability, and highlight the
                      importance of continued reform momentum.
                      Capacity risks. Weak institutional and implementation capacity across the
                      government is another source of risk to the program. Inadequate capacity
                      slows the reform process, leads to low utilization of available resources and
                      poor service delivery. To mitigate this risk, the Bank is supporting
                      Government capacity building in public sector management and public
                      expenditure management through two on-going ESWs. Capacity building
                      initiatives are also underway with support from other Development Partners
                      in the reform of financial accountability protocols.

    PROPOSED THIRD POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT AND CREDIT
                             (PRSGC-3)
                    TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

                                     I.     INTRODUCTION

  1.    The PRSGC-3 is the third and final in a series of annual development policy
operations (DPO) supporting the Government of Lesotho’s development program laid out in
its Interim National Development Framework and Growth Strategy, and consistent with the
CAS for FY10-14. The proposed operation will be a Grant and Credit, totaling US$18 million.
It comes at a time when the Government of Lesotho (GoL) is coping with the shocks
precipitated by the global financial crisis which have affected growth and public finances
adversely, and led to a significant deterioration in Lesotho’s near-term economic outlook. The
proposed operation takes cognizance of the need for macroeconomic stabilization and the
implied constraints, while continuing to support the longer term developmental program of the
country.

  2.    Macroeconomic conditions deteriorated sharply after 2008, reflecting the adverse
impacts of the global economic crisis. Economic growth slowed down from 4.7 percent in
2008 to 2.5 percent in 2009 due to reduced demand for diamond and textile exports, and the
recovery since has been slower than expected. The biggest shock however has come from a
sharp drop in revenues from the South African Customs Union (SACU) of some 16 percent of
GDP in 2010/11 to half of their level in the previous fiscal year. SACU revenues accounted
for 51 percent of government revenues in 2009/10, and their decline has resulted in large
fiscal and external imbalances. The situation calls for significant fiscal consolidation to restore
macroeconomic stability and preserve an adequate level of international reserves in support of
the exchange rate peg.

  3.    In response, GoL has adopted a medium-term program designed to restore
macroeconomic sustainability, while retaining the longer-term focus on broad-based growth
for poverty reduction. The pillars of this reform program are (a) containing public expenditure
to within sustainable limits while protecting the poor and vulnerable groups; (b) strengthening
non-SACU revenues; (c) strengthening public financial management to improve spending
efficiency and public service delivery, (d) improving the business environment to facilitate
private sector expansion and diversification, and (e) human development, especially
addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

 4.   The PRSC operation together with the contribution by the Joint Budget Support (JBS)
Donor Group will provide reliable and timely financial support for the implementation of the

Government’s development strategy.1 As was the case with earlier PRSC operations, the
proposed PRSGC-3 has been designed and is being implemented within a harmonized
framework for the provision of budget support in Lesotho. It comprises a multi-year
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) and a review process aimed at reducing
transaction costs for the Government and the development partners. GoL has also entered a
three year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program with the IMF in the amount of SDR 41.88
million.

                                                                A.   COUNTRY OVERVIEW

  5.    Lesotho is a small, landlocked country, with a population of around 2.1 million.
Highlands constitute more than two-thirds of the territory and less than ten percent of it is
suitable for cultivation. The country is endowed though with other natural resources; water,
diamonds, and hydro-potential. It is completely surrounded by South Africa, and its economy
is closely tied with it. South Africa is Lesotho’s largest trading partner, a major source of its
imports       and        a     market      for      its      exports,      especially     water.
It provides employment for many Basotho miners whose remittances are a major source of
foreign exchange. Many of Lesotho’s key macroeconomic determinants are strongly
influenced by the monetary union and the pegged exchange rate with South Africa under the
Common Monetary Area (CMA), membership in SACU and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), and the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU).
Importantly, receipts from SACU, driven in large part by South African imports, are a major
source of revenues for GoL. In 2009/2010, these accounted for more than half of total
government revenues.
Box 1: The South African Customs Union

SACU is the oldest still existing customs union in the world. Its aim is to maintain the free
interchange of goods between member countries. It provides for a common external tariff and a
common excise tariff to this common customs area. All customs and excise collected in the
common customs area are paid into South Africa’ national Revenue Fund. The Revenue is shared
among members according to a revenue-sharing formula as described in the agreement. South
Africa is the custodian of this pool. Only the BLNS Member States' shares are calculated with
South Africa receiving the residual.

The Administrative and Institutional structure of the revenue pool consists of the following:
    Council of Ministers: A body represented by one Minister from each SACU member

                                                            
1
  The other Donors providing Budget Support to Lesotho include the European Union and the African 
Development Bank. The EU plans to provide GoL 10.5 million EUR in FY 2011/12, while the ADB will not be 
disbursing that FY. 


                                                                         6
              state. It is the supreme SACU decision-making body and meets on a quarterly basis. It
              can take decisions only be by consensus.
             Commission: An administrative body composed of Senior Officials, three Technical
              Liaison Committees and an established Agricultural Liaison Committee.
             Tribunal: An independent body of experts. It reports directly to the Council of Ministers.
              The tribunal is responsible for tariff-setting and the Anti-dumping Mechanism.
             Secretariat: Responsible for day to day operations of the pool. It is funded from the
              revenue pool.

The revenue share accruing to each Member State is calculated from three basic components:
   1. a share of the customs pool;
   2. a share of the excise pool; and
   3. a share of a development component

These three different components are distributed as follows: The customs component is allocated
according to each country’s share of total intra-SACU trade, including re-exports. The excise
component, net of the development component, is allocated on the basis of the country’s share in
SACU GDP. The development component, fixed at 15% of the total excise pool, is distributed to
all SACU members according to the inverse of each country’s per capita GDP.

SACU revenue constitutes a substantial share of the state revenue of the BLNS countries.

  6.    The country is transitioning from a predominantly subsistence economy that
relies on remittances from abroad to a lower middle income country that exports natural
resources and manufactured goods. Lesotho’s per capita gross national income reached
US$1,020 (Atlas method) in 2009 placing it within reach of the IDA cut-off point. Real per
capita gross domestic product (GDP) grew on average by 3.3 percent annually between 1980
and 2009, well above the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. This was achieved in part by taking
advantage of the preferential trade regime under the 2001 U.S. African Growth and
Opportunity Act to attract FDI and expand garment exports to the United States. The textiles
industry today accounts for around 8 percent of GDP, and is Lesotho’s main foreign exchange
earner and the largest non-agriculture employer outside of government. The Government has
also modernized management of natural resources and transformed its abundant water
resources into a source of revenue by exporting water to South Africa. The transformation has
brought higher, more secure incomes to a large number of households while the Government
has succeeded in dramatically improving access to services such as education, health, water,
and transportation.2 However the small size of its economy and the lack of a diversification
make Lesotho vulnerable to economic shocks.

  7.    Poverty rates remain high, especially in rural areas. Despite good economic
growth, high inequality (Gini of 0.66) and high unemployment (22.7 percent in 2008) have
meant that the benefits of growth have not easily reached the poor. Data inadequacies make it
difficult to obtain a clear picture, but as of 2002/03, approximately 43 percent of households
in Lesotho lived on less than $1.25/day, and about half of Basotho households lived below the
national poverty line. A new Household survey is nearing completion which will provide
more current information. A substantial minority of households, mostly in rural areas, have
not benefitted much, and there is a large urban-rural gap with the 76 percent of the population
living in rural areas facing lower incomes and higher poverty rates.

  8.    The country faces serious challenges on the human development front, among the
most serious of which is the high prevalence of HIV/AIDs. Lesotho has the lowest life
expectancy at birth among comparator nations and deteriorating human development
indicators. Life expectancy at birth is 41 years, down from 59 years in 1996.3 The country has
the third highest HIV adult prevalence rate in the world at 23.6 percent. At the end of 2008,
there were an estimated 280,000 people living with HIV, of whom 21,000 were children. The
total number of orphans is estimated to be around 221,400.4 The country also has the fifth
highest Tuberculosis (TB) incidence in the world with 635 cases per 100,000 people. With 80
percent of TB positive patients also infected with HIV, the epidemic has dramatically
increased mortality. Multi-Drug Resistant and Extensively Drug Resistant strains of TB are on
the rise, threatening both Lesotho and the southern Africa region as a whole.

 9.    Improving the quality of education remains an important challenge. Lesotho has
made substantial gains since the introduction of free primary education in 2000 and the
Millennium Development Goals for the sector are within reach. However the quality of

education remains a concern, as highlighted by the poor results in an internationally
comparable test (SAQMEC 2007). Almost half of primary school infrastructure does not meet
minimum standards, and approximately 40 percent of teaching staff is unqualified. The
repetition rate of 21 percent is high. The success of free primary education is also leading to
transition rates of around 70 percent between primary and lower secondary, and between
lower and upper secondary education.5 The system however lacks the capacity to
accommodate the increasing numbers of secondary school students.

 10.    Lesotho has used public expenditures as a key tool in the fight against poverty.
Public expenditures in Lesotho can be understood, to a large extent, as redistribution, back to
the population, of two sorts of rental incomes: tax receipts from SACU, and receipts from
selling water to South Africa.6 The Government has invested substantially in expanding
access to social and economic infrastructure to reduce exclusion and inequality of
opportunities. Public investment has also been important in transforming Lesotho’s abundant
water resources into a source of revenue by exporting water to South Africa, and in promoting
private sector growth through infrastructure and skills development. The public sector is
consequently large, and public spending has a strong impact on economic growth and poverty
reduction.

 11.    Government expenditures however have reached unsustainably high levels.
Rising on the back of windfall SACU revenues, total expenditures rose from 48 percent of
GDP in 2005/06 to about 67 percent of GDP in 2009/10, with most of the increases coming in
current expenditure categories. In 2009/2010, domestically collected tax and non-tax revenues
accounted for an impressive 26.6 percent of GDP, but still left the Government heavily reliant
on volatile SACU revenues.

 12.    Management of public expenditure remains weak, though there has been
significant improvement. Lesotho had a long history of weak public expenditure
management for various reasons, including episodes of political instability and lack of
manpower and capacity. Weaknesses in the management of resources resulted in less than
favorable outcomes in terms of reducing poverty and fostering growth. In order to increase the
impact of public expenditures, the Government embarked upon a comprehensive reform
program in 2005 covering all stages of the budget cycle from budget formulation to legislative
scrutiny and audit. As a result public expenditure management, though still weak, has seen
significant improvements as elaborated later in the document.

 13.    Lesotho’s domestic private sector is small and weak. With the public sector
stretched, the onus for leading growth and employment creation is increasingly on the private
sector. The domestic private sector however is weak, poorly organized and lacks influence
over Government decision making. A number of factors hinder the growth of the private
sector. All quantitative measures (Global Trade Reports, Doing Business Indicators and
Enterprise Surveys) suggest that regulations are a serious constraint to business. Obtaining
business licenses and permits remains a major obstacle, as does access to finance. Doing
Business Indicators put Lesotho at the bottom of all SACU members with respect to the ease
of obtaining credit. Finally, access to land is an issue, especially for foreign investors. A series
of reforms, supported in part under the PRSC series and described later, have sought to
alleviate these constraints, although their impact will only be felt over time.

 14.    The process of reforms is made difficult by a challenging political environment,
and institutional and human capacity limitations. Lesotho has a hybrid parliamentary
system of direct elections combined with a member proportional system. Electoral rules are
complex and subject to different interpretations, opening up space for contestation. The last
National Assembly elections, held in February 2007, were hotly contested and aggrieved
parties have periodically protested against the allocation of seats in the National Assembly.
The electoral rules and the weak institutionalization of parties are associated with a high
degree of fragmentation, which limits the ability of parties to coordinate and commit to
reforms. At the same time, there is limited demand-side pressure for improved governance
because of the low capacity of civil society organizations, and limited collective action from
business organizations to press for reforms.

 15.    The Government has followed largely prudent macro-economic policies, though
fiscal consolidation remains an important medium term challenge. The currency peg with
the South African Rand provides Lesotho with exchange rate stability with its main trading
partner and monetary policy discipline. On the fiscal side, the Government prudently ran up
large surpluses in response to windfall SACU revenues till 2008/09, though as described in
Para 11 its fiscal stance was expansionary. In response to the sharp decline in SACU
revenues, the Government has committed to strong fiscal consolidation over the medium term,
entailing significant cuts in largely wasteful recurrent expenditures to restore fiscal and
macroeconomic stability. This commitment underlies the IMF’s ECF program, which remains
on track.



                           B.    RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

16.    Supported by favorable external conditions Lesotho experienced good growth
during 2004–2008 and stable inflation. Real GDP growth over the period averaged 3.4
percent driven by exports of textile and diamonds, and by the construction sector. In addition,


                                                10
sizeable revenues from SACU, resulting from strong growth in imports into South Africa, led
to large fiscal and current account surpluses. SACU revenues rose sharply from 25 percent of
GDP in 2004/05 to about 37 percent of GDP in 2008/09. Inflation has continued to decline
rapidly, from a high of 10.7 percent in 2008 to 3.4 percent in 2010 reflecting lower food
prices and the strength of the Rand/Maloti. Inflation is driven in large part by prices in South
Africa, which remains the source of almost 90 percent of the country’s imports for final
consumption.

 17.    The country suffered a major shock in 2009 as a result of the global economic
crisis. The economic crisis has had a significant impact on the garment industry with exports
to the largest market, the US, declining by 18.1 percent in 2009/2010. Employment in the
industry fell by roughly 10 percent. Diamond exports were similarly hit, with two mines
closing down, and the price of diamonds from the sole remaining open mine, Letšeng, falling
from US$ 2200 per carat in 2008, to a low of $1415 per carat in early 2009. Remittances from
mine workers working in South Africa also declined. Consequently growth came down
sharply in 2009. It is estimated to have recovered to around 3.3 percent in 2010 driven by
some recovery in the mining sector and in construction, despite continuing weakness in the
textiles sector. However the effects of the decline in SACU revenues continue to persist. The
decline is large in 2010/11 and 2011/12, after which these revenues are expected to stabilize at
a level significantly lower than in the period preceding the crisis.

 18.   The slowdown is leading to severe deterioration of both the fiscal and current
account balances. The Government’s ability to raise domestic tax and non-tax collections,
and to cut expenditures in the short term, is limited relative to the sharp decline in SACU
revenues. Consequently it projects running large deficits in 2010/11 and 2011/12. The decline
in SACU transfers and a weakening of the trade balance is also affecting the external current
account position. This is estimated to have worsened from a more or less balanced position in
2009 to a deficit of 16 percent of GDP in 2010. International reserves at the end of 2010 were
enough to cover 4.6 months of imports, but are projected to come down to just 3.5 months by
end 2011.

 19.   GoL has responded by embarking on a medium-term program of fiscal
consolidation to restore fiscal sustainability. At the heart of this program is a phased
reduction in recurrent spending over the medium-term, deemed necessary to reduce reliance
on volatile SACU revenues and restore fiscal sustainability. This involves adjustments in the
wage bill, in transfers and subsidies, and on spending on goods and services. Efforts would
also be made to further boost non-SACU revenues and strengthen public financial
management to improve spending efficiency and public service delivery.

 20.    GoL has entered into a three-year SDR 41.88 ECF arrangement with the IMF,
which recognizes both the challenging external circumstances and its commitment to
fiscal and structural reforms. The ECF program supports the Government’s objectives of

                                              11
fiscal consolidation, external stability and broad based growth for poverty reduction. It sets
quantitative targets on the Central Government’s domestic financing requirement, on the net
domestic assets of the Central Bank and on its net international reserves. It also supports
structural reforms to increase productivity and external competitiveness, and strengthen the
financial sector.

 21.     GoL maintained a tight control on expenditures and performed solidly on
revenue collection, enabling it to meet the ECF benchmarks in 2010/11. GoL estimates
that it was able to bring down recurrent spending as a percent of GDP by almost 4 percentage
points during 2010/11, with reductions coming from expenditures on both wages and salaries,
and goods and services. . On the revenue front, GoL has acted to modernize the functioning of
the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA), leading to a 20-percent increase in collections from
the value added tax (VAT) in 2010/11. Lesotho collected a healthy 22 percent of GDP as non-
customs taxes in 2010/11 (exceeding the performance of most low-income countries),
maintaining the good performance of the previous year. Non-tax revenues also grew by 17
percent, even after excluding the exceptional dividend payment by the Central Bank.

 22.    The tight control on expenditures, continued solid performance on revenue
collection, and some unanticipated, one-time revenue gains7, allowed the Government to
control the overall deficit at a projected 8.2 percent of GDP in 2010/11, compared to the
19 percent target under the ECF program. In addition, the Government conducted a review of
on-going and proposed projects in 2010 the findings of which are being used to consolidate
the public investment program. Capital expenditures are however expected to remain high
over the next few years (more than 20 percent of GDP), and the Government has taken
encouraging efforts to improve the quality of such expenditures. It has revived the Project
Appraisal Committee (PAC) to review each new project for relevance, readiness and resource
availability before it is included in the budget.

 23.    The budget for 2011/12 presents a mixed picture. On some fronts (revenue
collection, control on expenditure on goods and services, and on transfers) it builds on the
significant achievements of last year. However in two important areas it reverses part of the
gains. One, it proposes a significant increase in the wage bill, raising this to 17.5 percent of
GDP. The significant increase reflects the introduction of a new salary scale for teachers
provided for in the new Education Act passed by Parliament in 2010, intended to stem serious
retention problems; new positions in the areas of national security and defense; and an across-

the-board salary increase of 5 percent in line with expected inflation.8 Two, it proposes an
increase in the tertiary bursary scheme, which is widely believed to be regressive and
unproductive, taking expenditures on this to 4 percent of GDP. Increased spending on the
recurrent side in 2011/12 also reflects the temporary cost of carrying out national and local
elections (1.4 percent of GDP), as well as higher interest payments on account of the
introduction of treasury bonds to help finance the deficit this year (0.7 percent of GDP). While
projected reductions in other primary spending will absorb part of these increases, on the
whole current expenditure is projected to increase over the outturn for last year.

 24.    GoL however remains committed to the consolidation program, and the program
remains broadly on track as affirmed by the First Review of the IMF program approved
by the Board on April 4, 2011. The projected deficit for 2011/12 of 17.1 percent is above the
revised ECF target of 14.8 percent of GDP, on account of emergency expenditures to restore
infrastructure affected by abnormal rainfall, and the IMF program remains on track. Excluding
these emergency expenditures, the deficit would have been 15 percent, in line with the ECF
target. The increases in the wage bill and in student grants, however, heighten risks to medium
term consolidation because such expenditures can be difficult to roll back. GoL recognizes
these concerns and has committed to taking action. On the wage bill, it has signaled its
intentions by freezing all new positions in government (except in Defense and Police). The
budget speech also refers to its intentions to outsource non-core activities to the private sector.
The process of adjusting the wage bill is technically difficult, and the Government has
approached the Bank for analytical support in this regard. On student grants, GoL has used the
budget to sensitize the public about the need for controlling these expenditures. On this too, it
has asked the Bank for analytical support. Government ownership of the consolidation
program remains strong, and the Bank and the Fund teams will continue to support GoL
through continued analytical and policy engagement and monitoring. 9

 25.    On balance, the macroeconomic framework is sustainable and adequate to
support the Government’s developmental objectives. Lesotho’s macro framework stays
within the bounds of fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability, as discussed below. While the
fiscal position has deteriorated since 2009 due to external conditions, its fiscal policy stance
remains focused on keeping the fiscal deficit sustainable. This assessment is consistent with
the     IMF      Staff    assessment     of   progress     under     the      ECF      program.

                               C.         MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

 26.    Lesotho’s macroeconomic environment remains challenging, with downside risks.
Economic recovery is expected to be slow. Growth in the medium term will depend on
recovery in the key export sectors, garments and diamonds, and on public infrastructure
investments especially the Metelong Dam project and the second Highlands water project.
Garments sector growth depends on recovery in the major export market, the US; and on
diversification to other markets like South Africa and the European Union. However, given
the declining competitiveness of the industry, growth is likely to be muted. Public investments
in infrastructure, though important for growth, will be constrained by fiscal space and by the
tight balance of payments position unless they are financed by external grants or loans.

 27.    SACU revenues remain the key driver of fiscal and external outlook as well as
future debt dynamics. With capital expenditures likely to remain high till the completion of
the Metolong Dam in 2013/14, much will depend on how SACU revenues recover. These are
expected to remain lower than their historical average in 2011/12, and then recover in line
with the South African economy,10 and stabilize around a reduced level of about 20 percent of
GDP. The Government’s medium term fiscal framework envisages that public expenditures
will have to be cut from 67.3 percent of GDP in 2009/2010, to around 61 percent in 2013/14
to bring the deficit down to 3.7 percent of GDP. The increase in public debt in the meantime
will depend on the speed and the extent to which the authorities are able to curb expenditures,
and their ability to mobilize financing from donors on concessional terms.

 28.    The country’s nominal public sector debt declined from 39.6 percent of GDP at
the end of 2009/10 to a projected 38.6 percent in 2010/11. This was mainly because of a
significant appreciation of the loti/dollar exchange rate. Almost 90 percent of public debt is
external debt, owed almost entirely to multilaterals, mainly IDA and the African Development
Fund. Public domestic debt (held by residents) amounted to only 3.9 percent of GDP.

 29.    The DSA done in May 2010 rated the risk of debt distress in Lesotho as
moderate. The last World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) completed in May
2010 projected an increase in the risk of debt distress, mainly due to the non-concessional
borrowing for the Metolong dam. The analysis projected that a key indicator, the present
value of debt to GDP ratio, would rise to 42.2 percent by 2015, above the 40 percent
indicative threshold. The breach of the threshold lasted for 9 years, before declining to 15.3
percent by 2030. The analysis also projected a modest increase in the ratio of debt service to
exports (from 4.2 to 7.3 percent) and debt service to revenues (from 4.4 to 7.2 percent), but
debt service ratios remained well below the thresholds due to the highly concessional nature
of existing debt. Overall the risks were manageable if authorities implemented the planned
                                                            
10
   There is also considerable uncertainty regarding the level of SACU revenues over the longer term, with the 
possibility of revisions in the revenue‐sharing formula. 



                                                               15
fiscal adjustment. This underscores the need to restore fiscal sustainability and ensure sound
debt management. If the significant level of remittances to Lesotho, averaging more than 20
percent of GDP over the past several years, were taken into account, debt ratios decline
significantly and would remain below the remittance-modified threshold of 36 percent of
GDP, reducing markedly Lesotho’s risk of debt distress.  The debt dynamics are projected to
remain broadly unchanged, reflecting a moderate risk of debt distress, as fiscal consolidation
in 2010/11 was stronger than anticipated. The projected deficit in 2011/12 though higher, is
consistent with the ECF target and the assumptions used in the DSA.




                         III.   THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

 30. The long term aspirations of the Basotho are articulated in the Vision 2020
document, which was published in 2004. The long-term vision is that by the year 2020
“Lesotho shall be a stable democracy, a united and prosperous nation at peace with itself and
its neighbors. It shall have a healthy and well developed human resource base, a strong
economy, a well managed environment and an established technological base.”

 31. The GoL adopted an Interim National Development Framework (INDF) to
bridge the period between the end of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
(PRGS) and the adoption of a comprehensive National Development Plan in 2012. The
overall objective of the INDF is to reduce poverty and improve human development through:
(i) pursuit of high, shared, sustainable private sector led growth that generates employment;
(ii) reduction of social vulnerabilities, including fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic; and (iii)
fostering of good governance to improve service delivery.

 32. The Government’s programs and priorities are reflected in the Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF). Consensus on the main areas to be included in the PAF and
the nature of indicators to be included in the framework was reached during the initial
discussions at the outset of the PRSC program. The PAF defines and elaborates the main
objectives and a number of indicators of progress in the areas of: (i) Economic Growth and
Macroeconomic Performance; (ii) Governance and PFM; and (iii) service delivery. It
identifies a combination of process and outcome indicators against which to measure progress.

 33. Adjustments to the PAF have been made during annual review meetings which
bring together Government, civil society and donors. The last Annual Review was held
November 23-26, 2010. This event brought together all donors providing budget support, the
Government and other stakeholders, including the private sector, other development partners
and CSOs. Consensus was built through these consultative meetings on the merit of the
Government’s program.


                                             16
Fiscal Consolidation

 34.    A major pillar of the Government’s medium term economic program is to cut
wasteful expenditures protecting the poor and vulnerable. GoL has embarked on a
medium-term fiscal consolidation program to curtail recurrent spending through reducing
nonproductive expenditures over the medium-term to a level consistent with sustainable levels
of revenues, with the objective of reaching a balanced fiscal position by 2015/16. The
Government is however maintaining its focus on promoting economic growth and poverty
alleviation through infrastructure development and structural reforms to increase
competitiveness. It is also trying to improve public expenditure efficiency to minimize the
effect of fiscal consolidation on the economy. In addition, it has committed to a floor on social
spending on the school feeding program, old age pensions and HIV/AIDS to continue to
provide support for vulnerable Basotho.

 35.    Bringing down the wage bill, reducing subsidies and expenditures on goods and
services are important elements in this consolidation. The Government proposes to contain
the wage bill by freezing the number of existing positions and reducing the size of the public
service through eliminating posts that have remained vacant for more than 12 months. New
recruitment will be assessed in the context of skills requirements in high-priority areas such as
health and education. It also plans to outsource non-core activities to the private sector. In
addition, the Government proposes to cut expenditure on goods and services by reducing
international travel, cutting spending on furniture and equipment and curtailing trainings and
workshops.


Public Financial Management

 36.   Strengthening the effectiveness of public spending and the accountability
framework is at the core of fiscal consolidation and efforts to strengthen service delivery.
An important component of this is improving public expenditure management by improving
planning, budgeting, accounting and procurement.

 37.   The Government is moving towards Medium Term Expenditure budgeting to
better align the budget with national development priorities. New procedures and forms
have been developed, and the budget classification system has been expanded to
accommodate new information about programs, objectives, outputs and activities. Several
hundred officials from all ministries have been trained in the new approach. Significant
progress has been made on this front. All ministries now prepare three-year performance
budget estimates and use the IFMIS budget module to enter their budgets. Budget Framework
Papers (BFP) templates have been revised to ensure that government expenditures are aligned


                                               17
to national development priorities. Consolidated National BFP summarizing the competing
priorities and bids of the various ministries are then used by the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning (MFDP) and Cabinet to decide on budget ceilings for each ministry.

 38.    Program based budgeting is being piloted. While both the sector strategies and the
BFPs are costed, the MTEF information being captured and reported from the IFMIS still
largely focuses on expenditure items. A move towards program based budgeting is now
underway. In 2010/11, five pilot Ministries prepared MTEF information on a program basis.11
The GOL had planned to increase this to 10 for the 2011/12 budget cycle, but curtailed the
plans realizing that more effort in terms of capacity building is needed first.

 39.    Financial reporting is weak, but considerable improvements are underway.
Lesotho’s fiduciary framework and public expenditure management are severely hampered by
weaknesses in its financial reporting. An Accounting and Reporting Task Force has been set
up which aims to develop effective budget execution and reporting systems. Important
achievement include (i) replacement of the existing Government of Lesotho Financial
Information System (referred to as GOLFIS) by a new Integrated Financial Management and
Information System (IFMIS), which became operational on 1 April 2009; (ii) addressing the
issue of incomplete balances information, due to the absence of financial statements for the
five years 1996/97 to 2000/01; (iii) increasing training in accounting, IFMIS and internal
control issues, including raising the competence of financial controllers and the awareness of
chief accounting officers; (iv) establishing a new treasury organization within MFDP to
undertake the new accounting and cash management processes proposed under the IFMIS; (v)
developing the internal audit system into a hybrid arrangement under which internal auditors
will report to the top management of the ministry in which they are located, as well as to
MFDP; and (vi) reforming the public procurement system based on standardized procurement
documentation and streamlining procurement systems. Areas of significant progress are
discussed in more detail below.

 40.    The IFMIS system has been rolled out to improve planning, budgeting and
accounting. Donors supported the purchase, set-up, user training and go-live on April 1, 2009
of a central IFMIS, using EPICOR software. All ministries now prepare their budgets using
the budget module of the IFMIS, using the new chart of accounts and new budget
classification system. The system was the basis for maintaining Government accounts during
the 2009/10 and 2010/11 fiscal years and has already contributed to improving planning,
budgeting, accounting, reporting and purchasing/payments systems. However there have been

some implementation problems for which corrective actions are being taken.12 Terms of
Reference (ToR) for the IFMIS independent quality assurance was approved and an
assessment undertaken. An action plan has been developed, and MFDP has discussed the
findings with its Development Partners to garner their support.

 41.    GoL is currently in the process of decentralizing internal audit functions and
establishing Internal Audit Units in all line ministries. A recently approved Internal Audit
Charter envisages the establishment of modern internal audit functions in accordance with
international best practices and standards. Since the last Annual Joint Review, Internal Audit
staff has increased and Internal Audit Units have been established in 13 ministries, with
Internal Auditors attached. The Ministry of Finance and Development Planning has recently
also employed 20 additional Internal Auditors. There are, however, challenges with retaining
qualified auditors as several internal auditors have moved to the private sector. A new
structure for internal auditors in line ministries has been submitted to the Public Service
Commission for approval.

 42.    A Public Finance Management (PFM) Bill has been passed by Parliament. Public
Accounts for 2004/05, 2005/06, 2006/07 and 2007/2008 have been audited and submitted to
Parliament. Accounts for 2004/05 and 2005/06 are being reviewed by the Public Accounts
Committee. A Statement of Financial Affairs as of March 31, 2008 (dealing with the impact
of the period 1996 to 2001 for which no accounts are available) has been prepared and
submitted to Parliament - this affects the opening balances in the Public Accounts of 2009 and
those to be recorded in the IFMIS for 2010 onwards. The MFDP, in close cooperation with
the Development Partners, is updating a detailed draft PFM Reform Action Plan in response
to the 2009 PEFA PFM Performance Report, which will include a matrix of priority activities
to be undertaken and reported on during each Improvement and Reform Steering Committee
(IRSC) meeting.

 43.    Important procurement reforms are being implemented. New Procurement
Regulations were issued in January 2007 that resulted in removal of the Central Tender Board
and removal of the Central Stores, repositioning of the Government Printer, decentralization
of executive procurement to line ministries, establishment of an oversight body (Procurement
Policy and Advice Division-PPAD), capacity building of staff and development of procedures
manuals and bidding documents. The PPAD supports, monitors, and enforces compliance at
the ministries and at the districts. According to the Regulations, it covers the major functions
of developing relevant legislation, providing means of controlling and enforcing compliance
through audits, channeling information relating to all procurement activities, managing the
training efforts, and providing an independent appeal mechanism. Other roles include

guidance and advice to procurement units as well as compilation of an inventory of public
assets. Training programs have been initiated under the auspices of the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply (CIPS). However there is still a conflict between the Local
Government Act which provides for financial management under local authorities and the
2007 Procurement Regulations. Some other implementation issues also remain. Procurement
Units though established in line Ministries are not fully staffed, and where staff has been
employed, experience in public procurement is weak. Public perceptions about the
Government Procurement System are reportedly poor. An important step in ensuring that
procurement units adhere to regulations is the setting up of an independent Procurement
Tribunal, a provision contained in the PFM Bill. This bill has been passed by Parliament, and
awaits Royal Assent.


Growth and Diversification

 44.     The third pillar of GoL’s reform program is to generate high, shared, private
sector led growth. It sees its role primarily as an “enabler” of private sector generated
growth. The focus is on undertaking structural and institutional reforms to enhance Lesotho’s
global competitiveness and attractiveness for doing business, and becoming an investment
destination of choice. GoL is targeting those indicators of competitiveness that rank relatively
low in Lesotho.13 Business regulations and access to finance; and land have been identified as
priorities.

 45.    One important element of the Government’s program is business registration
reform. In 2007, the One Stop Business Facilitation Center (OBFC) was established, which
brings under one roof several functions. Supported by PRSC series, it now issues trading
enterprise licenses, industrial licenses, work permits for textile companies14 and import
permits/rebates and export visas (although a restricted list of product items requires approval
in various ministries). Parliament has passed the Bill which is now awaiting Royal Assent.
Once the Bill is enacted, a new Companies Registry will be established at the OBFC, enabling
its computer system to communicate directly with that of the LRA to provide the information
needed to register the company as a taxpayer, to which the LRA system would respond with a
taxpayer identification number (TIN). The intention is to develop an integrated company
registration and business registration system. In addition, the Companies Bill simplifies the
preparation of articles of incorporation by removing cumbersome requirements in the
Memorandum and Articles of Association. This will reduce the time of starting a business by
about 20 days.

      Lesotho is currently ranked 138 out of 183 countries in Doing Business.

                                                               20
 46.    Trading business licensing and industrial licensing procedures are being
simplified. It has been proposed that the current trade licensing system, which regulates all
enterprises including companies, be replaced with a simple registration requirement for
unincorporated businesses. The MTICM (at the OBFC or district offices) would simply
record basic information and issue a certificate of compliance with the provisions of the
proposed Enterprise Reporting Bill. The drafting of Enterprise Reporting Bill supported by the
Private Sector Competitiveness Project of the World Bank. In addition, a draft Industrial
Licensing Bill has been submitted for review and clearance of the Attorney General before
consideration of Parliament. One of the key changes of the draft bill is the removal of
Licensing Board, which has the potential to dramatically reduce the time spent in getting an
industrial license.

 47.    A number of issues however remain with the functioning of the OBFC.
Outstanding issues include: (i) the lack of an organizational and management structure
including clearly established requirements for reporting, performance management,
disciplinary procedures, working hours and consistent employee remuneration; (ii) the lack of
an IT support specialist; (iii) incorporation of tax registration and tourism licensing processes
in the OBFC; (iv) the lack of an OBFC representative located in Maputsoe for the provision of
export visas; and (v) the long delays associated with the requirement for residence permit
holders to obtain police clearance in order to apply for a renewal.

 48.    The Government has introduced legislation to improve access to land, identified
as a serious constraint for new FDI in Lesotho.15 A major step has been the enactment of
the Land Act (2010), which allows foreign companies to own land, so long as a Lesotho
citizen holds at least 20 percent shareholding in the business (as compared to 51 percent under
the old Land Act of 1979). It also increases the opportunity for lease holders to sign mortgage
bonds with financial institutions and pledge their leases. To further improve the business
environment, the Act has removed a requirement for Ministerial consent for issuance of leases
as was the case with the earlier Land Act.

 49.    It is investing in skills enhancement. Government is paying special attention to skills
development in the garment sector. With the support of its Development Partners, two
training centers (Northern Region Skills Center (NRSC) and the Maseru Skills Center) are
registered with the Technical and Vocational Training Department (TVD), Ministry of
Education, fully staffed and operational. Together the centers have trained 961 workers to
date and have developed a formal training curriculum that has been submitted to the TVD for
accreditation.

 50.     The Government recognizes the importance of good quality and timely statistical
data. These are prerequisites to inform policy and for monitoring progress towards the goals
set out in the results-based development agenda; including the Poverty Reduction Strategy,
the Interim National Development Framework and the Millennium Development Goals. The
Lesotho Bureau of Statistics (BoS) is spearheading the process to improve the National
Statistical System (NSS) and has prepared a National Strategy for the Development of
Statistics (NSDS). This outlines the current situation of the NSS in terms of operational
strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats, data demands and gaps, and capacities in
statistical data production. It provides a good framework upon which to build an action plan
to generate statistics that meet the critical information needs of the Government. The strategy
has been submitted to cabinet for approval.


Improving Service Delivery for Human Development

 51.    Government is committed to maintaining and strengthening its interventions which
seek to directly improve the quality of life of the Basotho. There has been progress in
improving access, especially in education and water supply, but the health care delivery
system remains weak. Combined with the scourge of HIV/AIDS, this has caused Lesotho’s
relative performance on the Human Development Index (HDI) ranking to fall from 127 of 174
countries in 1998 to 141 of 169 countries in 2010. GoL’s focus is on addressing the quality
and efficiency of service delivery, and the targeting of services to the most vulnerable sections
of society.


Health

 52.    The health sector suffers from systemic weaknesses. Health is a key pillar of the
Vision 2020 which outlines how Lesotho should become “a healthy nation with a well
developed human resource base”. The share of its budget allocated to the Ministry of Health
has increased steadily from 5.8 percent in 2000 to over 18.7 percent in 2010/11.16
However both access and quality of care remain problematic, especially for the poor and those
in rural areas. The widespread HIV prevalence, exacerbated by these problems of access and
quality help explain why most of the health outcome indicators are very poor; infant mortality
was 91 per 1000 live births in 2009, and maternal mortality 1155 per 100,000 live births.17

 53.    Despite a serious HIV/AIDS epidemic, demand for health care (outpatient visits
per capita and bed occupancy ratios) is very low evidenced by low occupancy rates (31
percent compared to the optimal range of 80–85 percent).18 Poor quality of care, high
transportation costs, long waiting times, and shortages of some drugs and equipment limit
access. The situation is exacerbated by severe human resources shortages, and even available
trained staff is used sub-optimally. At the same time, utilization of donor and budget funds is
poor mainly because of low capacity, weaknesses in public finance management and
incomplete decentralization. Several development partners (including the Bank) are jointly
supporting a long-term health sector reform led by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare
(MOHSW) in order to achieve a sustainable increase in access to quality preventive, curative
and rehabilitative health care services.

 54.     GoL is making efforts to strengthen healthcare access in rural areas, particularly
for the hardest to reach. The program to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV
(PMTCT) is a particularly success story in this respect. PMTCT is now available in all health
facilities and the country has pioneered a method of home-based PMTCT called the Mother
Baby Pack. This helps women who live far from health centers in getting preventive
treatment, even if they are unable to attend facilities for the duration of their pregnancies and
births. Health services are also capitalizing on the high level of horse ownership in Basotho
villages in a scheme called Riders for Health whereby horse-owning villagers are employed to
transport drugs, clinical samples and public health materials between health facilities and
villages, thus extending access to care.

 55.    The use of PPP arrangements is another important innovation, with the potential
to revolutionize the way healthcare services are delivered. The shining example is a new
referral hospital which would replace the Queen Elizabeth 2 hospital in Maseru. The new
390-bed hospital, to be operated on the principles of Public Private Partnership (PPP), has
been designed, built and will be fully operated (including clinical services) by the private
operator for 18 years. The Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid has provided a
performance-based grant of US$6.25 million to support service delivery to the poor under this
project. Three filter clinics have been constructed at Likotsi, Mabote and Qoaling. The
project's innovative PPP structure and the use of an output-based financing instrument enable
Government to maximize the quality and quantity of health services while remaining within
the budget, while the private sector has been presented with a new and robust market
opportunity. Most importantly, this also means that patients will have access to significantly
better medical services without increasing the minimal charge they pay for public services
today.

 56.   The coverage of several key HIV and AIDS interventions has improved. The
strong political commitment and increasing social mobilization plus increasing internal and
external funding have contributed to improvement in several key HIV and AIDS related
interventions in recent years. The coverage of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission
(PMTCT) increased more than tenfold from 6 percent in 2005 to 71 percent in 2009. The roll
out of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) made significant progress, with 64 percent of patients
needing ARVs receiving treatment in 2010. Lesotho has maintained a TB case detection rate
above 80 percent for the past 3 years, and currently has a treatment success rate of 74 percent,
up from 67 percent in 2007.



Education

 57.    The MDGs for education are within reach for Lesotho. Lesotho has achieved
substantial gains in education since introducing free primary education in 2000. The net
primary enrollment rate rose from 60 percent in 1999 to 80.9 percent in 2009, among the
highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lesotho has also achieved gender parity in primary education.
Most importantly, the probability of attending primary school is equal for the children from
the richest and the poorest households. Budget allocations for education have systematically
been high, between 14 and 15 percent of GDP for the past decade. The strong leadership of
the Minister of Education has been fundamental in the development and implementation of
comprehensive sector programs which have been endorsed by the Fast Track Initiative (FTI)
partnership.

 58.    Important challenges remain in primary education. More than half (51.7 percent)
of infrastructure does not meet the minimum standards for a safe learning environment; and
forty percent of the teachers are still unqualified. The harsh and difficult geographic
conditions of the country hamper service quality, and play an important role in factors such as
school drop-out, and time and quality of instruction. Repetition remains unusually high, with
a 29 percent repetition rate in grade 1 and an overall repetition rate of 21 percent.

 59.    The Government is addressing some of these challenges. For the past eight years
the Government has been strongly investing in improving the quality of infrastructure through
the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms, and the quality of education inputs through
the distribution of textbooks and other materials, and qualifying teachers. Concerns with the
quality of education and with the need to ensure the development of early literacy and
numeracy skills have led the Government to implement a curriculum reform and to strengthen
its assessment system. A quality of service delivery survey is underway, which will help the
design of future teacher training programs and curriculum materials.

 60.    Expanding lower secondary education is another important challenge. Lower
basic education is fundamental in the consolidation of basic skills. It also lays the foundation
for the development of more advanced skills in upper secondary, and technical and vocational
education. The current secondary education system in Lesotho does not have sufficient
capacity to accommodate all the students that transit from primary to lower secondary, and
from lower to upper secondary. Furthermore, teaching of key subjects such as science and
mathematics requires a well prepared and qualified teaching force that can deliver an
appropriate curriculum, which does not yet exist in Lesotho. Gender issues are also of concern
in secondary education, as many boys opt out for work, particularly in the rural areas. The
Lesotho authorities are expanding infrastructure through construction of new schools and with
the development of combined schools that include primary and lower secondary education.
They are also working towards equality of access through bringing down fees in secondary
schools, and increasing bursaries for orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs).

 61. The Government has received Parliamentary approval for its Education Sector
Strategic Plan (ESSP) 2005-2012. This lays the policy foundations for the development of
education and the achievement of the education MDGs. The Plan is under implementation,
and with the support of the local education donor group, a revised version of the Plan
(Education Sector Medium Term Plan) for the years 2009-2012 was prepared and endorsed by
the local donor group. An application for a Catalytic Fund grant from the FTI partnership for
funding to support interventions envisaged in the Medium Term Sector Plan, was submitted
with success. Lesotho was allocated a grant of US$ 20 million with a potential additional
grant of US$ 10 million upon successful implementation performance by the time of the mid-
term review. This grant is being complemented by a grant from Irish Aid in the amount of
US$ 6.8 million. The funds are being channeled to the Ministry of Education through a pooled
funding mechanism. The grant continues to support the development of infrastructure but it
also supports quality interventions. A quality of service delivery survey will be developed,
along with training of teachers for implementation of the new literacy and numeracy
curriculum. Incentives to retain and/or attract teachers to difficult to access schools are also


                                                 25
financed through the grant. The expansion of secondary education is being financed with the
support of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the African Development
Bank (AfDB).



            IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

                  A.       LINKS TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

 62.   The proposed PRSGC-3 is an integral part of the Bank’s assistance to Lesotho as
outlined in the CAS. The current CAS was discussed by the Board on July 2, 2010 and
covers a four year period (FY10-14). It was developed within the context of the
Government’s strategy for growth and sustainable development as expressed in the Vision
2020 and its Interim National Development Framework. It is built around three broad areas of
engagement: (i) fiscal adjustment and public sector efficiency, (ii) human development and
service delivery, and (iii) competitiveness and diversification. The proposed operation
supports reforms in all the areas.

                     B.     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

 63.    The Bank has a relatively small portfolio in Lesotho with an IDA allocation of about
US$24 million per year in the IDA 15 period. The PRSGC complements and reinforces
several current and planned investment projects in Lesotho. These include the Private Sector
Competitiveness and Economic Diversification (PSCED) Project, Integrated Transport
Project, Water Sector Improvement Project and the Smallholder Agriculture Development
Program– all geared towards creating an enabling environment for broad-based growth and
improving infrastructure and access to basic services. It also complements ongoing projects in
the Health, Education, and HIV/AIDS geared towards improving access and quality of
services in these sectors. In the education sector, for example, the PRSC series supported the
development of the education sector plan, the implementation of which is now being taken
forward under a Bank operation in the sector.



                C.        COORDINATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

 64.    Maintenance of sound macroeconomic management will be a precondition for
implementation of the PRSGC. Lesotho has entered into an ECF arrangement with the
Fund, and the coordination between the Bank and Fund teams is strong. The Bank team
participated in the review mission by the Fund in November 2010, and has provided continual
inputs into the development of the macroeconomic framework.




                                             26
 65.    The PRSGC is being prepared within the joint framework of budget support
developed under the leadership of the GOL with three participating development partners,
including IDA. The other development partners are the European Union and the AfDB.
DFID, Irish Aid, and GTZ, while not providing direct budget support at present, have been
participants in the process.

 66.    In May 2006, development partners established the guiding principles of the
budget support program. It was agreed that a nationally-owned PRS and an associated
common performance assessment framework would provide the basis for the budget support.
It was also recognized that the program should align around the budget timetable and MTEF
process and should be mindful of the need to ensure predictability in disbursements. The
program should also aim for a judicious balance between realism and ambition in the overall
results indicators that would set the basis for these disbursements. The Government welcomed
this approach, noting the importance of budget support in securing the still fragile reform
agenda whilst cautioning against the use of unrealistic results indicators. The donors are
collaborating to support Lesotho in implementing its development programs by providing
financial and technical support in a coordinated manner. Annual joint reviews are planned
and the most recent one was conducted in November 2010.



                                 D.     LESSONS LEARNED

 67.    Preparation of PRSGC 3 has benefitted from lessons learnt from the two
previous PRSC operations. The design of the operation is also guided by the overall advice
on DPLs provided by OPCS, including the good practices principles on conditionality and
also takes into account IDA’s overall experience with regard to implementation of projects in
Lesotho. The first lesson concerns selectivity and flexibility, focusing on reform areas that
will have a significant impact when completed. The second relates to a broader ownership of
the reform program by the Government – all stakeholder line ministries should own the
program and not just the Ministry of Finance. Other lessons include:
          (i) The program should be realistic as to what can be achieved, mindful of
              capacity constraints.

          (ii) It should concentrate on a few reform areas where there is most buy-in.

          (iii) Progress is greatest in sectors where there are complementary operations in
                place to provide technical assistance and build capacity for reforms.

          (iv) Involving civil society and non-government stakeholders in the design of the
               program and in reviewing progress is important to reinforce Government
               ownership of the reform program.



                                             27
                                                      E.       ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

 68.   The preparation of the PRSGC program has been informed by several analytical
studies and reviews. Since the last PRSC program document was prepared, a set of Policy
Notes have been prepared in key areas identified by the Government, aimed at strengthening
the overall dialogue and providing analytical inputs into the Government’s growth strategy
and the National Development Plan. Their findings fully support the focus and content of the
program. A PEFA PFM Performance Report was also completed in 2009 which provided
guidance on the direction PFM reforms should take.

 69.     The series of Policy Notes examine (i) Fiscal challenges in Lesotho and options for
reform; (ii) Realizing the potential of FDI to diversify Lesotho’s exports; (iii) Agriculture –
Challenges and directions for agri-business; and (iv) Effectively using available public
resources, particularly for capital expenditures. The Fiscal Challenges note looks at two
fiscal issues relevant for Lesotho: (i) developing a sustainable fiscal framework accounting for
the vulnerability in SACU revenues; and (ii) enhancing non-SACU revenues to mitigate the
impact of declining SACU revenues. Based on the long-term evolution of fiscal variables, and
under varying scenarios of sustainable SACU revenues, it is found that fiscal policy in
Lesotho has been somewhat expansionary and it is likely to remain so. At the same time,
given Lesotho’s unique characteristics19, sizeable reduction in SACU revenues will be
difficult to offset by increasing tax and non-tax revenues. The uncertainty over the future
evolution of SACU revenues thus reinforces the need for a prudent fiscal policy.

 70.    Lesotho has done well in attracting FDI for export led growth. But external
conditions that drove Lesotho’s trade boom are disappearing. With a much lower export
demand from the US (its largest export destination), there is a need to diversify its exports to
take better advantage of its relatively low wage structure, the country’s easy access to South
African physical infrastructure; its attractive position in the regional market by virtue of its
membership in SACU and SADC; and new opportunities presented under the interim
Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU. The policy note on realizing Lesotho’s export
potential addresses the policy and structural constraints that must be overcome to attract FDI.
This includes improving the investment climate by reducing the costs of doing business and
making Lesotho competitive vis-à-vis South Africa and providing factory shells and

                                                            
19
   As a small country fully surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho has a lot of trade with South Africa and border 
trade is more important than in countries of larger size. Variances in tariffs for imports and excises will provide 
opportunities  for  round  tripping  of  exports  and  smuggling.  The  same  logic  applies  for  consumption  taxes.   
Given its geographic characteristics, Lesotho has lower degrees of freedom than most countries to vary its tax 
rates. This also puts some limits on the income tax rate and income tax base. Different rates with South Africa 
would encourage firms either to incorporate in the other country or to use transfer pricing.

supporting infrastructure. Both these elements are an integral part of the PRSC series. The
PRSC program draws on the findings from this note.

 71.   The third policy note discusses weaknesses at different stages in the project cycle
which lead to weak links between capital spending and national priorities, underutilization of
available resources, and weak monitoring and evaluation of actual implementation. The paper
recommends wider use of BFPs to link policies with budgets and the revival of the Project
Appraisal Committee (PAC) to appraise and monitor all projects. The current operation
draws on these recommendations.

 72.    The Country Integrated Poverty, Social and Gender Assessment focuses on three
main areas: livelihood patterns among Lesotho’s households and how these correlate with
opportunity and exclusion; how the Government could make access to public services and
overall social development more equitable; and how the economic and social vulnerabilities
of households, including HIV/AIDS, could be alleviated in order to reduce poverty. Analysis
in this report concludes that it is possible for Lesotho to reduce poverty and to continue its
transition to an economically diverse middle-income country by undertaking three key
strategies: continuing to develop the investment climate for labor-intensive production;
implementing programs to support commercial agriculture and reduce land degradation in
rural areas; and developing a strategy to support socioeconomic and geographic mobility of
workers into higher-productivity sectors. Public funds should be better targeted towards
assisting the poor to build human capital and manage risks. Other recommendations to
improve the plight of the people of Lesotho include creating a more equitable and inclusive
society, especially for women, and developing a more effective campaign against HIV/AIDs.
The PRSGC is aligned with the key findings and recommendations.

                             A.      OPERATION DESCRIPTION

 73.    Significant progress has been made by the Government in implementing its
reform program as identified in the PAF. The last joint annual review of progress against
the PAF (November 2010) concluded that overall progress in the reform was satisfactory.
Table 4 presents the PRSGC-3 program which the Government has committed itself to
achieving. Section B below describes them in greater detail. The table also includes the
triggers for PRSGC-3 as they were identified at PRSC-2 stage. The differences with the prior
actions, if any, are explained in the comments column and are a result of intensive
consultations during the review period.

flows of SACU revenues are inherently unpredictable, the policy note on fiscal
challenges in Lesotho suggested that prudent behavior requires basing of expenditures
which are difficult to change, on the more stable revenue flows.21 The Government has
internalized this, and the budget for 2010/11 noted the need to “adopt a long-term fiscal
strategy that aligns expenditures to long-term domestic revenues and not SACU
revenues.” The budget for 2011/12 also mentions this as a key objective of the
Government. As a signal of the Government’s intentions, the fiscal framework presented
in the budget projects a decline in both the non-SACU deficit and the wage bill over the
medium term.

 75.     The Government has used a review of capital projects to consolidate the
public investment program. Capital expenditures over the next few years are projected
to amount to more than 20 percent of GDP. In order to consolidate the public investment
program, the Government conducted a review of on-going and proposed capital projects
to assess if some of these projects could be dropped or postponed. The recommendations
of this review have been used to inform the public investment program for 2011/12. This
has allowed authorities to lower domestically-funded capital spending, by improving
project prioritization, monitoring, and evaluation.

 76.    The indicative trigger for PRSGC-3 was that a macroeconomic framework
consistent with fiscal sustainability be adopted by Cabinet, with emphasis on the wage
bill and non-SACU deficit. The ECF arrangement with the IMF is based on such a
framework and has successfully ensured continuation of macroeconomic sustainability,
and no separate prior action is therefore needed. Bank dialogue with the Government is
strong and GoL has requested analytical advice from the Bank on options for controlling
the wage bill and subsidies.

Component 2: Improving Public Expenditure Management and the Fiduciary
Framework

 77.   In order to increase the impact of public expenditures, the Government embarked
upon a comprehensive reform program in 2005 covering all stages of the budget cycle
from budget formulation to legislative scrutiny and audit. The PRSGC-3 supports the
Government’s reform in all aspects of the budget cycle.

 78.    Good progress has been recorded on PFM reforms. An assessment based on
the PFM Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) was completed late in 2009
jointly by the Government and its key Development Partners. The assessment noted that
although longstanding weaknesses in budget execution, the internal control framework
and financial reporting identified in the previous assessment continue, significant
progress is clearly being made. The assessment also noted that there are many built-in
features of the new system that are designed to address problems in the areas of
expenditure commitments, authorization of expenditure and reconciliation of accounts.22


Planning and Budgeting

 79.    Lesotho has an orderly and participative budgetary process, involving spending
agencies and the political leadership in accordance with a pre-determined budget calendar
that is broadly adhered to. Cabinet discussion of the budget has been enhanced by the
establishment of a Cabinet Budget Sub-Committee, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister
and comprising the Minister of Finance and eight other ministers. The Budget sub-
committee reviews the budget submissions mid-January. The budget is normally
approved by the Legislature in a timely manner.

 80.    A multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting
has been deepened with the adoption of the MTEF. This was introduced in 2009/10.
As an integral part of MTEF development, a MTFF is now being prepared annually. The
annual preparation of the MTFF has five main objectives: (i) to prepare a realistic
forecast of the main components of revenue and grants; (ii) to make an accurate
assessment of statutory expenditure obligations; (iii) on the basis of the current policy
framework, to forecast the requirements for discretionary ministerial expenditure; (iv) to
use these forecasts of revenue and expenditure to recommend a budget balance and
financing strategy which is consistent with the core objectives of fiscal policy; and (v) to
set indicative ceilings showing the division of future ministerial expenditure ceilings by
economic classification (wages and salaries; goods and services; transfers and subsidies;
and capital).

 81.    The alignment of the budget with the Poverty Reduction Strategy is
improving with all ministries now preparing BFPs and the introduction of an MTEF in
all ministries, as detailed in earlier sections. Discussions on the BFPs are held to highlight
the Government goals and priorities, and to build consensus on the resource allocation by
cost centres, sub-cost centres, programmes and sub-programmes.

  The Assessment does not take into account the possible improvements that may be achieved as a result 
of the recent introduction of the integrated financial management and information system. 
                                                               35 
 
 82.    In April 2009 the IFMIS was also brought on line and Ministries were required
to enter their MTEF estimates into the budget module of IFMIS. This was initially not
adhered to by some ministries and resulted in problems with funds availability in the
IFMIS to process payment of invoices. Controls have now been established to mitigate
these problems. In order to further address shortcomings with the quality and
comprehensiveness of planning and budgeting data, the Budget Department is
introducing a performance monitoring and evaluation component for the MTEF, with key
performance indicators measuring the effectiveness of the MTEF approach.

 83.    PRSC-2 supported the development of BFPs by all ministries for 2009/10 -
2011/12. These papers are being produced, but are of variable quality and substantial
work remains to be done to achieve the full benefits of a transparent medium-term
perspective in planning and budgeting. The Government’s focus has correctly shifted to
improving the quality and utility of the BFPs. The indicative trigger for PRSGC-3 was
the publication of MTEF documentation for 2010/11 to 2012/13. The Government has
made some progress, putting the BFPs received for preparing the budget for 2011/12 on
the MFDP’s website. However recognizing the GoL’s justifiable focus on improving the
quality of MTEF documentation, this has been dropped as a prior action for this
operation. Going ahead however it will be important for Lesotho to develop
comprehensive MTEF documentation, and processes to have consultations around the
MTEF which help enhance policy responsive planning and budgeting. The Bank is
assisting GoL in strengthening the MTEF process.


Financial Reporting

 84.    A major reform supported by the PRSC, has been the introduction of IFMIS
in April 2009. The IFMIS can be broadly defined as a set of integrated automation
solutions that enable governments to plan, allocate responsibility, execute and monitor
the budget, by enabling the prioritization, allocation, execution, and reporting of
expenditures, as well as the custodianship and reporting of revenues. Accordingly the
IFMIS solution can contribute to the achievement of PFM strategic objectives. Proposed
budgets for all twenty seven budget heads for 2011/12 were loaded on to IFMIS,
significantly   improving    planning,    budgeting,    accounting,     reporting  and
purchasing/payments systems.

 85.    Implementation challenges are being addressed. Challenges have emerged
during the implementation phase of the system mostly due to insufficient training and
preparation of users. Monthly Government’s financial statements are now readily
available; however they are not yet reconciled with the bank accounts. There are some
transactions that are being conducted outside of the IFMIS in order to speed up the

                                          36 
 
payment process.23 It is anticipated that as the familiarity with the system increases, all
transactions will be conducted within the system. Bank accounts will then be easily
reconciled and expenditure backlog will diminish. Terms of Reference (ToR) for an
IFMIS independent quality assurance was approved and the assessment undertaken. A
help desk and issues log is in operation and corrective actions are being taken.

heads loaded on to IFMIS to strengthen planning, execution and monitoring of the
budget.



External Oversight and Audit

 86.   The PRSC operations have supported increased external oversight and audit
of public accounts. While public sector auditing in Lesotho is carried out in accordance
with international standards, it is hampered by delays in account preparation, lack of
financial resources and skilled staff. Progress with a new Audit Act to strengthen the
independence of the Office of the Auditor General has been slow and it still awaits
submission to Cabinet and Parliament. The capacity of the Public Accounts Committee
(PAC) is also weak and needs to be strengthened to review reports issued by the Auditor
General and ensure adequate follow-up of its reports by the Executive. The PAC should
also consider having its meetings open to the public on a regular basis to foster greater
transparency and accountability.

 87.    The indicative trigger for PRSGC-3 was that public accounts for 2007/08 and
2008/09 be audited and submitted to Parliament. However the finalization of Public
Accounts for 2008/09 by Treasury, and hence their auditing has been delayed.
Reconciliation of differences in balances between the 2007/08 Public Accounts and the
Statement of Financial Affairs as at 31 March 2008 has contributed to the delay in the
finalization and audit of the public accounts for 2008/09.24 In light of this, the prior action
for PRSGC-3 has been revised to the auditing and submission of Public Accounts for
2007/08, and records for 2008/09 submitted to the Auditor General.

Public Procurement

 88.    Progress has been made since the last PRSC operation. A Procurement
Assessment revealed several weaknesses that need to be addressed in order to render the
new procurement procedures efficient and transparent. This involved a revision of
regulations, as well as training of staff in the new procedures. The Manual and
regulations have been revised and standardized documents have been also prepared. The
Procurement Regulations will also be supported by other provisions in the new PFMA
Act.

 89.    The operation supports the establishment of a procurement tribunal in line
with CPAR recommendations. The Government confirmed its broad agreement with
the findings of the CPAR and has taken steps to implement several of the identified
actions. One key recommendation was regarding an appeals mechanism. While the
CPAR proposed establishment of an Independent Procurement Regulatory Authority
(IPRA), Government is establishing a Procurement Tribunal to provide an appeals
mechanism that would have been provided by the IPRA. The trigger for PRSGC-3 was
the establishment of a Procurement Tribunal. However the legal basis for establishing the
tribunal will be provided through the PFM Bill, which is being reviewed by Parliament.
Accordingly the prior action has been modified to the submission to Parliament for
review of the PFM Bill.

basis for establishing the Procurement Tribunal)



Component 3: Creating a Conducive Environment for Private Sector Led Growth

 90.     The PRSC series support simplification of regulatory procedures. On trade
facilitation, this involved folding the two distinct processes of Trade and Lesotho
Revenue Authority (LRA) into a single process. The export process has been redesigned
to eliminate unnecessary steps. Exporters no longer need to submit applications for
recommendation to the MTICM, they are approved at the OBFC; exporters no longer
apply for rebate permits for each individual consignment, they now apply for rebates
once a year irrespective of the number of consignments; and exporters no longer fill out
                                           38 
 
five different forms, they only complete a universal data form. Import processes have
been changed from blanket permits on all goods to permits for only restricted goods25.
Licensing administration has been changed to simplify the fee structure (no application
fee26) and reduce the number of pages on a form to one page from five for traders and
sixteen for manufacturers. The OBFC currently issues trading enterprise licenses,
industrial licenses (i.e. small scale industrial licenses and manufacturing licenses), work
permits (for textile companies) and import permits/rebates and export visas (although a
restricted list of product items requires approval in various ministries). Residence permits
for manufacturers, which earlier had been issued in the OBFC, is currently issued at the
MHAPS.

 91.     Sensitization and training of private sector clients has been undertaken
(information sessions, public notices, publications etc.). New software has been
developed to integrate business licensing, export visas and import permits, improving
information collection, automating forms as well as reducing processing time. The Local
Licensing Board has also revised its number of sittings from one to four times a month.
This has significantly reduced the number of days taken to issue a manufacturing license.
It takes 5days or less to issue manufacturing and trading licenses. The global financial
crisis that hit Lesotho’s textiles and garment industry, and the fact that MTICM decided
not to issue industrial licenses at the OBFC for much of the second half of 2009 however
make it hard to gauge outcomes. The OBFC issued an average of 395 trading enterprise
licenses per month in 2008 as compared to 250 licenses in 2009 and 211 licenses during
the first eight months of 2010. The OBFC also issued an average of 28 small scale
industrial licenses per month in 2008 as compared to 15 licenses in 2009 and 19 licenses
in the first eight months of 2010. It issued an average of 10 manufacturing licenses per
month in 2008 as compared to 3 licenses both in 2009 and during the first eight months
of 2010. In addition, the OBFC issued an average of 59 work permits per month in 2008
and 70 work permits per month in 2009. Finally, a large number of import permits and
export visas are issued at the OBFC. A Strategic Plan for the OBFC was completed in
March 2009 and subsequently adopted by the PRC, OSS Steering Committee and
MTICM. An Action Plan was developed with the assistance on an international
consultant in May-July 2010.

 92.   PRSGC-3 supports incorporation of company registration into the OBFC.
The extension of OBFC services to include rebate certificates, residence and work
permits, and industrial licenses was a prior action for PRSC-2. The incorporation of
Companies’ registration to the OBFC was supported under the PRSGC-3. The
Companies’ Bill, currently being reviewed by Parliament will empower the Director of
the OBFC to perform the duties of the Registrar of Companies. These reforms are
                                                            
25
      However, the Dept of Trade’s preference is to maintain the old system.
26
      This needs to be gazette before it comes into effect.
                                                               39 
 
expected to reduce the time taken to register a business from 21 days to one day; reduce
the time taken to issue export and import permits from 7 days to one day, and consolidate
many procedures at the Trade and Investment Facilitation Centre (TIFC), including
incorporation of Companies Registration and introduction of streamlined licensing
procedures. As the Companies Bill is undergoing Parliamentary review, the prior action
for PRSGC-3 has been modified to submission of the Companies Bill to Parliament.

 93.    The PRSC operations sought to address the issue of land availability to facilitate
the entry of new investment – foreign and domestic. When the PRSC series started,
availability of land was identified as a critical constraint hampering FDI into Lesotho.
Several international investors were identified as waiting for availability of factory space
to invest in garment and non-garment manufacturing. Consequently identification of
industrial infrastructure sites and development of new factory space were identified as
indicative triggers for PRSC-2 and PRSGC-3 respectively.

 94.    The LNDC has completed feasibility studies for two industrial sites (one of
which is a new site and the other is an extension of an existing industrial estate to
accommodate more investors). Government undertook a feasibility study on the Maseru
Industrial Estate Traffic Relief Road to provide easy and safe movement of traffic in
Maseru West Industrial Estate during peak hours. It also undertook a study on the
development of vacant spaces at Maseru, Nyenye and Maputsoe to assist LNDC to
explore the possibility of securing commercial financing for the development of factory
buildings on the already serviced industrial estates. Significant progress in the provision
of advance infrastructure has been made at the Tikoe industrial estate. Seventeen sites
have been provided with utilities and roads and one factory shell has been completed.
Construction of Nyenye Fire Station (Leribe) funded by GOL has also been completed.
Construction of the Metolong Dam which will provide water to industrial users, amongst
other things, has started. Border post infrastructure refurbishment has been completed at
the Maseru border post to facilitate trade of goods across border. In February 2010 the
GoL provided LNDC with a long-term concessional loan amounting to Maloti 51 million
for construction of phase 1. The loan was intended for the construction of factory
buildings for 3 foreign investors wishing to commence production in the Tikoe and
Nyenye Industrial Estates. Pre-investment agreements have been signed with these
foreign investors and factory buildings are expected to be completed by the beginning of
2011. The three factory shells are expected to create 1,350 new job opportunities and
generate additional annual exports amounting to about M150 million.
                                            40 
 
 95.    The indicative trigger for PRSGC-3 was the development of 20,000 square
meters of new factory space. However the strategic importance of this issue has
declined because of the global financial crisis, and the passage of the land act which
removes some of the barriers to foreigner owning or leasing land in the country. The
fiscal crisis within GOL has also limited the ability to fund industrial infrastructure.
Nonetheless Government is financing the development of 9000 sq m and is looking for
additional resources from donors to finance the development of more. Given the changed
environment and the prudent decision of the Government to postpone spending from its
own budget, this is being dropped as a prior action for the current operation.



Statistical Strengthening

 96.    The PRSC series supported the strengthening of the statistical systems to
ensure that frequency and quality of data improves and can provide meaningful
information to policymakers. The BOS has taken important steps towards the
development of a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) based on
the Paris 21 Principles. The first phase of the process culminated in August 2008 with a
draft note (2008/9-2012/13) covering 10 key Ministries, Department and Agencies
(MDA) in the National Statistical System (NSS). This draft outlined the current situation
of the NSS in terms of operational strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats,
data demands and gaps, and capacities in statistical data production. The second phase
covering an additional 5 sectors was completed in October 2010. The outputs from both
phases fed into a draft NSDS. The Bank provided technical assistance in the process to
address some key concerns: (a) alignment of the NSDS production and dissemination
calendar for censuses, surveys, recurrent statistics and administrative data with the
information needs outlined in the PAF, NMES and the National Development Plan; and
(b) adoption of a data dissemination strategy and calendar, including for micro-data
survey and census files. The NSDS has been finalized and costed, and submitted to
Cabinet for approval to implement. In the meantime, BoS has already taken some steps to
address one key concern though facilitating the dissemination of data by releasing
information as per a calendar published on its website. In light of the progress on this
front, and in the interests of streamlining the operation, this is being dropped as a prior
action.



Component 4: Improving Access and Quality of Basic Services

 97.   Progress has been made in revitalizing the national Tuberculosis program,
and improving access to HIV testing, prevention and treatment. TB notification
remains high (640/100,000 in 2008), and the Treatment Success (TS) has improved from

                                            41 
 
72% in 2006 to 74% in 2008. The expansion of access to ART to the health centre level
in each district of the country has resulted in a significant increase in the rate at which
HIV-positive men, women and children have been enrolled on ART. The number of ART
sites country wide has increased tremendously from 68 sites in December 2006, to 190 in
2009 and 197 in December 2010. The proportion of people living with AIDS and in need
of ART who receive ARV treatment increased from 41 percent in December 2008 to 55
percent in December 2009, and further to 64 percent in December 2010. This is
commendable given that the Government changed the eligibility criterion for receiving
treatment from a CD4 count of 250 to CD4 count of 350, making more patients eligible
for treatment. With this increased momentum, Lesotho is well positioned to achieve its
Universal Access target of 80% coverage.27

 98.   GoL revised national guidelines in 2010/11 to bring them in line with WHO
recommendations. These guidelines recommend significant changes to improve
PMTCT, and the treatment for pregnant women. They also provide for improvements in
the enabling environment to help retain people on ART, for example by recommending
easy to take away mother-baby medicine packages. The new guidelines also increase
coverage by recommending that all HIV patients with TB be started on ART, and
advising that all patients with HIV be tested for TB. Work on an operational manual is
expected to start shortly, supported by the WHO. Teams from the MoSHW have been
going to districts to sensitize service providers about the new guidelines.

 99.    Monitoring and Evaluation systems are being strengthened. While Lesotho
has achieved a great deal of progress in many other aspects of its response to HIV,
improving the extent and the quality of strategic information that is required to plan and
implement effective and relevant interventions has not always kept pace. In 2008, an
assessment of the national M&E systems and structures was undertaken. The review has
informed a national plan of action to strengthen M&E capacities and systems. In 2009,
the Lesotho Output Monitoring System for HIV & AIDS (LOMSHA) was launched as an
integrated data collection and analysis tool for the entire multi-sectoral response to HIV.

100.    Progress in the area of human resources continues to be a challenge, but
 there have been some successes in the development and implementation of the
 Emergency Human Resources Plan. The main issues of concern continue to be
 Lesotho’s reliance on foreign workers to staff the health system, the impact of HIV on the
 health work force and continuing brain drain to South Africa and richer countries. With
no medical school and very low salaries in comparison with neighboring countries, any
Basotho who qualify in medicine outside the country rarely return to use their skills at
home. Eighty percent of the country’s 90 doctors are from abroad, mainly other African

countries, as are a large proportion of nurses. Initiatives to address these issues include
the expansion of the National Health Training College (NHTC) and opening of two
colleges for assistant nurses; signing of a deal with the Nigerian and Zimbabwe
governments to send Basotho students to study medicine in Nigerian Universities and the
University of Zimbabwe; and the building of a Health Sciences department at the
National University of Lesotho (NUL). In addition, the organizational structure of the
MOHSW was reviewed in order to improve efficiency. The decentralization process of
health services has been slow but is gradually taking shape—most of the District Health
Management Teams (DHMTs) have the core staff and are able to develop their
operational plans. The Ministry developed a Decentralization Strategic Plan in 2009. The
Strategic plan defines intergovernmental relationships between different levels and
different stakeholders, including the relationships with CHAL facilities during the
decentralization dispensation.

101.    The PRSC supports increased capacity to deliver ARV treatment so as to increase
 the number of eligible people getting treatment. The prior action for PRSGC-3 is that the
 number of ART sites across the country increases, so as to increase access.




    PRSGC-3 Prior Action: The number of sites providing ARV treatment increases so
    as to improve access




102.     Government has been making efforts to improve support to Orphans and
 Vulnerable Children (OVCs). Data from the 2006 population census indicated that
 there were an estimated 221,403 OVC in Lesotho during that year. For 68 percent of all
 OVC, HIV&AIDS was the major factor causing orphanhood and vulnerability. To meet
 the needs of this vulnerable section, an essential package of support is currently being
 delivered to OVC by the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) comprising food,
 financial support, shelter, referral for health care, material support including toiletries,
 school uniform and or shoes and assistive devices for the disabled. It is difficult to report
 improvement or lack thereof in this program, as data started being collected only in 2009
 and figures for 2010 are not available. OVCs also receive support through education
 bursaries, as part of the Education Sector Plan supported by the PRSC operation. The
 number of beneficiaries under this scheme more than doubled from 19,418 in 2008/09 to
 40,299 in 2009/10. The Government is also piloting a financial assistance program.
 Currently financial assistance to OVCs is being provided in the form of public assistance




                                              43 
 
(PA) by GoL and as Child Grants (CGP) with EU/UNICEF support. This program is still
in its infancy with barely 2.3 percent of OVCs receiving support in 2009/2010.28

103.     PRSGC-3 supports the Government in obtaining baseline information to
 guide its policies and programs. The Government lacks baseline information on the
 numbers and geographical distribution of OVCs. It relies mainly on data from small scale
 surveys conducted by donors, NGOs and civil society. Given the potentially large fiscal
 implications, the Government is correctly focusing on first coming up with an appropriate
 definition of OVCs and their registration to ensure proper targeting, as a prerequisite to
 scaling up support programs. The PRSC supports the Government’s exercise to complete
 nationwide registration of OVCs. Going forward, it will be important for the Government
 to undertake a comprehensive review of safety nets policies and programs to look at their
 targeting, implementation and sustainability.


        PRSGC- 3 Prior Actions: Nationwide registration of OVCs completed.



104.     The Government has developed a medium term update of the Education
 Sector Strategic Plan, covering the period 2009-2012. This plan includes detailed
 costing for the planned development of the sector. This update of the ESSP has been
 appraised and the components associated to basic education endorsed by the development
 partners active in the sector. Most of the policy reforms included in the medium term
 revision of the ESSP, the Lesotho Medium Term Education Sector Plan (MTESP) 2009-
 2012 have been incorporated in the new education bill and the Plan is under
 implementation. In the particular case of secondary education, these reforms include: (i)
 expansion of secondary education through the construction of three new schools and the
 expansion of infrastructure in existing schools; (ii) recruitment of additional teachers and
 better teacher distribution, and strengthening of inspection; (iii) improved distribution of
 textbooks; and (iv) rationalization of school fees and awarding of bursaries to OVCs.

105.     A World Bank project is on-going to supervise the grant from the FTI through its
 catalytic trust fund and the additional grant from the Government of Ireland. The project
 is expected to run for three years, and will support the construction and refurbishment of
 new classrooms, along with a supporting set of interventions to improve the overall
 quality of teaching and learning in basic education.

106.  The PRSC supports access to secondary education over the PRSC series.
Secondary education enrollment has been growing slowly, although steadily. The pattern

however shows that capacity is limited and drop out is high as students move up in
secondary education. Extension of existing infrastructure to accommodate additional
entrants at the secondary school level was recognized as a prior action for PRSC-1.
Preparation of a three year costed plan for the education sector aimed at improving
quality and increasing access to secondary schools is a prior action for PRSC-2. The
trigger for PRSGC-3 was implementation of the lower secondary education components
of the costed sector plan. The implementation of the plan is however being supported by
the on-going operation on strengthening basic education, and this is therefore being
dropped as a prior action.



Box 2: The Proposed PRSGC and Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The proposed PRSGC supports implementation of Lesotho’s development program as laid out in its
Interim National Development Framework (INDF) and the medium term program. The GOL has
also prepared a Growth Strategy which lays down short and medium term approaches to achieve
broad-based, sustainable growth as set out in the Vision 2020. It has prepared a PAF, which
provides a basis for monitoring the program of overall budget support. The PAF consists of a
number of relevant, monitorable, time-bound, and realistic targets related to priority policy
objectives. Prior actions to be supported by PRSGC3 have been selected from the PAF.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a
coordinated accountability framework

All missions have been held jointly and joint aide memoires have been prepared and agreed with the
Government. The broad principles of budget support were identified in the May 2006 Joint Budget
Support Aide Memoire. It was agreed that reviews will be carried out jointly in October/November
each year, to fit in with the Government’s budget preparation timeline. The first joint review was
carried out in October 2008 the second joint review in November 2009, and a third in November
2010. Disbursements of budgetary support are based on a positive outcome of this review.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to
country circumstances

The joint budget support review is aligned to the country’s budget cycle and is held in
October/November each year. Disbursements are expected to be made for the following budget year
starting in April.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

One of the principles of the joint budget support is that the PAF should consist of a few monitorable
and realistic indicators. The prior actions for the proposed PRSGC represent only those actions that
will be critical for achieving the program’s project development objectives.


                                                45 
 
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
based financial support

In order to improve predictability of budgetary support from donors, the JBS framework requires
donors to indicate levels of budgetary support that they are planning to disburse well in advance of
the start of the fiscal year, such that the amounts can be included in the Budget submitted to
Parliament. At the annual PAF review in November 2010, all the JBS donors in Lesotho indicated to
the Government how much they are planning to disburse in the following fiscal year. Government
has used this information during the budget preparation process.




                          VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                           A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

107.     A rigorous analysis of the poverty and social impacts of the reforms
 supported by the operation is precluded by a lack of reliable recent information. The
 analytical underpinnings of the program derive from a Country Integrated Poverty, Social
 and Gender Assessment (2010) which relied on survey information from 2002/03. The
 Bureau of Statistics conducted a new household survey in 2010/11, the results of which
 should help inform future operations when they become available. The implementation of
 the NSDS, supported by this PRSC series, will also help improve data ability.

108.    The poverty and social impacts of the reforms supported by the operation
 are expected to be favorable overall. The PRSGC is expected to facilitate poverty
 reduction through three primary channels. The first is by assisting the Government to
 maintain a growth-conducive macroeconomic and business environment, which will
 provide the necessary growth for poverty reduction and wealth creation. The second is
 through its continued support to improving public sector management processes,
 enhancing the Government’s ability to direct its scarce resources to high-impact
 expenditure programs designed to reduce poverty. The third is by contributing to better
 service delivery, particularly to the most vulnerable sections of society: people affected
 by HIV/AIDS and orphans and vulnerable children.

109.     The impact of fiscal consolidation supported by the program on the poor is
 likely to be small. As noted earlier, fiscal consolidation is targeted at eliminating easily
 identified, unproductive expenditures which are unlikely to impact the poor. In addition,
 GoL has committed to a floor on social spending on the school feeding program, old age
 pensions and HIV/AIDS to continue to provide support for vulnerable Basotho.




                                               46 
 
                            B.             IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

110.     The institutional arrangements for the implementation of the operation fall
 within the framework of the Joint Budget Support (JBS) structure. The proposed
 arrangements seek to ensure oversight and buy in at the political level. A dedicated team
 of officials from the National Monitoring and Evaluation System (NMES) housed in the
 MFDP, will monitor progress in implementation of the overall budget support program.
 This team acts as the Secretariat for JBS implementation and monitoring. At the
 Ministerial level, dedicated teams of relevant officials responsible for implementation
 and monitoring of activities29 will monitor implementation of PAF activities and collect
data to verify achievement of PAF indicators and report to the Secretariat. The JBS
Secretariat is headed by the NMES and will report, on a quarterly basis, to the
Improvement and Reform Steering Committee (IRSC). Representatives of the DPs are
members of the IRSC, ensuring that they are also aware of the progress being made in
implementation in between the annual joint reviews. The Chairperson of the IRSC will,
in turn, report, through Minister, MFDP, to the Budget Committee. The PAF progress
report will be submitted by the Principal Secretary, MFDP to the Committee of Principal
Secretaries as they are responsible for delivering on these indicators. This will be the
 forum for initial discussions towards the required remedial actions where problems exist.
 The Principal Secretary, MFDP, will also pursue these discussions bilaterally with
 affected Ministries/Agencies for implementation of the required actions. Briefings to
 development partners envisaging budget support will be provided at regular intervals.

111.   The PAF will be the basis for monitoring and evaluation of the program. An
annual progress report submitted by end-August of each year will be followed by a joint
annual review of progress, based on the PAF, to analyze progress towards agreed triggers
and targets. The main objective of this review is to come to a joint view on performance,
which will serve as the basis for commitments for the following financial year.


 

                                                               C.   FIDUCIARY ASPECTS


Public Financial Management System

112.    Lesotho’s fiduciary framework is adequate overall to receive the proceeds of the
 Grant and Credit, particularly in light of the adoption of a comprehensive PFM reform
 program and the implementation progress made. Implementation of the PFM reform

                                                                        47 
 
program is currently being supported by the EU, and Ireland. The support will be
deepened under the auspices of the JBS.

113.     An assessment of PFM based on the PFM Performance Measurement Framework
 (PMF) has been conducted jointly by the Government and its key DPs in 2009 and a
 report has been prepared. The assessment notes that although longstanding weaknesses
 in budget execution, the internal control framework and financial reporting identified in
 the previous assessment continue, progress is clearly being made. The assessment also
 notes that there are many built-in features of the new system that are designed to address
 problems in the areas of expenditure commitments, authorization of expenditure and
 reconciliation of accounts30.

114.     Progress has been made in a number of areas, including deepening of the MTEF,
 drafting of the Public Financial Management and Accountability Bill, launching of
 IFMIS, preparation of outstanding public accounts up to 2007/08, auditing of public
 accounts and adoption of new procurement regulations. The PRSGC will support
 continued implementation of reforms.

115.     The IMF updated their 2003 safeguards assessment in December 2010 and
 reported an improved reporting and investment framework, but concluded that risks have
 emerged in external audit, vault operations and that a lack of adequate controls over the
 monetary data reporting remains a significant safeguard concern. Furthermore, internal
 audit remains at a developments stage and would, inter alia, need a robust monitoring
 framework to become fully effective. However, previous weaknesses in controls over the
 foreign reserves area appear to have been addressed and no evidence of impaired
 independence from government has been found. The CBL has acted on these findings.
 The safeguards proposed under disbursements are adequate for the operation.

                                                 D.            DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

116.     Upon effectiveness, expected in June 2011, two single tranches, one each for the
 Grant and Credit, together totaling SDR 11.2 million (US$18 million equivalent) will be
 disbursed to the Government of Lesotho. The PRSGC-3 will follow the Bank’s
 disbursement procedures for Development Policy Lending. In particular, the Credit and
 Grant proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the development
 policy program and not tied to any specific purchases and no procurement requirements
 will be needed.



                                                            
30
  The Assessment does not take into account the possible improvements that may be achieved as a result 
of the recent introduction of the integrated financial management and information system. 

                                                                       48 
 
117.     Upon receipt of separate withdrawal applications for the Grant and Credit from
 the Government, IDA will disburse the Grant and Credit proceeds to a United States
 Dollar denominated account maintained by the Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) and
 forming part of the official foreign exchange reserves of Lesotho. Within two business
 days, the CBL will credit the loti equivalent of the Grants and Credit proceeds to the
 consolidated account maintained on behalf of the Government of Lesotho for budget
 execution. The Accountant General will be notified accordingly. The CBL will not
 impose any charges or commissions on the Government for these transactions. The
 conversion from United States Dollars to loti will be based on the prevailing exchange
 rate on the date that the funds are credited to the consolidated account. The Government,
 through the MFDP will – (i) provide a written confirmation to the Bank within 30 days,
 that an amount equivalent to the Grant and Credit from the Bank has been credited to the
 consolidated account, with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (ii) provide
 evidence that the loti equivalent of the Grant and Credit was recorded as financing for
 Government budget; and (iii) ensure that the loti equivalent of the Grant and Credit is
 subject to controls to ensure its use for eligible budgeted public expenditures only. The
 administration of this Grant and Credit shall be the responsibility of MFDP. The closing
 date for the operation is January 15, 2012.

118.    Auditing: The budgeted public expenditure partially financed by the loti
 equivalent of the Credit and Grant is subject to external audit by the Auditor-general
 under the normal auditing arrangements applicable to the Government. The Association
 will have access to these audit reports.



                           E.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

119.     The proposed operation is not likely to have any significant positive or
 negative effects on the bio-physical environment. The prior actions supported by the
 PRSGC will not have a direct effect on the environment, forests and other natural
 resources. Improvements in the business climate are however likely to lead to increased
 business activity, some of which may have potentially negative effects on the
 environment, such as those involved in industrial production. In addition, the proposed
 trade facilitation measures which are intended to contribute to job creation in export
 sectors, in particular the textile industry, could pose additional challenges for the
 management of industrial pollution. Appropriate environmental and social safeguards
 instruments will need to be prepared for each project.

120.      The country’s regulatory systems and environmental legislation is adequate,
 with suitable legislation on environmental impact assessments (EIA) and corresponding
 institutions. The Environment Act 2001 has a number of sections specifically pertaining
 to Environmental Assessment (EA), and requires submission of EAs and Environment
                                            49 
 
and Social Impact Assessment to the Authority, currently the National Environment
Secretariat (NES). According to the Environmental Impact Assessment Licensing
Procedure (Lesotho Environment Authority (LEA), 2003) the following steps should be
followed by all Implementing Agencies (IAs). The EIA process starts with the pre-
application discussions with the National Environment Secretariat (NES) to establish a
common understanding at the beginning of the project. These discussions also entail
procedures to follow; necessary permits; agreeing potential consultant(s) to assist the IAs
and, stipulating the Public Participation Process - where applicable. If a license is not
obtained on the basis of the Project Brief, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS -- the
report of the EIA) must be submitted. The EIS is reviewed and assessed by NES. Based
on the EIS and other relevant data, NES will issue an Environmental Impact Assessment
review report. The review report provides an evaluation of the Statement and its
compliance with the Lesotho Environment Act and Standards and donors as appropriate.
A set of conditions will be outlined and discussed with the IA/developer before the
Environmental Impact Assessment License is issued. A record of decision will be issued
by NES, stating the conclusions of the Environmental Impact Review Process. The
Record of Decision will usually be accompanied by the Environmental Impact
Assessment review report and a set of conditions that the project has to comply with.
When the Implementing Agency (IA) through the Contractor` fails to implement the
mitigation measures or fails to follow the outlined procedures as in Environmental Impact
Assessment Licensing Procedure (Lesotho Environment Authority (LEA), 2003), NES
shall suspend the project and notify the IA. If the IA fails or refuses to effect mitigation
measures or to follow the procedures, NES may terminate the contract and seek remedies
as stipulated in the contract document.



                             F.      RISKS AND MITIGATION

121.    Macro-fiscal instability. A slower than expected regional and global economic
 recovery would dampen demand for exports, reduce foreign direct investment, and keep
 SACU revenues low. This would put enormous pressure on what already is a tough fiscal
 adjustment process, undermine fiscal sustainability and/or jeopardize necessary social
 and capital expenditure. Government deposits accumulated at the Central Bank during
 the years of SACU revenue boom provide some cushion from shocks. Predictable and
 timely budget support, backed by analytical support and policy dialogue through the
 PRSC series and from other development partners, including the IMF, to aid GoL’s
 ongoing medium-term fiscal consolidation program, will also help mitigate the risks.

122.    Policy slippages. The Government’s reform program is centered around ensuring
fiscal consolidation through expenditure control, structural reforms to boost economic
 growth in the medium term and improving service delivery of key services. The run-up to
                                            50 
 
local elections in 2011 and the National Assembly elections in 2012 will test political will
to push through necessary reforms and push forward the ambitious fiscal consolidation
program. This risk is being mitigated in two ways. One, by strengthening the hands of the
reform champions through the PRSC and more broadly the joint budget support
framework. Two, through conducting reviews of the harmonized Performance
Assessment Framework of development partners providing budget support which also
bring in civil society and key stakeholders to monitor progress, strengthen accountability,
and highlight the importance of continued reform momentum.

123.    Capacity risks. Weak institutional and implementation capacity across the
 Government is another source of risk to the program. Inadequate capacity slows the
 reform process, leads to low utilization of available resources and poor service delivery.
 To mitigate this risk, the Bank is supporting government capacity building in public
 sector management and public expenditure management through two on-going ESWs.
 Capacity building initiatives are also underway with support from other Development
 Partners    in      the     reform      of     financial     accountability     protocols.

    A sustained increase in economic growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction over the medium term. To achieve this, the Government seeks to maintain a stable macroeconomic
    environment; formulate a National Development Plan (with more explicit consideration of growth); create an improved enabling environment for private business and provide good
    infrastructure, including specific measures to accommodate increases in industrial investments.

The achievement of effective policy implementation in the pursuit of growth and poverty reduction requires a continuing process of improvement in the effectiveness of government institutions at
all levels and increasing responsiveness to citizens’ needs. In the coming period, a key focus in the pursuit of the goal of improved government performance is a series of actions to strengthen
public financial management. Government is also implementing a strategy to strengthen representative local government. Institutions are also being developed to combat corruption.
Government is also developing a strategy for civil service reform.

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under ECF Arrangement for the Kingdom of Lesotho and 
Approves Disbursement of US$9 Million 

Press Release No. 11/115 
April 4, 2011  

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the first review of the 
Kingdom of Lesotho's economic performance under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement1. 
The Board's decision, which was taken on a lapse of time basis, enables the authorities to draw an 
additional SDR 5.68 million (US$9 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to an 
amount equivalent to SDR 13.5 million (US$21.4 million).2 

The ECF‐supported program, adopted against the backdrop of a sharp fall in revenues from the Southern 
African Customs Union, is on track. Lesotho met all of its quantitative performance criteria except for 
the performance criterion on stock of net international reserves of the Central Bank of Lesotho that was 
not observed by a small margin. Structural reforms are also progressing. Ongoing successful program 
implementation will help strengthen Lesotho’s resilience to external shocks and foster economic growth 
and poverty reduction. 

The three‐year SDR 41.9 million (about US$61.4 million) ECF arrangement for Lesotho was approved by 
the IMF’s Executive Board on June 2, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/224). Lesotho joined the Fund in 
July 1968. 
 

                                                                                                          
1
  The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as 
the Fund’s main tool for medium‐term financial support to low‐income countries by providing a higher 
level of access to financing, more concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in program design features, 
and more focused streamlined conditionality. Financing under the ECF carries a zero interest rate, with a 
grace period of 5½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years 
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/ecf.htm). The Fund reviews the level of interest rates for all 
concessional facilities every two years.2 The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time 
procedure when it is agreed by the Board that a proposal can be considered without convening formal 
discussions.
