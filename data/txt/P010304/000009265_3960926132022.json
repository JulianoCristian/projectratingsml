It seeks to (a) increase agricultural\n            production; (b) provide a more equitable irrigation water\n            supply to farmers; and (c) strengthen the capabilities of\n            the Provincial Irrigation Departments' (PIDs) operation\n            and maintenance to improve efficiency in systems operation,\n            and ensure adequate maintenance of installed facilities.  To\n            that end, the project provides for rehabilitating designated\n            surface irrigation and surface drainage systems that have\n            deteriorated because of deferred maintenance.  It also\n            provides for required equipment and related facilities, as\n            well as technical assistance, training, project supervision\n            and administration."}, "docdt": "1988-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
