The project achieved some of its objectives,\n            its impact on institutional development was partially\n            successful, sustainability is uncertain at this time, and\n            both the Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, sustaining\n            Pakistan's irrigation systems requires developing\n            beneficiary-oriented, autonomous, commercially-oriented\n            public utilities in tandem with more positive participatory\n            management by beneficiaries. Second, delay in project\n            start-up (15 months from board to effectiveness) was due to\n            delay in ECNEC and USAID approval. Both the Government and\n            co-financier should have expedited the procedure to avoid\n            delays. Third, it is impossible to estimate the benefits of\n            irrigation and drainage development without carrying out\n            agro-economic monitoring and evaluation. Finally, there\n            still remains much to be improved in the technical ability\n            of small contractors."}, "docdt": "1996-09-13T00:00:00Z"}
