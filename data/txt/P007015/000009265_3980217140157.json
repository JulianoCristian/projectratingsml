The project consists of three components. First,\n            provincial subprojects will include: a) essential health\n            care interventions; b) developing new health care\n            organization, financing and developing managerial models to\n            create provincial integrated delivery systems; c)\n            institutional strengthening to reorganize and enhance the\n            capacity of health facilities; and d) training and\n            continuing education of health personnel. Second, the policy\n            development studies component will finance workshops and\n            study tours to assess the feasibility of additional policy\n            and institutional reforms. Third, the project administration\n            component will finance the administrative and operating\n            costs of the Project Coordination Unit."}, "docdt": "1997-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
