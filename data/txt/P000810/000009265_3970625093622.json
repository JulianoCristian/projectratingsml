The project's main objectives were to: (a) to\n            provide an essential service to the people Of Greater Banjul\n            Area (GBA) by increasing water supplies in areas of\n            suppressed demand and expanding the public water supply\n            system; (b) to provide improved water supply service in\n            seven provincial urban centers by rehabilitation and limited\n            expansion of the existing systems; (c) to reduce line losses\n            through the reinforcement and rehabilitation of the\n            electricity distribution system in Greater Banjul; and (d)\n            to assist Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC) in achieving\n            financial viability through improved operational efficiency\n            and financial management by implementing adequate tariff\n            increases for water and electricity, designing and\n            implementing a system of human resources management which\n            included training, and providing working capital support to\n            GUC for the purchase of about a nine month supply of diesel\n            fuel. Bank performance is rated deficient. Borrower\n            performance is rated deficient. The projects' outcome\n            is rated highly unsatisfactory. The following reflect the\n            lessons learned: (1) the Bank should be more decisive in\n            enforcing compliance with covenants. Constant use of threat\n            without follow through action does not produce the desired\n            results. The Bank should not hesitate to suspend a project\n            for non compliance with covenants and it should be willing\n            to cancel a project when it deems that any altemative will\n            not resolve the problem; (2) measures to improve\n            institutional and financial performance have to be initiated\n            up-front and have a more comprehensive approach, i.e.\n            include monitoring indicators for example, than what was\n            included in the project; (3) projects should be presented to\n            the Board only when preparation is sufficiently advanced\n            with detailed engineering for the first phase completed, and\n            not to meet lending targets; (4) a genuine and continuous\n            commitment from Government to a carefully analyzed and\n            planned program is a prerequisite for International\n            Development Association (IDA) support and IDA should not\n            hesitate to suspend or cancel a credit if the Government is\n            not sufficiently committed to the objectives of the project;\n            (5) the maximum time allowed for credit effectiveness should\n            not exceed 12 months; (6) project financing should be\n            secured and finalized before appraisal and contracts awarded\n            in good time to avoid delays; (7) in management leasing\n            contracts the necessity of an adequate institutional\n            framework, a carefully designed incentive environment, an\n            effective regulatory capacity plus the participation of not\n            only the Government and the utility but also its staff and\n            customers are key."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
