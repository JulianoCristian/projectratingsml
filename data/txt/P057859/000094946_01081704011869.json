North Coast mainland, and the offshore Bay Islands of\n            Honduras, through a participatory process, by strengthening\n            local, and municipal capacity to manage, and benefit from\n            coastal tourism. The components will: 1) formulate, and\n            promote a participatory approach to policy dialogue, with\n            public, and private stakeholders at the national, regional,\n            and local levels, through workshops to formulate strategic\n            tourism in the area, develop community participation, and\n            institutional arrangements. A major land titling diagnostic\n            on indigenous communities of the North Coast, should\n            recommend actions to formalize recognition of indigenous\n            land rights, as well as satisfactory conflict resolution.\n            Technical assistance will be provided to promote, and\n            implement policy reforms, legal and regulatory frameworks,\n            and, improve institutional arrangements. This includes\n            tourism audits, legal, and technical aspects related to\n            titling of communal land, as well as campaigns focused on\n            HIV/AIDS prevention, and control; 2) develop the capacity of\n            coastal municipalities, which includes the private sector,\n            and community based organizations, through skills training\n            in environmental management, tourism management, and\n            entrepreneurship. In addition, a cultural tourism site will\n            be restored at the historic center of Trujillo; 3) design,\n            and deliver micro, and small business enterprise training to\n            stimulate productive capacity, and create business\n            opportunities, i.e., handicrafts, tour operations, and\n            adventures travel, and, 4) support project management,\n            financial management, procurement, and reporting systems."}, "docdt": "2001-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
