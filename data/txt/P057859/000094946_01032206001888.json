populations, as a\n            result of the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project\n            implementation. It identifies the beneficiaries, and\n            stakeholders, to determine possible negative impacts on\n            their activities, and to minimize the social constraints\n            thereof. Ethnic representation revealed a larger percentage\n            of mestizo population, with only a thirty percent indigenous\n            population; however, it also revealed strong ties among\n            indigenous populations in the protected areas, between the\n            control of natural resources, and their cultural heritage.\n            Further review analyzed education, and health aspects, land\n            ownership, labor trends, and land uses. Measures to minimize\n            social adversity include: 1) interagency coordination to\n            identify property titles, and settle land\n            conflicts/disputes, with the support of the National\n            Property Registration Institute, Municipalities, non\n            governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Ministry of\n            Tourism; 2) continued inter-cultural process of bilingual\n            education, with the technical, and financial support of the\n            Ministry of Education, including teacher training provision,\n            and enhanced parental awareness; 3) coordination with the\n            Ministry of Health, ethnic organizations, NGOs, and\n            municipalities, to foster HIV/AIDS prevention, by\n            researching migration patterns, and sexual behavior (within\n            cultural parameters); and, 4) technical training for the\n            development, and quality control of native, or indigenous\n            products, and crafts, to diversify, and increase income\n            earnings capacity."}, "docdt": "2000-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
