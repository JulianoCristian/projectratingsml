highly satisfactory, the sustainability was highly\n            likely, the institutional development impact was high, the\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Following are some of\n            the lessons learned: In the process of building ownership\n            for sustainable coastal tourism, it is important to\n            integrate both short- and long-term incentives. The\n            potential of tourism income from larger-scale investments in\n            the Caribbean is very attractive, but it can conflict with\n            smaller-scale, community-based tourism and the interests of\n            local communities. Honduras has increased its numbers of\n            visitors, but it still remains in fourth place in terms of\n            number of tourism arrivals in Central America. Future\n            projects will need to continue overall strengthening of the\n            human resource capacity in the municipalities in Honduras.\n            The integration of a cultural heritage revitalization\n            component in a tourism project can have a multiplier effect\n            on other initiatives in a community. It is important to\n            assess the implementation capacity of the government agency\n            to implement these types of funds, as well as consider\n            contracting fund management out to third parties. In the\n            first call for proposals, many potential beneficiaries\n            lacked complete business plans. A strong social\n            communications campaign is needed when launching this type\n            of fund."}, "docdt": "2006-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
