 IEGWBMission: Enhancing development effectivenessthrough excellenceand independence inevaluation.


About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroupassesses the programs and activitiesof the World Bankfor two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verifythat the Bank's work is producingthe
expected results, and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies,and procedures throughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As partof this work, IEGWBannuallyassesses about 25 percentof
the Bank's lendingoperations through field work. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those
that are innovative,large, or complex;those that are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations;those for
which ExecutiveDirectors or Bank managementhaverequestedassessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To preparea ProjectPerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examine projectfiles and other
documents, interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowingcountryto discuss the operationwith the government,
and other in-countrystakeholders,and interview Bankstaff and other donor agencystaff both at headquartersand
in localoffices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and managementapproval.Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe commentsas
relevant. The completedPPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers' comments are attachedto
the document that is sent to the Bank's Boardof Executive Directors.After an assessmentreport has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


About the IEGWBRating System
       IEGWB's useof multipleevaluationmethodsoffers both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibilityto adapt to
lendinginstrument,project design, or sectoralapproach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basicmethod to
arrive at their project ratings. Followingis the definitionand ratingscale usedfor each evaluationcriterion
(additionalinformationis availableon the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extentto whichthe operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expectedto
be achieved, efficiently.The rating has threedimensions: relevance. efficacy, and efficiency.Relevanceincludes
relevance of objectivesand relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectivesis the extentto which the project's
objectivesare consistentwith the country's current development prioritiesand with current Bank countryand
sectoralassistancestrategiesand corporategoals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers,Country
AssistanceStrategies,Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevanceof designis the extent to which
the project's design is consistentwith the statedobjectives. Efficacyis the extent towhich the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved, taking intoaccount their relative importance.Efficiencyis the
extent to which the projectachieved, or is expected to achieve, a returnhigherthan the opportunitycost of capital
and benefitsat least cost compared to alternatives.The efficiencydimension generally is not appliedto adjustment
operations. Possibleratingsfor Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to Development Outcome: The risk,at the time of evaluation, that developmentoutcomes (or
expected outcomes)will not be maintained(or realized). Possibleratingsfor Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: High
Significant,Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensuredquality at entry of the
operation and supportedeffectiveimplementationthrough appropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequate
transitionarrangements for regular operationof supported activitiesafter loankredit closing, toward the
achievement of developmentoutcomes. The ratinghas two dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possibleratingsfor Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       BorrowerPerformance: The extent to whichthe borrower (includingthe governmentand implementing
agency or agencies) ensuredquality of preparationand implementation, and compliedwith covenantsand
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performanceand implementingagency(ies)performance.Possibleratingsfor Borrower Performance: Highly

    Preface

    This i s the Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) preparedbythe Independent
    EvaluationGroup (IEG) for three projects inMali: The National Agricultural Research
   Project (NARP),the Agricultural Trading and ProcessingPromotion Pilot Project
    (ATPPP), and the Pilot PrivateIrrigationPromotion Project (PPP).

    TheNARPwas approvedinFY94 for acredit ofUS$20.0 million. Other donors, mainly
   USAIDandDutchCooperation, promised independentparallel financing ofUS$68.1
   million. At closing on scheduleinDecember2001, total project costs were US$57.2
   million comparedwith the appraisal estimateofUS$111.7 million. Only US$19.2
   million, or 28 percent, of the anticipateddonor parallel financing was provided.

    The ATPPP project was approvedinFY95 for acredit o fUS$6.0 million. At completion,
    one year and 9 months behindscheduleinDecember2002, total costs were US$5.1
   million, 74 percent ofthe appraisal estimateo fUS$6.9 million. Cofinancing was US$O.l
   million. Unanticipatedfunds for technical assistince from Japan andCanadawere
    channeledthrough the project after its start.

    ThePPIP was approvedinFY97 for acredit ofUS$4.2 million from anInterimIDA
    Trust Fund. At completion, 9 monthsbehind schedule inMarch2003, total costswere
 -- US$2.4 million, 52 percent of the appraisal estimateo fUS$4.7 million. US$2.0 million
    were cancelled.

    This report is basedon the ImplementationCompletion Reports (ICRs) preparedbythe
    Afiica Region, the Credit Agreements, StaffAppraisal Reports, project documents and
    files, anddiscussionswith Bank staff and other stakeholders, includingthe Government
    o fMali, project implementingagencies, donors, the private sector, NGOs, and
   beneficiaries.An IEGmission visited Mali inOctober 2006. The cooperation and
    assistanceofcentral government andregionalofficials and staff, non-governmental
    stakeholders, donors, and other interestedparties are gratefully acknowledged.

    These projects were selectedfor aPPARbecauseo ftheir support for complementary
    aspects ofagricultural developmentinMali, becauseo ftheir innovative approachesto
   assistingthe government's policyof disengagingfrom the provisiono fservices and
    forging a strongpartnership withthe private sector, andbecauseo f some disagreements
'  with the Africa Region about the initialratings o fthe three projects. The timing ofthe
   PPAR was opportune since the Governmentis about to issue its new Poverty Reduction
    StrategyPaper andIEGis preparinga Country Assistance Evaluation for Mali. The
   PPAR was also to answer somequestionsraisedinthe ICR Reviews such as why private
   sector activity didnot develop as anticipated, andwhy committed donor financing didnot
   materialize eventhough all donorsinvolved inthe designhad agreedto coordinate and
   consolidatetheir financing.

   Following standardIEGprocedures, the draft o fthis PPARwas sent to theborrower for
   commentsbefore it was finalized. Inaccordancewith the Bank's disclosure policy, the

                                                 X



final report will be available to the public following submission to the World Bank's
Boardo f ExecutiveDirectors.

Summary

1.      With aper capita income ofUS$300in2004, Mali is one o fthe world's poorest
countries. The rural sector dominates Mali's economy and social structure -accounting
for about 80 percent of the country's populationo f 13.5 million and engaging about 70
percent o fthe country's labor force. Poverty inMali i s primarily a ruralphenomenon,
with more than70 percent o f the ruralpopulationbeingpoor. Fightingpovertymeans
providingeconomic opportunities to ruraldwellers to improve their incomes and
livelihoods.

2.      The Government o fMali and the World Bank concur that agricultural
development -from productionto marketing-is an essential ingredient o f the overall
rural development effort. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for the period2004-
2006 incorporates the recommendations o f Mali's 2002 PRSP, which inturn reflect the
aspirations o f Government's Master Plan for Rural Development. The Government's
2007-201 1PRSP, which is about to be approvedby the Council o fMinisters, emphasizes
the important role that the modernizationo f agricultural production and supply chains
playinaccelerating economic growth andpoverty reduction.

3.      The NationalAgriculturalResearchProject(NAFW),which was approved in
December 1993, was the largest o fthe three projects reviewed inthis PPAR with a total
cost o fUS$57.2 million at completion. Its objective was to improve the performance o f
the NationalAgricultural Research System (NARS) through institutional andprocedural
reforms and through implementing the guidingprinciples to revitalize researchthat had
beenissued bythe Special Program for African Agricultural Research (SPAAR). The
project representedthe implementationofthe first six-year phase o fMali's Strategic Plan
for NationalAgricultural Research (SPNAR), which aimedto ensure that adequate
technology would become available to farmers inorder to increase agricultural growth
and reverse the decline inthe productive capacity o f the naturalresource base.

4.      The AgriculturalTradingand ProcessingPromotionPilotProject(ATPPP),
which was approved inJune 1995, andthe PilotPrivateIrrigationPromotionProject
(PPIP),which was approved inMay 1997, were pilot projects o famuchsmaller size.
Bothprojects aimed, intheir respective subsectors, to assist the Government in
implementing its policies of (a) disengagingfrom the provision o f services, (b) forging a
new andstrongpublic-privatepartnership, (c) providingthe basic enabling environment
for the development o fprivate sector-led agricultural development, and (d) encouraging
agriculturaldiversification. Bothwere implementedbythe Agricultural Supply Chain
PromotionAgency (APROFA) -an agency created initially under the tutelage o fthe
Permanent Assembly o fMalian Chambers ofAgriculture (APCAM) to implement the
ATPPP, andlater entrusted bythe Government to implementthe PPlP against the Bank's
wishes. The total costs at completionwere US$5.1 million andUS$2.4 million,
respectively, for ATPPP and PPIP, andthe closing dates for the two projectswere
extendedby 21months and 9 months, respectively.

5.      This PPARrates the overall outcome o fNARP as satisfactory,based upon its
substantial relevance, efficacy,andefficiency. The project achievedits immediate

                                                 xii


  objective o f abetterperforming national agriculturalresearch system through
  institutional andprocedural reforms that have improvedresearch coherence, quality,
  relevance and accountability for results. These include separating programming,
  coordination, funding and oversight functions from research implementation, and
  restructuring the NationalAgricultural Research Council (CNRA) and the Institute of
  Rural Economy (IER) -the principal implementer o f agriculturalresearch inMali
  which is now fully autonomous interms of financial and administrative management. Its
  personnel are now better paidand more motivatedthanbefore, and its researchers can
  now plan, budget, and monitor their programs.

  6.      The PPARrates the overall outcome o fATPPP as moderately satisfactory, in
  spite o f a numberof accomplishments, due to deficiencies inthe preparationand design
  o f the project. The ATPPP has had a markedimpact on private sector development since
  it contributedsignificantly to increasing the volumes ofmarketedproductionto both
  internal and external markets. The ATPPP putthe focus on the production-to-marketing
  chain with an accent on diversifying production, processing andmarketing through
  private sector partnerships, thereby breakingthe traditional state-centered agricultural
  model, fosteringprivate sector development, andpromoting the commercialization o f a
  more diversified agriculturalproduction. It enabled Mali to see its potential for
  competingoninternational markets andencouraged the transition from subsistence
  farming and artisanal ago-processingto a more professional practice. Producers and
  traders had to form andregroup, andto work ina professional manner inorder to benefit
-.fromATPPP's activities.

  7.      The PPARrates overall outcome o fPPIPas highly unsatisfactory. The project
  resulted inonly 10ha o f irrigatedlandbeingrehabilitatedand no new investments in
  small-scale irrigation schemes, compared with the expectation that the project's technical
  assistance efforts would induce on-farm investments leading to the rehabilitationo f 400
  hao firrigatedlandandthe establishment o f600 ha o fnewly irrigated land. This
  unsatisfactory outcome was mainly causedbythe unwillingnesso f financial institutions
  to finance small-scale irrigation, andbythe non-conclusive testing o fnew irrigation and
  crop husbandry technologies. No low-cost technology capable o f increasingthe income
  o f small-scale irrigation farmers was validated.

  8.      Several lessons ofboth a substantive andproceduralnature have emerged from
  this review:

  (1)   Meeting the challenge of pro-poor agricultural growth requires addressinga
        number of institutional constraintsthat farmers inMaliface in relation to
        ruralfinance, landtitling, and the provision of public services such as
        wholesale market facilities. The needfor potentialbeneficiariesto have greater
        access to credit inorder to magnify the scale ofproject benefits was a common
        denominator inall three projects. More secure landtitles (which are not customary
        to have inMali's landtenure system) are also aprerequisite for manyfanners to
        invest intheir land. And the Government should not disengage from providing
        public services such as the constructionhehabilitationo fwholesale market facilities.

1. Background

1.1      Both the Government of Mali andthe World Bank view the development o fMali's
agricultural sector as an essential ingredient inthe country's overall rural development effort.
The Government's MasterPlans for RuralDevelopment(1992 and 2001), the Government's
PovertyReduction Strategy Papers (2002 and 2007), and the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (2003) all emphasize the importantrole that the modernization ofthe agricultural
production, from productionto marketing, must play inaccelerating economic growth and
poverty reduction. The World Bank hasbeen strongly supporting the implementation o f the
Government's agricultural and rural development strategies through its portfolio o f
investment and adjustment operations.'

1.2      Rural areas account for about 80 percent o fthe country's population o f 13.5 million,
agricultural activities occupy about 70 percent o fthe labor force, and agricultural production
contributes more than 40 percent o f GDP. The devaluation ofthe CFA Franc in 1994
increasedthe competitiveness o f Mali's agricultural products on internationalmarkets (for
mangoes, beans, and sweat peas) and on regional markets (vis-a-vis imports such as potatoes
from Europe). But the rate o f growth o fthe agricultural sector declined from an average o f
3.5 percent a year from 1987-1993 to an average of2.6 percent per year from 1994-2004,
and landproductivity remains low and essentially unchanging. Some horticultural crops such
as onions andtomatoes, whose productiongrew by over 200 percent and 100percent
respectively from 1999-2004, are an exception to these overall trends, but these still
represent a very small -albeit growing -share o f agricultural value added.

1.3      The NationalAgriculturalResearchProject(NARP),which was approved in
December 1993, was the largest o fthe three projects beingreviewed inthis PPAR. Total
costs were US$57.2 million at completion. The project aimedto restructure and improve the
performance ofthe National Agricultural Research System inorder to ensure that adequate
technology would become available to farmers inorder to increase agriculturalgrowth and to
reverse the decline inthe productivity o f landand other naturalresources.

1.4      The AgriculturalTradingandProcessingPromotionPilot Project(ATPPP)
approved inJune 1995, and the PilotPrivateIrrigationPromotionProject(PPIP)
approved inMay 1997, were pilot projects o f a much smaller size. Total costs were US$5.1
million andUS$2.4 millionrespectively. Bothprojects aimed to assist the Government in
implementingits policies o f (a) disengaging from the provision of services, (b) forging a new
and strong public-private partnership, (c) providing the basic enabling environment for the
development o fprivate sector-led agriculturaltrade, processing and small-scale irrigation,
and (d) encouraging agricultural diversification.

2.        The NationalAgricultural ResearchProject (NARP)

Objectives

2.1       The National Agricultural ResearchProject (NARP)representedthe first six-year
phaseofthe implementation o fthe Strategic Plan for National Agricultural Research
(SPNAR), whichhadbeenpresented to adonor roundtable in 1992. The long-term objective
ofthe StrategicPlanwas to ensure that adequatetechnology wouldbecome available to
farmers inorder to increaseagricultural growth andto reversethe decline inthe productive
capacity o fthe natural resourcebase. The specific objective o fthe NARP was to improve
"the performance ofthe national agricultural researchsystem, by improvingresearch
coherence, quality, relevance andaccountability for results through institutional reforms."2

2.2       The SPNAR also drew on the guiding principles inthe Strategic Framework for
Action (FFA) to revitalize agricultural researchinthe Sahel, which hadbeenpreparedjointly
bythe Institutdu Sahel (INSAH), the SpecialProgramfor AfricanAgriculturalResearch
(SPAAR), and the national agricultural researchinstitutions ofthe CILSS c~untries.~Mali
andTanzaniawere selectedin 1991as pilot countries for the implementation ofthe FFA
guiding principles, which the S A R grouped as follows:

          Establishing regional collaborative research programsto be implementedby lead
          national agricultural research systems ("research poles")
     0    Revitalizing the national agriculturalresearchthrough institutional reforms to:
          (i) defineagriculturalresearchpolicyandimprovedonorcoordinationthrough
              better
          the introductiono fconsolidated funding mechanisms; (ii) national            make
          agricultural researchinstitutions more dynamic and accountablefor results by
          granting them financial and administrative managementautonomy; and (iii)                         promote
          greater institutionaldiversity inthe implementation ofresearch.

DesignandImplementation

2.3       The NARPwas composed o f four components:

     (a) Institutionaldevelopment (US$2.7 million at appraisal, 2 percent o fproject cost^):^
          Restructuringthe National Agricultural ResearchCouncil(CNRA) andthe Institute
          ofRural Economy (IER) inorder to separateresearchfhding, coordination, and
          screeningfrom researchimplementation. Integrating user representativesinto
          decisionmakingat the CNRA. Transforming IERinto an autonomousinstitution with
          anindependentboard o fdirectors, and decentralizing its researchactivities closer to
          the users.

4. Actual project costsby component were neither presented inthe ICRnor available to the IEGmission. These are only
availablebyexpenditure category: works, goods, services, etc.

        Technologytransfer anduserparticipation(US$26.8 million at appraisal, 24
        percent o fproject costs): Developing interactive processes betweenfarmers,
        extension agents, and researchers to enhance farmer participationinsettingresearch
        objectives and evaluating results. Establishing a pilot User Research Fundfor
        research users (farmers andprocessors) to contract for specific researchtopics of
        interest to them.

        Researchprogramimplementationand management (US$37.3 millionat
        appraisal, 33 percent o fproject costs): Improvingresearch relevance andquality by
        improvingresearchprogramming, monitoring and evaluation, enhancing user
        participation, andresearch contracting. Strengthening external linkages with regional
        andinternational collaborative researchprograms.

        Resourcedevelopmentand management(US$44.8 millionat appraisal, 40 percent
        o fproject costs): Improvingmanagement o f research stations. Strengthening human
        resource development. Rehabilitatingresearch stations and equipment.

        The principalrisks identifiedby the S A R were (a) implementationdelays as a result
o fprofoundinstitutionalreforms; (b) slowness inchanging scientists' attitudes towards
participatoryresearch and collaborationwith extensionservices; (c) weak research
management; and (d) possible government reluctance to rely onregional collaboration. The
Bankaddressedtheserisks throughnumerous conditionalities for effectiveness, andthrough
implementationmeasures such as introducing contractual arrangements for research funding,
improving staff training, andproviding funds for Mali's participation inregional
collaborative research.

2.5      The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) judged quality at entry to be marginally
satisfactory, andproject design as satisfactory overall, but determined that Bank management
had overestimated the Government's readiness. Inretrospect, ifthe Bank had insisted on
basic organizational and administrative arrangements being inplace at the time o f credit
approval, or at least at effectiveness, some o fthe issues that delayed project implementation
-theadoptionoftherevisedstatutes,fimdingforincreasedsalaries,andtransferofland
titles to the Institute o fRuralEconomy (IER) -wouldhavebeenresolved earlier.

2.6      A numbero f factors hampered the implementationofthe project:

         Delaysinratifyinginstitutionalreforms, such as the official adoptiono fthe National
         Agricultural Research Council (CNRA) and IERstatutes, only completed in2001,
         five years into theproject, even though these were conditions o feffectiveness.
         Slow release o f counterpart funds due to the devaluation of the CFAF in 1994, which
         significantly increasedproject costs inlocal currency equivalents and coincidedwith
         lower government revenues due to low cottonprices.
         Insufficient government budget allocations -for the increased salaries o fresearchers
         after adoptiono fthe new IERstatutes, which resultedinthe departure o fhighcaliber
         staff, andfor agricultural extension after the Bank's NationalAgricultural Research
         andExtensionproject (PNVA) closed in 1998, whichhampereddissemination of
        researchresults.

                                                           4


          Frequent turnover of decision makers which resulted inthe deferral ofpolitically
          sensitive decisions such as approving landtitles for IERresearch centers and stations.
          Failure o fthe IERto implement the career development plan for its staff, thereby
          causing some discontent.
          The drastic unilateralreductioninthe size ofthe Sotuba Regional ResearchCenter in
          which the Government expropriated 80 percent o f its landfor urbandevelopment.
          This causedthe displacement o f several researchprograms andincurredunexpected
          expenses to enclose the remaining landat the highcost o fUS$0.55 million.

Nonetheless, inspite o f these initial implementationdelays, the NARPclosed inDecember
2001as scheduled, having achieved its development objectives.

2.7       A muchlower thanexpected contributionbyother donors -only US$19.2 million,
or 28 percent out o fthe pledgedUS$68.1 millionbyDutch Cooperation and USAID-led
to the decisions not to rehabilitate laboratories andreplace equipment, andto cut the finding
for several research activities (including four programsintheir entirety). Although the Dutch
concurredwith the project concept, they expressed some discontent at the slow pace of
implementationdue to the Bank's conditionalities andcomplicated project modalities5which
preventedthem from disbursing at the level they hadprogrammed. Instead, they decidedto
adopt the client approach and to channel financing directly to IER, the Malian Company for
the Development o f Textile Fibers (CMDT), andthe Office duNiger (ON). USAID started
downsizing its operations in 1995, reducing its support to agriculture ingeneral, changing the
direction o f its aid strategy from capacity buildingto market development, and funding
market chain development rather than research for the sake o f research.

 Outcome

2.8       NARPachievedits specific objectiveofabetterperformingnationalagricultural
research system through institutional andproceduralreforms that have improvedresearch
coherence, quality, relevance and accountability for results. These include separating
programming, coordination, fundingandoversight functions from research implementation,
andrestructuringthe CNRA andthe IER.IERpersonnel arenowbetterpaidandmore
motivated than before, andits researchers cannow plan, budget, andmonitor their programs.
The overall project outcome is rated satisfactory.

RELEVANCE
2.9         The project development objective was complex and thus, the appraisal team
amplifiedit indifferent sections o fthe SAR.6 The projectwas somewhat ambitious inaiming
to achieve both major institutionalreform andmajor researchimpacts withinthe time frame
ofa seven-year project. Inplaces, the appraisal document seemedto expect that there would
bea significant impact onincreasing the productivity ofsmall farmers andreducingrural
poverty within this time frame, whenmore realistically the plannedinstitutional reforms
could only enable such impacts inthe future. The stated objective o f the project was well
imbeddedinbothGovernment andBankstrategiesat the time, which emphasized
institutionaldevelopment; improving agriculturalproductivity, and greater decentralization
andmoreactive participationo fthepopulation indecision making, all inthe spirit ofpoverty
alleviation. The Government's Master Planfor RuralDevelopment (MPRD) in 1992
includedseveral priority action programs addressedbyNARP such as support to agricultural
services andproducer organizations; intensificationand diversificationo f agricultural
production; and enhancing food security. Project preparation precededthe first Bank Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mali, which was issued in 1994 and emphasized poverty
alleviation and sustained broad-based economic growth. The agriculture settor was viewed
as the main driver of economic growth at the time, and agricultural researchwas viewed as
animportant element inincreasing agriculturalproductivity, reducingpoverty, and enhancing
food security.

2.10        The objective o fthe project remains relevant today. The Government's updated
MPRD in2001continues to emphasize agricultural services, productivity, food security, and
diversification. The Bank's 2003 CAS supports the implementationofthe Government's
2002 PovertyReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) which seeks to reinforce institutional
capabilities and improve public sector management throughmodernization and reform; and
aims for a diverse and competitive primary sector. Mali's 2007 PRSP emphasizesthe need
for an agriculturalresearcWextension service that i s guidedby users andmarket demand.

2.11 Theproject's design fully supportedthe institutionalreform agendato positionthe
NARS to performmore efficiently. The project's activitieswere intendedto foster the
reorganization o fthe system; to strengthen technical andadministrativemanagement and
fundingcoordination; andto enable the integrationofresearchusers intothe research
programmingto validation cycle. Butthe project's design suffered fiom a number o f
shortcomings:


6. Paragraph1.01: "During the SpecialProgramfor African Agricultural Research(SPAAR) membershipmeetinginMay
1991 inAbidjan, Mali andTanzaniawere selected as pilot countries for the implementation o f FFArecommendations."
Paragraph2.21: "`I`he present project intendsto support IER'sparticipation inregional collaborative programs andto adapt
the institutional reforms recommendedbythe FFAto conditions inMali andimplement them, includingthe introduction of
a consolidatedfindingmechanismto strengthen donor coordination under Government lead." Paragraph3.02: "In addition
to institutional reforms andinview o fpersistentlimitationsinthe availability o fresources, NARP was to help focus the
national researcheffort on the priorities set inthe SPNAR. Indoing so, NARP emphasized (a) the testing o f technologies
developed elsewhere (to the extent possible, minimizing fundamental research); (b) expanding farmer participatory research
andmovingfaster towards on-farm testing (strengthening internal linkages); and(c) seekingregional collaboration in
adaptingpromising technologies to local circumstances (strengtheningexternal linkages), thereby avoiding expensive
duplication o f effort and seeking economies o f scale through collaborative research." Annex 13: "As a pilotproject for both
the SPAARinitiative andfor innovative approaches to improve research farmer extension linkages."
                                                                          -        -

          andAppliedResearchHigher Institute(ISFRA), and the Agricultural Mechanization

2.12      The design ofthe project didnot include a logical framework, since project
preparation preceded the adoption of this practice at the Bank.The Implementation
Completion RepoQ (ICR) mentions, and this PPAR concurs, that the project shouldhave
beenretrofitted in 1997 when a logical framework became a requirement. Nonktheless, the
correlation betweenproject activities and development objective i s straight-forward andhigh.
The indicators selected were a mix o f inputand output indicators which didnot reflect the
project's development objective nor were they time-bound. The risks identified inthe SAR
were on target. The mitigatingmeasures includedinthe project's design did little to
minimize the impact o fthese riskswhen they materialized. The project team also failed to
identify the risk o f donors not livingup to their commitments to parallel financing.                        lo

2.13      Inlightofthe above, andinspite ofthe shortcomings inproject design, thePPAR
rates relevance as substantial.




7. The Borrower has commented that Mali didnot have a national agricultural research system (NARS) at the
beginning ofthe project. IERwas the mainresearchinstitution at the time, which collaborated withIF'R, LCV
and ISFRA.

8. SAR, paragraph3.28: "Under the project, finding has beenincluded for Mali's participation inregional collaborative
researchprograms. For the componentsto be implementedby IER, the costs are included inthe research andstation
budgets, but not separatelyidentified, since these are the normal costs o fthe national programs".

9. It wasjudged, aposteriori,that project costsat appraisalwere inflateddue to lack of accurate data.

10. The Dutch told the IEGmissionthat, with hindsight, it was too early at project preparationinthe early 1990sto
consolidatedonor fundingandratherthat this shouldhavebeenaprocess. One government offcial related that donorswere
not really interestedinputtingfunds into a commonpot ofmoney: USAID didnot really want to contribute butbowed down
to the Bank's wishes duringpreparation,andthe Dutchwere frustrated at all the attention focusedon satisfyingthe Bank's
demands. Itdidnot help either that the Bankattemptedto managethe parallel financing as ifit were actual project
cofinancing, as this offcial putit.Inany event, consolidateddonor financing provedimpossible to achieveat the time.
Donors wantedvisibility. And theyhad different interests, reflecting their own priorities, whethergeographic or
disciplinary. The governmenthadproposedduringpreparationthat it would bebetter instead to have a donor group meet
periodically to review ofthe government's financing needs, and thenpledge support. But this proposalwas not pursued.

EFFICACY
2.14      TheNARP succeededinreformingandenergizing the NARS,andpositioningitto
perform better and more efficiently. It implemented significant institutionaland procedural
reforms,most ofwhich are irreversible:

          Separatedprogramming, coordination, hnding, and oversight functions from research
          implementation: The organogram for the NARS is now clear, andparticipating
          agencies have clear andcoherent mandates. CNRA i s now at the apex o fthe NARS,
          withthe mandateo f overseeing the implementationo fthe SPNAR.
          Restructured CNRA and IER: An autonomous CNRA, separate from IER and
          attachedto the Ministry o f Agriculture (MOA)," has been established. The IERhas
          beenrestructured, and is also fully autonomous interms of financial and
          administrative management.
          Established the practice o f contracting out results-oriented research to the best bidder.
          Brought researchcloser to its users byhelping IERregroup its capital assets,
          decentralize research to regional centers, and relocate its personnel to the regions.
          Integratedthe research users as full partners inthe NARS by creating a National User
          Committee (CNU), as well as RegionalUser Committees (CRUS) inorder for
          researchusers to participate inthe programmingto evaluation and validation cyc1e:l2
          Dueto thetraining received, andexperience acquiredby farmers underNARP,
          farmers were prepared to make a relevant input to the design o f the Bank's follow-on
          Agricultural Services andProducer Organizations Project (PASAOP).
          Strengthenedresearch-extension-farmer linkages, resulting inthe willingness o f
          researchersto talk anddiscuss directly with farmers.
          Institutedperiodic independent external financial and technical evaluations.
          Includedresearch entities other than IERincompeting for research contracts inorder
          to foster amore institutionally diverse NARS.
          Enhancedthe credibility and visibility o fthe MalianNARS, andincreased
          transparency infinancial management.

2.15      All stakeholdersthat the IEGmissionconsulted concurred that, ifNARPhadnot
existed, the N U S ' organogram would still benebulous with no clear vision andproficient
tools to allow CNRA andIERachieve their mandates; CNR4 wouldnot have attained its
present level o f governance; IERwould still be a heavily centralized structure dependent on
uncertain budgetary transfers, with unmotivated staff (low salaries, no staff management, no
control o f their budgets, andnot able to plantheir work); researchusers would have no role
at all inthe processo fprogrammingand evaluatingresearch; andresearch wouldbe carried
out with no accountability for results.



11. The Ministry ofRuralDevelopmentand Environment (MDRE)becamethe MinistryofAgriculture (MOA) in2004.

12. The example ofthe SegouCRUis citedhere: Itwas foundedin 1994with 15 memberswhich swelled to 60 in 1998-
2001, andare at 80presently. The CRUmembershipis composed ofproducersandprocessors. They conductextension
servicesto their membersandnon-members. They meetregularlyamongthemselves. From 1998to 2001, they collected
membershipfees inabidfor financial sustainability,which amountedto 15percentoftheir operationalcosts. This ended
unfortunatelywith the closureofNARP.They have expressedtheir satisfactionat the exchange of ideasthey were exposed
to, and confirmedthat having a CRUhas giventhem a larger latitude to adopt researchresults.

2.16     The coherence o f agriculturalresearchhasnow been strengthenedby entrusting the
CNRAwith theimplementationo fSPNAR. CNRA ensuresalignment with SPNARandno
duplication o fresearchproposals. This enables a clear vision for all research activities. The
quality ofthe researchportfoliohas greatly improved. This starts with better quality research
proposals inorder to win researchcontract bids. The better quality researchproposalshave
beenconfirmed by the tri-annual external reviews andbythe decliningrejectionrate of IER's
proposals from 80 percent when contracting out researchwas first implementedat mid-project,
to 30 percent at project closure in2001, andto a current 18percent, while CNRA's vetting
processbecameincreasinglymore stringent. Regional andinternationalcollaboration, under
which twelve IERprograms are beingexecuted, has also helpedimproveresearch content and
resultsby adapting promising technologies andbyinformation exchanges.

2.17     The overall relevance o f IER's research results has beenmixed. Onthe positive side,
their researchhas been creditedwith helpingraise rice yields by 30 percent, andwheatbarley
yields by 24 percent. IERhas also increasinglyresponded to research users' request^.'^ All o f
thisindicates therelevance o fthe improvedtechnologies to end-users' needs. Onthe
negative side, the general impression i s that the adoptionrate o fimprovedtechnologies has
beenlow, blamedby IER on a weak extension system. The fact remains that the majority o f
the technologies being generated are more accessible to better-offfarmers since these call for
the use o fmodeminputs (such as fertilizers, irrigation water, animaltraction, plows, or a
cart) which inthe absence of a well-performing agricultural credit system, are beyondthe
financial capacities o f the majority o f farmers. Better-off farmers constitute only 20 percent
o f the farming population, while the remaining 80 percent are classified as poor. Thus, IER's
researchhasbeenperceived as serving the better-off farmers, and has not beenpro-poor.

2.18     The impact o f the project on accountability to achieve results with the funds
allocated has so far beenweak andi s not fully inplace. Although CNRA hasbeen reported to
cut funding ofnon-performing programs, it does not seem to have heldIERaccountable for
not producingtechnologies that are better targeted to poor farmers. However, due to the
nature o fresearch, producingtechnologies that are socio-economically viable ina set time
fkame may not bepossibleeither. This aspect could havebeenthought out better.

2.19     The results o f the implementationo fthe SPAAR/FFA principles were mixedas
well. Onthe one hand, the NARS was revitalized throughsuccessful institutional and
procedural reforms, the grantingof financial andadministrative autonomy to CNRA and
IER, andthe inclusionofseveralresearchinstitutes inthe implementationo fthe SPNAR. On
the other hand, the Research Poles andthe consolidated funding experiments were not
successful. BeforeNARP,a commodity network was operating inthe subregion with the
CGIAR institutionstaking the lead. The sorghum programinMali evolved as apilot for
S P W F A , butwas not accompanied by earmarked funding.U S A I D subsequently
expressedinterest to contribute to the sorghum researchpole and enlarge it to all o fWest
Afiica, at which time, Nigeria, the most important producer of sorghum, questioned Mali's
lead o fthe sorghum program. The implementationo fthe "research poles" principle ended
withthis andthe system reverted back to the commoditynetwork. And, as explained above,


13. Severalexamplesexist: (a) When IER introducedanewvariety of sorghumin2002whichdidnotconservewellwhen

to produceafeed supplement for afeed ago-processorwhose project proposalwas approved bythe PilotUserFund.

                                                 9


the consolidated funding mechanism principle provedto betoo early to implement, and
possiblyimpractical due to different donor strategies, priorities, andmethods o f operation.

2.20    Based on the above, and despite the noted shortcomings, this PPARrates efficacy as
substantial.

EFFICIENCY
2.21    The S A R didnot estimate the economic or financial rate ofreturnfor theproject.
Instead, it referred to the Bank's Sector Policy Paper on Agricultural Research, dated June
1981, which had concluded that investments inagricultural research inbothdeveloped and
developingcountries had generatedhigheconomic rates o freturn, exceeding 40 percent in
many cases. As was commonwith other agriculturalresearchprojects beingprepared at the
time, noindicators were definedwith which to track informationoncost-effectiveness.

2.22    As part o fproject's monitoringand evaluation, IERconducted impact assessmentsin
2001 to estimate the economic and financial impact o f technologies developed and
disseminated duringthe NARP.These studies showed the highest rates o freturnto be 120
percent for improvedmaize technologies adopted, highrates o freturno f 66,62, and 50
percent, respectively, for improvedmillet, rice and sorghum technologies adopted, and lower
rates o f 28 and 22 percent, respectively, for improved cotton and groundnut technologies
adopted. The same studies also found the highest rates o f adoptiono f improvedtechnologies
to be 92 percent, 55 percent and45-78 percent, respectively, for cotton, rice, andmaize. The
adoptionrate o f the other improvedtechnologies were 22 percent andbelow. However, these
results are indicative only, since the studies' sample sizes were too small to make an
extrapolationo f impact.

2.23    Onthe other hand, ahealthy organization o fthe institutional andprocedural
fiamework for research, accompanied byproficient tools to ensure quality andrelevance, i s a
necessary precursor for efficient researchand the release o f sound technologies. NARP's
mainconcern was to improve the institutional efficiency o f the NARS, and its contribution in
this respect was substantial. Therefore, this PPARplaces most o f the emphasis on the
improvements ininstitutional efficiency that have been achieved andrates the overall project
efficiency as substantial.

Riskto Development Outcome

2.24    Most o fthe reforms are by their nature hardto reverse. The Government has not
given any indicationthat it intends to willingly reverse them inthe future. However, the IER
has expressedfrustration at the longreview and vetting process before it receives hnds from
CNRA, which mightbea threat. Inthe opinion o fthis PPAR, a concerted effort to improve
the IER's financial management would help to shorten this frustratingly long process.

2.25    As to financial sustainability, the NARPnever sought to achieve this inthe time
fiame of one project. So far, manyo fthe activities financed byNARPhavebeensponsored
by follow-on Bank projects-such asthe PASAOP andits sequel, under preparation-as
well as other donor fbnding such as the DutchPAPIER andthe FrenchFPS. For the long
term, Government is seeking to enhance financial sustainabilitybyhaving research users and
other beneficiaries pay for the programsthat interest them, andit is already working on

                                                           10


establishing a National Fundfor Agricultural Research for strategic research with a public
interest. Overhead costs o f IERwould be included inthe research contracted, as
recommended byPAPIER. Inthe meantime, the IERhas already made significant progress
insecuring anincreasingproportiono fits revenue fromdomestic sourcesthroughcontractual
research arrangements with large companies such as CMDT and ON; development
projects/NGOs/producer organizations; andthe sale o fbase seed14and research related
production. The share of these types o frevenues as a percent o f IER's overallbudget
increased from 25 percent in 1994to 49 percent in2001, and67 percent in2004.

2.26       Inview oftheirreversiblenature ofthe institutionalreforms, andthe increasing
financial sustainability o f the NARS, the risk to development outcome i s rated moderate.

Bankand BorrowerPerformance

BANKPERFORMANCE
2.27       The quality at entry isratedmoderatelysatisfactory.Projectpreparationwas based
on a comprehensive sector study and took account o f Government's own strategy. The
project design incorporated SPAAR's guidingprinciples, andincorporatedlessons learned
from past successhl and failed operations inagricultural research. Fiduciary and
implementationaspectswere well addressed, andrelatedguidelines were well detailed.
Gender and equity aspects were taken into                           buttransitionarrangements were not
mentioned.16And the Bankdecided to declare the project effective even though the Borrower
hadnot satisfied all the conditions for project effectiveness, inparticular, resolving the
crucialissue o f secure land titles for IERresearch centers and stations.

2.28       The quality o f supervisionis rated moderatelysatisfactory. The project was
supervised with a satisfactory skill mix, except inrelationto fiduciary aspects duringthe
initial stage.l7The aide-memoires were detailed, focused on development impact, realistic in
appraising implementationprogress toward achieving the development objective, andmade
pertinent recommendations. Bank staffrightlyrequested the interventiono f the Regional
Vice Presidentwith the President o fMali to resolvethe landtitlingissue for IERresearch
centers and stations. Onthe other hand, the ambitious design o f the project, with its focus on
both institutional strengthening andimproved research results, made the project difficult to
supervise. Supervision became almost exclusively focused on slow implementationand
problem solving. The project was not retrofittedwith a logframe andthe implementation

indicators were not revised when the Bank adopted the practice. As a result, the deficiencies
inthe functioningofproject monitoringandevaluationwere never satisfactorily addressed.
The implementationo fimportant Bank decisions that wouldhavereinforcedthe institutional
reforms were not made ina timely manner. The project team, backedby the Sector Manager,
suggestedin 1996 that the Bank should advancethe mid-termreview (MTR) becausethe
anticipated statutes hadnot yet been adopted, when these shouldhave beendone before
credit effectiveness. The Bank's Regionalmanagement did not support this recommendation,
causing delays inadoptingthe revised statutes, which eventually ledto a threat of
suspension.

2.29     &I lighto fthe above, the overallBankperformanceisratedmoderately satisfactory.

BORROWER      PERFORMANCE
2.30     The performanceo fthe Government isratedmoderately unsatisfactory. The
Government has adequately encouraged stakeholderheneficiary involvement and
consultations through the creation o f the CRUS,andhelped to ensure adequatetransition
arrangementsby actively participating inthe preparationo f PASAOP.However, it was slow
inreleasingits counterpartcontributions; itdidnotadopt therevisedstatutesfor CNRA and
JERuntilitwas threatenedwith suspension; anddelayedreleasingfunds for the increased
salaries o fIERresearch staff, which ledto discontent andthe departure o f some highcaliber
staff. The planned activities to upgrade the capabilities o f the research laboratories, centers,
and stations couldnotbe completed becausethe Government didnot provide the IERwith
acceptable landtitles untiltoo late inthe project, this being a condition for disbursement. In
addition, the Government appropriated 80percent o f the Sotuba Regional center lands for
urban development, which ledto increased and unplannedinvestments at this site (for
fencing) to the detriment o f others, and to the relocation o fresearch programs. These actions
gave the impressionthat Government didnot have sufficient ownership o fthe project and
was not committed to achievingNARP's development objective.

2.3 1    The performanceo fthe implementingagencies is rated moderately satisfactory. The
IER, the principal implementingagency, andthe CNRA,were highlycommittedand
instrumental inpreparingtheir staff for the proposed institutional reforms. The IERalso
successfully decentralized its operations, movingresearch staff from its headquartersin
Bamako to the regional centers, reducing its staff, etc. However, the IERwas not as
successful inimprovingits financial management, whichpromptedlong delays in
disbursement, nor infully implementingthe electronic M&Esystem. The CNRA
satisfactorily performedits role o f coordinatingand ensuringquality control of national
agricultural research activities, andintroducing contractual research.

2.32     Inspite o fGovernment's performance shortcomings, overallBorrowerperformance
i s rated moderately satisfactory, due to the good efforts o fthe IER and CNRA.

Monitoring andEvaluation

2.33     The overall quality o fproject monitoringandevaluation i s ratedmodest, basedon
substantial, modest, andnegligible ratings for design, implementation, and utilization,

                                                    12


respectively.18 The SAR providedguidelines andthe NARPinstitutedan M&E system to
assess the overallperformance o f the NARS, which the project aimed at improving. The
NARPalsoprovidedtraining onimpactevaluation. The M&Eprocesswas wellimbedded
institutionally since it was part o fthe ratified institutional reforms, covered several aspects o f
M&E, andis stillinpractice up to the writingo fthis PPAR. The SAR also includeda list of
project implementationprogress indicators for anumber o f inputs andoutputs, but with no
quantitativeand time-boundtargets, and which didnot fully reflect the project's development
objective.

2.34     Inspite o fthisgoodstart, theimplementationofM&Ewas mixed, andthere is no
evidence that M&Eresults were utilized to cause shifts inthe implementationo f the project.
Although thejoint impact assessments(withthe extension service andresearch users) were
not carried out, manyM&E components were. The plannedbaseline, or inventory and
descriptiono ftechnologies available, was not done duringthe life oftheproject, although
such a document hasnow beenprepared under the follow-on project, PASAOP. The M&E o f
research measuredimplementationprogress, recorded some researchresults, and prompted
the CNRA to stop financing a numberof research projects that were not achieving any results
after several years o fimplementation. But this didnot adequately measure the adoption of
technologies or their economic viability. For the most part, M&E findings have not been
utilized to influence either decision makingwith the NARP, or subsequent operations.

3.       The AgriculturalTrading and ProcessingPromotion
         PilotProject(ATPPP)

Objectives

3.1      The ATPPP was a five-year pilot project to address key sectoral constraints to private
investment inagriculturalprocessing andmarketing inMali, focusing on buildingcapacity
and transferringknow-how to the private sector bymeans o f informationnetworks, training,
specialized technical assistance, and study tours. The development objectivewas "to improve
the technical andmanagerial capacities o fproducers, traders, exporters and agro-processing
entrepreneurs with a view to inducing sustained growth inthe Borrower's agricultural trading
andprocessing subse~tor."'~

DesignandImplementation

3.2     The project adopted atwo-pronged approachto achieve this objective: first, the
provision o fgeneric support inthree highpotentialregions to allprofitable agro-processing
private entrepreneurs, upstreamanddownstream of agricultural production, andsecond, the
transfer o fspecialized expertise to enterprises operating inproduct lineswith a highpotential
for international export that required highquality standards. The project had four components:

    (a) The operationof the implementingagency's (APROFA) threeregionalbranches
        in the Sikasso, SCgou andMoptiregions(US$2.5 millionat appraisal, 48 percent
        ofproject costs):20Promotional and technical assistance; training and information
        services; constructionand rehabilitationo f wholesale market facilities; individualized
        on-demand technical assistanceto entrepreneurs; institutional strengthening o f
        RegionalChambers ofAgriculture.

    (b) Support packagesto subsectorprofessionalassociations(US$ 1.4million at
        appraisal, 27 percent ofproject costs): Institutional strengthening o fprofessional
        associations; construction andrehabilitation o f collective facilities.

    (c) APROFA's operations and management,andthe establishmentand operation of
        an agriculturalprocessingand marketinginformationexchangenetwork (US$
         1.1million at appraisal, 21percent o fprojectcosts): Market studies andconsumer
        surveys; establishing and maintaining a roster o f consultants and a data bank of
        informationmarket prices, product quality standards, post-harvest technologies, and
        marketingtechniques.

    (d) Access to credit(US$ 93,000 at appraisal, 1.8 percent o fproject costs): Workshops,
        meetings, training, andstudy tours to bridgethe gap and facilitate cooperation
        betweenprocessing andmarketingenterprises on the one hand and bankingand
        financial institutions on the other.

3.3     The ICR rated project design as satisfactory, while noting several shortcomings,
including the lack o f a formal set o f agreed-upon performance indicators, and the inadequate
institutionalinterface betweenthe MinistryofRuralDevelopment and Environment (MDRE)
and the Assembly o fthe Chambers ofAgriculture (APCAM). The Government had entrusted
the project implementationto APCAM, which hadinturnset up anagencyin 1995, the Apex
Organization ofAgo-business Associations (APROFA) for the promotion, processing and
marketing of agricultural produce, which became the project's implementing agency.
However, the hierarchyo freporting and supervision was fuzzy and this institutional
arrangement provednot to bepractical. Although APROFA was created under the tutelage o f
APCAM, APROFA's director general was appointed by andreported to the Minister ofRural
Development. Onthe other hand, the MDRE,which was responsible for overall project
supervision, decided not to interfere with the day-to-day management of APROFA.

3.4     Two ofthe three risks identified at appraisal -weak APROFA-APCAM linkages,
andpoormanagement andmisuse ofits autonomy byAPROFA -turned out to be
impediments to smoothproject implementation. APROFA worked inisolation and showed
weaknesses infinancial management which were never corrected. It failed to give adequate
attention to M&E andinformation dissemination. Its website, which was to include
comprehensive documentation andanalysis on markets, export standards, prices, the results
of studies, etc., never became operational, andmanymarket studies were not distributedto


20. Actualproject costs by component are not available since the software, SAARI, that was usedbythe
implementingagency, APROFA, to manageits accounting systemwas not conducive to monitoring
expendituresby component butonly by expenditure category. Thus actual project costs are only available by
expenditure category: works, goods, services, etc.

the clients. Itputup stron resistance to the transfer ofits monitoringhontrolresponsibilities
to APROFA-Association!'            and inso doing derailed the mechanismthat might have
sustained its activities.22In1999,APROFA's staff was dismissed, bringingthe project to a
standstill until a new management team took over in2001,which was no more successful in
executing the project. Bothfailures may be attributed to the lack o f effective institutional
guidance to APROFA. The project closing date was extended by a year andnine months to
makeup for the lost time betweenthe two APROFA management teams, andto buildonthe
successes which the project had achieved inspite o f the implementation deficiencies.

Outcome

3.5      The ATPPP hashad a markedimpact on private sector development since it
contributed significantly to increasing the volumes ofmarketedproductionto both internal
and externalmarkets. The ATPPP putthe focus on the production-to-marketing chainwith an
accent on diversifyingproduction, processing andmarketingthrough private sector
partnerships, thereby breakingthe traditional state-centered agriculturalmodel, fostering
privatesector development, andpromotingthe commercializationo f a more diversified
agricultural production. It enabled Mali to see its potential for competing on international
markets and encouraged the transition fiom subsistence farming and artisanal agro-
processingto a more professional practice. Producers andtraders hadto form andregroup,
andto work inaprofessionalmanner inorder to benefit fiom ATPPP's activities. Inspite of
these accomplishments, this PPAR rates the overall outcome o fthe project as moderately
satisfactory due to deficiencies inthe preparation anddesign ofthe project.

RELEVANCE
3.6      The statement o fthe development objective in the D C A is concise andto the point.
Bycomparison, that inthe SAR is longandunfocussed, andlists amix o factivities and
buildingblockswhichtaken as awhole only hintsat the objectivewhich the DCA states
more clearly. The development objective was too ambitious andunrealistic, especially since
the project design did not addresscrucial elements such as credit andmarket facilities.

representative ofacrosssectionof stakeholders.

3.7     Nonetheless, the development objective was consistent with the Government's policy
orientations andthe Bank's 1994 CAS, both o fwhich adopted apublic-private partnership
approach to economic and social development. Both aimed to: (a) enhancebusiness
opportunities for the private sector and encourage disengagement o f the State from
commercial activities; (b) improve technical support to producers to boost and diversify
production, andimprove the internationalcompetitiveness o fMalian exports; (c) promote
active participationo frural groups inthe design and implementationo frural development
activities; and(d) promote private investment inagricultural trading andprocessing. The
development objective remained consistent with the Government's current policyto support
ago-processingandto facilitate trade and transport systems, and the Bank'sdevelopment
assistance strategy inits 2003 CAS which focused on helping Mali tap into the country's
important agricultural potential and trade opportunities, andits 2007 PRSP which also
focuses on increasing the role o f trade inthe economic and social development o f Mali.

3.8      Although theproject's design addressed the requisites for achievingits development
objective, the IEGmissionto Mali identifieda number o fweaknesses inthe design o fthe
project which had an adverse impact on the magnitude, sustainability, andreacho f the
project's benefits, especially to women ago-processors andto a large portion o f the
relatively poorer private sector, producers as well as exporters.

3.9      Projectdesign didnot make a provision for credit to beneficiaries -whether farmers
for expandingplanted areas andproducingbetter quality crops usingmodern agricultural
inputs, exporters for packaging for exports, or women ago-processors for purchasing
packaging material or for acquiring ago-processing equipment. ATPPP only provided for
trainingthe bankingsector inthe economic evaluation o frequests for loans related to crop
productionand exports, which never took place. The Bank and the project presumed that
once an enabling environment was created, private investmentwould not be inshort supply.
Butthis presumption didnotprove correct for Mali. Theproject's long-term shot at
alleviating poverty:3     didnotmaterialize since those producers andentrepreneurs who
benefited from the project's activities were better o f fto beginwith. The project included
financing the construction o fwholesale markets andconservation facilities. However, it
became obvious duringimplementationthat the costs o fthis activity were not adequately
appraised, which resulted inits cancellation. The project design also failed to make explicit
arrangements for transferring to beneficiaries at project closure APROFA's physical and
acquired assets such as ago-processing equipment, the databank and study results,
computers and equipment, and vehicles -causing a loss o fcapital and a marked
unsustainability o fbenefits.

3.10     A logical fkamework was not developedat appraisal sincethiswas notyet arequired
practice at the Bank at the time. However, the project was retrofittedwith a logframe in
2001, when the project team took the opportunity o f a change inAPROFA's management to
revamp the implementation planandproduce a logframe. While this logframe includeda
clear statement ofthe development objective, this didnot conform to the wording ineither
the D C A or the SAR. It lumped outputs and outcomes together withno clear logic; missed
some importantintermediate outcomes (e.g., areas planted, increasedproduction, export
contracts signed, increased export volumes); included outcomes that were not part ofthe

23. SAR, page 11, paragraph4.01 (b)

                                                 16


project (e.g. APROFA becomingawell-performing implementingagency, professional, self-
managedandonits way to becoming apermanent structure); and included time-bound
targets only at the development objective level andnot at the outcome/output level. Iti s
difficult to the uninformedreader to understandthe inferredchain o f causality. The logframe
mentioned somebaseline information as well as production and export targets for the years to
come. The IEGmission could not confirmthe baseline figures since these didnot agree with
statistics given inthe ICR or from other sources. However, it was clear that the project team
attempted to retrofit the project to the best extentpossible.

3.11 This PPAR ratesthe relevance of ATPPP as modestinview ofthe deficiencies inthe
statement ofthe development objective and inthe design ofthe project.

EFFICACY
3.12    Almost four years after the project closed, the impact ofATPPP is still showing. On
the capacitybuildingside, severalfarmers andentrepreneurs organizations were formed and
strengthened:

    0   The APROFA-Association was createdunderATPPP andsaw its membership grow
        from 11memberswhen it was createdin2001, to 2,000 at project closure in2002,
        andto 3,000 in2006.
    0   Several associationso f farmers andmango pickers were trained on crop husbandry
  __    practicesand equippedwith sprayers and adequateharvesting basketswhich
        contributed to a substantial reduction inpre- andpost-harvestlosses o fmangoes, and
        an increaseintheir quality for export
        Severalwomen associationswere createdandstrengthened, inNiono for onion

        scalemarketing, whose membership grew from 40 in 1995 to about 250 in2001.

        makedecisionsbeneficial for their members andto provide themwith services such
        as fairs, study tours, and extension, which i s now beingfinanced byPASAOP.

3.13    Onthe production andmarketingside, ATPPP hada direct impact on increasingthe
production, marketing, and export o fmangoes, potatoes, sweet peas andonions. It openedthe
internal market for mangoeswhich are now transportedbyrefrigerated trucks and sold inthe
easternandnorthernparts o fthe country (Mopti-Gao, Tombouctou-Din; Nara; Nioro).
COPROMANGUE reportedthat these marketshave grown with time. As a result, its
members' mangoproductiongrew from2,000 tons in1995to a current 15,000 tons.

3.14    Mangoesare now the focus ofMali's exports ininternational markets, and are being
exported to severalEuropean countries, andthe WesternAfrica Region, inincreasing
quantities. The ICRreported that exports grew by 72 percent at project closure. USAID'S
TradeMali project reports that exports increasedthree folds since then. This growth hasbeen
greatly facilitated bythe multimodalexport routeintroducedbyAT'PPPwhich cut the
traditional export route out o f Sikasso byhalf. AGMK, an association o f fruits andvegetable
producersinKati, has reported a spectacular increaseinareas planted to mango plantedfrom
10hain 1996to 500 hain2006. ATPPP was also instrumental inimprovingthe quality of
mangoproductionbytraining andequippingthe mangopicker associations. Harvest and

                                                          17


transport losses were reduced from 40 percent to 10percent with ATPPP, which reducedthe
debts owed to exporters.24

3.15      Potato production, marketing, and exports have also increased as a result o f ATPPP.
The area planted to potatoes and potato exports doubled and quadrupled, respectively,
between 1996 and 2002, while potato production and quantities marketedincreasedby
21 percent. ATPPP helpedentrepreneurs test a new export market inC6te d'Ivoire in.2001
(to substitute for Dutchpotato imports), after which they received several purchasing
requests. ATPPP's introductiono f improvedtraditional storage houseshas also increased
potatoproduction, marketing and exports by cutting storage losses due to rotting from 40 to
20 percent, by increasing storage time from 3 months to 5 months, andby enabling exports to
the West African Region duringthe most lucrativeperiod from July to August. Potato
producers reportedthat ATPPP helped increase their revenues two-fold.

3.16      The sweet peamarket chain didnot experience the same success as mangoes and
potatoes. Plantedareas inSikasso increasedby 60 percent at project closure, but exports
which had increased by more than2-fold in 1999 (the peak year), subsequently dropped in
2002 to 86 percent o fthe quantities exported at project start. This decline thoughwas not a
failure onthe part o f ATPPP, butthe result o f the decisiono fthe main Malianexporter who
destroyed, at least temporarily, the whole export potential ina business move25to short-
circuit the established marketingchain to Spain, the mainimporter o f sweet peas.

3.17      InSbgou, the mainproductionareafor onion, the areaplantedandproduction
increased a two and a halffold with ATPPP. The IEGmissionwas told that these increases
have beensustained and that productioni s now at 135 thousand tons compared to 106
thousand tons at project closure in2002. This spectacular increase seems to be due to the
wide adoptiono f the drying andimprovedtraditional storage technologies disseminated by
ATPPP which enabled a longer marketinginterval. ATPPP also opened an export route for
tamarindjuice and concentrate to Mauritania, and bissap (Oseille de GuinCe) to Senegal.

3.18      Merchantshighlypraised ATPPP's collection and weekly dissemination o fproducer
prices o fhorticulturalcrops over the radio. They knew what the price was andwhat margins
they could get, they couldnot becheated, andthey conducted better negotiations. ATPPP
influenced OMA, APCAM's Observatory o fthe Agricultural Market, to adopt this practice
(for wholesale prices though). Before ATPPP, it had only published cereal prices.

3.19      ATPPP's impact on women ago-processing associations was spectacular. Itprovided
themwithtrainingandthe opportunityto use aprocessing unitto dry agriculturalproduce


24. BeforeATPPP, the Cooperativefor MarketingFruitsandLegumes ofMali(CCFL) wouldgive 80,000 CFAFincredit
to pickers at the beginningof everyharvest and export campaign. The pickerswouldreturnwithmangoesworth only 60,000
CFAFdue to losses inharvestand transport. The pickerswere 5 millionCFAF indebtto CCFLin 1998.After ATPPP's
trainingandequipment, lossesbecameminimalandthisdebt was closed.

25. The mainMalianexporter decidedto bypassthe Spanishmiddlemenand to do businessdirectly with the Spanish
importers.Thisdidnotgo well sincethe containersofsweet peasexportedto Spain were returnedto the Malianexporter
unopened.After this, rumorscirculatedthatMaliansweet peaswere notpackagedaccordingto internationalhygiene
standards, which causedthe development ofa carcinogenic toxin. Spain,the mainMaliansweet peaimporter stopped
importingdirectlyfiomMali.

     and another to makejuices andjams, andinstilledinthem sound financial management.
     They participatedinfairs and shows where they sold their products andreceivedawards for
     sweet potato processing. This generatedan independent source o f income and improvedthe
     overall family standard o f living. The women developed a sense o fbusiness and started a
     relationship with food stores that sold their products on consignment.

     3.20       Onthe negative side, the approach taken bytheproject to helpprovide farmer credit
     was inadequate. The banks viewed agriculture as highrisk and requested highcollateral (a
     landtitle inmost instances, which it is not customary to have inMali's land-ownership
     system), while being stringent on loanterms.26 Although the ATPPP helped entrepreneurs
     puttogether 154proposals for loans, only40 proposals were financed for CFAF 265 million,
     representing 22 percent o fthe demand. The failure to buildwholesale markets as provided
     for inthe SAR hadanegative impact onproducers andtraders alike bylimitingthe flow and
     marketingo f extraproduction.

     3.21       InadditiontotheLEGmissionfindingsmentionedabove,Government, donors, and
     beneficiaries all credited the ATPPP with a number o f achievements, with which the IEG
     mission concurs:

           e    Being a pioneer inraising awareness andrevealingthe marketingpotential, as well as
                the benefits o f ago-processing

.          e    ConnectingMalian exporters with European importers o f fruits and vegetables,
                resultinginexport contracts that have beensustained
           e    Puttinga focus onthe production-to-marketchain o fagriculturalproducts by
                implementingactivities up-stream and down-stream o fproduction
           e    Organizingandprofessionalizingproducers and entrepreneurs
          e     Regularly disseminating producer prices for horticulturalcrops
          e     Boosting exports o fmangoes through successfully testing an alternative multimodal
                export route which cut the customary land(truck)/sea exportjourney inhalf
          e     Professionalizing the mangopickers' associations
          e     Openingup internalmarkets for mangoes, andimproving the potato seedmarket
          a     Significantly reducingpotatoes andonions losses while instorage throughscaling up
                improved artisanal conservation structures
          e     Reportedly creatingjobs for seasonal agricultural labor, buildingand maintenance o f
                store houses for onions and potatoes, and ago-processing.

     ATPPP was the first donor-supported project inthis area, andother donors have followed
              IfATPPPhadnotexisted, noneofthiswouldhaveoccurred althoughdonorswould
     have eventuallyfinanced partial activities.



     26. One example isthe experience ofan entrepreneur inSCgouwho benefitedfrom atrial on onion conservation fkom
     ATPPP the first year after hebuilta storagehouse on his own expense. The second year, he borrowedmoney from the bank
     to buy onions. The bank lendhimmoney on short term. Thus he hadto return the loanbeforehe could take full advantage o f
     the activity which only realizes benefitsinthe mediumterm, when onionprices go up. He hadto sell at a lower price than
     potentialand lost money. Therefore, he decidednot to repeat the experience and abandonedthis investment altogether.

     27. Inparticular, USAIDfinancedthe Centre Agro-Entreprise project (CAE), from 1998to 2003, with objectives and
     activities similar to ATPPP's. Then USAIDfollowed CAE with three other projects: TradeMali which financed technical

                                                             19


3.22      Taking all these factors into consideration, this PPARrates efficacy as substantial.

EFFICIENCY
3.23      No economic or financialperformance targets were specified inthe SAR.** Nor was
anERRcalculated inthe ICRas no reliable economic or financial performance could be
calculated due to the non-performance o fthe M&E system. The project's impact on
producers was not systematically evaluated by the implementing agency, and available
statistics from other sources -theNationalAgriculture Directorate (NAD),the Planning
and Statistics Unit (CPS), andother donors' projects such as USAID's TradeMali -do not
agree with eachother except for the increasing trends inmangoes and onions. The ICR
presented some tables on areaplanted, production, quantities marketedand exported.
However, a closer look reveals that these figures are somewhat lacking and
inter~hangeable,~~and they couldnot be reproduced.

3.24      Nonethelep, the empirical evidence gathered from producer associations duringthe
IEGmissionshowed amarkedincrease inthe farm-gate prices for the targeted crops, which
reflects an increase inproduct quality.30For example, mangoes sold for 60-90 CFAFkg
before the project and for 100-200 CFAFkgmid-project and onwards; and good quality
onions sold for 15 CFAFkg and 125 CFAFkg, respectively. The revenues o fpotato
producers inSikasso increasedtwo fold, andthe revenues ofwomen's associations in
Sikassowho processed and sold their produce on the market peaked at 4 millionCFAF in
2000 solely due to the equipment which the projectput at their disposal.31These represent
substantial monetarygains for the individuals involved, ifnot for the overall economy. The
ATPPP succeededindemonstrating that its activities are highlyremunerative. The PPAR
gives more weight to the impact on individualsthanonthe overall economy becausethe
project was apilot project, andtherefore rates efficiency as substantial.




assistance and export tests from 2003 to 2006, FinanceMali which facilitated access to credit from 2004to 2006, and
PRODEPAMwhich is providing TA onproduction technologiesandproducer organizationsmanagementftom 2004to
2009. Both CAE andTradeMali adoptedactivities introducedbyATPPP such as export tests and the provision ofharvest
basketsand sprayingequipmentto mangopicker associations. CIDA also followed suit with PACCEMfrom 1997to 2002,
which focused on the commercialization ofcereal surpluses, the organizationofproducers, andthe provision of credit. The
Dutchhaverecently financedseveral ago-processingunitsandplacedthemat severalCRRAs for the benefit ofwomen's
ago-processingassociations.

28. The ICRattributesthis shortcomingto the fact that ATPPP was designed as a pilot operation. ICR, page20.

29. For example, the portionof the production that is exportedis really the portionwhich ismarketed(presumablyboth
internally and externally), andmarketedquantitiesoften exceedproducedquantities. (It is assumedthat the units for the
quantitiesmarketedshouldbe tonsandnot thousands oftons as presentedinthe ICR).

30. This is attributable, inturn, to training on improved husbandrypractices, the use ofmodem agricultural inputs for those
who could afford themor to whomthey wereprovided, the availability of export markets, andknowledgeof the relationship
betweenquality andprice, all of which are direct consequencesof project activities.

31. This revenue would not haveaccruedifATPPP hadnot existedsince the project introducedthe concept of drying and
processingh i t s andvegetables inorderto expandtheir shelf life andprovided the necessarytraining and equipmentto the
women's associations.

Riskto Development Outcome

3.25    The sustainability ofthe benefits resulting from the ATPPP varies widely according
to type. Severaltypes ofbenefits have shown to havebeen sustainableex post: (a) The tests
for opening new internal markets for mango which havebecome establishedmarkets, andthe
alternative multimodal transport route for mango exports which i s inpractice up-to-date by
the biggest mango exporter, TEM; and (b) the improvedtraditional storage models for onion
andpotatoeswhichadoption spreadquickly andwidely inNiono andSikasso. The services
providedthrough APROFA such as training, fairs, and study tours are beingsustained
becausesubsequentBank anddonor projects are financially supporting these activities.
Similarly, the growth inagricultural trade andexports is beingsustainedfor the most part by
continued external financing, such as by USAID.

3.26    Onthe otherhand, theproject failed to make arrangements for the appropriate
transfer of APROFA's assets -such as office equipment and furniture, vaicles, databank
and study results, showcasesandinternetcafes, and aprocessingunit-and failedto ensure
the continuity of the weeklybroadcastingofproducer prices startedduringthe project, all of
which represent glaring andunnecessaryrisks to the sustainability o fthe project's benefits.
The office equipment, furniture andvehicles, whichwere valued at 50 millionCFAF in
October 2003, are not beingutilized for the most part. The databank andthe results of the
studies conductedbyAPROFA havenot been disseminated and therefore havenot benefited
the intendedbeneficiaries.

3.27    The showcasesandinternet cafks havebeenshut down, except for the Bamako
showcase which hasbeenleasedsince 2004 to FINATRA (the National Federation of
Agricultural Processors).The weekly broadcasting ofproducer prices for fruits andvegetable
stoppedaltogether, which i s still lamented bymanytraders. The fruits andvegetables
processingunitusedbythe women associationsinSikasso was dismounted and stored away.
The activities andrevenuesofthese women associationswere drastically curtailed at atime
whenno alternativeswere availablethroughother projects. This situationisparticularly
unfortunate since the women were forced to revert back to their traditional andunsanitary
ways ofprocessingagricultural products. The lack o fwholesale market facilities andthe
difficulties inaccessingcredit have also affected the ability ofproducers and entrepreneursto
benefit from andbuildon the servicesprovidedthrough APROFA to sustainthe growth in
the trade and export sector. Overall, the risks to development outcome are significant.

BankandBorrowerPerformance

BANKPERFORMANCE
3.28    The quality at entry, as describedunder "Relevance", is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.Project designtook gender aspectsinto consideration andthe agro-
processingactivity benefitedwomen directly. Implementation arrangementswere well
addressedand detailed. The assessment o frisks was on target, with two out ofthree
materializing duringproject implementation. The SAR didnot provide for the realistic
transfer ofresponsibilities for services providedthrough the project. Although it mentioned
that a gradualtransfer wouldbemadeto the RCAs and someprofessional associations, it
madeno mention ofpotential sourceso f financing. Fortunately, this has beentaken care o f

                                                                21


  bysubsequentBank operations such as PASAOP and the Agricultural Competitiveness and
  DiversificationProject (PCDA). On the other hand, the project design suffered from several
  deficiencies which hamperedproject implementation. Regardingfiduciary standards, the
  SAR didnotprovide for training o f APROFA's staff on Bank financial management and
  procurement procedures, but only made provision for project staff to receive guidance
  regardingprocurement at the project launchwork~hop.~'

  3.29     The quality o f supervision i s rated moderately satisfactory.Duringthe last three
  years o fthe project's implementation, supervisionmissions consisted o f four to ten experts,
  reflectingthe Bank's focus on helpingATPPP through its implementation difficulties. The
  Bank belatedlyrecognizedthe implementationerrors by the implementing agency and took
  responsibilityfor addressing the shortcoming^.^^ As a result, APROFA's staffwere replaced
  in2001, andalogframeandanewimplementationplanwere launchedat aworkshopheldin
  Selinguk. The Bank respondedto the deficiencies infinancial management byrequesting the
  Minister o f Finance inDecember 2002 to take corrective action, but with not much success.
  Bank supervision failed to ensurethat APROFA's acquired capital was passed along to the
  beneficiaries. Finally, it was not clear to the IEGmissionwhether the Bankproperly advised
  APROFA concerning the rules governing the grace periodafter project closure.34

  3.30     Overall, the PPARrates the Bank's performance as moderately satisfactory.

  BORROWER         PERFORMANCE

--3.31     The performance o f the Government i s ratedunsatisfactory. Government stuck by its
  new policy of encouraging public-privatepartnerships, created APROFA, followed through
  on its pioneeringdecision to entrust the management o f a Bank Credit to the private sector
  (APCAM andAPROFA), participatedactively inproject preparation supervision missions,
  andreplacedAPROFA's non-performing staff in2001which temporarily improvedthe
  quality oftechnical implementation, but not o f financial management or M&E. However,
  Government didnot follow through with several supervision recommendations, e.g.
  APROFA-Association should take over implementationand M&E o f the project, anddidnot
  address effectively the inadequacies inAPROFA's financial management and M&E..
  Government andbeneficiary contributions were minimal compared to the agreed-upon
  counterpart funding at appraisal.35Inaddition, Government didnot make any decisions



  32. The SAR, page 26: "Procurement andUse of Consultants".

  33. The Borrower has commented that the Bank changed task managers manytimes and eachnew onebrought
  innewapproaches, newprocedures, andnewmethodologies.

  34. APROFA submitted a packageo f invoices andjustification o f expenses for services renderedupto project closure to the
  BankOffice inBamakotwo daysbeforethe graceperiod ended. APROFA didnothear back andthe expenseswere never
  reimbursed, althoughit is likelythat at least part of the expenses would have been eligible. APROFA clearly did not
  understandthat this packagehad to be received at the Bank'sheadquartersinWashington bythe end ofthe grace periodand
  not the Bank`s office inBamako.The time required to pouchthe request for reimbursementputitbeyondthe grace period.

  35. The BankICRmentions two contradictory figures: 168million CFAFon page 11, para. 5.4, andUS$0.06 million,
  equivalentto 37 millionCFAF in2003, inAnnex 2. The Government ICRmentions a contribution o f 138 million CFAF.
  Notwithstandingwhich figure is correct, the SAR hadspecified a counterpart contribution of US0.8 million, equivalent to
  424 million CFAF in 1995, andthe highest ofthe contributions mentioned equals only 40 percentof this.

                                                22


related to transferring APROFA's capital (equipment, vehicles, and databank and study
results), w h c h remains unused to this date curtailing the sustainabilityo fbenefits.

3.32     The performance o f the implementingagency was also unsatisfactory.APROFA
made arrangements with selectedpartners(CMDT, ON, etc.) to implement the project's             "

activities, and achievedmanytargets relating to the project components. It facilitated
meetings with bankinginstitutions to enable the provisiono f credit to several entrepreneurs.
However, itperformedpoorly inmanagingthe project's finances. It engaged in
undocumented spending, overspent, and never developed an accounting system that could
document how funds were allocated to project activities. Understandably, the Bank didnot
reimburse non-qualifying expenses -resultinginan accumulated government debt o f 202
million CFAF, and a list o fpersistent creditors, attributable to APROFA's illspending. The
change inmanagement in2001 did not resolve the problem ofweak financial management.
The Agency putup strong resistance to a transfer o f its monitoringlcontrol responsibilities to
APROFA-Association. I t was very slow infilling staff positions. Itnever filled the position
o f internalauditor, and filled the M&Eposition only two months prior to project closure. As
a result, spending against categories was never checked, andproper monitoring and
evaluation never took place. These weaknesseswere repeatedly flagged duringBank
supervision missions, but not corrected.

3.33     Overall, this PPARrates Borrower performance as unsatisfactory

Monitoringand Evaluation

3.34     The overall quality o fproject monitoring and evaluationis rated negligible.As
designed at the outset, the M&E system could only provide decisionmakers with information
on the status of inputs andoutputs andnot on outcomes or impacts. While the S A R included
a table ofkey performanceindicators to be monitoredper locationand per year, these
indicators were a mix o finput and output indicatorsthat would be o f little value in
determining whether the theory o f change or the causal logic ofthe project was sound or in
demonstrating whether a pilot project such as ATPPP was achieving its development
objective ina systematic manner. The S A R also assigned responsibility for M&E and
provided a detailedoutline ofthe semi-annual reportsto beprepared, butit didnot specify
the sources from where this data wouldbe collectednor the samplingprocess to be applied.

3.35    The project was not able to make its M&Eunit operationalandthe baseline
beneficiary survey foreseen inthe SAR was not conducted. APROFA's regional branches in
Sikasso andSkgoumonitored their activities and submittedperiodic reports which served as
the basis for the project's annualreports. The outcome andimpact data inthe ICRwere
reconstructed at the endofthe project onthe basis o fdata providedbythe regionalbranches,
andbythe M&Eofficer who was hiredonly two monthsbeforeproject closure. The IEG
missionconsulteddifferent data sources outside the project for informationon the impact of
the project on production andtrade inthe agriculturalproducts targeted by ATPPP.
Attemptingto triangulate the different setsofdata duringthepreparationofthePPARshowed
the weaknesses andunreliability o fthe variousdata sources.

 4.        The Pilot PrivateIrrigation Promotion Project (PPIP)

 Objectives

 4.1      The PPIPwas a four-year pilot project, mainly providingtechnical assistance to
 addressthe key constraints indeveloping the small-scale irrigationsector inMali.36The
 long-term development objective was to improve and induce, through capacity building
 activities, an expansion o f investments insmall-scale irrigation, which would contribute to
 increased on-farm diversification o finvestments, productivity, and food security. The
 specific objective was "to increase the delivery o f technical andmanagerial services to small-
 scale irrigationproducers, inorder to improve their capacity to (a) identify the most cost-
 effective investments inirrigation equipment and infkastructure; (b) properly operate and
 maintain such equipment; (c) prepare requests for loans from financial institutions and
 increase their accessto credit for investments inirrigation; (d) improve the security o f their
 assets including landholdings; and (e) capacity buildingo fproducer groups and individual
 producers inorganizational, financial, and micro-enterprise management."37

 DesignandImplementation

 4.2      Theproject was conceived as a research, development andcapacity buildinginitiative
 to improve the technical capacities o fprivate sector institutions to provide support for and
 financing o finvestments insmall-scale irrigation. The project had seven components:

          Support to the implementingagency (US$480,000 at appraisal, 14percent o f
          project
          Technicaland managerialservices andtraining(US$ 1.09millionat appraisal,
          31percent o f costs)
          Legal services and technicalstudies (US$440,000 at appraisal, 13percent ofcosts)
          Testingof irrigationequipment (US$ 710,000 at appraisal, 21percent o f costs)
          Capacitybuilding(US$ 170,000 at appraisal, 5 percent ofcosts)
          Environmentalmonitoringand mitigation(US$ 180,000 at appraisal, 5 percent o f
          costs)
          Surveysandstudies to monitor the incentiveenvironment(US$400,000 at
          appraisal, 11percent of cost^).^^



              ~               ~    ~~




36. (a) Useo fprimitivetechnology and inefficient design andmanagement ofequipment; (b) farmers' limited accessto
technical andmanagerialsupport services; (c) producers'marginal access to credit; (d) limitedformal landtenure
arrangements; and (e) limitednumber oftechnically skilled private consultantsandconsulting firms.

37. Staff Appraisal Report, page9.
38. Actual project costs by component are not available since the software, SAARI, that was used by the
implementing agency, APROFA, to manage its accounting system was not conducive to monitoring
expenditures by component but onlyby expenditure category. Thus actual project costs are only available by
expenditure category: works, goods, services, etc.

39. Percentagesdo not addupto 100percent.

                                                24


Duringimplementation, after a supervision missionin2001, the "testing o firrigation
equipment" component was revised to include an activity on demonstrations ofproduction
technologies and varieties (referred to as intensificationtesting).

4.3     Fundingfor the PPIP came from anInternationalTrust Fund(ITF) which supplied
funds for the first year o fthe IDA11period o fFY97-99, the year PPIPwas approvedbythe
Bank's BoardofDirectors. The UnitedStates, and few other countries including Israel, did
not participate inthe ITF, and thus were excluded from the list o f countries PPIP could
procure goods and services from. During implementation, this posed a problem since the
most qualified outfits to implement the irrigation testing component inMali were American
and Israeli, butwere not eligible to bidonthe irrigation testingcontract. The contract then
was awarded to the best eligible bidder, but the winner provednot to have sufficient
knowledge andcapacity to implement the contract.

4.4     The SAR identifiedthree risks: (a) the potentiallack o fwillingness o f investorsto
invest insmall-scale irrigation, and o f financial institutions to provide medium-term loans for
investments inthe sub-sector; (b) poor management by APROFA; and (c) a potentialreversal
bythe Government o fits current private sector approachto development. The project design
minimized the risks byincludingprovisions for capacity buildingof selected Malianbanks
staff; stringent management rules andprocedures; an intensive supervision; anda gradual
implementation.

4.5     Although the project's preparation studies hadproposed that project implementation
be entrusted to an association of irrigation professionals, AMADIP, the Bank went along
with Government wishes to entrust APROFA with implementationinthe hopes o f fostering
better synergies betweenATPPP andPPIP. QAGcarried out a quality-at-entry review o fthe
projectinMay 1998, andratedthe project design as marginalbecausethe project concept and
objectives were unclear, the technical soundnesswas not well established, andbeneficiaries
were primarily the non-poor, as considerable equity capital would beneeded for irrigation
investments, APROFA's poor management capacity, and a weak monitoring and evaluation
system. Unfortunately, implementationproblems occurred early on as APROFA was unable
to meet the challenge o f managing two pilots, especially since the participation of
beneficiaries indecisionmakingandmonitoring o f activities was not built into the design. A
project strategy or a business planto help systematize implementationwere not clearly
definedbyAPROFA. Farmers lost interest inthe project once they realized that PPIP's               .
primarypurposewas not landtitlingper se, andPPIPcame to beperceivedas targetingonly
those farmers who either had a landtitle, or who farmed their own family land.

4.6     Ittook nearly a year to recruitPPIPstafffor APROFA's central andregional offices.
Due to APROFA's poor performance, its staffwere dismissed inDecember 1999, and the
project stood at a standstilluntila new team took over 11months later. Project activities
were resumed inMarch2002 when a rural engineer and an agricultural economist were
recruited. The agricultural intensificationcomponent didnot start untilDecember2001, and
the irrigation equipment testing untilOctober 2002 -resyiectively, 9 months and 18 months
beforeproject closure (the project was granted a nine-month extensionto March 31,2003).
The anticipated cooperative agreementswere signed in 1998 with most ofthe entities
involved inirrigation (Le., IER, DNAMR, DNAER, andPSPHR), but were not actually
implemented.

Outcome

4.7       The project resulted inonly 10 ha o f irrigated land beingrehabilitated andno new
investments insmall-scale irrigation schemes, compared with the expectation that the
project's technicalassistanceefforts would induce on-farm investments leadingto the
rehabilitation o f 400 ha o f irrigated land and the establishment o f 600 ha of newlyirrigated
land. The impact onprivate sector development was also insignificant since financial
institutions didnot show a willingness to finance small-scale irrigation. The PPARthus rates
overall project outcome as highly unsatisfactory.

RELEVANCE
4.8       The project's development objectivewas complex and expressedina compounded
and overlappingway inthe SAR.4' These composite objectives became confusing, ambitious
anduntargeted, complicatingthe implementationofapilot operation. Nonetheless, PPIP's
stated objectives meshed well with the Government's 1992Master Planfor Rural
Development, updated in2002, which called for the provisiono f capacity buildingto
producers' organizations (POs), government withdrawal from andthe promotion o fprivate
sector involvement incommercial activities, andinvestments inrural development programs;
the Bank's 1994 CAS which promotedboth agricultural andprivate sector development; and
the Government's irrigation strategy, updatedinthe early 2000s, which aimed at stimulating
private investments insmall-scale irrigation. The project's development objective remained
consistent with the Bank's 2003 CAS, which focused on helpingto implement the first PRSP
o f 2002, which inturncalls for better water management as a key to rural development,
along withpilot actions and operations to expandsmall-scale irrigation. Inaddition, the 2007
PRSP promotes improvedirrigationwater management andincreased adoptiono fproduction
intensificationtechnologies by facilitating access to equipment, modem agricultural inputs,
andcredit.

4.9       Inprinciple, the project design includedtheingredientsnecessaryfor achievingits
objectives, although some o fthese (access to credit andlandtitling) would have beenbetter
addressedina separate, and not a pilot operation. Ifimplementationhadtaken place as
intended, there would likelyhave been an expansion o finvestments insmall-scale irrigation.
Buttheproject hadtoo manycomponents (seven) for apilot operation. Project design also
attempted to address two issues-access to credit and landtenure -that were too complex


40. Includingan overalidevelopmentobjective, aspecific medium-termobjective with severaltargets, and objectivesof
training.

                                                               26


 to beresolved in a pilot operation andreally requireda stand-alone operation to be
 effectively addressed.No logframe was developed andno coherent chain of causality was
 established.A list ofmonitoring indicators with yearly targets was agreed upon at
 negotiations, but it was composed mostly o f input and output indicators, falling short o f
measuring someproject impacts such as profitabilityo f investments; impact on production
 andon income and employment generation; etcS4lAn environmentalanalysis was conducted
 andthe project designincludeda detailed environmental mitigationplanwithtechnical,
 institutional, and legislative measures.

4.10       Inconclusion, projectdesignwas overly complex which ledto insurmountable
implementationproblems. This PPARrates the overall relevance o f the objectives andthe
design ofthe project as modest.

EFFICACY
4.1 1 The PPlP failedmarkedly inachievingits objectives. Compared with the expectation
that the project's technical assistance efforts would induceon-farm investments leadingto
the rehabilitationof about 400 ha o f irrigatedlandand the establishment o f about 600 ha o f
new irrigated                the project resulted inonly 10habeingrehabilitated andno new
investments insmall-scale irrigation schemes. The PPP never reached full development
following an apparent systemic breakdown, andthe constraints ofthe irrigation subsector
were not alle~iated.~~

4.12       The testing o f irrigation equipment and agricultural intensificationtook place only
towards the end o f the project, didnot incorporate any assessmentof economic viability, and
were inconclusivebecauseresults could not be validated over several cropping seasons. No
low-cost technology capable o f increasing the income o f small-scale irrigation producers was
validated. Farmers didnot have sufficient time within the life o f the project to adopt the
equipment andtechnologies which showed positive results. The two firms selected to
performthe irrigation equipment tests (after a lengthy selection procedure lastingover two
years) provednot to have the requisite ~ k i l l s . 4 ~

4.13       The impact onprivate sector development was insignificant. Entrepreneurs and
service providerswere no better able to draw up investmentplans, nor financial institutions
willingto finance small-scale irrigation. Dueto the poor training andcapacity buildingo fthe
consultingfirms that were to help entrepreneurs prepare loan applications, the proposals were




41. These were mentioned under section D, "Reporting, Monitoring, Supervision and Evaluation", SAR page 25.

42. SAR, "Project Objectives", page 9.

43. As mentionedinthe SAR, para. 1.21: ``The key constraints inthe sub-sector include: (a) use o f primitive technology and
inefficientdesign andmanagemento f equipment; (b) farmers' limitedaccess to technical andmanagerial support services;
(c) producers' marginal accessto credit; (d) limited formal landtenure arrangements; and (e) limitednumber of technically
skilled private consultants and consulting firms."

44. American andIsraelifirms, which were the most competent inthis area, were ineligible due to the type offimding for
the project, and it was not possible to changethe source o f fundingmid-project for procedural reasons. IDA'SInterimFund
excluded procurement fiom non-contributing countries, which includedIsrael andthe United States.

                                                            27


not o f sufficient quality. Only one loanrequest was appr~ved.~'Training was infrequent,
inadequately supervised, not of good quality for the most part, andnot sufficiently integrated
into a training plan suitedto the farmers' and entrepreneurs' needs, although some specific
traininghadpositiveimpacts, as discussed below. Only 20 producers' groups o f 70 planned,
obtained legal status, but their financial, managerial, and O&M capacities were not
improved, except inrelationto maintainingpumps. The 20 groups remained at the fledgling
stagewithout the capacity to provide services to their members without further assistance. No
significant transfer ofknowledge or expertise took place since a databank andmarket studies
results remained on file at APROFA and were not disseminated to the intendedusers.

4.14       Few farmers adoptedthe new small-scale irrigation technologies, andprivate
suppliers andmanufacturers of irrigation equipment didnot experience an increased demand
for their services. Indeed, no market for irrigationequipment exists inthe regions where PPIP
was implemented (Kati, SCgou, Sikasso). A limited selection o f equipment and spare parts
can only befound inBamako. Only one other private small-scale irrigationdevelopment
activity was implemented duringthe time o fPPIP, which also faced issues o f farmers' access
to credit similar to PPIP.46

4.15       Onthe other hand, the project had someminor achievements which could ultimately
translate into higher incomes for farmers, andimprovements intheir ability to select and
maintainirrigationinvestments. The preliminary results o fthe agricultural intensification
testingwere promising, andahighlighto fthe project,47but these results didnot leadto
increased investments and their economic sustainability could not be established within the
project's life. The training of farmers on O&M enabled a few o fthem to maintaintheir water
pumps,without always havingto hireamechanic.48The testingofirrigationequipment has
optimizedthe usage of equipmentpower per surface areaunder flood irrigation agriculture.
(This showed that a 5 KVA motor pump should be used for a 0.25 ha surface, comparedwith
the previous farmer practice o fusing a 5 KVA pump for a surface o f 1ha or more.) One
irrigation technique that was tested, namely the simplifieddrip system usinglocally available
materials, showed promise inreducingboth labor costs and fuel costs for pumpingbut was
not adoptedbecause farmers could not access credit for investments insmall-scale irrigation.
And anirrigationprototype(termed "exhaure sur arrosoir" byAPROFA) that was fashioned


45. Thirty sevenloanapplicationswere preparedout of330 anticipated. Only seven applicationswere submittedandone
was approved-a 1.5 millionCFAF loan-comparedto the 920 millionCFAF anticipated at appraisal.

46. This was supportedbythe Pen-UrbanProject financedbyFrenchCooperation, which includedasmallprivateimgation
component to helpprivateirrigatorsobtain credit. This project distributedfree pumpsto thosewho hadalandtitle, and
providedaccessto modeminputs.The scopeofthe componentwas limited sindless than 10out ofthe 25 submittedloan
applicationswere approved. The componentwas not consideredasuccess andwas closed shortlyafterwards.

47. InKati for example, farmers were ableto get better yields (3-4 times higher)on h i t s andvegetables inseason, andto
plantVegetablesout ofseasoninthe winter months, apracticeintroducedby PPIP(aresultofbetter husbandryinadditionto
imgation). The cultivatedareaunder vegetables increased3-fold. Farmersnow use phytosanitaryproductsadaptedto
vegetable productionandnothomeremediessuch as gasolineandbleach.Vegetable productionhasmoved fromsubsistence
to commercialbecauseofthese successesandthe ability to planttwice ayear. With imgation andthe openingupof
markets, millet production-whichusedto bethe productionofchoicebeforePPIP(and ATPPP) -is gradually
disappearingandbeingreplacedbytomato andother vegetable production.

48. Hiringamechaniccan cost 500 to 2,000 CFAF dependingon the diagnosis, while farmers spendless andrepair things
faster ifthey cando the maintenance andrepairsthemselves.

with existingtraditional irrigation equipment was manufacturedby local artisanstrained
through PPIP andadoptedby few farmers.

4.16      The IEGmissionwas toldby donors, NGOs, andbeneficiaries that PPIP was
important inexploring the concept o f small-scale private irrigation inMali. The project
createdthe desire to move from the traditional to the modem, provided elements to enable a
year-round anddiversifiedproduction, and showedthe results that are possible ifall
necessaryrequisites cometogether -such as abetter adaptedirrigationsystem, modern
inputs, financing, andalandtitle or secure tenure. The knowledge about small-scale
irrigation inMaliwould not be at its current levelwithout PPIP. But the PPIP didnot remove
the keyconstraintsinthe small-scale irrigationsector, andits failures far overshadowedits
successes, whichwere too diluted and scattered. Thus, this PPAR ratesefficacy as
negligible.

EFFICIENCY
4.17     The ICRwas not able to perform a cost-benefit analysis49on the basiso fthe
demonstrationsandtests that were performed alone, but gives examples ofhow farmers'
income couldbenefit from PPIP's activities. For example, usingthe simplifieddrip system
testedbyPPIP and for aninvestment o f CFAF 400,000ha (about US$700), producers could
achievea 60 percent reductioninlabor costs and a40 percentreductioninfuel costs for
pumpinginthe first year, while at the same time ensuring more uniformwatering that should
generatehigher yields over the mediumterm. The ICR concludedthat such equipment could
pay for itselfas early as the first year by the reduced labor and fuel costs. As a second
example, the agricultural intensification tests showed yieldincreasesrangingfrom 25 to 75
percent, andevenmore than 100percent insome cases.

4.18     The PPAR obtained anecdotal evidence, basedon discussionswith beneficiaries,
which concurs with the ICR findings. A beneficiary inS6gou adoptedthe recommendations
of atechnico-economic study done byPPIPto modernize his irrigationsystem andplant
orangesinsteadofbananas. H e reported that his returnwas 7.5 millionCFAF on 2.5 hain
2004, comparedto only 1.5 million CFAF ifhe hadkepthis bananaplantation andhis
traditional irrigation system. This ledhimto replicate the systemon another 3 haalready, and
to envisagereplicatingon an additional 4 hectares.Another beneficiary inSikasso installed
an irrigation systemon 2 ha ofhis fields after he saw the results o fthe irrigationtests because
thiswouldtriple the revenue fromhisbananafields. Onehectareo firrigatedbananasbrought
in 1.5 millionCFAF, comparedto 500,000 CFAFwithout irrigation. He alsoadopteddouble
cropping dueto the results ofthe agricultural intensificationtesting. Plantingmaize with
bananasbrought inan additional 300,000 CFAFha. Farmerswho plantvegetables out of
seasoninKati can sell their tomatoes at the farm-gate price of200 to 240 CFAFkg,
comparedwith the price of 30 CFAFkg for the in-seasonproduction. Consequently, such
farmers are reported to make three times more money and to enjoy a higher standardo f living
now thanwhen they practicedonly subsistencefarmingbefore PPIP.

4.19     These results are also due to the increasedopportunities for marketing agricultural
products resultingfrom the ATPPP, and due to other donor interventions which supplied


49. This waspresumablydue to the lack ofinformationandreliabledata onwhichto basethe calculations.

                                                29


modeminputs andmicro-credit throughNGOs. The results ofPPlPcannot be separatedfrom
these other interventions, but the PPIP did add the focus on irrigation. Althoughsome
positive results have occurred, these are rare -such as the farmers who investedinthe
rehabilitationof 10haof small-scale irrigation schemes, and the very few who adopted
improved technologies through their own investments-and do notjustify a government
investment o f US$2.21million. Therefore, the PPARrates efficiency as negligible.

Riskto Development Outcome

4.20    The project design did not make any provision for transfer o fresponsibilities after
project closure. However, duringimplementation, the project didmake an attempt to foster
the sustainability o f PPIP's anticipated benefits by commissioning an institutional
organization study which recommendedthe creation of an APROFA-Association, that would
represent beneficiaries, participate indecision making and supervise project activities,
thereby fostering a greater sense o fownership onthe part o fbeneficiaries to sustain the
project's interventions. However, this recommendation was not implemented.

4.21    Onthe positive side, the LEGmissionto Mali collectedevidence that theprogramo f
intensificationtesting (which was the main success o f the PPIP) was being sustainedintwo
localities, Segou and Diawara, at the request and expense o f farmers. The Kati Market
Gardening Association (AGMK) reportedthat laborers who worked inthe vegetable fields in
Katihadtaken the technologies to their villages, and those who had access to credit and
moderninputs were adopting them. A farmer in SCgou, who hadrehabilitatedhisirrigation
system andplantedorange orchards instead o fbananas on 2.5 ha, has already replicated this
on another 3 ha and envisages doing so onhis remaining4 ha o f land. The neighbors of a
farmer inSikasso, who had adopted irrigationtechnology onbananas, replicated this on 10
ha at their own expense. However, this evidence suggests only localized, as opposedto
widespread adoptiono f successful activities, andonly when the requisitecomplementary
elements were available (such as landownership and financial resources). Therefore, the
PPARrates the risk to development outcome as significant.

BankandBorrowerPerformance

BANKPERFORMANCE
4.22    The quality at entry is rated unsatisfactoryas described under "Design and
Implementation", the development objective was relevant but complex as stated under
"Relevance", and four successive task managers handledproject preparation. The quality o f
supervision was moderatelysatisfactory:the Bank's supervisionteam exhibitedcontinuity,
aproactive approach, flexibility inaddressing issues ina changing environment; focused on
the adequacy o f Bank and government inputsfor implementationand onthe achievement of
development impacts; provided detailedadvice for correcting shortcomings andimproving
implementationperformance; introduced a new activity -the intensificationtests -to
magnify the benefitsunder the "testing" component; and attempted to remedyAPROFA's
implementationdeficiencies by commissioning aninstitutional organizationstudy.However,
the Bank should have followed up more forcefully on its ownrecommendations. The Bank
team was not always realistic inratingproject performance; andbelatedly ratedthe project as
a "problem project" inDecember 2000 anddrew up an actionplanto restore it to normal

                                                       30


status. Inaddition, it was not clear to the IEGmissionwhether the Bank properlyadvised
APROFA concerning the rules governing the grace period after project closure.50Overall, the
Bank's supervision missions did little to improve the project's operations or the achievement
o f its objectives. Thus, the PPAR rates overall performance as moderatelyunsatisfactory.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
4.23     The performance o fthe Government i s rated unsatisfactory.The Government
actively participated inproject preparation, launchworkshops, and supervision missions.
However, the Government insisted on entrusting project implementationto APROFA, and
didnot accompany this decision withproper oversight o fAPROFA's activities. This decision
backfired andhinderedthe achievement o fthe project's objectives due to poor activity
implementationand fiduciary management. The Government didnot follow up on the Bank's
recommendationto transfer implementationresponsibilityto APROFA-Association and
actively involve it indecision makingandproject implementation. This compromisedthe
transition arrangements (belatedly agreedupon in2001) and the sustainability o fthe services
provided through the project. The assets and equipment acquired byAPROFA were not
transferred to beneficiaries and the irrigation and well-digging equipment have remained
with APROFA andstored away to this date.51

4.24     The performance o fthe implementingagency is rated highly unsatisfactory.Some
key staffwere hiredonly few months before project closure. Beneficiaryparticipation and
consultationdidnot take place. The agency put up strong resistance to the transfer o f
monitoringkontrol to the APROFA-Association, whose involvement would have facilitated
beneficiaryparticipationandmight have sustained the provision of services after project
closure. The agency failed to create synergies with other sector institutions, or even between
the two projects it was managing. APROFA's fiduciary management was also weak.
Procurement and contract management were done accordingto government processes and
not accordingto Bank procedures agreed-upon inthe DCA, which entailed a lengthy process,
takingupto two years for some contracts, anddelayed the implementationo fcomponents.
Several contracts were procuredcontrary to Bankprocedures, thereby resultinginineligible
expenses andthe accumulation o f a number o fpersistent creditors. APROFA handled its cash
flow anddisbursement requestspoorly, thereby causing delays inbudget replenishment and
fiequent postponement o f seasonal activities. It didnot follow throughon Bank
recommendations for improving its management. The disbursement ratewas low andonly 53
percent ofthe credit was spent at project closure. Finally, no monitoring and evaluation o f
the project's outcomes andimpacts were done, so that decisionmakingwas not made on the
basis o f systematic data.

4.25     Takingeverythinginto account, the PPARrates overallBorrower performance as
highlyunsatisfactory,compared to the ICRrating o funsatisfactory. The cumulativepoor
performance o f the Government andthe implementing agency had a major negative impact
on the achievement of the project's objectives.

Monitoring and Evaluation

4.26    The overallquality ofproject monitoringand evaluationi s ratednegligible. Project
appraisal gave due attention to M&E interms of the establishment o fperformance indicators,
the assignment o fresponsibilities, frequency, and the collectionprocess. However, the
performance indicators were not sufficiently detailed for a pilot operation. These were mostly
composed of input andoutput indicatorsthat were not conducive to helpingdecision makers
ininterpreting projectresults andinsteering or amendingproject activities.

4.27    Socioeconomic surveys were conducted duringprojectpreparationto set a baseline
for theproject. Some activity reportswere produced duringproject implementation. Input
data, and some output and outcome datawere collected at the regional level, but this took
place outside any integrated M&E and at ICRpreparation. The plannedstudies and surveys
on monitoringthe incentives for private irrigation development, on impact evaluation, and on
the taxationandsupply of inputsand sparepartswere not carriedout. The M&Esystem was
not well-embedded institutionally, didnot have sufficient stakeholder ownership, and
functioned only intermittently, reflecting the apparent disinterest o f the implementing agency
and the Government. Itwas simply unable to alert project management o fthe need to amend
activities or the direction these activities should take.

5.      Other Issues (Safeguards, Fiduciary, Unintended
        Outcomes-PositiveandNegative)

National Agricultural Research Project (NARP)

5.1     One unintendedproject outcome was the motivationit createdinother Malianinstitutes,
andresearchinstitutes inneighboringcountries, to copythereformsimplementedthroughthe
project. Other entitiesthat worked on administration ingeneralor researchinparticular startedto
thinkofabouttransformingthemselvesintoanautonomousbody, to evaluatethe statusand
capacity oftheir staff, andto give themTORSor letters o fmission. For example, the Malian
NationalCouncil for Scientific andTechnical Research, which isresponsible for sciencepolicy,
started to copy CNRA's reforms. And agricultural researchinstitutes inBenin, Gambia, and
Guineehavevisited andconsultedthe IERontheir ownreforms.

5.2     TheNARPstrengthened financial management withthe introduction o fnew software
that allowed for improved analysis o f expenditures through greater coding flexibility. The
CNRA made research available on the basis o fresearch contracts, and cut fundingwhen the
respective contracts didnot perform. However, IERresearcherscomplained bitterly to the
IEGmissionthat researchproposals hadtaken too longto beapproved -upto two years in
some instances-andthe funds hadbeenreleasedtardily. The CNRA respondedthat the
IERhadoften failedto producejustifications for their expenditures inatimely fashion. In
fact, IER's financial management was weak duringthe project due to inadequately trained
personnel, andpoor internalaudit capacity. The 2000 audit o f IER's statement o f
expenditures underscoredthis and raised questions regardingthe appropriateness o frecorded
transactions. This also prompted USAID, at the time, to manage its assistanceto IER directly
through setting up its own office on IERpremises. At present, as a result o f technical

                                                            32


assistanceprovidedby several donors, the IERhas improved its financial management so
thatthe management ofits finances hasno longerbeenoverseenby expatriates since 2003.

AgriculturalTradingandProcessingPromotionPilot (ATPPP)

5.3        The SAR stated that "although no negative environmental impact i s likely,
environmental concerns will be addressedduringproject implementation as they arise, and
duringthe mid-termreview." However, the wide adoption, as result ofthe ATPPP, ofthe
improved artisanal conservation cases for onions inthe SCgouregionpresenteda negative
environmental impact which was neither notednor addressedby the MTR or later. A CIDA
study showedthat about halfaton o flocally-harvested wood was used for the construction
andmaintenance o f a single conservation case. A mitigationplanshould have been adopted
to plant trees to replace those that were cut, or wouldbe cut inthe fbture, since the areais
noted for its scarcity inwooded lands. Onthe other hand, the processing o f agricultural
products, encouraged andenabled through ATPPP, reduced the incidence o f solid waste -a
positive unintended outcome, since solid waste disposalmanagement is lacking inMali.

5.4        ATPPP missed an opportunity innot constructingwholesale market facilities in
Bamako, Segou and Sikasso, where opportunities for domestic and export markets abound.
As a result, producer associations reportedinsufficient marketingopportunities for their
produce and subsequent losses o frevenues, especially duringthe peak harvest time. They
also cited hardships due to makeshift sale points subject to weather extremes.

5.5        The software, SAARI, that was usedby APROFA to manage its accounting system
was not conducive to monitoring expenditures by component but only by expenditure
category. WhenAPROFA's financial audits o f 2002 and2003 were completed inFebruary
2004, these showed a satisfactory result with no qualifications, andconfirmed APROFA's
debts at CFAF 202 million(30 percent ofwhich was due to ATPPP) includingstaff
indemnities, consultant fees, training, studies (40-50 percent o fthe total), and operational
costs. The Government took the decisionto pay back the debt inAugust 2006.

Pilot PrivateIrrigationPromotion(PPIP)

5.6        Assisted by FAO-CP, the Government conducted an environmental analysis and
preparedamitigationplanincompliance with Bank safeguards. However, the mitigation
planwas not implementedsince no significant expansion insmall-scale irrigationtook place.

5.7       As mentionedbefore, procurement andcontract management were done according to
Government processes(and not accordingto Bankprocedures as hadbeen agreed uponinthe
DCA), which entailed a lengthy process, takingup to two years for some contracts and
delayingthe implementation o f component^.^^ Several contracts were procuredcontraryto
established Bankprocedures, entailingineligible expenses and the accumulation of a number
o fpersistent creditors. The implementing agency had great difficulty planningits purchases
andorganizingtheminto aregularlyupdatedprocurementplan. APROFA handledits cash


52. The delivery ofirrigationequipmentwas considerablydelayeddue to the procurementproceduresfollowed,but also due
to the politicalunrest inCBted'Ivoire. The irrigation equipmentwas deliveredinSeptember 2002, six monthsbeforethe
project's extendedclosingdate.

   flow and disbursement requestspoorly, which causeddelays inbudget replenishment and
   fkequent postponements of seasonal activities. Whenthe audit reports for 2002 and 2003
   were completed inFebruary 2004, these confirmed APROFA's debts at CFAF 202 million
   (70percent o fwhich was due to PPIP).


   6.       LessonsandConsiderations for FutureDevelopment

   6.1      Several lessons ofboth a substantive andproceduralnature have emerged from this
   review:

   (1)    Meetingthe challenge of pro-poor agricultural growth requires addressing a
          number of institutional constraints that farmers inMali face in relation to rural
          finance, landtitling, and the provision of public services such as wholesale market
          facilities.

   6.2      The needfor potentialbeneficiaries to have greater access to credit inorder to
   magnify the scale o fproject benefits was a common denominator inall three projects.
   Agricultural production and relatedactivities such as irrigation, trading, andprocessing are
   viewed as highrisk, especially for perishables and high-end exportable products such as
  mangoes. InMali, the formal financial sector is almost completely absent from the rural
   economy becausebanks are not generally interested inaccepting the highrisk, the low levels
-- o f collateral, and the hightransaction costs involved inlendingto smallholders or community
   groups.The inability o fmostruraldwellers to invest from their ownresources inmodem
   agricultural inputs, small-scale irrigation equipment, small-scale processing, and storage
  infrastructure hinders them from expanding their productive investments or entering into new
  forms of productive endeavors. Unlessthere is greater accessto credit, agricultural
  development programs andprojects will continue to bypass the 80 percent o f farmers who
  are poor and serve primarily the 20 percent who are better off as well as a small percentage
  of the agriculture-related entrepreneurs (ago-processors, transporters, traders, exporters).

   6.3      More secure landtitles (which are not customaryto have inMali's landtenure
  system) are also a prerequisite for many farmers to invest intheir land. Under customary law,
  a farmer cannot plant trees on landallotted to himthat does not belong to himor his family
  (since this i s considered to be staking a claim on the land). This makes it more difficult for
  farmers to invest insmall-scale irrigation andto engage inhighend crops such as oranges,
  bananas, andmangoes since these involve the planting of h i t tress. Having a landtitle
  wouldmakeit more feasible for farmers to invest inthese more profitable crops andmagnify
  their revenues.

  6.4       The experience with ATPPP also showedthat the Government shouldnot disengage
  from providing public services such as the constructionhehabilitation o fwholesale market
  facilities. Inthe absence o f a "sponsor," less well-to-do farmers, or those who didnot live in
  large agglomerations, were unable to access the makeshift structures o fthese agglomerations
  andtherefore benefit from the extraproductionfostered under ATPPP andPPIP.

(2)    Ambitious andunrealistic developmentobjectivesandprojectdesigncomplicate
       implementationandsupervision.

6.5     Two out o f the three projects (ATPPP and PPP) tried to do too much. Eacho f their
designs comprised several components and subcomponents. The ATPPP, which was a pilot,
aimed to improve the production-to-marketing chains o f several products, as well as ago-
processing, and its development objective suggested that the project would bring about a
sustained growth inthe agricultural trading andprocessing sectors at the national level. The
PPIP, which was also a pilot, comprised seven components and aimed to address two issues
-landtitlingandaccesstocredit-whichwereclearlybeyondthescopeofapilotproject
andwhich warranted separate and specific operations.

6.6     Itwouldhavebeenbetter for NARPto concentrate, first, onthe major anddifficult
institutionalreforms -which wwe brutal and swift, and prompteda lot ofcomplaints from
IERstaff-while also including the other researchinstitutions inthe reformprocess, and
only second, onresearch relevance and quality. I t would have beenbetter for bothATPPP
andPPlPto concentrate their activities onthe learningexperience, ratherthanconducting
them as full fledged investment operations, and spreading them too thinly over many
activities. The unrealistic objectives and design necessitateda scalingback o f activities under
ATPPP -such as refocusingon only four crops rather thanthe large array inthe SAR, and
project implementationinonly two regions rather thanthree -and caused confusion in
understanding what andhow things shouldbedone inthe caseo f PPIP, thereby contributing
to its systemic breakdown.

(3) Effectivestakeholder representationindecisionmakingand in validating resultsis
       importantto the successof public-privatepartnerships.

6.7     This lessonhasbeen incorporatedinto the design o f the follow-on projects, PASAOP
andPCDA. Stakeholders mustbe engaged early on inpublic-privatepartnerships, and kept
engagedinorder to ensure effective ownership and sustainabilityo fresults. As the project's
clients, beneficiaries shouldbe able to influence the project's work program and spending
decisions, andshould cosponsor certainproject activities. However, it wouldbenecessary to
broadenthe participant base o fthe respective producer and other community-based
organizations inorder to ensure effective representation o f all potential beneficiaries.
Although the NARPmade huge steps towards involvingresearch users inprogramming and
validating research results, ifthe beneficiarieshadbeen fully represented andinvolved in
validating IER's technologies, this would havepressured the IERto reorient its work to
benefit the majority o f farmers who are poor and less able to invest inmodeminputs. More
effectivebeneficiaryrepresentation would have enhanced the pro-poor focus on the project.

(4)    Overestimatingthe readiness ofthe Borrowerto implementaprojectleadsto
       unavoidableimplementationdelays andcostly changesinprojectdesign.

6.8     For the NARP,Bankmanagement decided to declare the project effective even
though the conditions o fproject effectiveness were not met. These conditions were only
fulfilled intheir entiretytowards the end oftheproject, which resultedinthe satisfactory
achievement o f the development objectives by the end ofthe project, but unnecessarily
delayedproject implementationat the beginning and prompted a threat of suspension around

                                                 35
                                                                                  0
the middleo f the project. These conditions involved the legal establishment o f CNRA and
IER as autonomous bodies independent ofthe MDRE; the transfer o f ownership of vast plots
ofproductive landfrom the Ministryo f Finance to IERina country where land pressures are
increasing; and the loss o f controlby differentMinistries on a large employer, the IER. In
such an environment, the Bank overestimated the Government's readiness, ownership, and
willingness to implementthese hardpolitical decisions, andthe Bank's acquiescenceled to
the cancellation of some important activities that influencedthe sustainability o fbenefits, and
the needto spendmore inone locationto the detriment o f others. Datedcovenants and
conditions of effectiveness and disbursements didnot prove effective inkeepingthe
Government to its pledges on a timely basis, and the Bankwas viewedas havingbacked
down on its conditionalities.

(5)   For projectssupportingprivatesector development, implementingagenciesneed
      to have a results-orientedcultureand should sub-contract the managementand
      implementationof certainactivitiesto privateservice providers,includingNGOs.

6.9     This lessonhasbeenincorporated into the design o fthe follow-on project, PCDA.
Boththe ATPPP and PPIP suffered from having an implementing agency that was not
attuned to the private sector development nature o f the two projects, that didnot respect the
Bank's fiduciary processes, andthat didnot conform to a culture o f accountability. While
intensive training inthe Bank's fiduciary processes could have alleviatedthe fiduciary
compliance issue, public sector agencies such as APROFA do not have all the required skills,
theresults-oriented culture, or the efficiency for directlymanagingall the interventions
rangingfrom civilworks to capacity-buildingactivities, which APROFA, the implementing
agency, chose to do itselfunder PPIP. Contracting out the management ofthese activities to
private sector providers and other entities such as NGOswould have resultedinamore
efficient delivery o f services to the private sector, including farmers. This hasbeenwell
demonstrated bythe only successful activity o fPPIP-the intensificationtests -which
were contracted out to an NGO, CECI.

Annex B                                           46


Annex B. Mali's Agricultural Sector

With apercapitaincome ofUS$300in2004, andpercapita agricultural income at US$124
in2002, Maliis one oftheworld's poorestcountries.The ruralsectordominatesMali's
economy and social structure: rural areas account for about 80 percent o f the country's
populationo f 13.5 million, and agricultural activities occupy about 70 percent ofthe
country's labor force. Small-scaletraditional farming dominatesthe agricultural sector and
subsistence farming (primarily of sorghum, millet, andmaize) accounts for morethan 70
percent of the 4.6 millionhectaresof landunder cultivation. Only 82 thousandhectares of
landare irrigatedcomparedto Mali's estimatedirrigablepotential of 1millionhectares.
PovertyinMali i s primarily aruralphenomenon, with more than70percent ofthe rural
populationbeingpoor. Fighting poverty means providing economic opportunities to rural
dwellersto improve their incomes and livelihoods.

Although the agricultural sector is mainly oriented to the domestic market, agricultural
exportswere the mainforeign exchange earner (upto 80 percent) inthe 1990s, untilgold
exports becamemore important inthe early 2000s. The mainagricultural exports in2004
were cotton fiber (30 percentoftotal exports), which i s exported to Europe, andlivestock (4
percent), which i s exportedto West Afi-ica, especially C8te d'Ivoire. Hides andskins
accountedfor just under 1percent o f exports, while other agricultural exports -such as
shelled groundnuts, fish, cotton threads andmaterials, cottonseedoil, and mangoes-each
accountedfor 0.5 percent or less.

Agriculture contributed an average of46 percent to GDP duringthe period 1987-1993,
declining slightly to an average of43 percent from 1994to 2004, the year inwhich the CFA
Francwas devalued. At that time, the share ofthe secondary sector (notably gold) beganto
rise. Nonetheless, agriculture i s still the largest sector o fthe economy and the devaluation
increasedthe competitivenessofMalianproducts on international markets (for mangoes,
beans, and sweet peas) and on regionalmarkets (vis-a-vis imports such as potatoes from
Europe). The agriculture sector grew at the average rate o f 3.5 percentper year during the
period 1987-1993, declining to 2.6 percent per year from 1994to 2004 due to the low
productivity growth associatedwith the continued use o ftraditional technologies, and low
andirregular rainfall. Agricultural growth was ledbythe expansioninriceproduction at 9.3
percentper year -grown mainly for domestic consumption as a substitute for importedrice
-andincottonproductionat6.3percentperyear,grownmainlyforexport.

The average annual growth inreal GDP was 3.0 percent during 1987-1993 and5.7 percent
from 1994to 2004. Taking into account population growtho f2.7 percent per year, real GDP
per capita grew at 3.3 percent from 1994to 2004. However, this growthhasnot resultedina
matching decrease inruralpoverty, whichhasremainedat around 73 percent sincethe first
Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper (PRSP) was issuedin2002, due to the inequitable
distribution o fthe benefits o fgrowth.

Increasesinthe agriculturalproduction o fmarketable crops (notably rice andcotton) and
subsistencecrops (notably millet, sorghum, maize) have occurred since 1994. These
increaseshavestrengthened Mali's food security andenabledthe country to become
substantially self-reliant inbasic foodstuffs -decreasingthe need, for example, to import

                                                               47                                                      Annex B


rice. Liberalizingthe marketing ofcereal crops inthe late 198Os, ina programviewed as a
model inWest Afkica, removed restrictions on transporting cereal crops across regions and
improved food distribution throughout the country.

The Priority PlacedOnAgriculture

The GovernmentofMali andthe World Bank concur that the development o fthe agriculture
sector-fYomproductionto marketing -is an essential ingredient o fthe overall rural
developmenteffort. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period 2004-
2006 incorporatesthe recommendations o fMali's 2002 PRSP, which inturn reflect the
aspirations of Government's Master Plan for RuralDe~elopment.~~these strategiesaim            All
to acceleratebroad-basedgrowthbytapping more systematically into the country's important
agricultural potential and by strengthening capacities o fthe private sector to seizemarket
opportunities. The Bank hasbeen strongly supporting the implementationof Government's
rural developmentstrategy through itsportfolio o f investment and adjustment operation^.^^

The Government's 2007-201 1 PRSP, which i s about to be approvedby the Council of
Ministers, emphasizes the important role that the modernization ofagricultural production
and supply chains playinaccelerating economic growth andpoverty reduction. The PRSP
aims to achievethis through increasedprivate investment and access to credit to modernize
production, better landand water managementto minimizevulnerability to climatic
fluctuations, improvedaccess to markets, the provision andutilizationo finformation on
marketsandtechnological advances, andthe creation ofacoherent institutional andincentive
framework to foster the professionalization ofrural actors.

Challengesand Opportunities

The Bank's latestCountry Economic Memorandum for Mali, indraft anddue to be published
in2007, notesworrisome trendsinthe agriculture sector: agriculture's declining average
annualgrowth and contribution to GDP growth, and its low andessentially unchangedland
productivity (except for rice), with overall yields increasing an average o fonly 1percent a
year. An analysis conductedusinga social accounting matrix to understandthe links between
the sectorsinMali's economy suggests that agricultural growth would have the largest
positive impact onrural households, which are among the poorest. The failure to improve

priority actionprogramsthat were integrated into the Government's 2002 PRSP: (a) support for agricultural services and
producer organizations; (b) development o frural infrastructure and farmingequipment; (c) promotion and improvement of
the competitiveness o f agricultural supplychains; (d) stimulation o f exports of agricultural, forestry, livestock and fishery
products; (e) intensification anddiversification o f agricultural production; (f) reinforcement o f food security; (g) promotion
o ffinancing o fthe ruralsector andrural credit; and (h) management o fnatural resourcesto sustain rural development.

54. Inaddition to the threeprojectsbeingreviewed inthis PPAR, this includes the Agricultural Services Project (FY91,
USS24.4 million), the Natural Resources ManagementProject (FY92, US20.4 million), the NationalRural Infrastructure
Project (FYOO, US115.1 million), the StructuralAdjustment Credit 3 (FY02, US$85.0 million), the Agricultural Services
andProducer Organizations Project (FY02, U W 3 . 5 million), the Agricultural CompetitivenessandDiversificationProject
(FY06, US$46.4), andthe Rural Community Development Project (FY06, US%60.0million).

productivity is an important prerequisite for general economic development, employment
growth, and povertyreduction.55Inthe same study, a cross-sectional analysis o f data from
the World DevelopmentIndicators found that a 10percent increase incrop yields could lead
to a 6 to 12percentage point reductioninpoverty (defined as the share o f the population
living on less than$1 a day). Froma pro-poor perspective, with over 80 percent ofMali's
populationdependingon agriculture and with its comparative advantage residing in
agriculture andallied activities, declining agriculturalgrowth and stagnant agricultural
productivity growth are o f great concern.

Opportunities to reverse these trends, which also emerged as important factors inthis PPAR,
tend to fall into four broadareas:

    0    Access to modern inputs, including irrigation, in an organized input supply system to
          improve productivity and enable output growth over two cropping seasons rather than
          the traditional one cropping season.
    0    Access to a reliable market (domestic, external, and agro-processing), which comes
          from improvedmarket information; better organizationandcoordination o f
          producers, processors, and traders; and a dependable logistics and infrastructure
          system (such as rural roads, wholesale markets, conservation and cold storage, sorting
          andpacking facilities, refrigerated trucks, etc.)..
    0    Access to quality information on improved technology (including more suitable
          varieties, husbandrypractices, water management, post-harvest handling, and
          processing), which is related to the quality o f research andextension services as well
          as research-extension-farmer linkages.
    0    A strong institutional and incentiveframework at all levels o fthe production,
          processing and marketingchain, withproper attentionto product quality, landtenure
          andpropertyrights, andaccessto credit.

Some horticultural crops may represent an exceptionto the overall trends inagricultural
growth andproductivity. The productiono f onions andtomatoes increased by over 200
percent and 100percent, respectively, duringthe period 1999-2004 through a combinationo f
area expansion and yield increases, but this subsector represents a very small -albeit
growing-share o f agricultural value added. Horticulture i s an important exceptionbecause
itrepresents diversificationaway from anagriculturalproductionsystem basedoncottonand
traditional subsistence crops such as millet and sorghum, andbecause it expands the export
base. Horticultural crops are also a common aspect oftwo o fthe three projects (ATPPP and
PPIP)that this PPARcovers, while the thirdproject (NARP)provides a basic service
(research). Nonetheless, studies have shown that constraints to increasinghorticultural
growth andproductivity also exist, including:

    0    Lack o ftimely research andextension programs for these crops to improve crop
         varieties, farm-level techniques (including irrigation), andprocessing andmarketing
         capabilities

Annex C. Monitoring andEvaluationinthe Three Projects

NationalAgricultural ResearchProject

DESIGN
The project design didnot include a logical framework. Nonetheless, the correlation between
project activities (institutional reform andresearch impact) and the development objective i s
straightforward andhigh. The S A R included detailed guidelines onthe process o fmonitoring
and evaluation o f financial management, relevance, coherence, quality and impact o f
researchprograms, at both the CNRA andIERlevels.56

The NARPinstituted a monitoring and evaluation system of the technical and financial
aspectsofresearchthat was composed of amultitude o f checks andbalances at all levels,
which ifused according to plan, wouldhave given decisionmakers sufficient information to
reorient researchprogramming and financing. The NARP also providedtraining on impact
evaluations. The process was well imbedded institutionally since i t was part o fthe ratified
institutional reforms, covered several aspects o fM&E, and is still inpractice up to the
writingo fthis PPAR, althoughthe economic evaluationoftechnologies has been laclung
which has hamperedits utility. Not muchthought was givento demonstrating attribution o f
results to the project, except that it was understoodingeneral terms that the proposed
institutional reforms under NAFW could not but positively influence research programming,
implementation, and results. Data for evaluations was to be collected directly by external
reviewers through interviewswith researchersandbeneficiaries andreviews o fresearch
results, by CNRA staffthrough periodic visits to the CRRAs andthe field, and bythe
researchersthemselves conjointly with extension agents.

The SAR includeda list o fimplementationprogress indicators for a number o f inputs and
outputs (e.g. intermediate institutionalreform checks) but with no quantitative andtime-
boundtargets and which didnot fully reflect the project's development objective. With
respect to a baseline, the NAFW didhighlightthe needto take stock and evaluate all past
researchresults inorder to constitute a data base to better design research and extension
activities. Only some, but incompleteinformation was available at the time.

Despite the weaknesses inthe implementationprogress indicators listed inthe SAR, the
strong designo fthe M&E system warrants a rating o f substantialbecause its objective was




56. This included (a) independentexternalreviews ofongoingresearchprogramswith reviews ofproposedadjustments,
commissionedbyCNRA;(b) ad-hocvisits byCNRA's Scientific CommissionandIER's science coordinatorsto the
CRRAs, and monitoringand evaluationofresearchunderimplementation; (e) periodic independentfinancial and scientific
auditsfor all donors, including the Govemment, commissionedby CNRA, (d) key indicators (benchmarks) aspart of IER

which would thenbetransmittedto the ProgramCommittee; (f) small ad hoc impact evaluationsofresearchon beneficiaries
conductedby teams o fIERresearchersand extensionagents; and (g) researchresultspresentedinnational dialect to, and

  aimed at impr~ving.~~

  IMPLEMENTATION
  The baseline, or inventory and description o f technologies available, was not done duringthe
  life of the project. However such adocument now exists, preparedunderthe follow-on
  project, PASAOP. Duringthe implementationo fthe NARP,more input and output indicators
  were addedto the original list butthese did little to better represent the development
  objective. Boththe original and extended lists o f indicators were measured andthe data was
  presented inthe ICR.

  The implementation o fthe monitoring and evaluationo fresearchwas mixed. Although the
  joint impact assessments (withthe extension service and researchusers) were not carried out,
  most components were carried out?*

            Two independent external reviews were done as anticipated
            Twelve impact assessmentswere conducted
            The annual financial audits were carried out
       0    The evaluation of researchproposals by CNRA was done, as well as the monitoring
            o fimplementationandprogress towards results, inaccordance with the research
            programmingcycle
_-     0    Research proposals includedkeyindicators, drawing on the work done through the
            Dutch PAPERproject
       0    Research results were presented inthe national dialect to, and validated by, the CRUS
            at the annual regionalprogrammingsessions.

  Monitoring data has beenanalyzed to some extent since the CNRA has reportedthat it
  stopped financing a number o fresearchprojectsbecauseno results were achieved after
  several years ofimplementation. Onthe other hand, CNRA has also reportedthat some
  projects have not been stopped at the expressedrequests o f farmers, even though these have
  not shown results for several years.

  The software SAC (Suivi-Appui-Conseil), which was financed by PAPIER and allowed
  tracking o fresearchactivities andresults, was installed only towards the eqdo fNARP-too
  late to properly evaluate project outputs. IERresearchers at theNiono CREW reportedto the
  IEGmissionthat SAC was not muchutilizedinanycase. Theyhadbeenfurnishedwithonly
  one computer andresearcherswere constrained to takingturns feeding data into the system.
  There were no designated dataprocessors at the level o f the regionalcenters, andthe
  computer capacity was inadequate to handle the software operation, causing more stress to
 the scientists. Inaddition, there was ageneral sense o fmistrust andunwillingnessto expose


 57. It shouldbenotedherethat the evaluationofPAPIER'soutcomefound that the M&Esystemwas rather heavy and
 inefficient, absorbingtoo much energy from the researchers,but without elaboratingfurther. In the opinion of this PPAR, it
 was necessaryto install a rigoroussystemof checks andbalancesinorder to sensitizethe stakeholdersto the needto do
 researchfor results andto instilla culture ofaccountability, which hadnotbeenthe practice inMali's NARS inthe past.

researchresultsto others before these hadbeenpublished becauseof intellectualproperty
concerns.

However, the IERhasmonitored the implementation ofits researchcontracts, but not
evaluatedtheir results interms o f economic viability. Similarly, the CNRA has monitored
disbursementsandnot theprofitabilityofresearchprojects. Itwas clear to the IEGmission
thoughthat CNRA was well involvedinM&E, but the IERwas less interested. Itwill
probably take more time to instillthe culture o f accountability inresearcherscomparedto
administrative personnel.

The trustworthinessof data collected, andthe financial andeconomic impact o f technologies
developedanddisseminatedduringNARP,cannot be validated on a large scale, as
mentionedgbove under"Efficiency". The ICRpoints out that these impact assessment results
are only indicative only since the studies' sample size was too small to extrapolate impacts
andno other studieshavebeenundertakento measurethe cost-effectiveness ofresearch
before andafter the project.

The sustainability ofthe instituted M&E systemi s good at the moment becauseofthe
continued financingbyPASAOP and other donor projects, for whom M&E is ofhighvalue.
However, it is not likely that M&E functions will continue beingimplemented at the same
rate inthe absence o f external funding. The implementation of the M&E system is rated
modest inview ofthe partial collection ofimpact data, andthe lack o fevaluation of
economic viability.

UTILIZATION
There is no evidencethat the M&E results were utilizedto cause shifts inthe implementation
ofNARP.As mentioned above, the implementationprogressindicators measuredonly some
inputandoutputindicators.

The M&Eofresearchmeasuredimplementationprogress, recorded some researchresults,
andpromptedthe CNRA to cut fundingfor somenon-performing researchprojects after
severalyears ofimplementation. But this didnot adequatelymeasurethe adoption o f
technologies or the financial impact on farmers, and there is no evidence that this was
triangulatedwith other available evidence. No economic evaluation o ftechnologies was done
to enableaclassifidation oftechnologies by types o f farmers (wealthy, medium, andpoor) in
order to focus researchonpoor farmers.

The experienceofthe NARPhashadan impact on subsequent interventions. The follow-on
PASAOPhasincorporated severallessons from the NARPinrelationto (a) research-
extensionlinkages; (b) the User ResearchFund; (c) facilitating users' participation in
technology generation, dissemination andM&E; (d) developing technologies that correspond
to the diversityofsocio-economic andago-ecological constraints; and(e) involving
Community-BasedandProducer Organizations indesigningbothtechnology generation and
transferprograms andinmakingthe public andprivate entities involvedinagricultural
servicesmore accountableto the beneficiaries.

                                                        53                                                Annex C


However, the only direct influence o f the implementationprogress indicators inthe NARP's
S A R on the design o f PASAOPhas beenon the monitoring of the number o f research
contracts fundedunderthe pilot User Research Fund(the number and value as percentage o f
total initial fund). Under the NARP,the User Research Fundwas utilized at only 20 percent
of anticipated levels due to several factors: (a) the duplication o frequests throughthe CRUS
and the User Research Fund; (b) the difficulty for research staff to translate the needs of
beneficiaries into fundable proposals; (c) the lack o ftools to assist beneficiaries inplanning,
implementing, andmonitoringresearch activities; and inmany cases (d) the submission o f
proposals which were more o f a request for fbnding inputs. A major criticism o f the Fundhas
beenits distance fiom users. Thus PASAOP has incorporatedfinancing for regional demand-
drivenresearch and development subprojects submittedbybeneficiaries and focusing on
resolvingconstraints to small-farm productivity and income generation.

Thus, for the most part, the M&E findings have not beenutilizedto influence either decision
makingwithin the NARP,or subsequent operations. The PASAOP hasbenefitedfrom the
expressed opinions o f government officials andother stakeholders who worked on the NARP
andhelpedinthe PASAOP's preparation, but not from any written M&Ereports. Therefore,
the M&Eutilizationis ratednegligible.

Basedon the ratings of substantial, modest, andnegligible for the design, implementation,
and utilizationo fthe M&Esystem, respectively, the overall M&E quality is rated modest.

AgriculturalTradingand ProcessingPromotionPilotProject

DESIGN
The design of the ATPPP predated the Bank requirement for a logframe. However, the S A R
didstatethat "monitoring and evaluation will focus on: (a) the effectiveness o f services
provided to private entrepreneurs, either by the Agency or by other institutions; (b) the extent
to which the project has improvedthe technical andmanagement performance o f agro-
processing entrepreneurs and that o ftheir professional organizations; and (c) the project's
impact on agricultural processing activities and entrepreneurs." The S A R also presented a
table o fkeyperformance indicators to be monitoredper location andper year. But these
indicators were a mix o f input andoutput indicators which could not effectivelymeasure
what the S A R hadmentioned, nor the extent to which the benefits o fthe project accrued to
beneficiaries inorder to assess the achievement o f development objective ina systematic
manner.59Therefore, the relevance o fthe M&E system is consideredminimal.

The S A R mentioned that a baseline beneficiary survey would be conductedprior to project
start-up.Italso assigned responsibilityfor M&Eandmentionedthe processto be followed.60

59. Forexample, the numberof studytours conductedwas measuredwithout consideringwhether export contracts were
signed, howmanywere signed, or their volume over time.

60. APROFA would beresponsiblefor M&E, andMDREandthe Bankfor ensuringproperprojectsupervision.APROFA's
regionalbranches, the professionalassociations receivingsupport, andthe Agency would submit semi-annual progress
reports.Basedonthesereports, andonregular visitsbythe monitoringand evaluation specialist, APROFA's General
Managerwouldprepareasemi-annualconsolidatedprogress reportto be submittedto IDA, MDRE,andthe Consultative
Committee.

Annex C                                                 54


Inorderto facilitate monitoring, the appraisalteamprovidedadetailedoutline ofthe semi-
annual reports to beprepared, including a long list ofperformance indicators (again a mix o f
inputandoutput indicators) to eachcomponent,whichwas agreeduponduringnegotiations.
However, the S A R didnot specify the sources from where this datawouldbe collected nor
the samplingprocessto be applied.

Inshort, thedesignoftheM&E systemcouldonlyprovidedecisionmakerswith information
on the status of inputs and outputs andnot on outcomes or impacts. This wouldprovide little
value for apilot project such as ATPPP indemonstratingwhether the project was succeeding
ininducingsustainedgrowth inthe agricultural trading andprocessingsector, as statedinthe
development objective. Therefore, this PPARrates the M&E design as negligible.

IMPLEMENTATION
The project was not able to renderits monitoringandevaluation unit operational andthe
baselinebeneficiary survey foreseen inthe S A R was not conducted. APROFA's regional
branchesinSikasso andSCgoumonitored their activities and submittedperiodic reports
which served as a basisfor the project's various annual reports. The statisticsmade available
to the ICRmission were preparedex post, on the basis of dataprovidedby the regional
branches, andby the M&Eofficer who was hiredtwo months beforeproject closure. The
absenceof systematicmonitoring clearly contradicts the SAR's provision for "close
monitoringo fmanagementperformance, intensive technical supervision, andregular
evaluationo fthe beneficiaries' response". Duringthe IEGmission, different data sources
outside the project were consultedfor informationon the impact oftheproject onproduction
and trade inthe agricultural products targetedby ATPPP.

A logframewas developedin2001to compensatefor the lack ofit at appraisal. Butfor the
uninformed reader, the chain ofcausality inthe logframe is neither clearnor convincing.
Some o fthe indicators identifiedreflected the achievement ofthe development objective
(e.g., the product marketing chains targetedby APROFA should show an increase in
revenueso fno less than 5-10 percent annually), while others (e.g. APROFA i s an
autonomous andreliable implementing agency) didnot. A separate table for indicators was
also elaboratedas an attachmentto the logframe. This mentioned some baseline information
andtargets for productionandexports for future years. The IEGmissioncouldnot confirm
the baseline figures as thesedidnot concord with statistics giveninthe ICRor from other
sources. Beneficiaries didnot seem to have beenmuch involved indefiningtarget indicators
andinassessingtheir achievement.61The M&Esystemwas not conducive to sustainability or
replicabilitysince most indicators were specific to the inputsandoutputs ofATPPP.

Inconclusion, inputandoutputdatawerecollectedduringthecourseoftheproject, butthe
outcome andimpact dataputtogether at the endo fthe project are not very reliable although
they generally show apositive trend. There i s no evidencethat the datawere analyzedina
methodologically soundmanner. Thus the PPARratesM&Eimplementation as negligible.



61. Unless one countsAPROFA Association, representativeof beneficiaries,who was createdat the same workshop during
which the logframe was developed, andthus, could haveparticipated indefining the indicators.

                                             55                                       Annex C


UTILIZATION
As shownabove, the M&E systemonlymeasuredinputs andoutputs, andnot the outcomes or
impacts on beneficiaries, andthus could not assess whether the theory ofchange or the causal
logic o fthe project was sound. The decision to change APROFA's management team didnot
occur because o fM&Eresults showing the non-performance ofAPROFA, butbecause ofthe
slow disbursement and activity implementation. The experiencewith ATPPP has influenced
the design ofat leastone follow-on project, namely, the Bank-financed Agricultural
Competitiveness andDiversificationProject (PCDA). While ATPPP triedto facilitate access to
credit bytrainingbankofficials on appraising loanrequests, the PCDAprovides for a matching
fundandapartialguaranteefundto help entrepreneursaccess credit as well as the construction
o fcommercial infrastructure such as export facilities, cold chainequipment, storage facilities,
pack houses, andwholesale markets. Eventhis didnot materialize from the M&Eresults, but
fromobservations madeduringthe implementation ofATPPP, andbeneficiarycomplaints
duringthepreparation o fPCDA. The ATPPP madeno attempt to triangulate different M&E
evidence since outcomes and impacts were not measured(or rather reconstructed) untilthe end
o fthe project inorder to accommodate the preparation o fthe ICR. Attempting to triangulate
the dataduringthe preparation o fthe PPAR showed their weaknesses andunreliability.
Therefore, the PPARrates M&Eutilizationas negligible.

Based on the negligible ratings for the design, implementation, andutilization o f the M&E
system, respectively, the overall M&E quality is also rated negligible.

PilotPrivateIrrigationPromotionPilot

DESIGN
Project appraisal gave proper attention to M&E interms o f establishing performance
indicators, the assignment ofresponsibilities, fiequency, and the collection process, while
emphasizing the monitoring o fthe incentive environment, financial monitoring, and
environmental monitoringandmitigation. Section Do f the S A R on "Reporting, Monitoring,
Supervision and Evaluation" set forth an ambitious monitoring and evaluationagendawhich
focused on:

        The effectiveness o f services providedto producers
        The sustainabilityof services
        The extent to which women irrigators as well as other categories o fbeneficiaries
        benefit from the various project interventions
        The extent to which the project improvesirrigationproducers' accessto credit and the
        technical andmanagement performance o finvestments inirrigation
        The profitability ofthese investments
        The project's impact on irrigatedproductionand on income and employment
        generation
        The extent to which the projecthas facilitatedthe formalizationoflandtenure
        arrangements andthe creationo f legally registered producer groups
        The impact on strengthening the institutionalandorganizational capacities o f
        producer organizations

Annex C                                               56


         The impact on strengthening the localbanks' skills inappraising investment projects
         insmall-scale irrigation
         The environmental impacto fproject interventions, includingthe impact onhuman
         health
         The implementationo fthe cost-recovery scheme.

However, this agenda was not accompanied by a logframeor a matching set o f performance
indicators. The indicators presentedinthe S A R and agreed-upon at negotiationswere not
sufficiently detailedfor a pilot operation, were mostly composed o f input and output
indicators, and fell short o fmeasuringmost of the project's outcomes that the S A R aimed to
evaluate. While the indicators reflected the development objective by including such
indicators as the arearehabilitated or putundernew irrigation each year, they were not
location-specific, nor conducive to help decision makers ininterpretingprojectresults andin
steering or amending project activities.

Socioeconomic surveys were conducted duringproject preparation, setting a baseline for the
project. The S A R made provision for annual beneficiary assessments to collect andanalyze
data on the performance indicators, to update the baseline, to assessprogress inrelation to
project objectives, andto identify serious implementationproblems. However, the M&E
design was not well-embedded institutionally and didnothave sufficient stakeholder
ownership. Therefore, the M&E design i s rated modest.

IMPLEMENTATION
Socioeconomic surveys were conducted duringproject preparationto set a baseline for the
project. Some activity reports were produced duringproject implementation. Input data, and
some output andoutcome data were collected at the regional level, but this took place outside
any integrated monitoring and evaluation framework. Environmentalmonitoringreceivedno
follow-up. The planned studies and surveys on monitoringthe incentives for private
irrigation development, on impact evaluation, and on the taxation and supply o finputs and
spareparts were not carriedout.62Beneficiaries were not involvedinany decision makingor
monitoring o fproject activities. Indeed, the M&E functioned only intermittently, reflecting'
the apparent disinterest ofthe implementingagency andthe Government, anditwas unable
to alert project management o fthe need to amend activities or the direction these activities
should take.

The quality at entry review hadpointedout the weak initial reporting and monitoring
documents preparedby the Government, which modeled annual work programs andbudgets
andwhich hadno keyindicators. The review hadrecommendedthat anappropriate project
logical framework shouldbe formulated, keyperformanceindicators selected, and
monitoringprocessesbetter defined. However, there i s no indicationthat a logframewas
developed, or that the M&E was revisedor improved during implementation. As to the
sustainability o fthe M&Esystem, some elements (such as loanrequests submittedapproved,


62. The ICR mentionsthat onlyafew studieswere carriedout, includingthe updatingofbaselinestudies.However the IEG
missiondidnot see evidence ofthis unlessthe ICRmeansthe measuringofsurfacesunder irrigationwhich is aperformance

areas irrigated, andcropping intensity) could be used inabetter formulated M&E framework
infbturesimilar activities. Therefore, the M&E implementationisratednegligible.

UTILIZATION
Inputdata andsomeoutput andoutcome datawere collected, but mostlyoutside the project
M&E system andat ICRpreparation. Inthe absenceofalogframeand an established chain
o f causality, project management could not locate the gaps or assess the soundness o f the
theoryofchange adopted duringproject preparation. Slow disbursement and activity
implementation, and not the M&E system, became the main indicators o fproblems with the
project, prompting the redirectiono factivities at the MTR such as the inclusiono fthe new
subcomponent the "intensification testing". The PPIP's experience has influenced at least one
follow-on project, the Bank-financedPCDA. While PPIP triedto facilitate accessto credit by
trainingbank officials on appraising loanrequests specific to small-scale irrigation, the
PCDA includes provision for a matching fund and a partial guarantee fund to help
entrepreneurs access credit, and contracts out the implementationo f selected project
activities to private operators, both general and specialized. Butthis arose from observations
made duringPPIP's life and from beneficiary complaints duringPCDA's preparation, not
fi-omtheM&E analysis o fPPIP. Therefore, the M&E utilizationis rated negligible.

Basedon the negligible ratings for the design, implementation, and utilization o f the M&E
system, respectively, the overall M&E quality i s also rated negligible.

I.GENERALOBSERVATIONS:

  1.1 Despite many attempts viathe World Bank Country Office inBamako (Mali) to get
        the full PPAR (Project PerformanceAssessment Report) inFrench, only the French
        Executive Summary was available for the Government ofMali, which ineffect
        considerablyreducedthe capacity to analyze and comment on this IEGReport.63

  1.2 Tremendousefforts were madebythe consultantsinorder to determine the outcomes
        ofthe NARP (National Agricultural ResearchProject). The IEGreport provides some
        interesting information that is very usefulto sustainthese outcomes.

        Nevertheless, IEGdoes not explain clearly how the outcomes were measuredand
        rated. There is no clear definition, andit i s difficult to understandthe difference
        between "substantial" and "modest". What is the difference between "unsatisfactory"
        and"moderately satisfactory"? Itwouldbevery helpfulfor IEGto describeexplicitly
        the methodology for this PPAR andto be clear about the measurement methods and
        ratings.

        Overall, ifIEGfinds that the results andthe outcomes ofthe NARP(National
        Agricultural ResearchProject) are satisfactory, the reasonfor this rating should be
        translated into an equally "satisfactory" rating for boththe Bank Performance andthe
        Borrower Performance, becauseall these entities contributed to the good overall
        performame.

  1.3   Concerning the ATPPP (Agricultural Trading andProcessingPromotionPilot
        Project), the analysis from the consultantsprovides anopportunity to consolidate the
        outcomesofthis project inthebroader context o f the national agricultural policy. If
        IEGratesthe project "moderately satisfactory", it wouldbemore understandableifin
        the same logic, boththe BankPerformanceandthe Borrower Performance were rated


63. IEGprovideda completeFrenchtranslation ofthe maintext ofthe PPARto the Bank's countryoffice on
May 22,2007, whichwas forwardto the GovernmentofMali onMay 23. The Borrower's responseis dated
June 7,2007.

Annex E                                       64


     with this same rating. Bothpartnersworked together andconstituted one team for the
      execution of this project. There is no rationale for rating only the Borrower
     Performance "unsatisfactory". Inaddition, the Bank changedthe task managers
     many times andeachnewone brought innew approaches, new proceduresand
     methodologies.

 1.4 Concerningthe PPIP (Pilot Private Irrigation Promotion Project), the evaluation
     revealed that the constraints at the irrigation sub-sector level were never overcome,
     nevertheless, some positiveresults were obtained duringthe experimental production
     phase. Unfortunately, these results were too late to be disseminatedeffectively.
     Therefore, we do not agreewith the Bank's Performance ratingbeing "moderately
      satisfactory" on the onehand, andboththe Borrower Performance andthe overall
      outcome rating for the project being "highly unsatisfactory" on the other hand. In
      addition, it i s difficult to understandandbelieve that APROFA receivedthe execution
      contract for the PPIP (Pilot Private IrrigationPromotion Project) without the consent
      ofthe World Bank.

 1.5 These lessonsfrom the analysis o fthe consultants shouldbereflectedupon and
      inspire the design andthe execution ofupcoming similar newprojects andprograms.

11.SpecificObservations:

 2.1. Paragraph2.5: The Quality Assurance Groupjudged quality at entry to be
      "marginally satisfactory" andthe overall project design as "satisfactory", but stated
      that the Bankoverestimatedthe Government's readiness. Was this anerror of
     judgment? It would behelpful to be very specific about the nature ofthese comments.
      What i s the reasonfor this comment ifthe Government of Mali complied with its
      obligations? (Didthe Government ofMalimiss or not comply with any of its
      obligations?)

 2.2. Paragraph2.11: Itis statedthat the project suffered from anumbero f events. Please,
      note that at the time of the execution o f the project, Mali didnot have anational
      agriculturalresearchsystem. IERwas the mainresearchinstitution at that time, which
      collaborated with PR, LCV and ISFRA.

 2.3. Chapter2.12: The chosenperformance indicators shouldbemore explicit to allow for
      abetter monitoring o fthe attainment o fthe objectives ando f the progress.

 2.4. Chapter2.18: The accounting system was described as the weaker linkwithout any
      argumentor document to substantiatethis statement. No audit documentrevealed
      suchaweakness. Please, explainthis above statement.

 2.5. Chapter2.30: The government performance was rated"moderately unsatisfactory". It
     wouldbe good to better substantiatethis statement with some evidence. The reality is
     that the CRUperformed well although it was difficult to nominate apresidentfor the
      CNRA.
