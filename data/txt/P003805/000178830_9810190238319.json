    construction of about 24 new seed processing centers to be\n            operated by two public corporations and selected\n            cooperatives, and for incremental working capital for these\n            same organizations. It also provides new facilities,\n            equipment, and incremental operating costs for the several\n            government agencies involved in the development,\n            multiplication, and inspection of improved varieties of\n            seeds. The training component includes assistance in\n            starting a new diploma course in seed technology. At full\n            development, project investments combined with those under\n            the first seeds project would provide improved seed for\n            about 40 percent of the total demand for wetland rice seed\n            and 20 percent of the total demand for dryland rice and\n            secondary crop seed. Realization of the full benefits of the\n            project will depend on improved management of the two public\n            corporations involved, progress in the development of new\n            seed varieties for secondary crops, and successful extension\n            efforts to convince farmers of the value of improved seed."}, "docdt": "1981-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
