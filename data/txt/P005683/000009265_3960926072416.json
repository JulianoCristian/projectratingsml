production by the end\n            of the implementation period following environmentally sound\n            practices.  To this end, the project includes (a) forest\n            exploitation and regeneration; (b) forest plantations and\n            private tree planting; and (c) intensified forest\n            management.  Further to this, the project involves (d)\n            forest pasture and range improvement and, finally, (e)\n            institutional development and support.  Apart from\n            production and environmental benefits, which include project\n            action in support of the government program to protect eight\n            world threatened vertebrates, the project will have an\n            important employment creating effect in rural areas."}, "docdt": "1987-07-02T00:00:00Z"}
