Report (ICR) for the first Forestry DevelopmentProject in\n            Tunisia. The project's objectives were to: (a) increase\n            fuelwood and industrial wood production; (b) improve forest\n            grasslands and range management to compensate for grazing\n            areas lost to the closure of forest lands for natural forest\n            regeneration and tree planting; (c) reduce soil erosion and\n            increase water retention to protect the productivity of\n            agricultural lands; and (d) preserve and expand the\n            country's nature and wildlife heritage. The five main\n            components of the project are as follows: (a) forest\n            exploitation and regeneration (mainly thinning of conifer\n            plantations, regeneration of natural forests, and promotion\n            of private sector); (b) forest plantations and private tree\n            planting, improvement of forest nurseries and seed\n            collection; (c) intensified forest management (construction\n            of infrastructure and provision of logistical facilities;\n            (d) forest pasture and range improvement (establishment of\n            permanent and improved natural pastures); and (e)\n            institutional development/support (preparation of a national\n            forest and range inventory, improvement of national park\n            management, training and research). The main lessons learnt\n            are as follows: (a) forest plantation schemes are strongly\n            influencedb y socioeconomic,a nd topographicc onditionsw\n            hich have to be carefully assessed when planning large\n            programmes; (b) efficient project management requires an\n            adequate performance monitoring and evaluation system\n            (particularly early on); (c) complex multi-sectoral projects\n            need special institutional arrangements to develop\n            inter-sectoral linkages or the design needs to be\n            simplified; (d) when consecutive projects overlap additional\n            resources are needed to cater for the work required for the\n            preparation of the follow on project."}, "docdt": "1996-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
