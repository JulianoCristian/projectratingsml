                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has been effective since March 9, 2009. Due to the political situation, OP/BP 7.30 was triggered on March 17, 2009 and disbursements were suspended. Disbursements
                         under Component 1 (cash-for-work) and Component 4 (project management) were authorized to resume in early November 2009, while disbursements under Component 2

                         (community-driven basic infrastructure) and Component 3 (post-cyclone reconstruction) were authorized to resume on May 6, 2010. As project activities were initially delayed due to
                         the political situation, the initial closing date was extended by 18 months to June 30, 2013.

                         Despite a challenging political context, FID project execution remains very satisfactory. Two main components of this project (cash-for-work and post-disaster rehabilitation) have led

                         to the progressive transformation of FID into an effective social protection agency. As of September 30, 2012, 1,696 cash-for-work micro projects have been implemented (exceeding
                         the end-of-project target of 1,600 micro-projects) and 7.9 million person-days of employment have been created providing direct benefits to close to 340,000 individuals (of whom 61
                         percent are women). In addition, 160 community-based basic infrastructure micro-projects have been initiated under Component 2 (Community-based basic infrastructure) (above the
                         end-of-project target of 152) and 304 sub-projects have been initiated under Component 3 (post-cyclone reconstruction) (also above the end-of-project target of 210). In addition, FID
                         has accelerated its response to rehabilitate and reconstruct after cyclones. In the aftermath of the 2012 cyclone season (3 major cyclones named Irina, Giovana and Chanta hit
                         Madagascar in 2012), FID has been able to rehabilitate 95% of the socio-economic infrastructures under its responsibility within 6 months after the cyclone (above the objective of
                         75%). Consequently, Project implementation is very well on track, despite an 18-month initial implementation delay related to the political crisis which emerged in January 2009.

                         Throughout the years, FID has become an important partner in social protection. As a member of the social protection cluster (a forum where donors coordinate their actions in social
                         protection), FID works closely with international development agencies including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Program (WFP), the United Nations
                         Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ). FID has also established a solid partnership with several domestic and international
                         institutions such as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture and Madagascar's independent anti-corruption agency (Bureau Independant Anti-
                         Corruption, or BIANCO). FID also plays an important role in disaster risk management as the Project's third component finances rehabilitation and reconstruction of small
                         infrastructures in the aftermath of natural disasters. Under this activity, FID works with the Emergency Prevention and Management Office (Cellule de Prevention et Gestion des
                         Urgences, or CPGU), the National Risk and Disaster Management Bureau (Bureau National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes, or BNGRC) for the identification of disaster
                         affected areas and the definition of anti-cyclone standards and norms, the Early Warning System (Systeme d'Alerte Precoce, or SAP) which identifies food-insecure areas in the
                         South, and the National Statistics Office (Institut National de la Statistique de Madagascar, or INSTAT).

                         Eventually, FID has entered into partnerships with other IDA-financed projects such as the Growth Pole Project (PIC) and the Rural Development Project (PSDR) to enhance
                         synergies and maximize impacts across projects.
