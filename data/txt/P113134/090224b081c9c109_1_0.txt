                         Context: The Project has been effective since March 9, 2009. Due to the political situation, OP/BP 7.30 was triggered on March 17, 2009 and disbursements were suspended.
                         Disbursements under Component 1 (cash-for-work) and Component 4 (project management) were authorized to resume in early November 2009, while disbursements under
                         Component 2 (community-driven basic infrastructure) and Component 3 (post-cyclone reconstruction) were authorized to resume on May 6, 2010. As project activities were initially
                         delayed, the initial closing date was extended by 18 months to June 30, 2013.

                         Achievement of objectives: Despite an 18-month initial implementation delay related to the political crisis which emerged in January 2009 and a continuous challenging political
                         context, the outcome and result indicator targets have been achieved. As of March 31, 2013, 1,909 cash-for-work micro projects have been implemented (exceeding the end-of-
                         project target of 1,600 micro-projects) and 8.9 million person-days of employment have been created providing direct benefits to close to 368,000 individuals (of whom 61 percent are
                         women). In addition, 160 community-based basic infrastructure micro-projects have been initiated under Component 2 (Community-based basic infrastructure) (above the end-of-
                         project target of 152) and 326 sub-projects have been initiated under Component 3 (post-cyclone reconstruction) (also above the end-of-project target of 210). However, while FID
                         had been able to rehabilitate 95% of the socio-economic infrastructures under its responsibility within 6 months after the 2012 cyclone season (above the objective of 75%), this
                         "response" ratio went down during the last quarter of 2012 mostly due to (i) abundant rains which made it difficult to supply materials to the construction sites, and (ii) the use of
                         schools for exams which required some constructions to be temporarily suspended..

                         Relevance: The project PDOs (which were very relevant before the early 2009 political crisis) became even more relevant to the country's development priorities in the context of the
                         prolonged political crisis. Between 2009 and 2013, through the implementation of this Project, FID may have been the only institution which the capacity to mitigate the impacts of the
                         political crisis through the provision of short-term employment and access to basic social and economic services. With hindsight, both the project design and implementation
                         arrangements have been very appropriate to ensure satisfactory and efficient achievement of the PDOs.

                         Efficiency: The analytical works done during Project implementation confirm that the operation was efficient in economic terms. The cash-for-work component has reportedly saved
                         lives by providing much needed resources to an impoverished population further affected by the impacts of the political crisis (economic downturn, loss of jobs, etc). Razafindrainibe
                         (2011) shows that the Project has been effective to reach the targeted population while much of the proceeds have been used for food consumption. An economic analysis by types
                         of sub-projects (schools, water points, feeder roads...) conducted in 2011 report very high ERR (Ralaivelo, 2011). Also, a Technical Audit conducted in late 2011 indicates that FID is
                         very cost efficient compared to alternatives (for school construction, see Rasolonjatovo, 2013) although sustainability may be improved (Dupety, 2011). Finally, Project's cost
                         efficiency has been high. At 15%, Project's management costs are in line with the end-of-Project target. Following an Institutional Review in 2009 (Ferland, 2009), FID had adjusted
                         its corporate structure to implement the Project with efficiency. A few indicators were used for monitoring purposes only: end-of-Project targets for these indicators could not be
                         specified during Project preparation as they depends on communities' preferences -- which are revealed during Project implementation. Project's financial management, procurement,
                         monitoring and evaluation, and implementation of safeguards have all remained satisfactory during project implementation. A beneficiary assessment is underway and should be
                         complete by end-June 2013.

                         Institution: FID project execution has been very satisfactory during Project implementation. Throughout the years, FID has become an important partner in social protection. As a
                         member of the social protection cluster (a forum where donors coordinate their actions in social protection), FID has been working closely with international development agencies
                         including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Program (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the German Society for International
                         Cooperation (GIZ). FID has also established a solid partnership with several domestic and international institutions such as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the
                         Ministry of Agriculture and Madagascar's independent anti-corruption agency (Bureau Independant Anti-Corruption, or BIANCO). FID also plays an important role in disaster risk

                         management as the Project's third component finances rehabilitation and reconstruction of small infrastructures in the aftermath of natural disasters. Under this activity, FID works
                         with the Emergency Prevention and Management Office (Cellule de Prevention et Gestion des Urgences, or CPGU), the National Risk and Disaster Management Bureau (Bureau
                         National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes, or BNGRC) for the identification of disaster affected areas and the definition of anti-cyclone standards and norms, the Early
                         Warning System (Systeme d'Alerte Precoce, or SAP) which identifies food-insecure areas in the South, and the National Statistics Office (Institut National de la Statistique de
                         Madagascar, or INSTAT). Eventually, FID has entered into partnerships with other IDA-financed projects such as the Growth Pole Project (PIC) and the Rural Development Project
                         (PSDR) to enhance synergies and maximize impacts across projects. These synergies have been further enhanced under the multi-sector IDA operation which is continuing the
                         activities financed under this Project.
