                         The Project Development Objectives are to:
                         (i) increase access to short-term employment in targeted food-insecure areas; and
                         (ii) restore access to social and economic services following natural disasters in targeted communities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has been effective since March 9, 2009. Due to the political situation, OP/BP 7.30 was triggered on March 17, 2009 and disbursements were suspended. Disbursements
                         under Component 1 (cash-for-work) and Component 4 (project management) were authorized to resume in early November 2009, while disbursements under Component 2

                         Despite a challenging political context, FID project execution remains very satisfactory. Two main components of this project (cash-for-work and post-disaster rehabilitation) have lead
                         to the progressive transformation of FID into an effective social protection agency. As of September 30, 2011, 1275 cash-for-work micro projects have been implemented and 5.94

                         million person-days of employment have been created providing direct benefits to approximately 277,000 individuals (of whom 60 percent are women), while 114 community-based
                         basic infrastructure micro-projects have been initiated under Component 2 (Community-based basic infrastructure) and 212 sub-projects have been initiated under Component 3
                         (post-cyclone reconstruction). Consequently, project implementation is on track, despite an 18-month initial implementation delay related to the political crisis which emerged in
                         January 2009.

                         Also, FID has successfully established a solid partnership with several domestic and international institutions such as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of
                         Agriculture, Madagascar's independent anti-corruption agency (Bureau Independant Anti-Corruption, or BIANCO), the Emergency Prevention and Management Office (Cellule de
                         Prevention et Gestion des Urgences, or CPGU), the National Risk and Disaster Management Bureau (Bureau National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes, or BNGRC) for
                         the identification of disaster affected areas and the definition of anti-cyclone standards and norms, the Early Warning System (Systeme d'Alerte Precoce, or SAP) which identifies
                         food-insecure areas in the South, and the National Statistics Office (Institut National de la Statistique de Madagascar, or INSTAT). In addition, FID is also working closely with
                         international development partners including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Program (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the
                         German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ).

                         Eventually, FID has entered into partnerships with other IDA-financed projects such as the Growth Pole Project (PIC) and the Rural Development Project (PSDR) to enhance
                         synergies and maximize impacts across projects.
