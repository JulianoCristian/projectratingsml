                         under Component 1 (cash-for-work) and Component 4 (project management) were allowed to resume in early November 2009, while disbursements under Component 2 (community-

                         Despite a challenging political context, FID project execution remains very satisfactory. Two main components of this project (cash-for-work and post-disaster rehabilitation) have lead
                         to the progressive transformation of FID into an effective social protection agency. As of December 31, 2010, 871 cash-for-work micro projects had been implemented providing
                         direct benefits to about 223,000 individuals (of whom 59 percent are women), while 100 sub-projects had been initiated under Component 3 (post-cyclone reconstruction).
                         Consequently, project implementation is on track, despite an 18-month initial delay related to the political crisis which emerged in January 2009.

                         Also, FID has successfully established a solid partnership with several domestic and international institutions such as the Madagascar´s Independent Anti-Corruption Bureau (Bureau
                         Indépendant Anti-Corruption ­ BIANCO) on the fight against corruption, the Emergency Prevention and Management Office (Cellule de Prévention et Gestion des Urgences ­ CPGU)
                         on cyclonic norms, the National Risk and Disaster Management Bureau (Bureau National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes ­ BNGRC) on the identification of disaster
                         affected areas, the Early Warning System (Système d'Alerte Précoce ­ SAP) in the South, and the National Statistics Office (Institut National de la Statistique de Madagascar-
                         INSTAT). In addition, FID is also working closely with international development partners including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Children's Fund
                         (UNICEF) and the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ).
