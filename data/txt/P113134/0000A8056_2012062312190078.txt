                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has been effective since March 9, 2009. Due to the political situation, OP/BP 7.30 was triggered on March 17, 2009 and disbursements were suspended. Disbursements
                         under Component 1 (cash-for-work) and Component 4 (project management) were authorized to resume in early November 2009, while disbursements under Component 2

                         Despite a challenging political context, FID project execution remains very satisfactory. Two main components of this project (cash-for-work and post-disaster rehabilitation) have lead
                         to the progressive transformation of FID into an effective social protection agency. As of March 31, 2012, 1,468 cash-for-work micro projects have been implemented and 6.9 million

                         person-days of employment have been created providing direct benefits to approximately 305,000 individuals (of whom 60 percent are women). In addition, 147 community-based
                         basic infrastructure micro-projects have been initiated under Component 2 (Community-based basic infrastructure) and 226 sub-projects have been initiated under Component 3
                         (post-cyclone reconstruction). Consequently, project implementation is broadly on track, despite an 18-month initial implementation delay related to the political crisis which emerged
                         in January 2009.

                         In order to develop synergies across sectors, FID has introduced a few training sessions (on HIV/AIDS, family planning, nutrition, erosion prevention, etc) as an integral part of its
                         cash-for-work program. Training is provided to community members and substitutes for up to a few days of work. Importantly, the Ministry of Heath provides on-site child
                         immunization and nutrition support in beneficiary communities during the implementation of cash-for-work programs.

                         Throughout the years, FID has become an important partner in social protection. As a member of the social protection cluster (a forum where donors coordinate their actions in social
                         protection), FID works closely with international development agencies including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Program (WFP), the United Nations
                         Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ). FID has also established a solid partnership with several domestic and international
                         institutions such as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture and Madagascar's independent anti-corruption agency (Bureau Independant Anti-
                         Corruption, or BIANCO). FID also plays an important role in disaster risk management as the Project's third component finances rehabilitation and reconstruction of small
                         infrastructures in the aftermath of natural disasters. Under this activity, FID works with the Emergency Prevention and Management Office (Cellule de Prevention et Gestion des
                         Urgences, or CPGU), the National Risk and Disaster Management Bureau (Bureau National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes, or BNGRC) for the identification of disaster
                         affected areas and the definition of anti-cyclone standards and norms, the Early Warning System (Systeme d'Alerte Precoce, or SAP) which identifies food-insecure areas in the
                         South, and the National Statistics Office (Institut National de la Statistique de Madagascar, or INSTAT).

                         Eventually, FID has entered into partnerships with other IDA-financed projects such as the Growth Pole Project (PIC) and the Rural Development Project (PSDR) to enhance
                         synergies and maximize impacts across projects.
