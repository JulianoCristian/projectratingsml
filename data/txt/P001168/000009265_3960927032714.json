The project will comprise the following seven\n            components : 1) forest protection and management; 2)\n            industrial plantations ( planting of 9,000 ha new\n            plantations and upkeep of 55,000 ha existing plantations );\n            3) protection of the Comoe National parks; 4) finance\n            additional infrastructure equipment and staff for the\n            Forestry Training Schools in Bouafle and Banco; 5) research\n            and studies of natural forest silviculture, industrial\n            plantations techniques, agroforestry, evolution of\n            vegetative cover, incidence of brush fires, and the effects\n            of deforestation on the climate; 6) institutional\n            strengthening in the form of technical assistance to\n            MINAGREF and SODEFOR; and 7) monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1990-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
