(ES), from satisfactory project outcomes to\n            moderately unsatisfactory, sustainability from highly likely\n            to likely, and institutional development impacts, from\n            substantial to only modest, and, while the Bank performance\n            remained equally satisfactory, the performance by the\n            Borrower is also downgraded to unsatisfactory. The main\n            lessons outline that specific, and monitorable development\n            objectives are a strong incentive to effective project\n            implementation, particularly when institutional changes are\n            substantial parts of the implementation schedule. However,\n            justification for Bank involvement in the institutional\n            groundwork of such a long-term process as environmental\n            management, should be built on a clear understanding between\n            the parties, and a commitment by the Bank as to continued\n            assistance. Additionally, it is suggested that the\n            Environmental Management Authority (EMA) be instituted\n            within a neutral part of the government structure, even\n            located outside of it, where no real, or perceived conflict\n            of interest resulting from its environmental activities, may\n            be possible. EMA's decisions should be based on\n            technical, and economic considerations alone."}, "docdt": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
