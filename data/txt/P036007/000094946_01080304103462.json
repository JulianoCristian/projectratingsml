sustainability\n            as highly likely, institutional development impact as\n            substantial, bank performance as satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance as satisfactory. The lessons learned from this\n            project include: 1) Although the benefits of stakeholder\n            participation are now widely acknowledged, it was\n            particularly important for the environmental management\n            authority which sought to change the behavior of firms and\n            individuals. 2) Public awareness and education are effective\n            means of influencing behavioral change toward more\n            environmentally sound practices. 3) The Bank should\n            disseminate these experiences based on the projects it has\n            financed for greater use of team members form other country\n            units in supervision missions and in reviewing project\n            documents. 4) Environmental management organizations should\n            quickly demonstrate their ability to enforce the\n            environmental laws which will address some of these\n            expectations and engender public confidence. 5) Although it\n            is impractical to fully strengthen the legal framework in\n            advance, it is often possible to identify key pieces of\n            legislation that can affect the project's outcome. Such\n            legislations should be passed prior to project\n            effectiveness. 6) A good understanding of the local\n            political pressures or prevailing policies is important in\n            ensuring adjustments in project requirements."}, "docdt": "2001-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
