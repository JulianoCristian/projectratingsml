Management Project is to build effective institutional\n            capacity to plan and implement sound environmental\n            management. Further objectives are to complete a national\n            environmental action plan (NEAP), support a priority work\n            program which will strengthen the legal and regulatory\n            framework, and implement measures for improved environmental\n            management consistent with the findings of the NEAP. The\n            project will provide for: 1) the purchase of computer\n            hardware and software and other office equipment and\n            vehichles; 2) about 150 person-months of international and\n            local consultants who will prepare a NEAP, provide advice on\n            policy, legal and technical matters, and undertake studies\n            on priority areas; 3) training workshops, seminars, public\n            awareness, curriculum development and environmental\n            education; 4) the cost of incremental salaries for staff\n            contracted, support for the Environmental Management\n            Authority, and the incremental costs associated with support\n            of the participating agencies (NGO's, private sector\n            agencies, etc.); and 5) operational and overhead materials\n            and supplies for the project."}, "docdt": "1995-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
