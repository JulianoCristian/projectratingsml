There are four Project components. Component A (the\n            largest) would continue financing transfer payments to\n            beneficiaries o f the Heads o f Household Program who comply\n            with the requirement to participate in workfare or\n            training/education activities. Support would also be given\n            the Ministry of Labor to reorient these activities so that\n            they contribute more to improving the employment prospects\n            of beneficiaries. Component B provides grants for productive\n            sub-projects proposed by small groups of Program\n            participants. Component C covers activities related to the\n            establishing and strengthening employment services in some\n            municipalities and testing instruments to facilitate the\n            labor market insertion of Program beneficiaries.
