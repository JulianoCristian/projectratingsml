would rehabilitate food\n            crops and coffee production through the provision of\n            fertilizer, the extension of credit for labor and farm\n            inputs, expansion of coffee nurseries, purchase of hand\n            tools and the construction of regional farm development\n            centers to improve and reinforce support services in the\n            project area. The project would: (i) help restore food\n            production and (ii) help salvage part of the 1981 coffee\n            crop and increase production in the 1982 and subsequent\n            crops. Coffee yields per hectare could increase from 250 kg\n            to at least 300 kg in the second and subsequent years. The\n            project would help about 10,000 farmers severely affected by\n            Hurricane Allen to maintain, and subsequently improve their\n            incomes. The risks of the project are the possibility of\n            poor credit recovery and non-return of hand tools, and\n            potential weaknesses in field organization of the Ministry\n            of Agriculture. Risks are reduced by providing 154 staff of\n            various levels for field work and supervision, and by having\n            the overall project coordinated by a Management Team of the\n            Ministry of Agriculture."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
