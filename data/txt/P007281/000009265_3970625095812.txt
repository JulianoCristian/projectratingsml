POST-HURRICANE AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
Ihis is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Post-Hurricane
Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1106-HA). The Credit Agreement
was signed on April 13, 1981. The total credit amount was SDR 2.60 million,
as approved by the Board on March 17, 1981. Total Credit disbursement was
SDR 2.52 million, and the final disbursement took place on April 23, 1984.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Region,
Agriculture Division A. The report is based on the findings of a completion
mission in June 1984 and information contained in LAC Regional Files.
The project was not selected for audit by OED as (i) project issues
are common to those of relief projects already audited and (ii) project impact
on agricultural production cannot be measured.
The Project Completion Report was sent to the Borrower for comment
on June 18, 1985. However, no comments have bee4± received.

POST-HURRICANE AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        On August 5 and 6, 1980, Hurricane Allen struck the Southern
Peninsula of Haiti causing extensive damage to agriculture. Following
immediate relief assistance by the international donor community during the
next few months, this project was designed to initiate the rehabilitation
of the agricultural sector over a 16-month period. To this effect, the
Credit financed the procurement of fertilizer to be used for coffee and
food crops, as well as the expansion of coffee nurseries, lending to
agriculture, construction of storage facilities, and purchase of hand
tools.
2.        Due to the emergency nature of this project, no attempt was made
to assess the economic rate of return at appraisal; it was also not
possible to quantify subsequently the agricultural impact of the project.
The findings of the completion report, therefore, rest on judgements of the
completion mission reflecting impressions from contacts with the
implementing agency, extension agents, the agricultural credit institution
involved, and farmers who had benefited from the Credit. Though project
benefits may not have been optimal, the project lessened the harmful
effects of Hurricane Allen on agriculture.
3.        Some of the points of interest and lessons learned are:
- The project, which was appraised under abbreviated
procedures,experienced major delays during the various
implementation stages. At appraisal, IDA was aware of the
limited capacity of the implementing agency to absorb financial
assistance. However, it was decided that there were no
reasonable alternatives available and the overriding
consideration was seen to be the urgent need to rehabilitate
agriculture in the affected areas (para. 4.05); and
- In a wider context, IDA's experience in implementing this project
raiJes the question of whether the Bank Group - with its present
operational procedures - has a comparative advantage in planning
and executing effectively relief measures and short-term
rehabilitation projects. Such assistance may be better left to
bilateral or international agencies that have sufficient regional
and local representation for close supervision (paras. 4.01-4.04).

I. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
A. Introduction
1.01      Hurricane Allen struck the Southern Peninsula of Haiti on August
5 and 6, 1980. While loss of human life and damage of infrastructure were
relatively light, agriculture sustained heavy losses. Coffee, Haiti's
major export crop, which provided the economy with 40 to 50 percent of its
export receipts and ensured significant fiscal revenue through an export
tax, was severely hit. The hurricane struck the trees when they were laden
with beans. As a result, between one third and one half of the 1980 coffee
crop in the hurricane area was lost. Future coffee crops were also
affected, as some 20% of the coffee plants were uprooted or permanently
damaged.
B. Formulation and Objectives
1.02      Immediately after the hurricane, the Government requested
financial assistance from IDA to rehabilitate agriculture in the south and
south-west of the country. Following an exploratory mission in September
1980, an agricultural rehabilitation project was prepared and appraised by
a mission in November 1980, in consultation with USAID and the Department
of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DARNDR), which was the intended
implementing agency. The appraisal followed abbreviated procedures; no
appraisal report was prepared. Negotiations were completed in January
1981. The project was approved by the Board on March 17, 1981, and the
Credit Agreement was signed on April 13, 1981.
1.03      The project consisted of six components:  (i) funding by USAID
and IDA of 5,000 t of fertilizer each; (ii) financing of fertilizer
transportation and storage; (iii) farm credit for labor, fertilizer and
other inputs; (iv) expansion of coffee nurseries; (v) construction of 16
farm service centers; and (vi) procurement of hand tools and implements.
The project aimed primarily at the restoration of coffee and food crop
production for the 1980-81 and 1981-82 crop years (ending in July).
ProJect formulation was based on the premise that the defoliation and
damage of coffee and shade trees would have a serious effect on coffee
production over the next few years, unless trees were fertilized and
properly maintained. Financing of fertilizer was therefore considered the
most important means of rehabilitating agriculture in the hurricane area.
Experience had shown also that after previous hurricanes coffee production
did not attain earlier levels, as marginal land previously devoted to
coffee was partly used for growing food crops. For this reason and because
of USAID's earlier unsuccessful efforts in promoting a pure coffee project
in Haiti, the fertilizer would also be used for food crops.
1.04      When the project was conceived, the Bank Group's involvement in
agriculture in Haiti was limited to the first Rural Development Project in
the Northern Department, approved in January 1977. USAID, on the other
hand, had already beed involved in assisting the coffee sector in the south
through its Smallholder Coffee Project (Petit Planteur Cafeier - PPC). The
PPC loan had financed the procurement of fertilizer, credit to coffee
growers, and construction and equipping of six coffee

research/demonstration centers. By the time the Post-Hurricane
Rehabilitation Project was formulated it was already evident that the PPC
project was ill-conceived because of its exclusive focus on coffee. The
majority of Haiti's farmers are "gatherers" rather than cultivators of
coffee. Over its implementation period, the PPC project had evidenced a
low sub-loan repayment rate, weak coffee extension services, the diversion
of fertilizer to non-coffee crops, and a high attrition rate of
agricultural credit groups organized under the project. The main
achievement of the PPC project was that it introduced the use of fertilizer
and farm credit to growers. Given this situation the Post-Hurricane
Agricultural Rehabilitation Project broadened the use of fertilizer to
include food crops for local subsistence needs.
1.05      Issues that had been discussed in the Bank at the appraisal stage
included the lack of a tested technical package.  Specifically, there was a
perceived need for coffee plants of improved varieties, as local varieties
had been known to be less productive. While the preparation and appraisal
effort of the project had been abbreviated, it was acknowledged that a wore
detailed assessment may not have helped to a significant extent.
Development of a technical package would have required several years of
research. It was evident, however, that some supporting measures were
needed in addition to the provision of fertilizer and the expansion of
coffee nurseries. Becau3e of the severe lack of storage facilities for
fertilizer and other farm inputs, the construction of warehouses, to be
used eventually as farm service centers, was included in the project
design. Another perceived need was the expansion of tool banks to satisfy
the high demand for hand tools such as hoes and machetes in the hurricane
area.
1.06      The original project concept included the financing of a swine
fever eradication program. Though not related to the hurricane damage,
this component was meant to improve the income potential of the Haitian
farmers that had been eroded in parts of the country by the effects of
hurricane Allen. The Bank considered this component, but eventually
decided against it, because the design and administration of a swine fever
eradication program would exceed the scope of post-hurricane rehabilitation
measures. In retrospect, the Bank's position in this context proved right
in view of the Government's difficulties in implementing the
administratively much easier components of the final project.
C. Institutional Constraints and Implementing Arrangements
1.07      When the project was formulated, the shortage of trained
personnel and the weakness of support services, especially at the central
level, were considered the most important constraints to promoting
agriculture in Haiti. Insufficient local funds even for current outlays
for extension services exacerbated the institutional weakness of DARNDR.
It was therefore the strategy of the international donor community,
including the Bank Group, to foster development on a regional basis through
creation of regional development authorities, as was the case with the
IDA-financed Rural Development Project in the North (Cr 675-HA). The only
available organizational structure to implement the Post-Hurricane
Agricultural Rehabilitation Project was DARNDR. Implementing arrangements



-3-
included formation of a coordinating committee in DARNDR and the allocation
to the hurricane area of 154 additional DARNDR agronomists and
technicians. The fertilizer was to be procured directly by DARNDR,
transported to local distribution centers in the project area, and the
majority sold on credit by DARNDR's Agricultural Credit Bureau (BCA). The
Government was to seek to continue the technical assistance being provided
by USAID to BCA, which was already involved in administering credit for
fertilizer and other farm inputs.
D. Project Cost and Financing
1.08      At appraisal, project costs were estimated at US$5.2 million,
about 60% of which corresponded to the estimated cost of procuring
10,000 t of fertilizer. USAID allocated an amount of US$1.6 million that
was still uncommitted under its PPC project to finance half of the
fertilizer requirements of the Post-Hurricane Project.1/ The first 5,000 t
of fertilizer, funded by USAID, were to be used for the 1980-81 crop year,
while the second, IDA-funded tranche of 5,000 t was to be for the 1981-82
crop year. Because of Haiti's extreme budgetary constraints, it was
decided that the IDA Credit would finance 100% of total project cost,
excluding the above-mentioned USAID contribution, and payment by Government
of the salaries of 154 agronomists and technicians to be stationed in the
project area. Of the IDA-funded project components (SDR 2.6 million), the
cost of fertilizer was estimated to amount to SDR 1.1 million or about 40%
of the total Credit excluding an initial deposit into a special account
with the Central Bank to serve as a revolving fund to finance local cost.
The breakdown of the IDA Credit as to categories is given in para 2.05.
II. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Content
2.01      On two occasions before effectiveness of the Credit, the
Government proposed modifications of the project concept as developed at
appraisal. The first modification suggested by DARNDR was to substitute
locally produced organic fertilizer for chemical fertilizer. Organic
fertilizer has a low N-P-K nutrient content, implying that the application
of the required doses of N-P-K would necessitate extremely large quantities
of organic fertilizer. Transport costs would be prohibitive and storage
requirements a multiple of those necessary for chemical fertilizer.
Therefore, no Credit proceeds were used to finance the procurement or
transport of organic fertilizer.
2.02      The Bank did not oppose the second change proposed by the
Government--the inclusion of fruit tree nurseries in the nursery
component. A large number of fruit trees in the project area had been
destroyed by the hurricane and while a fruit tree component could have been
1/ The USAID contribution to the project did not constitute cofinancing
nor parallel financing, as its funding of fertilizer took place under
the PPC project, that was close to completion when the hurricane
occurred. Thus, no attempt was made at appraisal to formalize USAID's
financing of fertilizer as part of the Post-Hurricane Agricultural
Rehabilitation Project.



-4-
justified, the Government did not follow up on its proposal with submission
of detailed plans. In addition, when counterpart funding constraints
occurred at a later stage, the idea to include fruit tree nurseries under
the project was dropped.
2.03      The Credit Agreeient was amended in two aspects on April 29,
1982. One relating to the funding of audits and the other to the mechanism
of the special account as described below. In January 1982, a supervision
mission agreed with DARNDR that the project accounts would be audited by an
international firm and agreed to amend the Credit Agreement to allow for
this. However, the Borrower did not take advantage of this, but agreed to
the audit by an international firm from its own resources after the closing
date of the project. The need for the second amendment was also agreed to
during the January 1982 supervision mission. As originally designed, the
Central Bank was to re'ease funds from Special Account (revolving funds)
against reimbursement documentation submitted by DARNDR, thereby requiring
pre-financing of expenditures by DARNDR. This shortcoming was discussed
with DARNDR and they subsequently requested a change in the mechanism of
the revolving fund to allow the Ministry to use checking facilities.
B. Implementation Schedule
2.04      The appraisal documentation does not contain a disbursement
schedule that could serve as an indication of the originally anticipated
time frame, because the nature of the project as a disaster related program
of rehabilitation measures was seen at the time to require swift action.
By that standard the project performed poorly. The project became
effective after two extensions and all components that required planning
were implemented so late that the closing date of the project had to be
also extended twice: first from September 30, 1982 to March 31, 1983, and
again to September 30, 1983. A summary of important delays experienced at
different stages of the project is shown below.

Closing Date                          September 30,1982   September 30, 1983
Disbursements of Credit funds for most project components were so late that
they took place after the origin,l1y anticipated closing date of September
30, 1982. The delays in effectiveness, as well as subsequent delays in
project execution, were caused by late and not always clearly defined
implementation arrangements.
C. Estimated and Actual Project Cost
2.05      At appraisal the US$ equivalent of the SDR 2.6 million Credit
amounted to about US$3.2 million. However, in May 1982, by the time of the
fourth supervision mission, it became obvious that because of the
strengthening of the US$, the dollar equivalent of the Credit would be
considerably less, and as a consequence so would the amount of local



currency since the exchange rate of the Gourde is fixed vis-a-vis the US$.
When the Credit had been disbursed in April 1984, the US$ equivalent was
about $2.8 million or about US$400,000 below the original estimate. To
facilitate the comparison between estimated and actual costs of the various
project components, the table below presents the original Credit
allocations in a modified way. Each project component was increased by its
proportional share of the unallocated amount. The amount earmarked for
payment into a special account was also proportionally allocated to all
components with the exception of the fertilizer (as it was procured under
direct payment procedures).

2.06      Only in the case of the 16 farm service centers constructed under
the project, did a major cost overrun occur.  The centers are basically
simple storage buildings of 120 m2 per unit. When the first detailed
costing became available in March 1981, the cost of one center was
estimated at US$23,215 equivalent, or US$193 per m2. Site selection and
other preparations for construction were delayed, however, until the spring
of 1983 and the delay of almost two years explains the cost increase of 15%
to about US$221 per m2. The agricultural credit component absorbed more of
the Credit proceeds than had been originally anticipated, as towards the
end of the project some unused funds were allocated to it. The contract
for the supply of fertilizer provided for delivery to main distribution
centers at district level. Therefore only minor transport costs were
incurred in the context of the overall project; these costs were allocated
to the various components.
D. Administrative Arrangements
2.07      To ensure the necessary coordination and project implementation,
the Government established and maintained a coordinating committee in
DARNDR, chaired by the Director General of the Department. Other members
were the General Manager of BCA, the Director of the Coffee Production
Section, the Director of the Agricultural Division and the Chief
Financial Administrator. In spite of frequent changes at the level of the
minister, there was little turnover in the composition of the management
team.



-6-
2.08      The project area is comprised of 11 districts, each of which are
divided into seven administrative subdivisions ("zones"). To the largest
extent possible, DARNDR relied in project execution on the services of its
district staff. This decentralization process was necessary and desirable,
but was not followed up by adequate monitoring at the central level. This
is illustrated by the fact that despite frequent requests by the Bank, only
once during the project did the Bank receive a quarterly progress report,
providing consolidated information on the various components.
2.09      The desirable principle of decentralization of administrative
arrangements was also maintained in relation to groups of beneficiaries.
The appraisal concept in the administration of the coffee nurseries called
for a continuation of DARNLD's involvement.  In October 1981, however,
DARNDR handed over all Government nurseries to the communities in which
they were located. Similarly, to operate the tool banks, extension staff
have been using whatever informal groupings are available, such as farmer
associations, schools, community councils, etc. On a voluntary basis,
representatives of such groups handle the storage, distribution and
redistribution, keeping informal records.
III. PROJECT IMPACT
A. Supply of Fertilizer
3.01      According to the appraisal concept, 5,000 t of fertilizer were to
be supplied in each of the first two years following Hurricane Allen to
rehabilitate the coffee and annual crops production in the Southern
Peninsula. This anticipated fertilizer input compares to an annual
pre-hurricane fertilizer use in the project area of 1,000 to 2,000 t. When
the hurricane struck, stocks in the project area had been about 700 t which
were augmented by reallocation of 400 t of PPC stocks from the central and
northern districts during the remainder of 1980. In 1981, USAID supplied
3,700 t to the project area under its PPC program (which was phased out in
that year) and another 1,700 t under its emergency food program. USAID's
total fertilizer contribution in 1981 was, therefore, of the order of
5,000 t as expected at appraisal. IDA's contribution of the remaining
5,000 t of fertilizer, anticipated for 1982, was imported by DARNDR only in
1983.1/
3.02      DARNDR was not able to provide the completion mission with
information on fertilizer stock movements.  District extension staff were
of the opinion that the TSAID fertilizer supplied in 1981 had been almost
entirely used by the time the IDA-funded fertilizer became available for
distribution to benefiting districts in the period of March to June 1983.
At the time of the completion mission, there were reportedly only a few
hundred tons left of the IDA-funded fertilizer. Data received from DARNDR
on the use of fertilizer financed by IDA were contradictory. They implied
that 5,000 mt of fertilizer had been used entirely for coffee to fertilize
some 8,000 ha of established trees and 9,500 ha of new plantings. Based on
the volume of available seedlings however, the area of new ccffee plantings
1/ The delivery of fertilizer to the various districts is given in
Annex 1.



- 7 -
relating to the fertilizer supplied by IDA could have been at the most
2,000 ha. Moreover, the use of fertilizer for food crops zas permitted
under the project and Bank missions estimated that somewhat less than half -
of the fertilizer used in the project area was used for food crops. The
5,000 t of fertilizer financed by IDA was used in 1983 and the first half
of 1984, so that in each lear the consumption for coffee and annual crops
is unlikely to have exceeded 2,000 to 3,000 t. For coffee only, the
fertilizer use was probably on the order of 1,000 to 2,000 t in 1983 and
1984. Given (i) recommended fertilizer application rates of 500 kg per ha
for established coffee plants and 150 kg per ha for new plants, and (ii)
areas under coffee in the Southern Peninsula of around 71,000 ha, this
input of f=rt1lizer is too small to have had a major impact on production.
Even if it was applied to only 10,000 ha, which the appraisal report
mentions as the worst hit coifee area, the average input intensity of 1,000
to 2,000 t a year would result in an average application rate of only 100
to 200 kg of fertilizer per ha.
3.03      One possibility to try to assess the effect of the post-hurricane
fertilizer supply to the project area would be to analyze coffee production
data during the immediate pre-hurricane and the post-hurricane years. S-c-th
an analysis is made difficult by the lack of reliable statistics on
production and the lag involved between fertilizer application and
increased production. Moreover, in Haiti, coffee growing is characterized
by cycles of good and poor production years, which is a common phenomenon
in countries having comparatively old and poorly managed coffee plantings
(little application of fertilizer, insecticides, pruning, etc.).
3.04      If coffee exports statistics are taken as a proxy for production
statistics, the production in the 1979-80 crop year--prior to Hurricane
Allen-reached a peak in almost two decades. It was, therefore, a
fortunate coincidence that the hurricane occurred in a low production
year. Coffee exports amounted to 24,900 t in 1979-80, dropped to about
13,000 t in the following two years, and are estimated to have
substantially increased again in 1982-83.
3.05      While it is also not possible to quantify the impact of the
increased use of fertilizer on the production of food crops, relative
prices of substitute crops such as red beans or corn continued to move in
favor of these crops and against coffee after the hurricane. These price
movements, therefore, continued to provide an incentive to farmers to apply
fertilizer to food crops rather than coffee. Moreover, land pressure is
very pronounced in Haiti, and the average size of coffee holdings is less
than one hectare. This structural element has the effect of inducing a
shift in output, away from export crops in general towards the production
of labor intensive food crops. It follows, that the project concept of
attempting to rehabilitate both coffee and food crops has in fact been a
sound approach.
3.06      Under the Credit Agreement, DARNDR was to charge a price to
farmers for fertilizer made available by the Department of not less than
50% of cost (including delivery cost) in 1981, and not less than 65% in
1982. At the time of the January 1982 supervision mission, free
distribution of fertilizer by the Government had ceased and the subsidy
amounted to 50%. In spite of representations of early supervision
missions, a further reduction of the subsidy never took place, DARNDR



-8-
arguing that the maintenance of the 50% subsidy was required to induce
farmers to continue to use fertilizer. The failure to reduce the subsidy
is unfortunate, since subsidization in general is likely to encourage
inefficient use of resources.
B. Expansion of Coffee Ntarseries
3.07      The project made a modest contribution to a reversal of the
downward trend in coffee plantings and production and in attenuating the
effects of Hurricane Allen. The IDA-funded nursery program more or less
replaced the growing of coffee seedlings under US.ID's PPC project which
phased out in 1981.1/ The program funded by IDA started in early 1982 and
ended in 1983. About one million seedlings were produced in 1982-33 and
about four million in 1983, equivalent to about 85% of the appraisal
target. The total of 5 million seedlings corresponded to the planting
requirements of some 2,500 ha or 5% of the 47,000 ha which were affected by
the hurricane.
3.08      The nurseries were established as vrivate and community nurseries
with supervision by DARNDR's Coffee Division.  DARNDR provided the input
and paid participants for labor costs. In 1982, a large number of
contracts was cancelled in four districts because of poor quality of
plants. Supervision missions reported that overall the condition of the
nurseries was mediocre to satisfactory. The seedlings were propagated
from improved varieties (about bOZ Caturra) but farmers had limited
experience in nursery operations. The coffee extension service in the most
westward located areas was understaffed and lacked transport. The Credit
Agreement provided that DARNDR maintain, until completion of the project,
154 extension staff of various levels. The staffing siruation varied
little during the life of the project and in r;.id-198/t there were still 135
staff in the project area, many, however, with limiteJ experience in coffee
growing.
C. Agricultural Credit
3.09      At appraisal, it was expected that because of hurricane related
needs BCA's short-term loans in the project area would risp sharply from
G 3.4 million (US$680,000) in 1979-80 to around G 5.5 million (US$1.1
million) in 1980-81. During the 30-month period between signing of the
Credit Agreement in April 1981 and closure in September 1983, BCA's total
cumulative disbursements for short-term credit in the project area amounted
to G 17.4 million (US$3.5 million) confirming the anticipated surge in
credit demand. As during the same period BCA's cumulative collections from
farmers relating to short-term subloans amounted to G 10.9 million (US$2.2
million), the incremental credit demand was G 6.5 million
(US$1.3 million). Reimbursements by IDA totalled G 2.5 million
(US$500,000).
3.10      The IDA Credit provides for use of proceeds of the credit for
importation of fertilizers in bulk for DARNDR and for short-term onlending
to farmers by BCA, an agency of DARNDR responsible for agricultural
1/ An overview on the USAID and IDA coffee nursery programs is given in
Annex 2.



-9 -
credit. Lending for fertilizers was included as part of the on-lending
component. Although the project extended over 2-1/2 years, IDA
disbursement of US$0.5 m for credit were made on only two occasions and
were for only a fraction of BCA's on-lending during the 2 1/2 year period.
Although on the two occasions when IDA disbursements were made against
on-lending, some double financing of fertilizer was involved (because of
other disbursements against bulk purchases), when considered over the
entire project period, it would not have constituted any double financing.
3.11      BCA's short-term lending is primarily to Societes de Credit
Agricole (SACs), precooperative groupings established for credit purposes.
Subloan repayment rates to SACs in the project area averaged about 85%,
compared to only 25% for the ill-fated Smallholder Coffee Project
(para 1.04). Statistics on the size of benefitting farms are not
available. Subloans partially funded under the Credit had an average size
of US$1,800 equivalent. Given the average SAC membership of 10 farmers,
the average subloan per farmer was about US$180 equivalent. Though
statistics on the size of benefitting farms are not available, the small
size of subloans indicates that beneficiaries have been mostly small
farmers.
D. Construction of Farm Service Centers
3.12      The 16 farm service centers built under the project in remote
areas have been constructed by small village contractors with construction
materials provided by DARNDR. Their location is given in Annex 3. They
are stores with a floor area of about 8 x 12 m and, depending on the season
can be used to store fertilizer and other inputs, or crops, or serve as
meeting rooms. As they were constructed towards the end of the project,
only one supervision mission and the completion mission had an opportunity
to visit two or three of them. The centers visited had been well
constructed and were in use. At appraisal, the Government proposed
funding for over 60 of such centers and it is safe to assume that most, if
not all, of the 16 centers built under the project are serving a useful
purpose.
E. Expansion of Tool Banks
3.13      Tools and implements (shovels, machetes, hoes, levers, bars,
sprayers, wheelbarrows, etc.) were procured locally by DARNDR in the fall
of 1982.  They have been used at the level of district subdivisions (zones)
to carry out soil conservation works and to construct and maintain darth
roads in coffee and crop production areas. USAID-financed tools and
implements, provided prior to procurement of those funded by IDA, were
distributed to districts ou.side the project area. Under the supervision
of district extension staff, tools have been issued by participating
communities to work teams engaged in community work as well as to
individuals. A supervision mission reported that in the case of the tool
banks visited, the extension service had little control ovk!r the use of the
tools and these did not appear to circulate much. However, 6'ven the small
size and multitude of tools, to depend on informal groups for their
administration seems to have b-r' the only practical solution.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERF0RKMNCE
A. Government
4.01      The institutions involved in project implementation have been
DARNDR and BCA, a Department of DARNDR. The very nature of the
project--disaster relief and rehabilitation--did not permit the Government
ana IDA to pursue institution building objectives. Rather, the task was
swift and efficient project implementation to the extent possible, given
the institutional constraints that were known to exist when the project was
formulated (para 1.07). Major delays in project implementation were the
result of DARNDR's limited institutional capacity. This has been
illustrated, inter alia, by DARNDR's performance in procuring and
accounting for the use of the project's assets.
4.02      Procurement.  Given the emergency situation, implementation
arrangements could have been planned after negotiations of the project in
January 1981, to be ready for implementation following effectiveness of the
Credit. This did not bap-,n. At the time of the original closing date,
September 30, 1982, cly 27% of the Credit proceeds had been disbursed,
reflecting delays in physical project execution. In spite of the existence
of a special account that had the functions of a revolving fund, the
Government did not take full advantage of this mechanism. The procurement
of fertilizer through international competitive bidding called for direct
payment procedures, unrelated to the Central Bank's special account. In
January 1982, six months after the original effectiveness date of the
Credit, the drafting of the invitation for bids had not been initiated.
Similarly, the sites for construction of the farm service centers were not
surveyed before July 1982, i.e., two months before the original closiug
date of the Credit that was designed to be implemented in 16 months.
4.03      The special account never served the function of a revolving
fund. Requests for replenisbment could have been submitted to IDA even
before the mechanism was changed to permit the use of checking facilities
by DARNDR in April 1982. DARNDR had already pre-financed the expansion of
nurseries and the disbursement of agricultural credit, as noted by the
first supervision mission. The special account was drawn on by DARNDR
between June 1982 and July 1983, without DARNDR substantiating withdrawals
to IDA and requesting replenishment. When towards the end of that period
all direct payments and the initial deposit into the special account had
reached the ceiling stipulated in the Credit Agreement, the special account
was dissolved. Only then did IDA receive the documentation on expenditures
financed through the special account.
4.04      Audit.  After the January 1982 supervision mission, the Credit
Agreement was amended to provide for payment of the services of an
international audit firm from the proceeds of the project (para 2.03).
Following supervision missions pursued the need for an adequate audit
arrangement and held discussions with one of the two international audit
firms that are fully represented in Haiti. However, instead of annual
audit reports, DARNDR submitted only one audit report in March 1984. This
report was prepared by a local audit firm, and covered only part of the
project expenditures during the period July 1982 to September 1983. On the



- 11 -
occasion of the completion mission, a final and complete audit by an
international firm was agreed upon at ministerial level. This audit
commenced in September 1984. As of March 1985 a draft audit report has
been prepared for discussion with Government. The delay was caused by a
new Minister having been appointed to DARNDR.
B. IDA
4.05      Adopting abbreviated procedures, IDA prepared, appraised, and
negotiated this project in three months. The project design followed
priorities that are still considered justified (paras 1.03 and 1.04). The
shortcomings in project formulation are more than compensated for by the
time gained in responding quickly to an emergency situation at the
appraisal stage. Given the serious institutional constraints of DARNDR,
which IDA was aware of when the project was formulated, project management
would have benefitted from the provision of one or two technical assistance
staff, who may have been funded under the Credit. IDA's supervision of the
project was relatively frequent, but consisted generally only of a hurried
follow-up of the implementation issues. In July and October 1981 two
supervision missions spent a day each in the field to follow up on
conditions of effectiveness. Subsequently, between January 1982 and August
1983, five missions spent in total 23 man-days in the field (including two
missions of three man-days and one mission of one man-day). Most missions
combined supervision of the project with that of other projects. While the
frequency of contacts with the implementing agency was probably adequate,
it is probable that the project would have benefitted from more intensive
supervision.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
5.01      The project, designed as a rehabilitation effort following an
emergency, was executed with a delay of more than one year, which
constitutes a time overrun of 75% compared to the anticipated schedule of
16 months. At appraisaJ IDA had noted the limited capacity of DARNDR to
absorb financial assis. ice. The project could not be implemented in the
time frame anticipated. Provision of technical assistance staff to help
execute the project would probably have sped up its implementation. Its
benefits have probably not been optimal, but the project lessened the
harmful effects of Hurricane Allen on agriculture in the project area.
5.02      In a wider context, IDA's experience in implementing this project
raises the question of whether tne Bank Group--with its present operational
procedures--has a comparative advantage in planning and executing
effectively relief measures and short-term rehabilitation projects. Such
assistance may be better left to bilateral or international agencies that
have sufficient regional and local representation for close supervision.
