   Power Project is to provide adequate transmission and\n            distribution network facilities to meet the rapidly growing\n            power needs and to improve the quality of power supply\n            services in Jordan in the most economical way. The project\n            will comprise: (a) construction of about 160 km of 132-kV\n            transmission lines; (b) construction of five new transformer\n            and extension of five existing transformer substations, with\n            a total capacity of about 619 MVA; (c) extension of the\n            urban distribution network, including power supply to three\n            low-cost housing developments; (d) electrification of about\n            20 villages around Amman and 30 villages in the Central and\n            Southern Regions of Jordan; (e) consultant services for\n            project engineering and construction; (f) review of\n            JEPCO's organization and management; (g) training\n            program for JEA's and JEPCO's staff; and (h)\n            consultant services to assist in energy sector development.\n            The project will serve municipal and industrial load centers\n            from the national grid, reinforcing substation capacity at\n            five important load centers and help electrify about 50\n            villages with a total of 23,000 inhabitants and three\n            low-cost housing areas being developed for 28,000 inhabitants."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
