Project is to improve\n            the quality of graduate education in Indonesia.\n            Specifically, the project will aim at: increasing\n            competitive funding for domestic graduate education and\n            university research: strengthening procedures for selecting\n            grant and fellowship proposals; integrating university\n            research activities with graduate education; strengthening\n            the research capacity and dissemination of research results\n            in universities; and attracting highly qualified candidates\n            for domestic graduate education. To achieve these objectives\n            the project will: a) provide assistance for improving the\n            planning and management capacity for graduate education and\n            university research through the development of the\n            University Research Council ; and b) support competitive\n            research grants and fellowship programs to provide\n            incentives for high quality graduate training and research activities."}, "docdt": "1994-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
