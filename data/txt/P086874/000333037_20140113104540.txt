1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is potentially one of Africa's richest economies,
with extensive forest, mineral, and energy resources. Its regional importance, with a large labor force
and potential market size, extensive navigable inland waterways and land links to nine countries,
could make the DRC a motor for regional growth as significant as Nigeria or South Africa. However,
this promise has been repeatedly thwarted. Successive governments have neither been able to
translate this potential into satisfactory living conditions for the Congolese people nor to effectively
fight corruption. As the State slowly collapsed in the last decade of the regime of Mobuto Sese Seko
(1965-97), much of the productive capital was abandoned or destroyed.

2.     In 2001, the government launched a program of economic reforms aimed at restoring macro-
economic stability and kick-starting economic activity, while tackling some governance issues. This
program was implemented with the support of the World Bank (Bank) and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and began to pay off with the economy reaching an annual growth rate of 7.8 percent by
2005. Nevertheless, the global recession resulted in a precipitous drop in the growth rate to 2.8
percent in 2009. After a brief slowdown, economic growth accelerated again and climbed back to 7
percent by 2011.

3.     Infrastructure, which was deteriorating under the Mobutu regime, was largely destroyed
during subsequent years of conflict, leaving few passable roads and only sporadic access to electricity
and safe water for a large majority of the population. Social indicators, already low before the war,
continued to drop until the year 2000, when the trend gradually reversed. Despite the improvements
evident over the last 10 years, the DRC continues to rank at the bottom of UNDP’s 2013 Human
Development Index, tied with Niger for last place at 186th.

4.      Starting in 2002, the government began implementing an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (I-PRSP), premised on broad-based consultations with civil society and community groups.
The I-PRSP rested upon three pillars: (i) restoration and consolidation of peace and sustainable good
governance; (ii) macro-economic stabilization and pro-poor growth; and (iii) community dynamics
(community-led development initiatives). In July 2007 a Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (GPRSP) was approved by the Bank and remained valid until December 2010. It included five
pillars: (i) promoting good governance and consolidating peace; (ii) maintaining macro-economic
stability and growth; (iii) improving access to social services and reducing vulnerability; (iv)
combating HIV/AIDS; and (v) improving community dynamics.

5.      The objective of the Bank's activities in DRC was to contribute to the transition to peace and
stability in the country. The first phase of support was framed within the context of a Transitional
Support Strategy (TSS, July 2001) and aimed to: (i) meet basic and urgent needs; (ii) rebuild effective
public institutions and policies; (iii) revitalize economic activity; and (iv) rebuild implementation
capacity. The second phase of support was based upon the Bank's 2004 TSS, which included
community reintegration and social development as primary objectives – with a particular emphasis
on education, health, and community self-help – and identified a social fund as a key mechanism to
reach such objectives.

6.     The Emergency Social Action Project (Projet d’action sociale d’urgence, PASU), in providing
money to communities via a social fund mechanism, was clearly designed to align with the goals of
the I-PRSP 2002, the GPRSP 2007-2010, and TSS 2001 and 2004 and coordinated donor priorities.


                                                   1
PASU also responded to the need to show rapid results on the ground, quickly delivering much
needed basic services to communities all over the DRC in a very low capacity context. By building
local and provincial capacity for planning and implementing sustainable economic and social
activities, the project was expected to increase self-reliance and social capital, facilitating on-going
decentralization efforts and strengthening civil society.

7.     At appraisal in 2004, the project was seen as an important complement to the Emergency
Demobilization and Reintegration Project (EDRP), which was designed to support the reintegration of
demobilized ex-combatants. There was concern that disaffected citizens, not benefiting from the
demobilization process, would turn to violence if they did not see improvements in the quality of
living in their communities. The Bank’s investment in PASU helped relieve pressure from the
government and other donors to satisfy this need, without over-extending the scope of the EDRP to
include general community development.

8.      The project was implemented in a very challenging post-conflict operational environment.
Social and institutional capital in DRC remained very weak throughout implementation, with the
country’s overarching governance systems still recovering from years of political instability. In the
eastern provinces of the country, active conflict persisted. At appraisal the fiduciary environment had
few established control mechanisms and lacked modern payment systems in some areas. During
implementation, human resources capacity met several constraints in terms of the availability of
qualified staff and NGO partners, particularly in remote rural areas where access to basic social
services remains scarce. Not only is the cost of operating in the DRC very high, it is further
compounded by the poorly developed transport network, the dense geographical terrain, and the large
land mass.

9.     During its life, the project received the following grants:

10.   Findings presented in this ICR are the conclusion of a data collection and analysis process that
spanned over six months, and included:
    • Two field visits in Kinshasa, Bas-Congo, Province Orientale, Nord Kivu, and South Kivu
    • Interviews with key project stakeholders, including project staff, government representatives,
       staff from NGOs and local contracting agencies involved in implementation, and staff of non-
       benefiting NGOs operating in areas covered by the project
    • Group discussions with beneficiaries
    • Desk review of five independent technical audits financed by the project, project appraisal
       documents, project supervision reports, and external financial audits
    • Desk review of Bank aide memoires and interim supervision reports
    • Interviews with Bank task team leaders and technical specialists

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

11.   The original objective of the project was “to improve access of the poor to social and
economic services and increase the availability and management of development resources at the
community level.”


                                                    2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

12.     While the PDO was not changed during the life of the project, the key indicators were revised
to better capture the outcomes associated with the range of sub-projects selected by communities and
to make the indicators more specific (with a particular emphasis on capturing IDA core indicators)
and/or easier to measure. The only significant change was the addition of indicators to track the
progress of a labor intensive public works sub-component financed as part of the first additional
financing (AF). Table 1 below tracks the evolution of the PDO and indicators over the life of the
project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.     The main beneficiaries were identified in the original project document as “poor communities”
in all 11 provinces of the DRC. Zones of intervention were selected taking into account accessibility
and safety, constraints in management and supervision of operations, dynamism of communities, 1 and
existence of local partners. Over the life of the project, the primary beneficiaries continued to be
“poor communities.” However, some project components targeted specific sub-groups of
beneficiaries in poor communities as discussed below.

1.5 Original Components

14.  The original project had the following four components for a total initial project value of
US$60 million.

Component 1: Infrastructure (US$35.04 million)

15.     This component included three main sub-components. Sub-component 1A targeted poor
communities for the rehabilitation and construction of community-based socio-economic
infrastructure for a value of up to US$50,000; community contributions of 10 percent in cash and/or
in kind were required. Sub-component 1B financed medium to large socio-economic infrastructure
projects costing up to US$850,000. These projects were to benefit larger communities, including
urban neighborhoods and clusters of communities. Very few sub-projects of this scale were
implemented, and this sub-component was formally dropped with the first AF, when the limit on
small infrastructure projects was raised from US$50,000 to US$100,000 to address increase in the
sub-project costs 2. Finally, Sub-component 1C supported pilot income-generating sub-projects to be

 As measured by the ability to provide a 10 percent community contribution (in kind or in cash). The vast
majority of contributions received were in kind.

2
  There were two factors affecting construction costs in the DRC at the time, high inflation rates and the added
cost of building in remote communities where materials often had to be airlifted to the building site.



                                                        6
implemented through local micro-enterprise organizations. This was also dropped with the first AF to
allow the project to focus on Sub-component 1A where demand was very high.

Component 2: Capacity building (US$1.97 million)

16.     The primary beneficiaries of the capacity building efforts were (i) the local executing agencies
(ALEs for Agences locales d’exécution), that is, local non-government organizations (NGOs) that
were selected by the communities (and certified by the Social Fund as needed) to provide them with
technical support in the identification and implementation of the sub-projects; (ii) the community
management committees composed of 3-7 members who were elected by the community during the
project preparation phase based on criteria identified in the project implementation manual to lead
project design and supervise implementation; (iii) the village maintenance committees, which were
established by the communities in each village to ensure the sustainability of the infrastructures
rehabilitated 3; (iv) the local contractors who were small and medium enterprises recruited by the
ALEs or the community management committees to construct/rehabilitate the infrastructures
identified; and (v) the firms contracted by the Social Fund to conduct the feasibility study of
relatively complex sub-projects, or supervise project implementation. The community management
committees and village maintenance committees received limited training in committee organization
and sub-project management, with a focus on mobilizing community contributions and infrastructure
maintenance. The ALEs learned how to operate under strict Bank procurement, sub-project
identification, preparation, and management rules. This included identifying, contracting, and
managing local contractors, who received technical trainings to improve the quality of their works, as
well as trainings on procurement and labor intensive public works methods (for those involved in the
THIMO sub-components).

Component 3: Education (US$3.14 million)

17. This component financed two sub-components, with different target beneficiaries. The
scholarship program targeted top-performing university-level students based upon their state exam
scores. Students from across the country benefited, regardless of income level, receiving US$400
each to finance tuition, lodging, and library fees. Awards were made on an annual basis and renewed
when students passed their year with distinction. Schools that consistently produced winning students
also received cash awards. This sub-component was only supposed to operate during the first two
years of the project, but based on demand, was extended for a third year. The second component
financed a Literacy Program, referred to as PROLEDA (Projet de lecture et alphabétisation), which
was designed to establish community and classroom libraries, promote low-cost literacy activities for
children and adults, and train teachers and librarians. Priority was given to communities and primary
and secondary schools in disadvantaged areas that lacked library resources. These two activities were
included in the project upon request of the GoDRC. They were a continuation of a government
program already underway.

 The village maintenance committees comprised at least 3 members. They included representatives of the
community management committees, and were set up during the project preparation phase according to criteria
defined in the project implementation manual.



                                                     7
Component 4: Project coordination, management, and outreach (US$19.85 million)

18. The project was implemented by the Social Fund of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(Fonds Social de la République Démocratique du Congo), a public legal entity created in 2002 by
Presidential Decree No. 009/2002 under the tutelage of the President’s Office to contribute to
reconstruction efforts and rapidly increase access to basic social infrastructure and income-generating
opportunities. Component 4 covered staffing and administrative costs of the Social Fund at its
headquarters office in Kinshasa and in all 11 provinces where the Social Fund had small regional
offices.

1.6 Revised Components

19.     Component 1: Community-based socio-economic infrastructure and labor intensive public
works (US$32.3 million, including US$27 million under the first AF and US$5.3 million under the
second AF). The first AF added US$22.5 million to benefit an additional 300 communities, with a
greater focus on economic infrastructure sub-projects. In addition, the ceiling for community sub-
projects was raised to US$100,000 in consideration of higher commodity prices and the high cost of
infrastructure investments in the most remote areas. The first AF did not finance medium- to large-
scale infrastructure rehabilitation or the income-generating activity sub-component of the parent
project. However, US$4.5 million was included for labor intensive public works (LIPW) targeting
miners in the Katanga Province, many of whom had been affected by the decrease in global demand
for minerals caused by the world-wide recession. The investment in this sub-component was expected
to generate 290,000 person days of employment for this target group. LIPW sub-projects had a ceiling
of US$200,000 each. The State and Peace-building Fund (SPF) provided an additional US$5 million
to the LIPW sub-component. The second AF exclusively targeted communities in the Seke Banza
territory of the Bas-Congo Province for infrastructure construction/rehabilitation, many of which had
been affected by the construction of the Inga dam, financed by another Bank project.

20.    Component 2: Capacity building of beneficiary communities and local executing agencies
involved in project implementation (US$1.0 million under the first AF and US$.2 under the second
AF). Additional funds continued to target community organizations and NGOs serving the
beneficiary communities.

21.    Component 3: Education grants and community libraries. This component was concluded
successfully during the life of the original project and was not renewed in order to enable the Social
Fund to focus on Component 1 where demand far exceeded project resources.

22.    Component 4: Project coordination and management (US$7 million from the first AF and
US$1.3 million from the second AF). The first AF provided US$7 million to finance on-going
project coordination and management costs. Some of these incremental funds financed increased
financial accounting oversight, particularly to support the labor-intensive projects in Katanga, and an
internal audit function was created to strengthen financial management at the provincial level. The
subsequent AF contributed US$1.3 million to finance an increase in administrative costs related to the
scale-up in Bas-Congo.

23.    Annex 1 provides a revised estimate of project costs per component, reflecting total
contributions from the first and second additional financing.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

24.    The project was restructured several times (three reallocations of proceeds and three
extensions of closing dates) to take into account delays experienced at start-up (see section on Quality
at Entry, paragraph 29), provision of additional financing, and issues related to unexpectedly high


                                                   8
and fluctuating operational costs given high inflation rates that affected costs of supervision, among
others. Table 2 describes the type of restructuring carried out during the life of the project, while
Table 3 provides details on the reallocation of proceeds.

                     communications due to the challenging operational
                     context; (iii) training costs for Social Fund staff
                     charged to operating costs rather than Consultants’
                     Services as originally planned; and (iv) very high
                     banking and money transfer costs. This was being off-
                     set by lower than anticipated expenditures for
                     consultants partly due to the above-mentioned charging
                     of training costs to the operational cost category and
                     partly due to the fact that the project needed fewer
                     consultants than originally envisaged for information
                     and outreach activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

25.    This project was prepared under the Bank’s emergency procedures (OP 8.50) in the
challenging post-conflict context described in the Introduction Section (see paragraph 8). The risk
rating was High at appraisal in recognition of the weak fiduciary and administrative capacity of the
Social Fund at the time of appraisal and the volatility of the overall political context. The risk level
was downgraded to Medium under both additional financings (AF), given the experience acquired by
the Social Fund, its good fiduciary performance, and the country’s progress towards political stability.

26.     Overall and given the circumstances under which the project was prepared, the project design
was solid and it continued to be revised for improvements during implementation as discussed below.
The project was aligned with the Bank’s country assistance strategies (TSS 2001 and 2004 and the
Country Assistance Strategy), the government’s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP) in
effect at the time of project preparation, and later the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
2007-2010 (GPRSP) at the time the AFs were prepared. Project design incorporated best practices in
Bank-funded Community Driven Development (CDD) projects in comparable countries and
situations, as follows:

    •   Used a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to promote readiness after approval. An advance in
        the maximum amount allowed of US$600,000 was provided to the Social Fund six months
        before Board approval of the parent project.
    •   Was responsive to the fragile context by using a bottom-up participatory process to build
        community infrastructure so that communities began to take ownership of the development
        process.
    •   Required community contribution (10 percent of the project costs, in kind and/or in cash) as a
        way to promote ownership.
    •   Helped form community management committees that were elected by the beneficiaries and
        responsible for the design and implementation of the prioritized community sub-projects;
        village maintenance committees were also established by the community, and were
        responsible for the maintenance and sustainability of the sub-projects.
    •   Envisioned working with and strengthening local NGOs (ALEs) and construction contractors
        to collaborate with the communities in getting their prioritized infrastructure built. By
        engaging civil society and private sector partners, the project helped demonstrate the value of



                                                  10
          multi-stakeholder collaborations for rapidly achieving results across the entire country at a
          reasonable cost, in a context of social instability, post-conflict violence, and minimal State
          capacity.
      •   Built the project on an existing government-operated social fund. Prior to receiving the
          Bank’s support, the Social Fund was already legally mandated and had some (minimal)
          experience managing a community infrastructure portfolio. This reduced the potential delays
          associated with creating a new government institution from scratch.
      •   Envisioned a decentralized model, where each provincial office operated in a semi-
          autonomous fashion with its own staff. This not only led to rapid implementation in all 11
          provinces but also created an institution in each province with the potential to serve as a
          government vehicle to make impactful community investments.
      •   Ensured effective linkages with the wider health and education systems through the role
          played by the provincial committees. These committees included representatives from key
          sector ministries at the provincial level who worked effectively to review and approve sub-
          projects, while ensuring that the infrastructure was consistent with sector plans and could be
          staffed and supplied by government.
      •   Built rigorous checks and balances into the system to help minimize corruption. These
          included sufficient funding for regular internal and external financial and technical audits,
          enforcing a zero tolerance for corruption, prosecuting those found guilty of corruption, and
          vetting NGOs involved in implementation to eliminate those that were underperforming. This
          helped maximize the volume of funds reaching the community level and helped spread a
          culture of transparency among the actors directly involved with the project.
      •   Benefited from continuous learning. The design of the project was continuously strengthened
          during the implementation period to incorporate lessons learned and accelerate disbursements
          (see sub section on M&E Utilization in paragraph 39).

27.     The project envisioned that its management and oversight would be governed at the national
level by two main structures within the Social Fund: (i) a board of directors responsible for providing
oversight of the coordination unit, approving project manuals, annual project activities and work
plans, ensuring the recruitment of external auditors, and reviewing activities and project reports; and
(ii) a coordination unit responsible for the day-to-day management and implementation of the project,
and for ensuring compliance with Bank guidelines and requirements. The board of directors, which
comprised representatives from key line ministries, donors, and civil society, was only formed in
2010 despite recurrent reminders from the Bank and the Social Fund. Once established, the Board
held a total number of nine meetings (three in 2010, three in 2011, two in 2012, and one in 2013).
During the absence of an active board of directors prior to 2010, the Social Fund’s management team,
composed by its the general coordinator, the financial management director, the technical director, the
director of programs, and the internal auditor, ensured oversight responsibilities in terms of recruiting
the external auditors on an annual basis, and worked closely with the Bank to approve planning
documents and ensure compliance with fiduciary requirements.

28.       No quality at entry review was conducted by the Quality Assurance Group.




                                                   11
2.2 Implementation

Quality of Implementation

29.     The project became effective 11 months after approval, after receiving two extensions.
Implementation progress was characterized by a slow start associated with non-compliance with Bank
fiduciary requirements and slow disbursement rates during its first two years. This was primarily
justified by a combination of factors related to the post-conflict context, including: (i) difficulties in
recruiting and retaining qualified staff; (ii) delays in securing office space (which was supposed to be
a government contribution); and (iii) challenges in identifying partners with strong capacity
(communities and ALEs). In addition, the first general coordinator fell short of the Bank’s
expectations. The Social Fund completion report identifies additional project-specific challenges that
contributed to the slow start, including difficulties in: (i) securing community contributions for
Component 1 sub-projects; (ii) finding construction materials; and (iii) motivating communities to
participate in the project (see executive summary of the borrower’s completion report in Annex 5.
Executive Summary of Borrower's ICR).
30.     In August 2006, the recruitment of a new general coordinator prompted gradual and steady
improvements in project performance and compliance with the Bank fiduciary requirements. The
Social Fund started adjusting operational procedures in late 2006 to address bottlenecks to rapid
disbursements on its largest component (Component 1), including: (i) conducting extensive
sensitization campaigns to secure community contributions; (ii) making community contributions a
pre-condition to starting project activities; and (iii) systematically involving ALEs in project
management. Staffing positions were progressively filled. Throughout the implementation period, the
Social Fund made continuous improvements to its processes and procedures to ensure effective and
efficient project implementation. In particular, the mid-term evaluation, conducted from October to
November 2008, and the periodic technical audits provided useful recommendations that were
promptly adopted and reflected in the two requests for additional financing. These included the
decision by Kinshasa headquarters to:

    •   Disburse the full value of a sub-project to the provincial office as soon as the sub-project was
        approved, thus eliminating the risk of losing a qualified contractor due to transfer delays –
        and having to start the bidding process all over again
    •   Raise the budgetary ceiling for sub-projects from US$50,000 to US$100,000 in light of the
        significant increases in construction costs, particularly in conflict-affected eastern DRC,
        where the risks and challenges of moving materials contributed to escalating costs
    •   Intermediary NGOs should only get involved in sub-project construction if no local private
        sector contractors were available.

31.    The 2010 and 2012 technical audits assessed the quality of project implementation during the
period 2010 and 2011 as Satisfactory. The reports found that the infrastructure built was generally of
good quality, fully furnished and equipped, and responded to the needs of the beneficiary
communities. The report also noted that the Social Fund had been effective in engaging provincial
government officials through the provincial committees. This helped ensure that the selected sub-
projects were included in the local sector plans, thus increasing the likelihood that the personnel
required to operate/maintain the expanded/improved infrastructure would be made available. At
closing, the project was rated Satisfactory and exceeded seven out of nine of its programmatic targets
(see paragraph 52 on Achievements of Project Development Objectives).




                                                   12
Capacity Building for Implementation

32.    The quality of implementation benefitted from investments in capacity building for
community organizations, intermediary NGOs, consulting firms, and local contractors. Supervision
documents and the counterpart’s completion reports indicate that trainings in procurement, financial
management, technical supervision of sub-projects, and other administrative procedures required for
working effectively with Bank funds were regularly delivered and crucial for achieving good results
and building local partners who can serve as effective implementers for other donors in the future.
Trainings on project implementation processes were delivered before the sub-projects were
implemented. The majority of NGOs interviewed during ICR preparation commented that the regular
follow-up and implementation support they received from the provincial-level office was particularly
useful in building their capacity to manage the quality of the construction work. Some NGOs also
indicated that the trainings in procurement and financial management helped them strengthen their
internal control processes, making them more competitive to receive other donor funding.

33.     The assessment of the intermediary NGOs, carried out in 2007 to diagnose their capacity and
develop a capacity building plan, was successful in weeding out ALEs that did not have the capacity
or the level of transparency required by the project. A total of 91 NGOs (out of 171), 45 engineering
firms (out of 75), and 61 contractors (out of 95) qualified to continue working with the Social Fund.
The NGOs were organized into three categories according to their capacity, with the most capable
being allowed to work on multiple sub-projects at once and the least experienced on one small sub-
project at a time. Based on findings from the above assessment, the project opted to build the capacity
of local community-based organizations (CBOs) in remote areas, including helping them become
legally registered as opposed to bringing NGOs from larger cities to operate in these regions. This
increased effectiveness and further strengthened community participation.

34.    A small number of Social Fund staff also benefited from trainings in procurement, monitoring
and evaluation (M&E), and exchange visits in Madagascar and the Republic of Congo. Kinshasa-
based staff experts on M&E and safeguards were responsible for training project officers in the
provinces.

Implementation Capacity

35.    At project start-up, implementation capacity was hampered by instability at the top of the
Social Fund. The initial general coordinator fell short of satisfying Bank expectations and left in July
2006. She was replaced by the director of administration and finance (DAF), who had worked for
many years as an auditor for one of the main international auditing firms, proved to have the right set
of skills to get the project moving at a rapid pace, and enforced a culture of zero tolerance for
corruption. Under his leadership, 37 percent of the staff members who left the Social Fund during the
project were terminated for lack of integrity. The transparent culture that the second general
coordinator promoted was critical within the context of the DRC, where the risk of corruption is very
high; it is also a contributing factor to the positive results that the project achieved under his
leadership. NGOs consulted for the preparation of the ICR were unanimous in praising the good
governance of the Social Fund and appreciated the fact that they were held accountable for a
transparent management of funds.

36.     Rapid staff turnover, particularly at the level of the provincial offices, was identified as an
issue in implementation. Over the life of the project, 77 staff left. This was due, in large part, to the
fact that the Social Fund contracted its field staff on annual consulting contracts, which were renewed
after an evaluation of each staff member’s performance. While this enabled the Social Fund to weed
out poor performers annually, the lack of job security led many staff to go to their field post without
their family, which increased the likelihood of staff turnover. The mid-term evaluation team also


                                                   13
found that salary levels were not competitive and became less so over time, especially as inflation
increased. The problem was such that, the Social Fund tried to maintain salaries that were more in
line with local employers to promote sustainability but this made it increasingly difficult to compete
with international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and other donor and Bank-funded
projects that offered higher salaries. The director of M&E, a position difficult to fill in most contexts,
changed more than seven times during the first two years of the project, likely due to better financial
opportunities offered by other employers.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Design- Rating: Substantial

37.     The design of the project approach to monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was not very strong at
approval, but gradually improved to satisfactory levels after being adjusted to incorporate lessons
learned during the implementation period. At project effectiveness, the M&E indicators were not
defined precisely, and field staff did not receive training on the results frameworks, leaving some of
the indicators open to interpretation. This issue was compounded by the reliance of the project on the
ALEs (whose capacities varied significantly) for data collection. Due to budget constraints, only one
staff based in Kinshasa was responsible for coordinating input from all the 11 provinces, and this
person had a limited supervision budget and was seldom able to get to the field to verify data supplied
by local partners. Turnover at this post also affected the timeliness of reporting. Despite these
weaknesses, the initial design of the M&E system featured several strong points: (i) it provided for
five technical audits reports and a thorough mid-term review4 that provided reliable data on project
performance until the M&E system became operational; and (ii) it relied on a decentralized system
for routine supervision, whereby heads of provincial offices and their technical staff (including an
engineer and a chief of provincial officer with an expertise in rural development or social
mobilization) conducted regular field visits to identify implementation issues and provide support as
needed.

Implementation- Rating: Substantial

38.     The above-mentioned initial weaknesses in the M&E design led to further delays in
establishing and operationalizing the system. The M&E manual was finalized in March 2006, a year
after effectiveness. The first M&E manager was recruited a month later. In 2007, a consultant was
recruited to provide technical assistance to roll out the M&E system. Software was acquired to
manage M&E data; training was provided to key stakeholders; and M&E tools were developed. In
2008, the results framework was updated to ensure a common understanding of the indicators, and a
baseline data collection exercise was conducted, marking the official launch of the M&E system. As
of this point, the project conducted annual evaluations and technical assessments, which looked at
randomly selected samples of sub-projects to confirm the validity of data reported by the provincial
offices. These external assessments were complemented by a rigorous financial audit. A random
sample of sub-projects was selected for a site visit by the technical audit teams, which helped serve as
a means of verifying the accuracy of data submitted by the provincial teams. The Social Fund
estimates in its completion report that it conducted on average 13 monthly supervision missions of
NGOs and local contractors during project implementation. In addition, the coordination unit
conducted regular supervision of the provincial offices, estimated at 49 per year. Timeliness of

  The technical audits and mid-term review were conducted by some independent firms who were recruited
competitively based on the World Bank procurement procedures.



                                                    14
reporting to the Bank remained an issue until project closing, but did not seem to impact data
utilization as findings and lessons learned were regularly incorporated in project implementation and
design.

Utilization- Rating: High

39.    Data provided through the M&E system – particularly internal supervision missions, the mid-
term review, the various technical audits – and the external audits, were used to strengthen project
design and implementation performance as follows:

    •   Addressing implementation issues: At its onset, the Social Fund met some challenges in
        obtaining a large number of proposals for sub-projects, and in securing the 10 percent
        community contributions. The quality of sub-project proposals received was also problematic.
        The Social Fund’s completion report indicates that in 2006, less than 60 percent of the
        requests received were of an adequate quality. Information obtained during supervision
        missions pointed to the need to conduct more thorough sensitization campaigns to address
        communities’ concerns about the contributions. After implementing this recommendation, the
        project experienced a high success rate in obtaining community contributions and the number
        of proposals surged from 1,825 in 2006 to 3,479 in 2007. The percentage of high quality
        proposals exceeded 85 percent in 2007.
    •   Contributing to good governance: The financial audits led to corrective measures against
        mismanagement, as they helped the Social Fund identify instances of corruption or financial
        mismanagement at the project level. The government is expected to reimburse US$93,313 in
        ineligible expenses resulting from the project accountant in North Kivu and the manager of a
        financial cooperative 5 misappropriating project funds. Likewise, findings from the NGO
        capacity assessment conducted was instrumental in weeding out the local implementing
        partners (NGOs and local contractors) that could not be trusted to deliver effectively on
        project objectives as discussed above.
    •   Ensuring the delivery of good quality operations: Regular supervision missions undertaken
        by the Social Fund staff were key in ensuring the good technical quality of infrastructure
        rehabilitated. Indeed, the project engineers in the provinces conducted follow-up site visits
        based on supervision reports from the ALE or the communities, pointing to potential issues in
        the rehabilitation/construction activities underway. These site visits were an opportunity to
        provide technical support to the local contractors.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

40.     Social and environmental safeguards: Project performance on safeguards compliance was also
characterized by a slow start during the first two years after effectiveness. The project was classified
as environmental category B, as the sub-projects (including the construction and rehabilitation of
community-based infrastructure) could potentially have localized negative environmental and social
impacts. The prescribed instruments (an Environmental and Social Assessment Framework (ESMF),
a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and an Indigenous People’s Planning Framework (IPPF)
were prepared and disclosed between one to two years after their scheduled due date (six months after
effectiveness). Performance improved to a Moderately Satisfactory rating in 2007 after the Social
Fund recruited an environmental specialist whose responsibilities included training the ALE and the

 In the absence of banks in remote areas, the project partnered with community based banking institutions such
as credit institutions, and financial cooperatives.



                                                     15
entrepreneurs on Bank safeguards requirements and ensuring safeguards compliance. This specialist,
based in Kinshasa, worked closely with the provincial staff for supervision. Yet, effective supervision
and capacity transfer to key stakeholders (ALE and enterprises) was affected by a low budget for
supervision activities, a high turnover rate of the provincial staff that the Kinshasa-based specialist
trained, and limited capacity of the stakeholders who required more in-depth training.

41.    Despite these constraints, as indicated by the Social Fund during the ICR process,
environmental impact assessments were conducted and risk management plans elaborated for
medium-size projects and projects requiring population displacements. The potential impact of non-
compliance was reduced during the first additional financing, when the Social Fund required the use
of a negative list for micro-projects selection. The 2012 technical audit reviewed 22 requests for
financing and concluded that overall social and environmental risks were adequately addressed.

42.     Financial management (FM) performance: The project appraisal identified a high fiduciary
risk and proposed appropriate mitigation measures that were satisfactorily implemented during the
project implementation period. The recruitment of the fiduciary management team, the systematic
implementation of biannual financial management supervision missions, the elaboration of detailed
procedural manuals, and the hiring of external auditors (for the technical and financial aspects) helped
somewhat in reducing these risks. With the exception of the first two years of implementation
characterized by instability at the level of top-management as described above, FM performance was
consistently rated as Moderately Satisfactory or Satisfactory and the related FM risk was rated
Moderate during the implementation of the project. This achievement is notable in a country context
that is characterized by weak governance systems and can partly be attributed to the zero tolerance
policy enforced by the second general coordinator when he took office. Strong control and oversight
systems were established. The final financial supervision visit found that the project complied with
the obligations of financial reporting and auditing. Throughout the life of project, all the IFRs were
submitted on time and all audit reports submitted in the last four years of the project were unqualified.
All audit reports and IFRs were reviewed by the Bank and comments provided to the government. All
FM issues that had justified the project financial management Moderately Satisfactory rating were
addressed before the project closing date, except for the refund of US$91,313 diverted by the project
accountant in North Kivu and by the manager of a financial cooperative. The project pursued legal
action against both the ALE manager and the North Kivu accountant. A repeated claim letter was sent
to the Ministry of Finance on November 18, 2013 for action.

43.     Procurement performance: Procurement occurred at two levels through the life of this
project: (i) purchase by the ALEs of small inputs for sub-projects; and (ii) purchase of larger goods
and recruitment of consultants by the Social Fund. Performance was rated Unsatisfactory during the
first two years of implementation, when the Social Fund’s experience with Bank procurement
guidelines and its capacity to implement the sub-projects proposed under Component 1 was limited.
As the Social Fund’s capacity improved, its performance rating alternated between Satisfactory and
Moderately Satisfactory until closure, except in 2011 when it was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory
due to delays in replacing the procurement manager who had left the project. The latest post
procurement review conducted in 2011 concluded that overall, procurement performance was
consistent with the provisions of the Bank’s procurement guidelines and the financing agreement. The
document noted room for improvement in the following aspects of the procurement system: (i) the
filing system should be strengthened to ensure traceability of the entire procurement process; (ii) all
contracts should be included in the procurement plan agreed with the Bank; (iii) full transparency
should be required in the selection procedures of individual consultants; (iv) all contract awards
should be published; and (v) delays in the procurement process should be reduced. During ICR
preparation, the intermediary NGOs commended the Social Fund for transferring capacity in
procurement management.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

44.    Sustainability of Infrastructure Financed: A review of the independent technical audits
conducted, as well as discussions held with project counterparts and field visits conducted as part of
the ICR mission, point to the good quality and durability of the infrastructure
constructed/rehabilitated. As stated above, an engineer was based in each provincial office and
worked closely with the ALEs, communities, and local contractors to ensure that the sub-projects
were technically sound. Financial sustainability was promoted on several fronts: (i) promoting
ownership of the infrastructure; (ii) ensuring alignment with government sector plans; and (iii)
building community capacity to manage the infrastructure.

45.    By actively involving the community in prioritizing projects to be financed and by requiring
the community to form a community management committee, and raise match funding equivalent to
10 percent of the sub-project value (in kind or in cash)this project laid the groundwork for active
community participation in the operation of the community infrastructure financed. The management
committees were required to report regularly to the community on implementation progress. These
design features were critical in contributing to the communities’ sense of ownership; indeed, most
beneficiary communities contacted for the ICR preparation referred to their completed sub-project as
“our school,” “our health clinic,” and “our market.” .

46.    Further, the sub-projects identified by the communities were first vetted by the Social Fund,
which conducted field visits to confirm communities’ needs, and then submitted to the provincial
committees for approval. This linkage helped ensure an alignment between the communities’ priority
projects and the sector ministries’ plans for expanding services; thus, the overwhelming majority of
funded projects have the additional teachers, nurses, and doctors, paid by the government, required to
operate effectively.

47.     Finally, the project laid the foundation for community-based maintenance of
constructed/rehabilitated infrastructures through the creation of village maintenance committees.
These committees (including representatives from the community management committee) were
established by the communities during sub-project preparation. Members were trained in project
maintenance and were responsible for (i) making sure that the infrastructures rehabilitated/constructed
were used no later than a month after project end; (ii) developing a project maintenance plan to be
included in sub-project proposals 6 ; and (iii) maintaining the infrastructures. A manual for the
operation and maintenance of rehabilitated/constructed infrastructures was provided to the
committees. Unfortunately, the trainings were only delivered in April 2013, long after the majority of
sub-projects had been completed. According to the project staff, this resulted from a lack of
consensus within the Social Fund itself and between the Bank and the Social Fund as to the content of
the modules. Despite these delays, the communities and NGOs interviewed in the preparation of this
ICR reported that village maintenance committees established by the project are functioning well, and
are able to manage the rehabilitated infrastructures. These affirmations corroborate the outcome
indicator target of 97.5 percent of sub-projects being operational and functioning one year after
completion.

  The village maintenance committee was required to sign a “maintenance contract” with the Social Fund before
receiving sub-project funds.

48.    Sustainability of the Social Fund: The Social Fund is a legal public entity with financial
autonomy; therefore, its sustainability as a national institution is firmly established. However, the
government has allocated minimal funding to both its running costs and its portfolio of activities are
minimal. Efforts by the Bank team to link the Social Fund to multilateral and bilateral donors –
despite being beyond the scope of this project – have so far been unsuccessful. Future Bank-funded
projects implemented by the Social Fund should include a provision to help this institution diversify
its donor base. An active board of directors could play an important role in achieving this objective.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objective- Rating: High

49.     The project objectives are still relevant today, and will remain relevant into the foreseeable
future as the demand for access to basic social and economic infrastructure and services continues to
outstrip supply. The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2013-2016 approved in April
2013 reflects this continued demand and includes “improving social service delivery to raise human
development indicators” as one of its objectives. The project’s objective contributes to the actual
World Bank objective of eradicating poverty and contributing to shared prosperity. The PDO is also
aligned with government policy priorities highlighted in the 2011-2015 DRC Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP 2), which lists increased access to basic social services and
strengthening human capital as one of its four pillars with a focus on education, health, and social
protection.

Relevance of Design and Implementation- Ratings: High

50.     The original causal model around which the project was designed was solid. Component 1
directly contributed to “improve access of the poor to basic social and economic services” by
constructing or rehabilitating 1,022 basic social infrastructure (including 3,426 classrooms, 117 health
centers, 92 markets, 182 km of road, and 103 water points). For the labor intensive public works, an
estimated 3,385 people, of which 745 were women, received increased revenues. Component 2
contributed to “increase the availability and management of development resources at the community
level” by building the capacity of 1,381 village committees to manage development resources at the
community level. Component 4 also contributed to 157 ALEs and 176 local contractors operating in
remote and impoverished areas of the country.

51.    Component 3 under the parent operation, which included the university scholarship program
and the community libraries, may be slightly less aligned with the PDOs. This sub-component, which
from a budget perspective was not significant representing only 5 percent of the original budget and 3
percent of the final budget, was introduced in the project upon specific request from the government,
and dropped after the activities were successfully implemented before the first additional financing. A
focus on only targeting poor students who had demonstrated outstanding performance could have
further strengthened its relevancy. The community-based model to increase the supply of the goods
provided continues to be appropriate in a context as fragile as the DRC given limited government
capacity to effectively address the needs, as also mentioned in the FY2013-2016 CAS.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial




                                                  18
52.    The Social Fund’s performance at closing indicates that it overcame significant
implementation challenges and surpassed six out of nine of its outcome indicators (see Table 4 on
achievements of key outcome indicators below), while fully achieving a seventh.

Improving access of the poor to social and economic services

53.     According to the three technical audit reports reviewed and 10 field discussions conducted
through this ICR process, the social and economic infrastructure produced were of high quality. The
impact of these infrastructure improvements on the beneficiary populations exceeded expectations,
with school enrollment increasing by 52 percent, exceeding its target by almost 50 percent, clinic
consultations increasing by 64 percent, almost 30 percent above target, and close to half a million
people getting access to potable water for the first time as stated in the completion report of the Social
Fund. According to the Social Fund’s data, the total number of people who benefited from at least one
of these projects was over 4 million, almost 700 percent greater than anticipated. This assumed an
average household size of eight and 500 households benefiting from each project. As highlighted in
the CAS, GPRSP2, and government completion report, accurate data on household size is very
difficult to find in the DRC where the last census was conducted in 1984. Since then, population
estimates have been based on growth assumptions and projections. Even if we use more conservative
assumptions of five people per household and 200 households benefiting from each sub-project, over
1 million people would have benefited from at least one sub-project, twice the number anticipated.

54.   The project also created an estimated 34,000 temporary jobs through the sub-projects under
Component 1, which were not formally tracked by the project, and over 260,000 person days of work
through the LIPW, putting over US$7 million into the hands of people who would be otherwise
unemployed.

Increasing the availability and management of development resources at the community level

55.     The project could not have successfully built 1,022 infrastructure projects at the community
level without capable partners on the ground, including 157 local NGO partners (ALE), who, in turn,
recruited 176 local contractors (private sector construction contractors) to build high quality
infrastructure in the remote communities. Local NGO partners were identified by the communities,
vetted by the Social Fund, received support to become accredited according to relevant
national/relevant laws when needed, and trained to strengthen their procurement and financial
management skills. During the life of the project, the Social Fund conducted an assessment of its
partners, which led to a narrowing of the pool of qualified NGOs, contractors, and technical
assistance providers to those that demonstrated the highest level of capacity. Through its NGO
partners, the project also created 1,381 village committees that contributed to the design of the sub-
projects’ infrastructure and worked hand-in-hand with the intermediary NGO and construction
contractors, ensuring that community contributions were on-site when required and assisting with the
recruitment of local labor. This experience has left communities better prepared to implement similar
projects in the future. The intermediary NGOs also helped organize and train village maintenance
committees; however, as noted above, the Social Fund was late in developing the training curriculum,
which meant many committees were not trained in M&O until the last year of the project. This may
explain why the project under-performed its target of 90 percent of village maintenance committees
being fully operational one year after sub-project completion.

56.    Overall, the project, by only a small margin, fell short of two of its nine PDO indicators:




                                                   19
    •   74 7 percent of village maintenance committees were fully operational one year after the
        project rather than the target 90 percent. This shortcoming does not appear to have had an
        impact on service delivery and maintenance. Indeed, nearly 98 percent of sub-projects were
        operational and in good repair one year after completion according to the 2012 M&E report.
    •   The number of person-days of work provided by LIPW was 10 percent less than targeted. ..




7
 This indicator was measured before the M&O training, which is expected to have led to an increase in the
percentage of operational village maintenance committees in the project area.

  This data is based upon an annual survey of completed schools. A total of 189 or 34 percent of the 561
completed schools provided enrollment data, which generated this result in increased enrollment.

  A randomly selected sample representing 37 percent of the completed health centers generated this data on
increased health consultations.
10
   A randomly selected sample representing 22 percent of the 99 roads projects generated the result that the
completed roads reduce travel time by 61 percent.
11
   A randomly selected sample of 49 percent of the 103 water points built resulted in an average of 4,695 people
per water point having new access to improved water sources per source, which allowed the project to
extrapolate that a total of 483,585 people now have improved access from the 103 water projects built.
12
   This data is based upon 40 market and/or warehouse projects representing 45 percent of the total built each of
which was found to benefit an average of 457 merchants. This data was extrapolated to the 89 projects and
adjusted for one large marketplace that is no longer operational.
13
   The project used the following assumptions for this indicator. Every project reaches an average of 500
households, each of which has eight household members; therefore each project benefits 4,000 people. This
multiplied by the 1,022 projects results in over 4 million beneficiaries. Even if we use more conservative
assumptions of five people per household and 200 households benefiting from each sub-project, over 1 million
people have benefited from at least one sub-project, twice the number anticipated.
14
   All projects built in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 were evaluated one year after completion to verify if they
were operational and well maintained. This assessment found that 97 percent, 95.6 percent, 100 percent, and
100 percent of the projects for each of the respective years were operating and well maintained. This data
generated the overall average of 97.5 percent.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating- Substantial

57.    Although the budget ceiling on sub-projects had to be raised from US$50,000 to US$100,000
with the first AF to accommodate increase in the price of construction materials (which averaged
close to 20 percent per year and was further elevated in conflict zones where the cost of moving
materials increased with the level of insecurity), the average cost for implementing a sub-project
remained US$60,000. All of the beneficiaries, implementing NGOs, and local government officials
visited as part of the ICR process expressed the opinion that the infrastructure project costs were
reasonable compared to other projects being implemented in the area. To verify the cost-effectiveness
of its investments, the Social Fund staff collected data on schools and health clinics (which
represented 66 percent of their investment in infrastructure) built by other implementers, including
UNICEF and UNOPS, in four of the provinces targeted by the project. On average, the Social Fund’s
schools cost only 77 percent of similar schools built by other implementers and health clinics only 70
percent (see table below).

58.     According to the third party technical auditors, the Social Fund’s projects did not sacrifice
infrastructure quality to lower its costs. This was confirmed during site visits for the ICR preparation
and in interviews with local government officials; moreover, it is supported by the fact that 97.5
percent of the sub-projects were still fully operational when assessed at least one year after
completion. The emphasis put on anti-corruption by the Social Fund likely helped keep the costs of
sub-projects more in line with what they should be, including construction materials, labor, profit
margin, and oversight, with no increment for paying off bribes.

59.   The overall administrative cost as a percentage of the total project budget was 28 percent,
compared to the targeted 20 percent. Each time funds were added to the project, the relative


                                                  22
proportion of project management increased as a percent of the overall budget. There were a number
of reasons for these higher than expected operating costs. For one, the country is very large and has a
very poorly developed road network, so most supervision travel had to be done by air, along routes
that had very little competition; travel for supervision and on-going internal auditing, thus, was very
expensive. The heavy emphasis put on project supervision and auditing was necessary in the highly
corrupt context of the DRC and helped keep sub-project costs in check by minimizing opportunities
for fraud.

60.     While staff salaries were low relative to other projects, staffing costs were still higher than
expected given the challenge of finding qualified staff in the provinces, so many of the provincial
satellite offices were staffed with professionals recruited from Kinshasa who had higher salary
expectations and required relocation expenditures. By working through local NGOs as intermediaries,
the Social Fund was able to reach many more communities with relatively small field teams.

61.     The delays in implementation experienced during the early years of this emergency project
contributed to higher than expected administrative costs: Administrative costs were incurred over a
number of months while little progress was made in implementing sub-projects. That being said, once
the new general coordinator was in place, this situation was gradually corrected and the Social Fund
became increasingly efficient in its operations. For example, prior to 2009 the proposal review
process took an average of seven months from the moment the staff received a proposal from the
community until the project was approved for financing. By 2013, this process was down to five
months. Likewise, the number of months required to construct a project dropped significantly over
the life of the project, from an average of 13 months prior to 2010 to an average of four months from
2010 onwards. This effectively lowered the cost of administering each sub-project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

62.     Despite the challenging operating environment and difficulties experienced at project launch,
the project successfully incorporated lessons learned and exceeded most of its outcome indicators and
results targets as discussed in previous sections.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

        (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts: Overall, as per the PDO, the project was effective in targeting poor communities in
all 11 provinces of the DRC. In a context where over 70 percent of the population is poor, with an
estimated 89 percent of the rural population being poor 16 the risks of exclusion were small. For the
first Sub-component 1A, which represented 68 percent of project investments, the majority of the
beneficiaries lived in rural areas. Poor communities were identified using poverty indicators such as
limited or lack of access to basic social infrastructures in health, education, roads, and markets. Of the
1,022 sub-projects implemented under this subcomponent, 841 sub-projects or 82 percent were
implemented in “remote and impoverished rural communities” according to the counterpart’s report 17.

     World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for DRC (FY2013-2016).

17
   The number of sub-projects implemented in remote and impoverished areas is an intermediate outcome
indicator of the project. The Social Fund indicated that this figure would increase if sub-projects implemented
in poor neighborhoods in urban centers were taken into account in the definition of this indicator.



                                                                 23
The need to target very poor communities was balanced with the importance of promoting sub-project
ownership and sustainability by requiring community contributions of 10 percent (in cash or in kind).
Communities that came up with their contribution first had their sub-project financed first. A
thorough community sensitization process was key to securing the community contributions in a
timely fashion. The labor intensive public works activities specifically targeted communities in
Katanga that had been affected by a series of layoffs in the mining sector. In this sub-component, self-
targeting, through the setting of a daily wage that was slightly below market rate, ensured that the
3,483 beneficiaries were among vulnerable populations. Component 3 on education, which
represented 3.7 percent of total project investments, targeted students for scholarships primarily based
on merits and academic performance, not on poverty status.

63.    Beyond the poverty impacts captured through the project indicator data – improved access to
health and educational services, potable water, and markets – the project created over 34,000
temporary jobs through the sub-projects and over 260,000 days of work person days of work through
the LIPW, putting over US$7 million into the hands of people who would be otherwise unemployed.
Likewise, the project helped poor communities realize that they had the power to contribute to
improving the quality of their lives by working hand-in-hand with this government program, even in
communities located in conflict zones.

64.     Gender Aspects: For Component 1, the project indicators did not break the data down by sex,
so it is difficult to assess the degree to which women and girls benefited from the sub-project
investments. Nonetheless, expanded school capacity and single-sex bathrooms may have contributed
to an increase in the number of girls attending school; potable water projects likely decreased the time
it took for girls and women to collect water; and closer health care services with birthing facilities
benefited women more than men. Both the scholarship program and the labor intensive public works
program tracked beneficiaries by gender and sought to achieve a minimal degree of gender balance.
Findings indicate that 25 percent of scholarships went to women and 22 percent of the beneficiaries
of the labor intensive public works program were women.

65.    The Social Fund staff was male dominated, particularly at the highest levels (although the first
general coordinator was a woman), with all of the directors and all but one of the provincial managers
being men. Gender equity was slightly more evident among the intermediary NGOs. The community
management committees tended to be male-dominated; however, women seemed to be more visible




                                                  24
than men on the village maintenance committees, especially those that collected and managed user
fees.

(b) Institutional Change

66.     With Bank funding and guidance, the project helped transform the DRC Social Fund from a
fledgling agency into a decentralized institution operating in all 11 provinces – arguably the only
government presence in many remote areas. The Social Fund effectively transferred resources to 171
NGO partners and 289 construction contractors to build high quality social and economic
infrastructure in poor communities all across the country at lower average costs than others, while
strengthening the capacity of their local partners. Partner NGOs and contractors had the opportunity
to learn about transparent procurement processes and infrastructure project management, which
positions them well for future opportunities.

67.    The community management committees also learned to mobilize community residents around
a common cause and to hold contractors and their NGO partners accountable for results. This may
eventually affect the way in which communities engage with government at the local level, as they
now see that the government and communities can work together to achieve results. The community
also sees the infrastructure that it has built as a community asset, not as a government asset. This
change of attitude stimulated by the requirement that the community finance up to 10 percent of the
cost may help ensure that the community infrastructure is maintained and remains operational over
the long-term, even though delays occurred in training the village maintenance committees
responsible for M&O.

68.     According to discussions held during field visits conducted as part of the ICR process, the
project helped build trust between targeted communities and the government, as the Social Fund
delivered on its promise to provide its 90 percent contribution towards the rehabilitation of socio-
economic infrastructures identified. The 10 percent community contribution, on the other hand,
helped foster pride from the communities in their accomplishments, breeding self-confidence and
self-reliance. The positive experience the community had in participating in the identification and
construction of their sub-projects may also have given them a sense of empowerment, which could
translate into increased initiative and self-help in the future.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

69.     Promoting demand for good governance at the community level: The community
empowerment methodology used by the project helped create microcosms of democracy in each of
the beneficiary communities. The communities had to elect their management committees’
membership, and they had to learn how to write and abide by their by-laws and be accountable to the
citizens that elected them. This experience in good governance may create more demand from these
community citizens for accountability from their elected government officials. Based on anecdotal
evidence collected in South Kivu, some communities situated nearby an intervention area required the
government to finish constructing schools for which rehabilitation works were underway before the
Social Funds started its operations. Likewise, the emphasis placed by the project on community
empowerment, good governance, and the transparent management of funds also gave government at
the provincial and municipal levels an opportunity to see how accountable systems result in visible
results on the ground.

70.    Creating a transparent, effective, and efficient decentralized public sector delivery system:
The Social Fund created a nationwide delivery system functioning in all 11 provinces for the
construction and rehabilitation of community infrastructure. While this was not an end in itself, it was
an organizational precondition for achieving the stated results. The investment required to getting this



                                                  25
highly effective and transparent delivery system fully operational was high. Ideally, this system could
be repurposed to channel government, private sector, and/or donor funds to the provinces, most of
which continue to have many unsatisfied basic needs.

71.     Promoting social cohesion in conflict zones: In eastern DRC, the project is credited with
contributing to social cohesion by bringing together members of groups traditionally in conflict
based on anecdotal evidence. For instance, the Lenge Primary School in Ituri and the Boule Primary
School in Fataki brought together Hema and Lendu communities for a school rehabilitation project.
Parents from both sides had to collaborate to collect the required community contribution, and their
children now attend the same schools. This experience is informing the design of a follow-on project
that is being developed to target the provinces in eastern DRC that have been most affected by ethnic
conflict.

72.     Economic ripple effect: Based upon anecdotal evidence, some of the sub-projects created other
income-generating opportunities for targeted populations. In South Kivu and Bas-Congo, for example,
the installation of electricity in poor communities improved living conditions and laid the groundwork
for businesses reliant on electricity to operate. Merchants could extend their store hours into the
evening; local entrepreneurs could start-up grain mills, hair salons, and cold storage units; and
mechanics and carpenters could increase the scale of their operation through the use of power tools.
The increased demand for school furnishing created by the high investment made by the Social Fund
in schools also generated work for local carpenters. New roads cut the travel time of getting
agricultural products to market; it also led farmers in Bas-Congo and other provinces to expand the
area they cultivated, because they had the means to transport their crops in trucks instead of on their
backs. This expansion, in turn, created demand for more seasonal labor during the planting and
harvesting periods.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

73.    The project undertook a beneficiary assessment from April to May 2013 to evaluate the level
of beneficiary satisfaction with the project. Thirty percent of sub-projects completed were randomly
selected to be the focus of this exercise. Given budgetary constraints, only projects within 50 km of
the provincial capital in seven provinces were selected. Interviews with 1,048 people were facilitated
by the project staff. The populations surveyed included local authorities, beneficiaries, and
community leaders living in the intervention area. The findings are as follows:

    •   83 percent of community members know of the sub-projects rehabilitated/constructed
        through the project
    •   81 percent are satisfied with the final output
    •   58 percent of people interviewed claimed to have been involved in the supervision of the sub-
        projects
    •   68 percent of people interviewed confirmed the existence of a village maintenance committee.

74.   These statistics show a high level of satisfaction and are generally consistent with project
outcome indicators and qualitative discussions held with the ICR preparation team during field visits.




                                                  26
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

75.    The overall risk to the project achieving its development outcome is rated Significant, due to a
combination of factors including the overall operating environment (which remains characteristic of
most low-capacity post-conflict contexts), political volatility, and government commitment to provide
financial support to the Social Fund.

76.     The main risk to the long-term development outcome would be the communities’ ability to
maintain the rehabilitated infrastructure. In the short term, as the Social Fund effectively mitigated the
risk of occurrence by transferring knowledge to the communities and ALEs on effective maintenance
of rehabilitated/constructed infrastructure, despite the training being delivered in the final year of the
project. In addition, the project trained the village maintenance committees in setting up basic cost-
recovery schemes to generate funds for the maintenance of these structures. This risk is further
mitigated by the heavy emphasis on community ownership at every phase of the sub-project cycle.
Future Bank-funded CDD trainings should consider providing refresher training to ALEs and village
committees that have participated in sub-projects.

77.     A possible second risk relates to the inability of civil servants to deliver basic social services
using the rehabilitated/constructed infrastructure if, for instance, the government fails to pay their
salaries. The likelihood of this occurring was reduced as the project set up provincial committees
which included representatives from all key technical ministries to approve sub-projects before
implementation. Their decisions were based on the availability of government resources to ensure that
the proposed sub-projects remained functional over the long term. Any potential impact could be
mitigated by the fact that in the education sector (which represents the majority of the investments),
community mechanisms (e.g., the strong mobilization of parent–teacher associations) generally exist
to ensure that schools remain functional even when the government is not able to pay teachers’
salaries.

78.    Finally, political instability and conflicts in eastern DRC may reduce the access of the
communities to rehabilitated/constructed infrastructure. However, the Social Fund’s experience
indicates that community-rehabilitated infrastructure has not been destroyed by warring factions,
perhaps because of strong community ownership. In addition, the government, working in
collaboration with the UN Force Intervention Brigade (FIB), has made recent progress in militarily
defeating the M23, one of the most powerful armed groups operating in the East. A follow-up project
is being designed to target eastern DRC in the hope of contributing to stability in this area.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry Rating: Satisfactory

79.    Overall, the project design was solid, especially given the challenging operational environment
and conditions in which this emergency intervention was prepared. The design was responsive to the
country context during preparation; it used a demand-driven approach and valuable inputs, such as the
recruitment of an engineer in each province to oversee the technical quality of the work undertaken
by contractors, which increased the chances that the community infrastructure built would be
sustainable over the long-term; it built the project on a structure that already existed; and it drew from
international best practices of other Social Funds using the CDD approach. The PPF was approved six




                                                   27
months before project submission to the board, for the maximum amount allowed of US$600,000, to
help the project elaborate its implementation manuals and recruit key staff.

80.     The Bank had little control over issues that primarily affected readiness to implement during
the first two years of the project, as those were primarily linked to the challenging operational
context (see paragraph 8) or required government intervention, which was not always forthcoming.
The fact that this was an emergency project meant that the Bank could not make government action a
condition for disbursement; thus when government failed to fulfill its commitments, the Bank’s
ability to negotiate was limited. These issues were progressively addressed throughout project
implementation, particularly after the replacement of the first general coordinator as discussed above,
and they had a marginal impact on the project’s ability to meet its development objectives.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

81.    The Social Fund generally had praise for the support it received from the Bank project team,
particularly its ability to get quick decisions from different departments within the Bank. A total
number of three task team leaders (TTLs) were involved in the supervision of the project at different
times. One of the TTLs who had less experience received mentorship to ensure the quality of
implementation support.

82.     A review of ISRs produced during implementation indicates the following performance on the
part of the Bank team:

    •   Strong focus on development impact: The team conducted regular field visits (more than
        twice a year for Washington-based staff) and provided constant reminders of progress
        towards achieving outcome indicators, which were adjusted and updated as needed to
        adequately capture impact on targeted communities.
    •   Adequate supervision inputs and processes, which was rated satisfactory by the borrower in
        its completion report. The Bank’s recommendations that the project recruit international
        consultants to assist with the M&E system, for instance, had a positive impact on overall
        project performance in that regards. It should be noted however that the Social Fund received
        minimal supervision on safeguards, with input only provided at critical times (during the
        preparation of additional financings).
    •   Overall candor and quality of performance reporting: ISR ratings were globally consistent
        with the narrative of project performance documented in the aide memoires and the ISRs
        themselves. M&E ratings, which were upgraded to Satisfactory from 2008 to 2011, should
        have remained Moderately Satisfactory until project end. Likewise, counterpart funding was
        rated satisfactory from 2010 to 2013 to reflect the successes in mobilizing community
        contributions and positive collaboration with the government at the local level. A moderately
        satisfactory rating would have better captured the challenges associated with involving the
        government in addressing implementation issues.

83.    Lessons learned during the implementation of the parent operation were successfully
incorporated in the restructuring and the additional financings, such that the project exceeded most of
its expected results by closing.




                                                  28
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

84.    The project was prepared in eight months as an emergency operation to be implemented in a
highly political and fragile post-conflict context. Despite these challenges, the Bank successfully
assisted the Social Fund in delivering a Satisfactory project. The project presented some weaknesses
on monitoring and evaluation design and operation costs that were higher than expected. Ultimately,
these did not affect performance ratings at closing.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Government of DRC: Moderately Satisfactory

85.    At the provincial and local levels, representatives of relevant sector ministries were actively
involved in the provincial committees . This helped ensure a rational allocation of limited sub-project
resources and avoid the building of a school or health clinic in a community not contemplated in the
government’s sector plans. As a result, most of the public schools and clinics that were built received
the government-paid staff and supplies required to be fully operational.

86.     The government at the national level, however, was slow to respond to repeated requests to
address implementation issues, including delays in establishing a board. Further, Sub-component 1B
of the parent operation was dropped primarily because of the inability of the government to contribute
its funds for the larger-scale projects. Finally, the start-up delays were also linked with government
delays in providing office space to the Social Fund at the local level.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: The Social Fund: Satisfactory

87.    The Social Fund team achieved good results, despite a slow start and a difficult operating
context. Under the leadership of the second general coordinator, the Social Fund established rigorous
policies and procedures as well as checks and balances that enabled effective mitigation of key
project risks, in particular, identifying and eliminating corrupt staff and intermediary NGOs. The
Social Fund staff worked to continuously improve their procedures and, in turn, their results. The
communities and implementing agencies visited during the ICR process were all complimentary of
the support they received from the Social Fund. They noted that funds were always sent on time,
which allowed them to implement the sub-project quickly. Community representatives reported that
they felt comfortable visiting the Social Fund offices and expressed gratitude for the technical support
and advices they received. The project staff established an effective partnership with the UN
Peacekeeping Mission (MONUSCO) to reach communities in conflict areas.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

88.    While the national government has yet to take the necessary leadership required to transform
the Social Fund into a fully autonomous institution, including allocation of financial resources, the
potential is still there. There is still time for the government to recognize the importance of the Social
Fund and use it as one of its primary vehicles for operationalizing the transfer of resources from the
national to the provincial and community levels. The local and provincial government representatives



                                                   29
played a key role in aligning the sub-projects financed with their regional investment plans and could
continue to play this role should the national level government decide to channel resources through
the Fund.

6. Lessons Learned
•   Transparency is possible even in highly corrupt contexts: The Democratic Republic of Congo
    Social Fund has demonstrated how a highly decentralized grant-making mechanism can be
    effective and transparent in a context that ranks high on international corruption indexes, as long
    as: (i) local staff and partners receive sufficient training on what is expected of them in terms of
    transparent procurement and resource management, and on what they stand to lose if they violate
    the rules; (ii) a strong internal and external audit financial and technical audit function is in place
    and regularly conducts random audits; and (iii) staff and partners who are found to have
    undermined the procurement and resource management rules are removed and held accountable
    for their behavior.

•   In countries where a decentralization process is underway and there is an active and diverse
    donor community, consider making the sustainability of the Social Fund, itself, a project
    objective: In such complex environments as the DRC, a transparent, well-run Social Fund
    mechanism able to reach all provinces is a real asset, particularly for donors seeking to channel
    funds down to the local level. An active networking and communications campaign is required to
    build the awareness of other donors of the Social Fund’s work and dispel assumptions that its
    investments are politically motivated. While, in the case of the DRC, the absence of an active
    board of directors does not appear to have had a negative effect on project outcomes, it may have
    reduced the visibility of the Social Fund’s work within the donor community. This, while not an
    objective of the project, could have contributed to a more diversified funding base for a highly
    effective government project that would ensure its longevity beyond the Bank funding period.

•   Engaging with government increases project sustainability: Actively engaging provincial and
    local government in the sub-project selection process at the provincial level is a good way to
    ensure that the sub-projects funded are considered priorities by both the beneficiary community
    and the relevant sector ministries and local government. This in turn helps to ensure that
    completed sub-projects are staffed and equipped by complementary government financing.
    Likewise, the national government must be required to make a match investment in the Social
    Fund, either by contributing public sector resources or by engaging with other donor or private
    sector companies to raise additional Social Fund capital. The lack of national government
    contributions undermines the long-term sustainability of the social fund, increasing the likelihood
    that it will cease to exist once World Bank funding ends.

•   Invest adequately in project management: The DRC context requires investments in project
    management costs that exceed the Bank’s standard ceiling of 20 percent of total budget costs.
    This will help project implementation units be better equipped to effectively support operations
    over a vast territory, where transport facilities are often expensive and precarious. Adequate
    funding needs to be allocated to monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Project indicators need to be
    very clearly defined, and project staff and partners need to be trained in a common methodology
    for gathering, recording, and documenting indicator data. To do this effectively, provincial offices
    need to have M&E specialists on staff. Data audits, carried out by an internal or third party
    auditor, are as important as financial audits in verifying that a project is on track in achieving
    project results transparently.




                                                    30
•   Allow some flexibility in sub-project budget levels for remote locations: Construction costs vary
    within different parts of a country based on a number of factors, including distance from main
    markets, security, road quality, cost of labor, and supply of skilled labor. For this reason, budget
    envelopes may need to be adjusted by province to reflect these variations; otherwise, sub-projects
    may need to be scaled down to fit within the budget in remote, underserved areas that may have
    the greatest need.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies

89.     The Social Fund wrote an in-depth completion report that provides a wealth of project data,
some of which is presented above. The report is highly analytical and overall very constructive in
identifying improvements made in its operations over the life of the project to ensure that all project
results would be achieved. The key points made in the report are in line with the analysis presented
above. The executive summary of the Borrower’s report is presented in Annex 5. Executive
Summary of Borrower's ICR
90.     The Borrower report should provide additional information on safeguards compliance. The
report also underplays the role played by the government in contributing to start-up delays.

(b) Cofinanciers N/A

(c) Other Partners and Stakeholders

    •   Many of the communities and ALEs interviewed through this ICR preparation process
        complained about the challenge of raising the 10 percent counterpart; nonetheless, they
        succeeded in doing so and acknowledged that it fostered community ownership of the sub-
        projects. Communities in the eastern part of the country, where the need was greatest and the
        poverty most intense, were least likely to see the community counterpart as a barrier to
        implementing the project. It is not recommended that this requirement be decreased,
        especially when it helps ensure that the Social Fund’s resources are invested in communities
        with the highest level of motivation for self-improvement. However, more flexibility can be
        built into the process of defining what constitutes the community contribution, and at which
        point in project implementation it should be provided.

    •   Despite its extremely significant accomplishments, very few other donors, NGOs, or other
        actors were familiar with the Social Fund’s work. Many made erroneous assumptions about
        its capacity to deliver transparently on its promises.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.    The economic impact of the project was assessed in terms of: (i) success in targeting poor
communities; (ii) impact on households; and (iii) cost comparison with similar interventions
implemented by other organizations.

Success in Targeting Poor Communities

2.      Overall, as per the PDO, the project was effective in targeting poor communities in the 11
provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In a context where 70 percent of the
population is poor, the risks of exclusion were small. For Component 1A, which represented 68
percent of project investments, poor communities were identified using poverty indicators such as
limited or lack of access to basic social infrastructures in health, education, roads, and markets. Of the
1,022 sub-projects implemented under this subcomponent, 841 or 82 percent were implemented in
remote and impoverished rural communities according to the counterpart’s report. Direct
beneficiaries are estimated to be 4,088,000 people. The need to target very poor communities was
balanced with the importance of promoting sub-project ownership and sustainability by requiring
community contributions of 10 percent (in cash or in kind). According to lessons learned from the
project, a thorough community sensitization was key in securing the community contributions.
Modifying the requirements of the community contributions so that it did not become a pre-requisite
for disbursement to the enterprises was also important to avoid delays in implementation. The labor
intensive public works activities specifically targeted the communities in Katanga that had been
affected by a series of layoffs in the mining sector. In this sub-component, self-targeting through the
setting of a daily wage that was slightly above market rate ensured that the 3,483 beneficiaries were
among vulnerable populations.

3.     Component 3 on education, which represented 3.7 percent of total project investments,
targeted students for scholarships primarily based on merits and academic performance. Specific
poverty targeting could have maximized its relevancy with the PDO.

4.      Impact on Household: This impact was assessed in terms of (i) increased access to basic
social services; and (ii) job creation and increased revenue.

5.     Increased in access to basic social services: No research has been conducted to quantify the
impact of increased access to basic social services on targeted households. Nevertheless, outcome
performance gives a strong indication of overall improvements in living standards as a result of this
project, as follows:

    •   52 percent increase in school inscription
    •   64 percent increase in medical consultations, with women giving birth in safer conditions
    •   61 percent reduction in the time spent by vehicles on rehabilitated roads
    •   169 percent increase in the number of people with access to clean water
    •   80.4 percent increase in the number of traders with access to stalls at the market and/or
        storage facilities
    •   7,645 people gained access to higher education;
    •   Increase in the number of operational village committees, with 1,044 committees established
        through this project.




                                                   36
6.     These changes can expect to have a direct short-term and long-term impact on the goods,
services, and income of the communities targeted in the short and long term.

7.     Job creation and increase in revenue: For the infrastructure sub-project, an estimated 34,000
temporary jobs for an average duration of four to six months were created, injecting roughly US$7
million in direct transfers to workers, but these investments were not formally tracked by the project.
This calculation does not take into account indirect benefits to the communities, such as training
skilled and unskilled labor involved in sub-project construction, the local purchase of building
supplies and school furniture, and increased sales of prepared foods for the construction crews.

8.     For the LIPW sub-component, labor intensity (the share of all wages paid in total public works
costs) is estimated at 52 percent. This is consistent with (but on the lower end of) international
standards. Other public works programs show rates of around 60 percent in India (National Rural
Employment Guarantee Scheme), 70 percent in Korea’s public works program, 85 percent in the
Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia, 40-50 percent in Argentina’s Trabajar Program,
and 60-70 percent in Bangladesh’s Food for Work Program. It is important to note, however, that
these programs are of a significantly larger scale than the program in DRC.

Cost Comparison

9.      The Social Fund compared the costs of the infrastructures it rehabilitated to the costs paid by
other institutions (see table below). This exercise met several constraints, such as: (i) the variability of
costs in different provinces; (ii) the challenges associated with obtaining sensitive information, such
as management costs from other institutions; and (iii) the fact that different institutions use different
technical standards to construct/rehabilitate infrastructure. Thus, the cost comparison focuses on costs
of constructing school and education sub-projects as part of Component 1. It should be noted that
construction represented 87 percent of the sub-projects and that 66 percent of the built infrastructure
was in the health and education sectors. The findings are summarized in the table.

10.      The Social Fund was not able to obtain information relative to the management costs of the
agencies mentioned above. However, it estimated at 0.38 per US$1 its own management cost for
constructing an infrastructure sub-project. All stakeholders consulted during the preparation of this
report confirmed the excellent technical quality of the infrastructures constructed/rehabilitated by the
Social Fund, which conformed to technical norms and standards established by the technical
ministries. The stakeholders interviewed (beneficiary communities and ALEs) mentioned the critical
role played by the engineer of the Social Fund in ensuring the high technical quality of the work. The
counterpart completion report indicates that 97.5 percent of infrastructures rehabilitated/constructed
are still fully operational.

Annex 5. Executive Summary of Borrower's ICR

1. In 2004, the World Bank provided a US$60,000,000 grant to the Government of the Democratic
Republic of Congo to implement the Emergency Social Action Project (PASU). This project was
framed within the context of the 2002 Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of the DRC, and the
July 2001 Transitional Support Strategy of the World Bank.

2. PASU was designed to increase poor people’s access to basic social services in a sustainable way
and improve the management of resources allocated to community development. The project was
approved on July 26, 2004 and became effective on July 25, 2005 on the eve of the 2006 elections, in
a very difficult socio-economic and political context. Indeed, at the time of project appraisal, the DRC
was emerging from several decades of dictatorial rule and a series of civil wars that destroyed the
social and economic fabric of the society. An estimated 80 percent of the population lived in extreme
poverty, and basic social infrastructures had been largely destroyed.

3. PASU met several constraints at its launch and throughout implementation. These challenges led
to a slow start of the project and included: (i) delays in recruiting qualified staff and opening up
offices in the province; (ii) difficulties in retaining qualified staff; (iii) high operational costs (and
particularly transport costs); (iv) limited capacity of communities and implementing partners; and (v)
challenges in securing community contributions at the beginning of the project. However, despite the
difficult operational environment, the project achieved its development objective and nearly all of its
outcomes and results indicators. Two additional financings of US$35 million and US$6.8 million
IDA grants were approved in March 2009 and June 2011, respectively, and helped scale up project
impact on vulnerable communities. Key project achievements are summarized as follows:

    •    1,022 community-based infrastructure sub-projects were implemented in all 11 provinces of
         the country in the health, water sanitation, education, rural transport, and energy and trade
         sectors. A total of 561 schools, 129 water points, 117 health centers, 99 small bridges and
         rural roads, 92 markets, and 17 electrical installations were constructed, rehabilitated, or
         equipped.
    •    1,381 communities benefited from capacity building through trainings that targeted at least
         2,303 participants.
    •    7,645 students in the higher education system received scholarships of US$400, and more
         than 40,000 books were distributed to 327primary schools.

4. These achievements had a positive impact on beneficiary populations estimated at more than 4
million people, translating into an improvement in the living conditions of these populations.
Outcomes noted are as follows:

    •   A 52 percent increase in primary school enrollment in the schools rehabilitated/constructed
        by the project. Nearly all the schools rehabilitated have set up a double shift system to cater
        to the very high demand for education.
    •   A 64 percent increase in medical consultations in the health centers rehabilitated/constructed
        by the project. Women are now giving birth in a safer environment.
    •   483,585 people gained increased access to improved water sources as a result of the project.
    •   43,759 traders gained access to stalls and/or storage facilities rehabilitated/constructed by the
        project.




                                                   41
   •   A 61 percent reduction in travel time on rehabilitated roads, with significant gains for users in
       terms of people’s mobility and the price of agricultural commodities.
   •   4,088,000 people benefited from the project.
   •   97.5 percent of sub-projects were operational and well maintained within a year of
       completion.
   •   74 percent of village committees were operational after one year of completion of project.
   •   259,969 person days of work were provided through the labor intensive public works.

5. This completion report provides a detailed account and analysis of project achievements,
outcomes, and impact. It also reviews and analyses project performance, challenges met, and key
lessons learned.
