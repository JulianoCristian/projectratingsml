                         sanitation sub-projects, 49 roads or bridges (rehabilitated or built), 101 health centers and 16 mini-electric networks. On average enrollment rates in schools built through the project
                         have increased by 65 % and utilization rates in health centers have increased by 72%. Over 1 million people have benefited directly from the project. Under the Labor Intensive

                         banking arrangements. Problems with procurement activities related to the departure of the national procurement specialist for another Bank project should finally have also found a
