the poor to\n            social and economic services and increase the availability\n            and management of development resources at the community\n            level. The closing date of the project will be extended from\n            March 31, 2013 until June 30, 2013. The extension is\n            necessary to compensate for some of the implementation delay\n            caused by a World Bank request to change disbursement\n            procedures (after six months, disbursement procedures were\n            reverted to the original ones). In particular, the extension\n            will make it possible to finalize the implementation of 175\n            sub-projects, of which 125 financed by the first additional\n            financing and 50 by the second additional financing. This\n            will bring the total number of sub-projects completed under\n            the first additional financing to 327 and the total number\n            of sub-projects financed under the second additional\n            financing to 58, equivalent to a disbursement of about USD\n            10 million."}, "docdt": "2012-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
