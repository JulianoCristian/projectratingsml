DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — EMERGENCY SOCIAL ACTION PROJECT
                            P086874
                 GRANT (H1200, H5520 AND H7200)

                                  Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for the Democratic Republic of Congo Emergency Social Action
   Project (Grant No. H1200, P086874) and its two Additional Financings (Grant No.
   H5520, P118658 and Grant No. H7200, P126683) will be extended from March 31,
   2013 until June 30, 2013.

2. The Project Development Objective (PDO) continues to be achievable and will be
   realized by the proposed extension of the closing date based on renewed commitment
   of the Ministry of Finance and the Social Fund of the Democratic Republic of Congo
   (FSRDC).

3. The project implementation was and continues to be satisfactory. A total of 795
   community sub-projects have already been executed including 644 under the original
   project and 117 under the first Additional Financing.

4. The proposed extension is necessary to compensate for some of the implementation
   delay caused by a World Bank request to change disbursement procedures (after six
   months, disbursement procedures were reverted to the original ones). In particular,
   the extension will make it possible to finalize the implementation of 175 sub-projects,
   of which 125 financed by the first Additional Financing and 50 by the second
   Additional Financing. This will bring the total number of sub-projects completed
   under the first Additional Financing to 327 and the total number of sub-projects
   financed under the second Additional Financing to 58, equivalent to a disbursement
   of about USD 10 million.

5. The team confirms that the Recipient has in place an action plan for the remainder of
   the project. More specifically, all the 175 sub-projects to be implemented have
   already been identified and it is expected that by December 31, 2012, implementation
   will have started for 162 of them. Considering that the typical implementation time is
   four months in urban areas and six months in rural areas, a closing date of June 30,
   2013 will be sufficient to complete all sub-projects.

6. This will be the second extension of the project, covering Grants No. H1200, H5520
   and H7200. A previous 30-months extension of Grant No. H1200 was obtained in
   October 2010 to allow for the implementation of an Additional Financing of USD 35
   million.
