                                      I. INTRODUCTION
1.     This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a second
additional financing grant (AF PASU II) in the amount of US$ 6.8 million equivalent to the
Democratic Republic of Congo for the Emergency Social Action Project (H720-DRC).

2.      The proposed additional grant would help finance the costs associated with scaling up
successful activities of a well performing project that has led to substantial increase in access to
basic social services. The activities to be funded comprise: (i) rehabilitation and construction of
small-scale community based infrastructure; (ii) capacity building primarily for beneficiary
communities and local executing agencies involved in project implementation; and (iii) project
coordination and management. The proposed Additional Financing will target communities in
the Seke Banza territory in the Bas-Congo province. The development objective of the project
will not be changed: to improve access to social services by the poor and enhance management
of development resources at the community level. Outcome indicators will remain the same, but
the targets have been updated to reflect the increased funding (see Results Framework in Annex I
for the detailed list of outcome indicators).

3.      The original grant was approved in the amount of US$ 60 million on IDA grant terms on
August 26, 2004. In March 2010, an additional grant of US$ 35 million (H552-DRC, P118658)
was approved to scale up financing to small-scale infrastructure throughout the country, as well
as to support employment and income opportunities for artisanal miners in the Katanga province.
There are no co-financing arrangements for the original project or its additional financing grants.

II. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE AMOUNT
                         OF US$ 6.8 MILLION

4.     Consistency with CAS: The proposed activities are closely aligned with strategic
elements 3 and 5 of the DRC Country Assistance Strategy of December 18, 2007, covering the
2008 - 2011 period, which are to help improve the provision of social services and reduce
vulnerability, and to promote community dynamics.

5.     Original grant: The original grant (H120-DRC) was approved by the Board on August 26,
2004 with an expected completion date of March 31, 2009. It became effective on July 26, 2005.
The project was subsequently extended twice in response to government requests. The current
closing date is March 31, 2013.

6.     Project components: The project has the following components:
       (i)     sub-projects targeting the construction and rehabilitation of community-based and
               medium-scale social and economic infrastructure nationwide as well as piloting of
               income generating activities;
       (ii)    capacity building for government agencies and NGOs involved in the
               implementation;




                                                 1
           (iii)   provision of scholarships to increase enrollment in universities and a literacy
                   program, including the provision of community libraries and training in library
                   management; and
           (iv)    project coordination and management.

7.      First Additional Financing: The first additional grant was approved on March 30, 2010
in the amount of US$ 35 million and became effective on October 29, 2010, for an expected
closing date of March 31, 2013. The PDO remained unchanged from the original project. The
Additional Financing provided support to all components except for component 3 because
planned activities under this component were completed under the original grant. In addition, a
sub-component on income generation was redesigned to provide a more appropriate response to
the high unemployment rates among mining workers in the Katanga province through labor-
intensive public works. The results framework was revised to reflect these changes.

8.      Project performance and status of implementation: The project is executed by the Social
Fund of DRC (FSRDC), a public organization created in 2002 to improve the living conditions
of the poor by making available to communities the financial and human resources necessary for
implementing self-selected sub-projects. The project started with very slow disbursement rates.
In 2006, however, a new coordination team established strong fiduciary functions, procedures
and program management processes, and the implementation pace picked up from 2007.

9.      Overall performance of the original project and its additional financing was rated
satisfactory during the last supervision mission in March, 2011. The project has consistently
been rated satisfactory over the last five years. Direct project achievements to date include:

      -    The achievements of the original project are important, including 34 percent increase in
           enrollment in the schools built or rehabilitated, 50 percent increase in medical
           consultations in the health centers supported by the project, and 77 percent increase in
           access to improved water sources due to project support1.

      -    A total of 577 sub-projects have been completed, including 354 schools, 86 health
           centers, and 70 water projects. Almost all (90 percent) of the projects are operational and
           provide social or economic services. Another 70 sub-projects are ongoing and are
           expected to be completed by the end of 2011. The total number of sub-projects exceeds
           targets. Most of the sub-projects to be financed under the first Additional Financing have
           been selected, and it is expected that the implementation of these sub-projects will be
           launched in June 2011.

      -    The original US$ 60 million has been disbursed (100 percent) as well as US$ 4.3 million,
           of the first Additional Financing grant (12 percent). It is expected that funds remaining
           from the first Additional Financing grant will be disbursed by the current closing date.

10      Legal, fiduciary and safeguard issues. The Project is in full compliance with all legal
covenants and has no unresolved audit issues. Audits are up-to-date and procurement guidelines
are followed consistently. The financial management performance rating was satisfactory during

1
    2010 figures


                                                    2
the supervision mission in March, 2011. It is also confirmed that all mandatory core indicators in
the results framework are incorporated and progress is monitored. All safeguard requirements
are being implemented in accordance with Bank policies.

11.      Rationale: The rationale for the Additional Financing is to scale up the coverage of
activities, and therefore intensify project benefits, in the Seke Banza territory in the Bas-Congo
province. The project has a rolling approach to its support to communities. While the first
Additional Financing targeted in particular artisanal miners in the Katanga province, the
proposed Additional Financing will target an estimated 65 communities in the Seke Banza
territory in the Bas-Congo province given the fact that until now the original Project has not
adequately addressed the needs of these communities. The DRC Government made an official
request to IDA that an additional financing to the project would target communities in this area
in a letter dated May 9, 2011.

12.     Alternatives considered: The choice to proceed with an Additional Financing to PASU
rather than setting up a new project is motivated by the advantages in terms of reduced
processing time, lower administrative costs, and greater efficiency of the additional financing
mechanism versus a new stand-alone project. Various Bank missions during the last few
years have positively assessed FSRDC’s capacity to implement small-scale infrastructure and the
agency’s potential to expand its portfolio. Moreover, FSRDC has provincial offices in all of
DRC provinces, including in Bas-Congo, and has developed a pool of local executing agencies in
each province that have the capacity to help communities implement the sub-projects of their
choice.


                                      III. PROPOSED CHANGES
13.     Project objective, scope and components: The development objective of the project
remains the same2: to improve access to social services by the poor and enhance management of
development resources at the community level. Although the project scope will continue to be
national, the proposed additional financing grant will target about 65 communities in the Seke
Benza territory in the Bas-Congo province. This will entail only slight modifications to the
project components, as follows:

    (i)   The sub-component on community-based infrastructure in Component 1 will be scaled up
          to reflect the proposed Additional Financing. The sub-component will include a
          particular focus on rehabilitating or constructing small-scale social and economic
          infrastructure for the benefit of communities in the Bas-Congo province. The approach
          and implementation of the sub-component will be the same as that of the first Additional
          Financing grant, including that: (a) interventions in the education and health sectors will
          be considered on a selective basis, taking into consideration other actors and
          interventions and paying particular attention to equity, complementarity and effectiveness
          (availability of staff, linking with the school and health facilities’ mapping process); (b)

2
 In the process of reviewing the project, we noted a slight discrepancy between the PDO wording in the original
project document and the original Financing Agreement. The PDO in the Financing Agreement which has remained
unchanged is the correct one and is being used hereafter.


                                                      3
        greater emphasis will be put on social capital development by strengthening activities
        designed to enhance social cohesion, promoting community participation in governance
        processes and ensuring competent project implementation; (c) a uniform ceiling of US$
        100,000 (excluding the 10 percent community contribution) will be applied to all
        community sub-projects to ensure enough flexibility in a context of highly variable and
        fluctuating commodity prices, (d) the community contribution of 10 percent of the cost of
        sub-projects will be maintained, but exceptions would be allowed (e.g., for communities
        that have demonstrated their inability to secure cash contributions when the nature of the
        project does not lend itself to in-kind contributions). Under the original project the
        experience of the community contribution has generally been good, in particular after the
        project made the beneficiary contribution a condition for launching the sub-project; (e)
        particular emphasis will be put on sustainability, for instance by introducing sub-project
        maintenance plans as a selection criteria, by establishing maintenance committees and
        training their members prior to executing the sub-projects, and by promoting increased
        involvement and quality of the contribution of the provincial governments. Moreover, to
        increase the possibility for the FSRDC to continue to operate beyond the IDA-funded
        program, possibilities for a government contribution to FSRDC operations during the
        period of the Additional Financing will be explored.

 (ii)   The capacity building component (Component 2) that targets beneficiary communities
        and local executing agencies (mainly NGOs) will be scaled up to reflect the proposed
        additional financing that will target an estimated 65 additional communities.

14.  The project will also cover the increase in administrative costs (financed under
Component 4 – project coordination and management) associated with the scale-up.

15.     Targets for the relevant performance indicators have been updated to reflect the
additional funds being made available. Some other targets have also been slightly modified to
reflect the results in terms of number and types of sub-projects to be financed under the first
additional financing following the recent completion of the selection process. The various
indicators will be closely monitored during project implementation.

IDA finances US$ 101.8 million (including the original Project of US$ 60 million, the first
Additional Financing of US$ 35 million and the second proposed Additional Financing of
US$ 6.8 million). The remainder will be represented by community contributions (US$ 4
million equivalent for the original project, US$ 2 million equivalent for the first Additional
Financing, and US$ 470,000 for the second Additional Financing) in the form of in-kind or
cash contributions to sub-projects (see below for a revised estimate of project costs).

17.     Fiduciary aspects: All disbursements will be issued through a separate designated
account in US dollars to be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. There will be
no changes on procurement arrangements. However, there will be modifications in the
guidelines to be applied. The procurement procedures will be carried out in accordance with
the new Bank’s guidelines dated January 2011 – “Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD
Loans, and IDA Credits dated January 2011- and “Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers”
dated January 2011; the World Bank’s anti-corruption guidelines: “Guidelines on Preventing
and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
and Grants”, dated October 15, 2006 and revised in January 2011; as well as the provisions
stipulated in the Financing Agreement. The procurement plan for the proposed additional
financing has been agreed upon. The overall procurement risk rating for the Additional
Financing is moderate.

18.  The financial management systems and performance of the implementing agency
FSRDC under the original project as well as under the first Additional Financing are
3
 In the context of the first Additional Financing, this refers to the Labor Intensive Public Works Component in
Katanga.


                                                         6
acceptable to IDA. The FSRDC will be responsible for the financial management aspects of
the second Additional Financing and remains the Bank focal point for fiduciary aspects. The
FSRDC is very familiar with the Bank financial management procedures and requirements
and is currently managing several Bank-financed projects. The aspects of this second
Additional Financing of PASU will follow the same approach as the implementation
arrangements in place for the ongoing projects managed by the FSRDC. The current FM
staffing is deemed acceptable; no additional staff will be recruited. TOMPRO, the multi-
project and multi-sites accounting software, operates well and will be used for this second
Additional Financing grant following a configuration. The existing FM procedures manual,
which has been updated for the purpose of the first Additional Financing as well as the Street
Children Project, is acceptable to IDA and will be used for the second Additional Financing.
The overall residual FM risk after mitigating measures remains Medium Likelihood
(Moderate). The last implementation support mission of March 2011 confirmed the
Satisfactory FM performance of FSRDC. The action plans derived from this mission as well
as the recommendations of the 2009 external audit reports, have been or are being
implemented well. The Interim un-audited Financial Reports (IFR) are prepared every
quarter and submitted to the Bank regularly (e.g. 45 days after the end of each quarter) on
time.

19.     The internal audit function managed by individual consultants operates well.
However it was agreed during the preparation of the first Additional Financing as well as
other new projects managed by the FSRDC, to recruit one additional internal auditor to
strengthen the team due to the increase in the scope of activities of the entity requiring more
sophisticated control systems, an effective internal audit function. The recruitment of this
senior internal auditor with engineering skills and qualifications is underway.

20.     There is no overdue audit report in the projects managed by the FSRDC, and the
sector at the time of preparation of this second AF. The audit report of the project accounts
managed by the FSRDC covering the period that ended December 31, 2009 was submitted
on time. The auditor expressed an unqualified opinion and the report was found acceptable
to IDA. The next audit report of the IDA-financed projects in DRC is due on June 30, 2011.
The accounts of the second Additional Financing grant will be audited on an annual basis and
the external audit report including the management letter will be submitted to IDA within six
months after the end of each calendar year. The Terms of Reference (ToRs) of the current
external auditing firm will be updated to reflect the second Additional Financing. The
FSRDC will comply with the Bank disclosure policy of audit reports and place the
information provided on the official website within one month of the report being accepted as
final by the Bank team.

21.    Upon the effectiveness of the second additional financing grant, transaction-based
disbursements will be used. The second Additional Financing will finance 100% of eligible
expenditures inclusive of taxes. A new designated account (DA) will be opened in a
commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The ceiling of the DA will be established at US$ 1
million which represents four months of forecasted project expenditures expected to be paid
from the DA. An initial advance up to the ceiling of the DA will be made into the DA, and
subsequent disbursements will be made on a monthly basis against submission of Statements
of Expenditures (SOE) reporting on the use of the initial/previous advance as specified in the


                                                7
Disbursement Letter (DL). The option to disburse against submission of quarterly unaudited
Interim Financial Report (IFR, also known as the Report-based disbursements) could be
considered, as soon as the project meets the criteria4. E-signature of Withdrawal
Applications is being used by the FSRDC for all its projects. The other methods of
disbursing the funds (reimbursement, direct payment and special commitment) will also be
available to the project. The minimum value of applications for these methods is twenty
percent of the DA ceiling.

22.     Funds will be disbursed to implementing entities (e.g. local executing agencies,
mainly non-governmental organizations (NGO)) on the basis of budget depicted under a
Work Plan. The submission of supporting documents of expenditures (e.g. contracts,
invoices, order forms, delivery notes, and receipt notes) for previous advances will not be a
condition for paying subsequent request for replenishment of the DA. However,
replenishment of the bank account will be made on the basis of two documents: (i) a
statement of expenditures; and (ii) a summary showing the total amount received, the
expenditures made. More details are provided in the updated Project Implementation Manuel
(PIM).

23.    Finally, based on the current risk assessment which is Moderate one full supervision
mission is normally planned for this project every year. The ISR will include a FM rating of
the project. An implementation support mission will be carried before effectiveness to
ensure the second AF readiness. To the extent possible, joint on-site supervision missions
will be undertaken with procurement monitoring and evaluation and disbursement
colleagues.

24.     Closing date: It is expected that the planned activities under the proposed additional
grant will be completed before March 31, 2013, which is the current closing date of the
original Project.

25.    Expected outcomes: This second Additional Financing will build on the results
achieved through the original Project and the first Additional Financing. The second
Additional Financing will focus on an estimated 65 additional communities that will have
improved access to social or economic services. The same indicators as for the original and
second additional financing project will be monitored (see further Annex 1):

        65 communities with improved capacity to plan, implement, and manage their
         economic and social infrastructure (this will bring the total outcome for the project to
         1012 communities)

  e.g. the draft report of the eligibility assessment current underway revealed that the project budgetary system and
the quality of the financial reporting require some improvements before being considered for this method.

                                 IV. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
26.     Similar to the original Project and the first Additional Financing, this proposed
Additional Financing is classified as environmental category B. Community sub-projects may
have the potential of some localized environmental and social impacts. However, as confirmed
during the original project and the first additional grant, no activity funded under the second
Additional Financing is expected to have a significant negative environmental or social impact.
Investments will be small (none of them will be above US$ 100,000) and will primarily involve
the reconstruction, rehabilitation or re-equipment of existing infrastructure.

27.     Under the first Additional Financing, the Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) for the original project was modified slightly to make it more efficient and
effective. This revised ESMF is still valid for the new Additional Financing. Other safeguards
documents developed during the original project - a Resettlement Policy Framework, and an
Indigenous People Development Plan are still valid and will continue to be used as appropriate.
Environmental and Social Management Plans and/or a Resettlement Action Plan will be prepared
as and when necessary.

28.    The financial and economic justification and assessment under the original project
remains valid. The operating costs will account for a maximum of 20 percent of the total project
investments. While the operating costs of the original project exceeded this threshold, the first
Additional Financing grant managed to reduce the operating costs considerably, partly due to a
17 percent reduction of salary of all of FSRDC’s staff.

29.     The overall risk rating for the implementation of the proposed Additional Financing is
Medium-Likelihood due to (i) the demonstrated capacity of FSRDC, the implementing agency,
to effectively manage the risks identified; and its familiarity with IDA guidelines on governance,
accountability, and financial management, and (ii) the high country risk.

Country Issues and reasons for using FSRDC: Assessment of the FM capacity of the
Ministry of Social Affairs

The World Bank and other donors’ assessments notably, the CFAA (Country Financial
Accountability Assessment), PER (Public Expenditures Review), and PEFA (Public

                                          24
Expenditure and Financial Accountability) completed between 2002 and 2007 portray
an unsatisfactory economic and financial control environment including weak budgeting
preparation and control, financial reporting, external audit and human resources. As a
result, the overall country fiduciary risk is still considered high. The findings of CFAA
and PEFA exercises revealed some capacity shortages in the fields of financial
management and procurement within the Ministries. The scope and responsibilities of
the FM Department of these ministries are limited to the preparation and execution of
the budget of the ministries. The weaknesses of the FM Department of the Ministries
include (i) insufficiently qualified staff in financial management at all levels of the
Ministries’ system, (ii) staff’s insufficient familiarity with IDA and other donors
financed–project procedures for reporting, disbursement arrangements, and auditing;
(iii) lack of a proper accounting system in place to record and prepare financial reports ;
(iv) lack of computerized and modern accounting tools at central and provincial levels;
and (iv) weak internal control systems.
The Bank cannot thus, at this period of time rely on the public expenditure framework
for the purpose of this second AF of the PASU. Therefore, it was agreed to use the
ring-fenced approach “PIU” and rely on FSRDC for the fiduciary aspects of the second
AF.

Description of the FSRDC- Institutional arrangements for the fiduciary aspects of
the second AF
The “Fond Social de la Republique Démocratique du Congo “FSRDC”) will be the
Bank and other donors’ main counterpart and focal point for fiduciary aspects. It will
oversee the entire project fiduciary management including management of the funds and
the designated account and will primarily be responsible for: (i) handling financial and
administrative management; (ii) disbursement; (ii) procurement; and (iii) auditing. The
FM team of the FSRDC is composed of (i) one Finance Director; (ii) two Accountants
and one Treasurer at central level; and (iii) one Accountant in each of the 11 provinces.
The Finance Director has the overall oversight of the project financial management
system. There will be no additional FM staff recruited for the solely purposes of this
second AF.

Strengths.
The FSRDC is very familiar with Bank FM procedures (e.g. financial reporting,
auditing and disbursement…) and the entity has already significant experiences in
implementing and managing CDD projects. The second AF accounting will be managed
and supervised by the Kinshasa-based Finance Director supported by a team of internal
auditors, budget controller and accountants. The Budget Controller and the Internal
audit unit have acceptable experience in working on IDA-financed projects. The FM
performance of the projects managed by the FSRDC is rated Satisfactory.

Weaknesses/risks
No significant FM capacity weaknesses impeding the implementation of the second AF
of the PASU have been identified. However, the implementation of this second AF, in
addition to the ongoing operations managed by the FSRDC will translate into an
increase of workload for the staff and the FSRDC- which in turn will require more

                                         25
sophisticated control systems, an effective internal audit function and configuration of
the existing multi-sites and multi-projects accounting software.

Conclusions and Action Plan.
The use of FSRDC to manage the key financial management functions will enable the
establishment of a financial fiduciary management system for the Project that satisfies
the Bank’s minimum requirements under OP/BP 10.02. – No specific key FM actions
for the implementation of the second AF is required except the effective implementation
of the dated covenants of first AF as well as the Street Children Projects; mainly (i) the
strengthening of the Internal Audit Unit staffing; and (iii) the extension of the scope of
the mission of the already selected external auditor to include the aspects of the second
AF.
C. FM Arrangements and Conclusion by the FM Specialist

1. The FM systems and performance of the Fonds Social de la Republique
   Démocratique du Congo “FSRDC” under the initial phase of the PASU as well as its
   first AF are acceptable to IDA. The FSRDC will be responsible for the FM aspects
   of the second AF and remains the Bank focal point for fiduciary aspects. The
   FSRDC is very familiar with the Bank FM procedures and requirements and is
   currently managing several Bank-financed projects. The FM aspects of the second
   AF of the PASU will follow the same approach as the implementation arrangements
   in place for the ongoing projects managed by the FSRDC. The current FM staffing
   is deemed acceptable; no additional staff will be recruited. TOMPRO, the multi-
   project and multi-sites accounting software, operates well and will be used for this
   second AF following a configuration. The existing FM procedures manual, which
   has been updated for the purpose of the first AF as well as the Street Children
   Project, is acceptable to IDA and will be used for the second AF. The overall
   residual FM risk after mitigating measures remains Medium Likelihood (Moderate).
   The last implementation support mission of March 2011 confirmed the Satisfactory
   FM performance of FSRDC. The action plans derived from this mission as well as
   the recommendations of the 2009 external audit reports, have been or are being
   implemented well. The Interim un-audited Financial Reports (IFR) are prepared
   every quarter and submitted to the Bank regularly (e.g. 45 days after the end of each
   quarter) on time.

2. The internal audit function managed by individual consultants operates well.
   However it was agreed during the preparing the first AF as well as other new
   projects managed by the FSRDC, to recruit one additional internal auditor to
   strengthen the team due to the increase in the scope of activities of the entity
   requiring more sophisticated control systems, an effective internal audit function.
   The recruitment of this senior internal auditor with engineering skills and
   qualifications is underway.

3. There is no overdue audit report in the projects managed by the FSRDC, and the
   sector at the time of preparation of this second AF. The audit report of the project
   accounts managed by the FSRDC covering the period that ended December 31,
   2009 was submitted on time. The auditor expressed an unqualified opinion and the

                                         26
        report deemed acceptable to IDA. The next audit report of the IDA-financed projects
        in DRC is due on June 30, 2011. The accounts of the second AF will be audited on
        an annual basis and the external audit report including the management letter will be
        submitted to IDA within six months after the end of each calendar year. The ToR of
        the current external auditing firm will be updated to reflect the second AF. The
        FSRDC will comply with the Bank disclosure policy of audit reports and place the
        information provided on the official website within one month of the report being
        accepted as final by the team.

     4. Upon the second AF effectiveness, transaction-based disbursements will be used.
        The second AF will finance 100% of eligible expenditures inclusive of taxes. A new
        designated account (DA) will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.
        The ceiling of the DA will be established at USD 1 million which represents four
        months of forecasted project expenditures expected to be paid from the DA. An
        initial advance up to the ceiling of the DA will be made into the DA, and subsequent
        disbursements will be made on a monthly basis against submission of Statements of
        Expenditures (SOE) reporting on the use of the initial/previous advance as specified
        in the DL. The option to disburse against submission of quarterly unaudited Interim
        Financial Report (also known as the Report-based disbursements) could be
        considered, as soon as the project meets the criteria10. E-signature of Withdrawal
        Applications is being used by the FSRDC for all its projects. The other methods of
        disbursing the funds (reimbursement, direct payment and special commitment) will
        also be available to the project. The minimum value of applications for these
        methods is twenty percent of the DA ceiling.

     5. Funds will be disbursed to implementing entities (e.g. NGO, ALE…) on the basis of
        budget depicted under a Work Plan. The submission of supporting documents of
        expenditures (e.g. contracts, invoices, order forms, delivery notes, receipt notes…)
        for previous advances will not be a condition for paying subsequent request for
        replenishment of the IA. However, replenishment of the bank account will be made
        on the basis of two documents: (i) a statement of expenditures; and (ii) a summary
        showing the total amount received, the expenditures made. More details are
        provided in the updated PIM.

     6. Finally, based on the current risk assessment which is Moderate one full supervision
        mission is normally planned for this project. The ISR will include a FM rating of the
        project. An implementation support mission will be carried before effectiveness to
        ensure the second AF readiness. To the extent possible, mixed on-site supervision
        missions will be undertaken with procurement monitoring and evaluation and
        disbursement colleagues.

this method.
