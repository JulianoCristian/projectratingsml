Action\n            Project for Congo, Democratic Republic of were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: actively engaging provincial and local\n            government in the sub-project selection process at the\n            provincial level is a good way to ensure that the\n            sub-projects funded are considered priorities by both the\n            beneficiary community and the relevant sector ministries and\n            local government. This in turn helps to ensure that\n            completed sub-projects are staffed and equipped by\n            complementary government financing. Likewise, the national\n            government must be required to make a match investment in\n            the Social Fund, either by contributing public sector\n            resources or by engaging with other donor or private sector\n            companies to raise additional Social Fund capital. The lack\n            of national government contributions undermines the\n            long-term sustainability of the social fund, increasing the\n            likelihood that it will cease to exist once World Bank\n            funding ends. The DRC context requires investments in\n            project management costs that exceed the Bank's\n            standard ceiling of 20 percent of total budget costs. This\n            will help project implementation units be better equipped to\n            effectively support operations over a vast territory, where\n            transport facilities are often expensive and precarious.\n            Adequate funding needs to be allocated to monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E). Project indicators need to be very\n            clearly defined, and project staff and partners need to be\n            trained in a common methodology for gathering, recording,\n            and documenting indicator data. To do this effectively,\n            provincial offices need to have M&E specialists on\n            staff. Data audits, carried out by an internal or third\n            party auditor, are as important as financial audits in\n            verifying that a project is on track in achieving project\n            results transparently."}, "docdt": "2013-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
