Additional Financing for the Emergency Social Action Project\n            for Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is to improve access\n            to social services by the poor and enhance management of\n            development resources at the community level. Performance\n            indicator targets have been updated to reflect the\n            additional funds being made available. The additional grant\n            will help finance the costs associated with scaling up\n            successful activities of a well performing project that has\n            led to substantial increase in access to basic social\n            services. The activities to be funded comprise: (i)\n            rehabilitation and construction of small-scale community\n            based infrastructure; (ii) capacity building primarily for\n            beneficiary communities and local executing agencies\n            involved in project implementation; and (iii) project\n            coordination and management. The additional financing will\n            target communities in the Seke Banza territory in the\n            Bas-Congo province."}, "docdt": "2011-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
