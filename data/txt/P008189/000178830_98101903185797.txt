INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO COPIANIA ANO1NTIHA NACIONAL
TELEFONOS DE VENEZUELA
FOR A SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF VENEZUELA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $35 million to
Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV). The loan would
assist in financing the foreign exchange costs of the expansion of the
national telecommunications system during the period 1970-7h. It would be
for a term of 16 years, including a 5-year period of grace, with interest
at 7-1/h percent, and would be guaranteed by the Republic of Venezuela.
2.        The status of previous Bank loans to Venezuela is summarized in
Annex I. Country and project data sheets are attached hereto as Annexes
II and III. An economic report on Venezuela (CA-5a) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on October 12, 1970. An appraisal report on the
proposed project (PU-50) is being distributed separately.
PART I - COUNTRY BACKGROUND
3.        Venezuela received its first loan, for roads, in December 1961.
Since that date total Bank lending, net of cancellations, has aggregated
$294 million, of which the Bank still holds about $264 million, including
$50 million not yet disbursed. ADproximately half of the lending has been
for power (principally for the Guri hydro-electric project in the Guayana
Region), one-third for roads and the rest for telecommunications and water
supply. The two latest loans, for the expansion of the Guri project and
for expressways in Caracas, were both signed two years ago, in June 1969.
4.        Execution of Bank-financed projects in Venezuela has on the
whole been satisfactory except for a water supply project in Caracas
(Loan 444-VE) where the Borrower has been unable to raise its water
tariffs and has consequently failed to comply with the rate of return
covenant set in the Loan Agreement. For this reason, disbursements on
the loan were suspended for almost two years in agreement with the
Government and the water supply company, pending a final decision on
tariffs.  The loan was closed at the end of August 1970, when the remain-
ing balance of about $4.2 million was cancelled. Construction of the
project has been substantially completed. The difficulties encountered
in the execution of the power and road projects financed under Loans
353-VE and 390-VE respectively, on which I commented in a report to the
Executive Directors in May 1969, have since been resolved, and progress
on these projects is now satisfactory.

5.        Although on paper Venezuela has the highest per capita income in
Latin America (around $1,100 per annum), it is in many respects less
advanced than Argentina, and its development problems are made more
difficult by the high rate of population growth (3½2 percent a year),
serious urban unemployment and heavy dependence on petroleum (over 90 per-
cent of exports, about three fifths of government revenues and 16 percent
of GDP in 1970). The justification for Bank lending to Venezuela has been
based essentially on the country's need for technical assistance in carry-
ing forward the diversification of its economy and on the fact that
Venezuela is not able to obtain more than a small portion of its external
capital requirements at reasonable terms in the private capital markets.
The conclusion reached in the Bank's last economic report, completed about
ten months ago, was that, after allowing for the introduction of new taxes
on the non-oil sector, the Government would need to obtain new external
loan commitments of about $1,000 million over the five years 1970-74 in
order to carry through what the Bank mission considered to be a barely
adequate public investment program, consistent with the maintenance of an
annual rate of growth of GDP of around 5 percent a year. It was recognized
that, with population growing so rapidly, a considerably higher rate of
growth in GDP would be desirable in the longer run, but the feasibility of
carrying through a much larger investment program during the next few years
was questioned on fiscal grounds, and it was considered that time would
anyhow be needed to stimulate and restructure agricultural and industrial
production and to orient them increasingly toward exports - steps which were
regarded as essential for the long-term viability of the economy.
6.        Venezuela does not receive any significant amount of bilateral
aid, other than technical assistance, and borrowing from official sources
is limited to the World Bank Group and the Inter-American Development Bank
and to export credit agencies in equipment-supplying countries.2/
Venezuela has had some access to private capital markets in the past, hav`ng
floated a $15 million public bond issue in New York in 1965 and another
for $25 million in Germany in 1968. In 1969 and 1970, the Government
obtained almost US$200 million from U.S. and Canadian banks, at a term of
five years and an interest cost averaging one percent over the U.S. prime
rate. In Anril of this year the Government negotiated for its petrochemic&-
company a $70 million loan in the Eurodollar market at a rate of 1-4 >lrc=.t
above the six months interbank Eurodollar rate in London adjusted every si:!
ronths, but soundings made by the Government last ycar in New York indicated
1/ Details of past and prospective future borrowing from other lending
agencies are given in Table 4.4 of the Statistical Appendix to the
Economic Report.



- 3 -
that there would be difficulty in raising long-term funds in substantial
amounts, and that the terms were likely to be unfavorable. While
Venezuela's present external debt service ratio is quite lo01 (around
4 percent) and its creditworthiness is not in question, excessive
reliance on financing from commercial banks and suppliers could easily
result in a rapid accumulation of external indebtedness. Therefore, as
pointed out in the economic report, Venezuela should continue to look
to the international lending agencies to meet an important part of its
external capital requirements.
7.        The case for Bank lending to Venezuela needs to be re-examined
as a result of the recent sharp increases in Venezuelan oil prices which
are expected, on the basis of present "reference prices" to raise balance
of payments receipts and government revenues by about $460 million in
1971 and possibly $600 million a year thereafter. This is equivalent to
about 5 percent of GDP and over 20 percent of public sector current
revenues in 1969 and would more than cover the estimated gap in the
financing of the relatively modest public investment program recommended
by the Bank mission without any additional revenue measures. However,
if an appreciably higher rate of growth of GDP is to be achieved, as seems
indeed necessary to cope with the problems of employment and urbanization,
a much larger public investment program may be called for. In that case
the additional oil revenues may still need to be supplemented by further
measures to raise public savings. The Finance IYinister did in fact recoin-
mend a new tax package to Congress last October along the lines fore-
shadowed in the economic report,j/ but no action has been taken on this
recommendation because of the opportunity that has been suddenly presented
to increase Venezuela's oil "take".
8.        The need to restructure the economy and particularly to develop
more efficient manufacturing industries remains as great as ever, since
the petroleum industry cannot make any significant contribution to a
solution of the employment problem, and the economy will continue to be
vulnerable to sudden changes in the world oil situation. Venezuela's
competitive position as a supplier of petroleum has probably not suffered
in the short run from the recent price increases in view of parallel
developments in North Africa and the iMiddle East, but prospects for new
investments required to maintain output growth at reasonable cosit in the
petroleum sector are uncertain. Although the first service contracts were
recently signed for exploration of an area in the south of Lake Maracaibo,
1/ Report CA-5a, page 37, paragraph 92.



- 4 -
the output from these investments will not raise total production, but
at best maintain it for a few years from the mid-seventies. Overall
petroleum exploration in Venezuela is low by historical standards because
of limited investment by the major producers in anticipation of the end
of their concessions in 1983.   The state company, Corporacion Venezolana
de Petroleo (CVP), with only about 5 percent of present productive
capacity, does not yet appear to be in a position to take up the slack.
9.        Now that the immediate fiscal constraint has been eased, and
prospects for faster economic growth are enhanced, a reassessment cf
Venezuela's development program is called for with a view to achieving
a more rapid increase in public investment and providing industry with
stronger incentives for export promotion. In line with the development
strategy outlined in the economic report, the major concentr:tion Cof invent-
ments would still be in the "Core Region", which extends from just east
of Caracas to west of Valencia and accounts for roughly 70 percent of
the nation's industrial production, three-quarters of all employment in
industry and about one-third of the total population. At the same time
larger expenditures are certainly justified on education, health and other
social services in order to improve the conditions of the poor and raise
the efficiency of the labor force.
10.       The Bank plans to send another economic mission to Venezuela
later this year to review the prospects for the economy in the light of
the recent developments in petroleum prices. IMeanwhile, to the extent
that the Bank, by lending for selective purposes, can help to increase
the public sector's capability to prepare and implement sound investment
projects and thereby ease the administrative constraints on economic
development, I believe that continued Bank lending to Venezuela will be
justified. Apart from the telecommunications project now under considera-
tion, the Bank has appraised a first livestock credit project and a
project for the expansion of Maiquetia Airport (near Caracas) and is
working on the preparation of a project for the construction of a subway
in Caracas.  A project is also being developed with assistance from UNESCO
for the improvement and expansion of general secondary education. Bank
participation in these projects would help in diversifying the economy,
in building up new institutions, and in strengthening existing ones. I
propose therefore that we should proceed with work on these projects with
a view to some further lending during the next 12-18 months, but that we
should delay appraisal of any new projects until the longer-term prospects
for public finances and the balance of payments have been clarified.
11.       Consistently with the economic assessment given above, somewhat
shorter terms are proposed for the telecommunications loan now under con-
sideration than would be justified on project grounds alone.



PART II - THE PROJECT
12.       The proposed telecommunications project is broadly similar in
concept to that previously financed by the Bank in Venezuela and does not
raise any major issue of Bank policy. The Bank would provide part of the
funds required to implement CANTV's five-year expansion program, which
consists of: 1/
(a) installation of about 370,000 lines of local exchange
equipment and cable netwiork and associated facilities
to provide an increase of about 250OCO connected direct
exchange lines (DELs);
(b) installation of new microwave links and provision of
multiplexing equipment for 8,000 channels on existing
and new links;
(c) installation of a satellite ground terminal station
and associated facilities;
(d) installation of about 1,700 telex lines; and
(e) assistance of consultants in the improvement of organi-
zation and operating procedures.
13.       The total program, which is expected to cost about $318 million,
including $146 million in foreign exchange, is scheduled to be completed
by December 31, 197h. About three-quarters of the expenditures would be
for the expansion of local services, one-fifth for national long-distance
services and the remainder for international services, telex and consult-
ants. The proposed Bank loan would finance 11 percent of the total
funds required and 24 percent of the foreign exchange cost.   CANTV would
provide 43 percent of the total requirements from cash generated from
within the enterprise; another 28 percent would be obtained from suppliers'
credits and medium-term loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and U.S.
comr.ercial banks, 13 percent from domestic bond issues, 3 percent from
subscribers' deposits and 2 percent from the collection of overdue
accounts.
14.       The project would be executed by CANTV, a stock company wholly
owned by the Government which has been in operation since 1930, and which
provides virtually all public telephone service in Venezuela. CANTV's
recent expansion program, partly financed by Loan 435-VE, has resulted
1/  The appraisal report, which is distributed separately, is based on
the findings of a mission to Venezuela in March/April 1970. There
have been certain minor adjustments in the program since then which
were reviewed by a further mission to Venezuela in Miarch 1971 and
are reflected in the paragraphs which follow.

in administrative and financial improverments. During the disbursement
period of the second loan CANTV would strengthen further its management
and improve its efficiency of operations and engineering planning. The
program provides for the engagement of consultants to review the manage-
ment of CANTV. These consultants would be financed under the proposed
Bank loan.  In addition, CANTV is arranging through the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) to obtain technical experts from the
Australian Post Office and to have CANTV engineers trained in Australia.
ITU is also participating as executing agency for a UNDP-financed
project for training of telecommunications technicians.  The Loan
Agreement includes a special covenant on staffing, which would call
for an improvement in staff utilization from over 18 persons per thousand
telephones in service at present to 15 per thousand telephones in 1974.
15.       The financial position of CANTV is expected to remain sound
through the project period. The rate of return on its average net assets
in operation is projected to rise gradually from 9.2 percent in 1970 to
over 15 percent by 1974. This compares with the minimum rate of return
of 8 percent prescribed under the previous loan; this minimum would be
maintained under the second loan through 1972, but thereafter would be
increased to 11 percent to ensure that CANTV contributes an adequate
share to the project and future investment programs.
16.       The coverage of debt service (by net revenues) under the
previous loan was agreed at 2.0, which was a somewhat conservative
ratio because this was a first Bank operation with CANTV. It is now
proposed to lower the ratio to 1.5 since the relatively large expansion
program will require a substantial increase in CANTV's medium-term
indebtedness. This lower level of debt service coverage is still
considered satisfactory for CAMTV's normal operation. Nevertheless,
at the rate of expansion presently foreseen, this ratio is not expected
to fall substantially below 2.0 through 1974, after which it would
improve again.
17.       The backlog of unpaid accounts has grown daring recent years.
In order to remedy this situation and to help CANTV's liquidity position,
the loan would not be declared effective until satisfactory arrangements
have been made for collection of arrears and current charges for telecom-
munications services rendered to departments, autonomous institutes and
other agencies of the Guarantor, and of arrears owing by state and
municipal authorities. A further condition of effectiveness would be
the submission of satisfactory evidence that CANTV has been authorized
to establish a subscriber guarantee deposit.
18.       All goods financed under the proposed Bank loan would be
procured through international competitive bidding. Hitherto the
procurement of cable was reserved exclusively for domestic manufacturers.
The draft Loan Agreement provides that two-thirds in value of cable to
be procured for CANTV's 1970-74 program, including all cable to be
financed out of the proposed loan, would be procured on the basis of



- 7 -
international competitive bidding. The one-third of cable procurement
still reserved for domestic suppliers would represent an amount slightly
in excess of CANTV's average annual purchases from them in the past,
but in the future CANTV would be in a position to check their prices
against international bids. Domestic cable manufacturers who entered
bids under the procurement open to international competitive bidding
would be allowed a margin of preference in the evaluation of bids equal
to 15 percent or the actual customs duty, whichever is the lower. In
the case of switching equipment, to be financed outside the proposed
Bank loan, procurement will mostly be by international bidding limited
to the two types of cross-bar systems now installed or on order. The
balance would be procured, for reasons of standardization, from existing
suppliers on the basis of prices established through earlier internationa2.
bidding and options available under existing contracts.
19.       No orders have been placed so far for goods to be financed by
the Bank. However, invitations to bid for telephones have already been
issued. The consultants' services contract, involving professional fees
of about $27h,000 and expenses of about $95,000, has already been placed,
but retroactive financing under this heading would not amount to more
than about $125,000.
20.       The project is technically sound and economically justified.
A conservative estimate of the benefits based on the net incremental
operating cash flows and costs attributable to the program at present
tariff levels, indicates an internal financial rate of return of around
21 percent.
PART III - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHOPITY
21.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and CANTV, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Venezuela and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section h (iii),
of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately. Apart
from the particular features which have already been mentioned, the
draft Agreements contain provisions substantially similar to those in
the Agreements for the first telecommunications project (Loan 435-VE).
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
