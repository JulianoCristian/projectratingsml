Telecommunications Project in\n            Venezuela (Loan 770-VE) was part of a long-term plan of\n            telecommunications development, and its aim was to extend\n            and improve national and international telecommunications\n            services. Compania Anonima Nacional de Telefonos de\n            Venezuela (CANTV), the provider of telecommunications\n            services in Venezuela, as well as a wholly Government-owned\n            utility, is satisfied with the quality and the efficiency of\n            the plant obtained with Bank funds through contractors. The\n            project has generally achieved, though with some delay, the\n            physical growth targets, and less so the institutional\n            improvements envisaged at the time of appraisal. The large\n            unsatisfied demand for telecommunications services, the\n            improved quality of service during the project period and\n            the substantial decrease in real terms of tariff levels,\n            indicate the existence of a consumer surplus. Assuming\n            CANTV's subscribers are willing to pay the same tariffs\n            in real terms as they were paying in 1973, the economic rate\n            of return on the investment program is estimated at 27\n            percent. Several conclusions were drawn from the experiences\n            of this project. Changes in personnel and organization of a\n            rapidly expanding entity are inevitable. During the period\n            of the project, several changes in top management occurred.\n            Bank project staff should also carefully monitor project\n            progress reports both for their timely receipt and for their\n            contents. If borrowers are slack in submission of the\n            reports, the Bank should send regular reminders. In 1980\n            CANTV became less interested in using the remaining US$5.8\n            million of Bank loan funds due to the findings of a study\n            based on the 1978-79 experience, when CANTV found itself\n            with several sources of investment capital, which due to\n            exchange losses on the Bank loan accumulated up to that\n            time, was less costly than Bank funds. The Bank should have\n            pushed CANTV to review the loan allocation and to recommend\n            use of the surplus funds by either preparing proposals for\n            procurement of other goods and for their utilization, or to\n            insist that the loan should be closed. Finally, if the Bank\n            wants to exert sufficient leverage in improving the\n            borrowers institutional performance, its contribution should\n            be a larger part of the program costs."}, "docdt": "1983-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
