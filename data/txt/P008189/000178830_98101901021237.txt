PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
VENEZUELA - SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 770-VE)
Preface
1.        This report covers the second telecommunications project
supported by Loan 770-VE. The Loan of US$35.0 million was approved in June
1971, and was fully disbursed (after cancellation of US$5.8 million) in
June 1980, four and one-half years after the original closing date.
2.        The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared in the Industry
Department of the Bank on the basis of information and data supplied by
Compania Anonima Nacional de Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV), and gathered
by a project completion mission which visited Venezuela in July/August
1981. The project was not subject to an OED audit.
3.        The PCR was sent to the Borrower and the Government of Venezuela
for comments and these comments (reproduced as an appendix to this report)
have been taken into account in finalizing the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
VENEZUELA - SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 770-VE)
Highlights
1.        The Second Telecommunications Project in Venezuela was CANTV's
five year (1970-74) telecommunications development program and comprised
the installation of (a) 370,000 additional local exchange equipment to make
about 250,000 additional connections; (b) telex equipment; (c) long
distance service equipment including an earth satellite station.
Additionally, consultants were retained for improving organization and
operating procedures. The project was expected to be completed by December
31, 1974 whereas it was mainly completed by December 31, 1975. Total
project cost was about to US$317.9 million--about a 5 percent increase over
appraisal estimates of US$300.3 million.
2.        Due to higher than expected traffic per subscriber, CANTV's gross
revenues surpassed appraisal estimates. This was achieved despite tariffs
being kept constant in nominal terms during the period 1967-80 and despite
delayed connection of new subscribers. However, due to inflation,
operating expenses increased at a faster rate than revenues, resulting in
the deterioration of CANTV's financial performance (paragraph 5.02). The
covenanted 11 percent rate of return was complied with only during the
years 1976 and 1977 (paragraph 5.03). A 30 percent tariff increase,
effective as from June 1, 1981, was according to CANTV's calculations,
sufficient to produce a rate of return in excess of covenanted level as
from this year (paragraph 6.14).
3. The internal financial rate of return of the project is now estimated at
9 percent, which compares unfavorably with the appraisal estimate of
21 percent. The main reason for the lower than appraisal financial return
of the project is the substantial decrease in real terms of CANTV's tariff
levels (paragraph 7.04). Assuming CANTV's subscribers are willing to pay
the same tariffs in real terms as they were paying in 1973, the economic
rate of return is now estimated at 27 percent (paragraph 7.05).
4.        In analyzing the project experience, the PCR stresses the
importance of: (a) careful monitoring of project execution
(paragaph 9.02), (b) timely action to reallocate eventual unused funds or
to close the Loan if funds are not reallocated (paragraph 9.03), and (c)
fixing the amount of Loan at a level that gives the Bank sufficient
leverage to improve the Borrower 's performance (paragraph 9.03).

COMPANIA ANONIMA NACIONAL DE TELEFONOS DE VENEZUELA (CANTV)
LOAN 770-VE
COMPLETION REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01       Telecommunications services in Venezuela are provided by Compania
Anonima Nacional de Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV), a wholly Government-owned
utility; and the Instituto Postal Telegraphico (IPOSTEL) a department within
the Ministry of Transport and Communications. CANTV operates all public
local telephone, national and international telephone and telex services; and
IPOSTEL is responsible for national and international telegraph services.
Linea Aeropostal Venezolana (LAV) which was temporarily operating
international telegraph services at the time of project appraisal, has made
over operation of these services to IPOSTEL.
1.02       The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector in
Venezuela since 1965. The first telecommunications project financed by Bank
Loan 435-VE of December 13, 1965 helped to establish a basic high quality
long distance network between the main cities, improve international
connections, and expand local service.    The project was satisfactorily
completed in October 1970.
1.03       In June 1971, the Bank approved a second Bank loan for US$35
million for financing part of CANTV's 1970-74 telecommunicatiorns development
program which aimed at (a) meeting part of the demand for telecommunications
services during this period by doubling the then existing number of
connections; and (b) expanding the lorg distance facilities to hardle the
expected increase in traffic.    The project was estimated to cost US$317.9
million including a foreign exchange expenditure of US$145.7 million
equivalent. This project is the subject of this completion report.
2. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01       In September 1969 the Government of Venezuela enquired into the
possibility of Bank participation in the financing of CANTV's proposed
1970-74 telecommunications development program. The program including the
proposed facilities was received in the Bank in February 1970, with a forma]
request for a loan of about US$40 million. An appraisal mission visited
Venezuela in March/April 1970. Negotiations for the loan were held in
Washington in September 1970. The Bank's Board of Directors approved a loan
for US$35 million on June 29, 1971. Board presentation of the loan was



delayed after negotiations were completed, tb ensure that the Venezuelan
Congress had acted on the necessary enabling legislation.     The Loan and
Guarantee Agreements were signed on June 30, 197].
Project's Objectives in Long-Term Plan
2.02       The project was part of a long-term plan of telecommunications
development, and Wds a continuation of the earlier Bank financed project.
Its dim was to extend and improve national and international
telecommunications services and to extend and upgrade the telex network.
The project also aimed at improving and strengthening the institution to
enable it to cope with the heavier responsibilities of an expanded future
network.
Project Description
2.03       The Bank financed project was CANTV's five-year (1970-74)
telecommunications program and comprised the following:
(a)  the installation of about 370,000 lines of local exchange
equipment, cable network, and associated facilities, to
provide an increase of about 250,000 connected direct
exchange lines;
(b)  the installation of new microwave links and provision of
multiplex equipment for about 8,000 channels on existing
and on new links;
(c) the installation of a satellite ground terminal station
and associated facilities;
(d)  the installation of about 1,700 telex lines; and
(e) retention of consultants for improving organization and
operating procedures.
The project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1974.
Covenants
2.04       The Loan Agreement provided that the Borrower shall:
(a)  employ consultants acceptable to the Bank upon terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to assist the
Borrower in improving its organization and operating
procedures (Section 4.02);
(b) take all necessary measures to improve personnel
utilization, including the regulation of employment of
new personnel in such a manner that the number of



employees of the Borrower per thousand telephones will be
progressively reduced to not more than 15 by December 31,
1974 (Section 4.03);
(c)  have its accounts and financial statements (balance
sheets, statement of income and expenses and related
statements) for each fiscal year audited, in accordance
with sound auditing principles consistently applied, by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and furnish
to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not
later than four months after the end of each such year,
certified copies of its financial statements for such
dudit by the said auditors, of such scope and in such
detail as the Bank shall have reasonably requested
(Section 5.02);
(d) take all necessary steps to adjust and maintain tariffs
for telecommunications services, and shall take all other
actions as shall be required to produce an annual rate of
return of not less than 8% until December 31, 1972, and
11% thereafter, on the value of the Borrower's average
net fixed assets in operation; further, the Borrower
shall not during the period of carrying out the project,
lower any tariffs for telecommunications services
(Section 5.03);
(e) not (i) during the period of construction of the project
incur any debt other than debt on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, incurred for purposes of
financing the project; and (ii) thereafter incur any debt
unless its net revenues for the fiscal year next
preceding such incurrence or for a later 12-month period
ended prior to such incurrence whichever is greater,
shall be less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service
requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all the
Borrower's debt, including the debt to be incurred
(Section 5.05);
(f) not, during the period of construction of the project,
declare or pay any dividend or make any other
distribution on any of the shares of common stock of the
Borrower from time to time outstanding other than a
dividend payable in such shares (Section 5.06); and
(g) establish and maintain effective collection procedures
satisfactory to the Bank to ensure that payments for the
Borrower's services are brought up to date and maintained
on a current basis (Section 5.07).



- 4 -
!.05      The Guarantee Agreement provided that the Guarantor shall (a) take
dl1 such action as will be necessary to enable the Borrower to obtain from
time to time such adjustments in the telecommunications tariffs as will
)rovide revenues sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 5.03 of the
.oan Agreement (Section 3.02); and (b) promptly pay or cause to be paid, to
the Borrower on a current basis all charges incurred by the Guarantor or by
any of its departments agencies or instrumentalities in respect of
telecommunications services furnished by the Borrower (Section 3.03).
2.06      Additional side letters were exchanged wherein CANTV agreed to
Exchange views with the Bank when making appointments to the posts of
'resident and general manager, and on personnel limitations.
2.07      The covenants were suggested by the Bank to ensure CANTV's
institutional and financial viability during the project period and were
accepted by CANTV.
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-Up
3.01      The loan became effective on March 31, 1972, about nine months
after loan signature. The delay was caused by the necessity to complete
formalities within CANTV and the Government of Venezuela. Procurement action
for cables and telephones was initiated before loan signature but most of the
procurement action was commenced after loan signature. Contracts were signed
progressively from October 1971 (for consultants), and from January 1973
Dnwards for equipment. The last contract was signed on October 15, 1976.
Annex 1 sets out details of procurement for each of the Bank financed goods.
Though Bank approved CANTV bid (LD-29) award recommendation for microwave
radio medium capacity equipment in May 1976, CANTV did not send the Bank the
contract. Current CANTV staff were of the opinion that with several changes
Dccuring in the organization, the fact that this procurement was to be
financed under the Loan, was perhaps unknown to the new staff. CANTV did
however, sign a contract for these goods and is financing the cost with its
Dwn resources.
Revision of the Project
3.02      The project staff appraisal gray cover report (SAR) differs in many
respects with the president's report. From the information in the files, an
appraisal updating mission visited Venezuela in March 1971, and made several
-hanges in the project as appears in the SAR. The mission considered that
the adjustments and redefinitions of CANTV's investment program and financing
:lan were not significant and not different in size and nature from those
normally occurring periodically in any ongoing telecommunications enterprize,



- 5 -
and therefore it was not considered necessary to revise the gray cover
appraisal report issued in October 1970 following negotiations.     The
president's report however reflected all the update mission changes. The
basic changes relate to the physical program (some items), program costs,
disbursement schedule, justification, and financial forecasts. The physical
changes are set out in Annex 2; the program costs increased from about
US$300.3 million (with a foreign exchange content of US$132.9 million), to
US$ 317.9 million (with about US$145.7 million in foreign costs).     The
estimated disbursement schedule used in paragraph 3.07 of this report is the
updated revision of March 1971.
Implementation Schedule
3.03       The project's completion date was scheduled at appraisal for
December 31, 1974. During the project period, CANTV revised its physical
targets and using its own funds increased the number of telex equipment lines
to be installed, and telex subscribers. As a consequence of this upward
revision, and the complexity in calculation with diverse works with diverse
completion dates, it is not possible to accurately indicate overall what
proportion of the original project work was completed by that date. However,
completion of various installations ranged from 51% to 232% of the original
targets.    The following table give the summary position as of December 31,
1974. Details are set out in Annex 3.

Procurement
3.04      While CANTV did not encounter any problems generally in the
procurement of equipment in accordance with Bank's guidelines, a problem did
arise in goods procurement--pertaining to telephones and cables.     In the case
of telephones CANTV prequalified some companies thereby rejecting several
well known manufacturers. The Bank did not agree with CANTV's basis for
rejection. Ultimately, CANTV financed this procurement using its own funds,
and Bank permitted CANTV to reallocate the funds originally allocated for
telephones procurement, to procurement of coin boxes and additional power
plant. In the case of cables, CANTV used prequalification procedures which
according to the Bank, CANTV had agreed to delete. The Bank approved CANTV's



- 6 -
procedures as a last exception. CANTV agreed to drop prequalification
requirements in the procurement of all other Bank financed goods, and
accordingly the later procurements did not provide for prequalification.
Costs and Disbursements
3.05       CANTV's current accounting system does not permit any detailed
analysis to be made to identify local costs separately for each item of the
program as appraised. During the completion report mission discussions,
CANTV staff were of the impression that the project comprised only the Bank
financed goods, and therefore did not identify total project costs. Even
otherwise, the information now given in respect of Bank-financed items is
incomplete.    The mission received information on total (local plus foreign)
actual investment expenditures on the second telecommunications project from
1971 through 1978. Since part, or maybe, full expenditures on some parts of
the project occurred during the appraised project construction (1971-74)
years and others occurred after this period, and since the project was
revised considerably during these years, it is impossible to identify the
costs pertaining to the original project as appraised.     The program
investment costs (see Annex 4) obtained from CANTV for individual items vary
significantly--up and down--from both appraisal forecasts through 1974, and
CANTV's own forecasts thereafter through 1978. CANTV staff are unable to
explain the variations.
3.06       In as far as local service is concerned, the total investment from
1971-78 was Bs 2,117.9 million (US$492.5 million). This expenditure does not
represent the exact exchange lines costs as some of the expenditure is
carried over from previous years, and some is carried over to subsequent
years. If, however, we use these costs as some approximation of actual costs
for the number of exchange lines installed (623,440) during this period, the
average cost per exchange line installed would be about US$789. The
appraisal costs were estimated at US$227.0 million for installation of about
347,000 exchange lines--an average per exchange line cost of US$654. Part of
the increase would undoubtedly be due to inflation during 1974-78, but this
cannot be quantified as part of the total equipment installed during 1974-78
(and, therefore, the cost incurrence) could have been received in the earlier
years for installation in following years.
Disbursements
3.07       The estimated and actual total annual disbursements of the Bank
loan were as follows:

1/  An amount of about US$5,800,000 was cancelled.
2/  Figures within brackets use US$29,200,000 as
base for final amount of loan.
3.08       The slippage in disbursements was due to inordinate delay in
evaluation of bids, and in contract finalization after Bank approved CANTV's
bid award recommendations (see comment at end of Annex 1). In some cases,
the Bank files do not indicate if any review of the contract was made by the
project department. The figures against actual as a percentage of appraisal
do not give a clear picture of the status of disbursement as CANTV did not
sign contracts, or call for bids after October 1976, even though about
US$5.80 million was lying unused. To get a more accurate picture of the
status, the actual percentage could be a calculated on the final loan amount,
i.e., US$29.2 million. The calculations in the last column shown in brackets
indicate the results based on the final loan amount.
Loarn Allocation
3.09      The original and final allocation of the loan proceeds was as
follows:



Loan Allocation

III Consultants                               300,000       300,000
IV  Unallocated                               250,000     5,800,0002
Total                                35,000,00O    35,000,000
1/ These items were included and allocation changed when Bank
financing for telephones was not agreed to see para. 3.04.
2/ This amount of loan funds was cancelled.
CANTV decided in the first instance not to purchase concentrators but to
replace these by mobile exchanges and later CANTV decided against the mobile
exchange purchase also, as CANTV system design was changed after a review was
made. There are discrepancies between Bank and CANTV final loan allocation.
For instance, while CANTV did not procure any goods under category l(c), the
Bank loan account shows a disbursement of US$100,000. Reconciliation of the
discrepancies between CANTV and Bank disbursements against each category
would be time consuming and will certainly not produce any results
commensurate with the effort, and has therefore not been attempted.
According to CANTV's calculation of contract value, allocation would be as
follows:



-9-
Category                           Allocation

III                                  300,000
Total                              29,209,330
Balance                              5,790,6701
1/  The amount actually cancelled was
US$5,829,220--a difference of US$38,550.
The difference (probably due to exchange
variations) is negligible.
During the completion report missions' discussions, CANTV has been unable to
state the reasons for the variation of utilization of loan funds between the
revised allocation and actual disbursements under various categories. If
however, the Bank had financed the procurement of microwave radio equipment
(see paragraph 3.01), the variation under Category II would have been
eliminated, and a smaller amount of the Loan cancelled.
Operations
3.10       CANTV is satisfied with the quality and the efficiency of the plant
obtained with Bank funds through contractors. The equipment was supplied in
accordance with the technical specifications which were reviewed in the
Bank. According to CANTV, the performance of the equipment has met all the
specified requirements.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower
3.11       CANTV retained the services of a consultant under the project to
assist CANTV in financial management. CANTV staff are satisfied with the
services rendered by the consultant.    The suppliers and contractors for
various installation works have performed well and in accordance with their
contractual obligations. The exchange installation contractors delayed their
works but this was reportedly due to labor troubles in the initial stages.
CANTV has good technical personnel, fully capable of operating all types of
telecommunications equipment. Cable installations dre carried out by CANTV
personnel except for civil works involving construction of cable ducts which
are carried out by contractors under .CANTV supervision. Automatic exchange
installations were carried out by suppliers with CANTV staff assistance,
while long distance transmission equipment was partly installed by CANTV
staff and partly by contractors with CANTV staff assistance. CANTV, however,
failed to inform the Bank regularly about the projects progress as very few



- 10 -
reports were received in the Bank. The progress on the project was reviewed
mainly through Bank supervision missions. Judged from the generally
satisfactory progress in services provision, CANTV has performed adequately
on the technical side.
4. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Market Forces
4.01       CANTV originally planned the installation of a total of about
372,000 additional equipment lines, and the connection of about 248,000
additional connections. The demand at the end of 1969 was 328,369 comprising
252,369connections plus 76,000 unfilled applications. CANTV's anticipated
demand at end of 1970 and 1974 was about 657,900 and 824,600 respectively,
and the working connections were 272,066 and 427,006 respectively.      The
actual demand at the end of 1970 and 1974 is not available as information on
the number of unfilled applications as of end 1970 and 1974 is not
available.   If we consider CANTV's growth in the number of connections in the
1970-80 period for gauging the growth rate, the connections reached 775,000
at end 1980--which shows an annual growth rate of 11%. CANTV is currently
executing another expansion plan to increase the annual connection rate by
12%.
5. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

FY70-76 set out in Annex 5 are summarized below:

1/  On assets valued at historic cost.
2/ Appraisal report contained projections through 1976 only.
5.02      CANTV's tariffs remained constant during the period 1967-80 (para-
graph 6.14). Despite unchanged tariffs and delay in making new connections,
CANTV's total revenues surpassed appraisal estimates, due mainly to higher
than expected revenues per subscriber. However, operating expenses increased
at a faster rate than revenues, resulting in the deterioration of the
operating ratio and the rate of return.   Changed accounting procedures1 and
an increase in the connection making rate in 1976 led to a temporary
improvement of financial performance in 1976 and 1977 (see Table above). In
1978, however, operating costs started to increase much faster than CANTV's
revenues and by 1980 CANTV's rate of return was negative.
5.03      CANTV surpassed the 8% covenanted rate of return through 1972
partly due to capitalization of certain operating expenses as from 1971.
This capitalization was not foreseen at the time of appraisal. The 11
percent rate of return covenanted as from 1973 onwards was only complied with
during the years 1976 and 1977 (paragraph 5.01). A tariff increase effective
as from June 1981, has, according to CANTV's projections, resulted in a rate
of return in excess of covenanted levels as from 1981 (paragraph 6.14).
1/ Provision for staff benefits were dissolved thereby reducing operating
costs for personnel and certain bad debts were reinstated (paragraph
6.12).

5.05       The slippage in capital works completion and additions to the
investment program are reflected in the high value of work in progress, as
compared with 1976 appraisa] values. Other non-current assets increased more
than projected, partly due to higher than expected overdue amounts for
accounts receivables as CANTV's collection procedures were not effective in
ensuring timely payment for its services (paragraph 6.11).
5.06       Current liabilities exceeded current assets mainly due to a sharp
increase in current maturities, reflecting a higher than projected long-term
debt on increasingly shorter terms. Up to 1975 the new borrowings was mainly
used to carry out CANTV's investment program, but thereafter most new funds
were needed for debt service on already existing loans. CANTV's debt/equity
ratio was weaker than projected in 1976, despite an unprojected government
capital contribution of about Bs 370 million in 1975. Long-term debt for 1980
includes Bs 500 million from Government.    No debt service on this amount has
been established and CANTV has suggested to Government that the amount be
converted into a capital contribution.

5.07       CANTV made no effort to establish the effects of inflation on the
value of its fixed assets and the Bank did not require that they be revalued.

5.09       Due to possible higher than projected unit costs, and additions to
CANTV's FY70-76 investment program, the total investment cost was higher than
projected. Furthermore, higher operating costs led to lower internal cash
generation. Resulting cash deficit was partly covered by a government equity
contribution in 1975 (Bs 369 million), but the bulk of the deficit had to be
covered by increased borrowing (paragraph 5.06).
5.10       The large amounts of new long-term debt with relatively short
maturities led to a sharply increased debt service, which over the 1970-80
period far exceeded CANTVs internal cash generation. CANTV did not inform the
Bank, or ask for its opinion, on the terms and conditions of the new debt, and
did not meet the debt limitation covenant established under the project.
5.11       As covenanted with the Bank, no dividends were declared by CANTV
during the construction period of the project.

6. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01       CANTV has carried out a heavy construction program and at end W'
1980 operated about 775,000 connected lines--502,900 of these contected
during 1970-80. This is certainly a creditable achievement.
6.02       CANTV has demonstrated an ability to procure goods through
international competitive bidding, to prepare contracts, to supervise
contractor installations, and to acceptance testing of such installations.
6.03       CANTV has also developed an effective planning organization and has
integrated this project with the following (1976-81) CANTV financed project
to develop long-term network expansion designed to meet public demands. The
connections made over and above those provided for during the project period,
enabled CANTV's connections to increase from about 427,006 lines in 1974, to
about 775,000 lines in 1980. At the end of 1980, CANTV's exchange capacity
was.1,202,275 lines, against 365,160 at end of 1970. The quality of project
technical implementation was adequate.
Growth
6.04       In all aspects of its activity, CANTV has shown a remarkable growth
in plant installed, traffic carried and revenues.
6.05       Despite the considerable service expansion, CANTV has not yet been
able to meet the full demand for service. CANTV has prepared a future
(1982-85) telecommunications development plan and expects at the termination
of the plan to meet all demands for service.
Staff Recruitment, Training and Development
6.06       The number of staff as of December 31, 1980, was 17,115.     The
number of telephones operated on that date was approximately 775,000 x 1.42
= 1,085,000 and the staff ratio was 15.7 per 1,000 telephones. At appraisal
time the staff ratio was 18.3 per 1,000 telephones.     Section 4.03 of the Loan
Agreement required CANTV to reduce this ratio to 15 by December 31, 1974. As
of that date, CANTV's staff numbered 9,278, and the number of telephones as
597,800 (assuming 1.4 telephones per main connection--it was 1.5 at the time
Df appraisal). The ratio was thus 15.5 per 1,000 telephones, close to that
required in the covenant.
,.07      CANTV has provided good technical training facilities to its
staff. The training center was set up in 1974 with UNDP financing and is
functioning well. About 2,300 personnel were trained in 1980. CANTV has had
lo significant problems in the recruitment of professional and
ion-professional staff.

Accounting and Audit
6.08       CANTV's financial statements for FY72 were received by the Bank in
August 1973 and the FY73 statements in September 1974. Statements for
FYs74-80 were made over to Bank supervision missions to Venezuela. CANTV
routinely completed its financial statements about three months after the end
of its fiscal year, but in no case were statements for the project period
made available to the Bank within the covenanted four months of the close of
CANTV's fiscal year.
6.09       Based on recommendations given in the audit report for FY70, CANTV
started as from FY72 to capitalize interest for loans financing work in
progress and about 10 percent of its operating expenses. This procedure led
to a higher rate of return as shown in CANTV's financial statements. As the
basis for capitalization of operating expenses is not available, no definite
opinion on its adequacy can be given. As compared with practices adopted by
other telephone companies, however, capitalized amounts appear high.
6.10       In the FY70-80 period, CANTV changed external auditors three times:
FY70-72 Price Waterhouse, FY73 Szoychen, Diaz, Carillo and Associate, FY74-79
Perez-Mena and Everts and for FY80 C. Carrillo & Associates. The Bank was
not consulted when new auditors were appointed.
Billing and Collection
6.11       CANTV classifies its bills receivable into current (overdue less
than one year) and non-current (overdue a year or more). Private subscribers
are given about two months from the date of billing to pay and are liable to
be disconnected in case of non-payment. In practice however,disconnection is
often delayed. The bulk of non-current bills receivable are for services to
government subscribers. Provisions for bad debts are made annually after a
review of non-current bills receivable.
6.12       The development of CANTV's accounts receivable in 1970-80 is given
below in Bs. millions:

reinstated in 1976.
3/  Of which Bs. 527.9 million are for services to government subscribers.
6.13      In 1972 CANTV started to sign agreements with official subscribers
for collection of bills for services rendered. These agreements did not,
however, substantially improve the situation. In September 1975, the
national congress enacted a law regulating the collection or compensation of
bills for services rendered by one government organization to another. In
the case of CANTV, this law did not basically improve the then existing
unsatisfactory situation. At the end of 1980, outstanding bills equaled
about 6.2 months of billings, which is high by any standard. Furthermore,
substantial amounts were set aside during 1970-80 as provisions for bad
debts. CANTV was, therefore, up to 1980 not able to establish and maintain
effective collection procedures as covenanted. In 1981, a presidential order
was issued requiring that CANTV's new bills to government, be paid within 90
days. Ways to collect old bills are being studied.
Tariffs
6.14      CANTV's tariffs remained basically unchanged in 1967-80, despite
rising operating costs. In April 1981 a tariff increase was gazetted and the
new tariffs were made effective as from June 1981.    The tariff increase was
expected to increase CANTV's revenues by an average of about 30% which,
according to CANTV's calculations, has resulted in a rate of return on
average net fixed assets in operation as from 1981 in excess of covenanted
11% (Annex 11).

7. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Project Achievements
7.01       The project has generally achieved, though with some delay, the
physical growth targets, and less so the institutional improvements envisaged
at the time of appraisal. Most of the early construction delays were due to
delay in the signing of goods contracts, and contractors failure to complete
installations in time, because in a large part labor troubles created
execution problems. The delays were made up after 1974. With an accelerated
connection making schedule about 283,000 connections were added during
1975-79, against 154,940 added during 1970-74.
Project Spin-Off
7.02       The projects equipment requirements have stimulated extension and
improvements in the existing manufacturing industry. Prior to this project,
cables and telephones were manufactured in Venezuela, but production
increases resulted from the project equipment needs. CANTV staff mentioned
that proposals have been finalized for the local manufacture of switching
equipment, and action to select a collaborator is being considered.
Least Cost Solution
7.03       The system design of long distance equipment on various routes
utilizing microwave radio and multiplex equipment, and the use of automatic
exchange equipment in all large, medium, and in a large number of small,
exchanges where adequate long distance facilities were available, were the
most economical way of providing service.    The type of local and long
distance equipment selected for use in various towns and areas was based on
least cost technical criteria.
Return On Investment
7.04       The internal financial rate of return for CANTV's 1973-78
investment program is 9 percent (Annex 8). This compares unfavorably with
the appraisal estimate of 21 percent. The difference was mainly due to
increases of operating costs caused by inflation and constant tariffs in
nominal terms during 1967-80 (paragraph 6.14).
7.05       The large unsatisfied demand for telecommunications services, the
improved quality of service during the project period and the substantial
decrease in real terms of tariff levels, indicate the existence of a consumer
surplus. Assuming CANTV's subscribers are willing to pay the same tariffs in
real terms as they were paying in 1973, the economic rate of return on the
investment program is estimated at 27% (Annex 8). This compares favorably
with the appraised 22%.



- 18 -
8. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01       The project identified for Bank financing aimed at the provision of
facilities where they were required, and at the least cost. The project
design was well conceived and was justified. The Bank was instrumental in
getting CANTV to implement financial management improvement through financing
consultants to assist CANTV in first identifying areas of weakness,
suggesting remedies and then generally setting up and overseeing systems to
suit the remedies.
Supervision
8.02       The Bank's project supervision missions did not visit Venezuela at
regular intervals. Through 1975, missioris were mounted fairly regularly with
about one each year but thereafter only three supervision missions visited
Venezuela. There was one mission each in 1976, in 1978 and in 1980. The
1978 mission only updated the supervision summary in September 1978. Though
the terms of reference for the 1980 mission specified that if the project was
fully completed a project completion report should be prepared, only a
supervision report was issued. The report itself was the first technical
report since 1976. However, important issues like development of
installations under each contract, nonsignature of one contract, and final
costs of contract works, were not dealt with. The report also contained
several errors. Proposals for the utilization of the balance of loan funds
of about US$5.8 million for consultants was discussed during the 1980
mission. No further action was taken and the project was closed in June
1980. All in all, considering the paucity of project progress reports, the
overall Bank supervision effort should have been more intensive and
frequent.   The supervision effort on the whole could be considered as
inadequate.
Working Relationship
8.03       The working relationship between the Bank and the Borrower during
the project execution period was good, although following 1974 when numerous
other sources of funds became available to CANTV, the borrower became less
interested in the Bank.   Even though the Bank and the Borrower had serious
disagreements on the issues of financing the procurement of telephones and
cables, (see paragraph 3.04) the Borrower, at least in the initial years,
considered that Bank involvement was welcome. While the Bank's supervision
missions prior to 1980 do not mention difficulties in obtaining any project
related information, the 1980 mission did so. CANTV's response to informa-
tion requested in the Bank's letter of April 1981 and telexes of May, June,
and July 1981 for data for preparing completion report was less than
adequate. However, CANTV staff mentioned during the completion report
mission visit that they would always give all information requested by Bank
missions unless of course that information was not readily available.

Compliance of Covenants
8.04       A statement setting out the position on the compliance of covenants
is given in Annex 9. Brief explanatory details on each item are also set out
therein.
9.  CONCLUSIONS
9.01       Changes in personnel and organization of a rapidly expanding entity
are inevitable.   During the period of the project, several changes in top
management occurred.   Though CANTV agreed (through a side letter) to exchange
views with the Bank on impending or proposed changes in management
(paragraph 2.06), this was done only during the earlier project construction
period prior to 1974.   However, since the project was finally satisfactorily
completed, the lack of interchange of views when staff changes occured did
not significantly affect the project's execution, and given that this is the
case, perhaps the original consultation agreement was unnecessary.
9.02       Bank project staff should carefully monitor project progress
reports both for their timely receipt and for their contents. If borrowers
are slack in submission of the reports, the Bank should send regular
reminders and if these still do not produce results, bring the omission to
the Guarantor's notice.   In this project, the borrower sent only a few
reports, and the Bank some reminders at irregular intervals. There was
inadequate follow-up on the non-receipt of these reports. The lack of
adequate supervision missions compounded by lack of project progress reports
resulted in the Bank having inadequate knowledge of project status in the
final years.
9.03       In 1980 CANTV became less interested in using the remaining US$5.8
million of Bank loan funds due to the findings of a study based on the
1978-79 experience, when CANTV found itself with several sources of
investment capital, which due to exchange losses on the Bank loan accumulated
up to that time, was less costly than Bank funds. The Bank should have
pushed CANTV to review the loan allocation and to recommend use of the
surplus funds by either preparing proposals for procurement of other goods
and for their utilization, or to insist that the loan should be closed. For
lack of positive timely action on the part of the Bank, this amount remained
unutilized for about three years.
9.04       The Bank Loan was US$35 million in a total program costing US$318
million. If the Bank wants to exert sufficient leverage in improving the
borrowers institutional performance, the Bank's contribution should be a
larger part of the program costs.

Comment - Considerable delay occurred between calling for bids and bid evalua-
tion. In addition, CANTV used another five months after Bank approved bid
award to sign contracts. In one case, CANTV did not obtain CANTV's bid award
recommendations before contracting and the Bank had to give ex-post facto
clearance to CANTV's bid award recommendations. Further, even though CANTV
obtained Bank comments on one bid (radio microwave medium capacity), CANTV
took no further action on procurement, in spite of the availability of Bank
loan funds.

L/ From 1970 through 1974.
The achievement through 1974 has been based on information provided in supervision report of May 28, 1975.
Later supervision missions have produced data differing from the 1975 mission data, but the 1975 mission
data has been utilized in the report as it contains the first set of information as of end 1974--the ap-
praisal anticipated project completion date.

The appraisal estimates provided for a total 1970-74--investment program of US$317.9 million, and of
US$270.9 million between 1971-74. The actual total costs between 1970-74 (using 1970 actuals as in revised SAR)
amounted to US$291.9--an over investment of about 81. Since the itemwise investment breakdown is unavailable, it
is not possible to compare appraisal estimates and actual costs, or to conclude that the higher total investments,
unit costs were higher than estimated at appraisal time.

LOAN 770-VE
Return on Investment
CANTV's Investment Program
1.        The close relationship between equipment installed under the project
and other equipment installed under CANTV's investment program makes any
attempt to separate incremental costs and revenues for the project very
arbitrary. The rate of return calculated in this annex, therefore, refers
to CANTV's total investment program.
2.        The appraisal rate of return was based on CANTV's 1970-74 invest-
ment program. However, delays in execution and changes to the program caused
most of the projected works to be executed in 1973-78. This was the period
during which the Bank funds were disbursed and projected new subscribers
were connected. The rate of return calculations are, therefore, based on
CANTV's total 1973-78 investment program.
Deflator
3.        Inflation in Venezuela according to CPI (International Financial
Statistics, IMF) equalled about 8% annually in 1973-78, 12% in 1979, 22% in
1980 and an estimated 10% in 1981. For calculation of the financial rate
of return, incremental cost and revenue streams have been deflated accordingly
to reflect 1973 constant prices. As from 1981 onwards, incremental costs and
benefits are assumed to remain constant in real terms.
Benefit Period
4.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1973 to 1995, when,
on average, the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
Incremental Operating Costs and Revenues
5.        Incremental revenues are based on increased traffic generated by
subscribers and through equipment connected under the program. Tariffs
remained unchanged up to 1981, when they were increased 30%. Operating costs
are based on additional assets and traffic generated under the program,
excluding interest, depreciation and taxes.
Residual Value
6.        No residual values of fixed assets at the end of their useful
lives have been taken into account as the discounted value of these would
be insignificant in 1973 prices.

ANNEX 8

7.        A summary of costs and revenue streams on 1973 prices is given
below in Bs millions:
Capital              Operating            Net
Year       Deflator      Expenditures     Costs      Revenues     Benefits
1973         1.00            315            64           -          (379)
1974         0.93            238           119          115         (242)
1975         0.86            300           251          249         (302)
1976         0.79            486           245          406         (325)
1977         0.74            713           237          550         (400)
1978         0.68            602           515          679         (438)
1979         0.61             -            528          712          184
1980         0.50                          515          702          187
1981-95       0.45                          503          831          328
The net benefit stream above results in a financial rate of return of 9%.
Consumer Surplus
8.        No increase in consumer surplus has been taken into account for
above rate of return calculations. Due to inflation and constant tariffs
in nominal terms during 1967-80, however, tariffs in real terms have
decreased substantially. Furthermore, the quality of and access to ser-
vice has improved during the project period. Considering the large
unsatisfied demand for telecommunications services, it is, therefore,
reasonable to assume that a consumer surplus exists.
9.        Assuming CANTV's subscribers are willing to pay the same tariffs
in real terms as they were paying in 1973, the economic rate of return of
the 1973-78 investment program can be estimated to 27%.

Mr. Shiv S. Kapur

Dear Mr. Kapurus
Report on Second Teleconmunications Project (Loan 770-VE)
In response to your letter of August 27, 1982, I have pleasure in
informing you that the draft report submitted to me for my consideration is
satisfactory.
In my opinion, and to judge by the World Bank's experience with this
loan, it would be preferable not to finance projects for the purchase of
equipment unless one can really be sure that the loan funds will be used.
In conclusion, I understand that Compafii'a An6nima Nacional Telefonos
de Venezuela (CANTV) has prepared a document correcting and updating the
information you have on that enterprise. I have also been informed that
CANTV does not have any comments either on the draft report on Loan 770-VE.
Yours truly,
/s/ Maritza Izaguirre P.

REPORT TO WORLD BANK
I.       Capital Stock
The provision of telephone service in Venezuela is an exclusive
monopoly of Companiia An6nima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV), which is
owned in its entirety by the Venezuelan Government.
The initial composition of the capital stock was as follows:
Number of        Nominal value
Shareholder              shares             per share          Value          %

1,117,500    1,OOO.OO   1,117,500,000.00    100.0
In 1977 and 1978, CANTV borrowed Bs 500 million from the Venezuelan
State pursuant to Article 6 of the Special Law on Public Credit of
August 26, 1976. This debt was capitalized by the Permanent Committee on
Finance of the Chamber of Deputies at its meeting of April 29, 1982, the
capital stock thereby being constituted as follows:
Number of       Nominal value
Shareholder             shares          per share          Value          %

- 35 -
This action increased the proportion of equity capital in the
company's financial structure, and at the same time increased the company's
borrowing capacity for obtaining resources under the Basic Law on Public
Credit.
II.      Personnel
The agreement with the World Bank stipulated that by
December 31, 1974 there would have to be a ratio of 15 employees per 1,000
telephones. On December 31, 1980 the employee-telephone ratio was 15.7 per
thousand.
As of August 31, 1982 the company had 18,535 employees and there were
910,945 telephones. Assuming that there are 1.42 telephones per main
connection, the number of employees per 1,000 telephones was 14.33, less than
the number required in the contract:
(910,945 x 1.42 = 1,293,541; 18,535,000 +- 1,293,541 = 14.33).
With regard to recruitment and training, CANTV has continued its
policy of personnel selection and annual training programs to ensure maximum
training. It also has acted to reduce employee turnover with a view to
improved efficiency.
NOTE:
If the ratio of subscribers and employees is considered, we obtain
very different figures:

- 36 -
III.     Tariffs
Inasmuch as CANTV had had its last tariff increase in 1967 and those
rates were still in effect in 1981, the company considered a tariff increase
to meet higher operating costs due to the rise in the price of telephone
equipment as well as the increase in personnel costs resulting from the
collective contracts signed in recent years.
Accordingly, a tariff increase was ordered by resolution of the
Ministry of Communications, to which CANTV is attached. This was published in
the Gaceta Oficial of the Republic No. 32209 dated April 14, 1981.
The main features of the new tariff are:
(a) The subscription fee was increased from Bs 500 to Bs 1,000.
(b) The basic monthly charge was set at Bs 24 to Bs 30 for a minimum of
180 calls per month.
(c) The incremental charge was established at Bs 0.20 per 90 seconds
after one and one half minutes of conversation. This has resulted in an
improvement in service by reducing the congestion caused by excessively
lengthy calls.
IV.      Financial Statement
The new tariff system has produced an increase in income, which will
enable CANTV to carry out its new investment plans effectively.
The following table shows the movement of income in recent years and
the projection through 1983.

The foregoing table, which presents the actual figures through
September 1982, shows that income increased modestly up till 1980, and that
beginning in 1981 -- the year of the tariff increase -- the rise in income
began to be significant.

The rate of increase in operating income was 45% in 1981 as a result
of the new tariff for telephone service. The increase in 1982 will be 25%,
owing to the increase in subscribers and the new telex tariff.
Net current expenditure rose by 29% in 1981 and will show a slight
decrease of 2% in 1982, due in part to the implementation of Decree 1460 of
April 7, 1982, Gaceta Oficial No. 2934 (Special) concerning the policy on
rationalization and reduction of National Government expenditure, and to other
internal measures adopted by the company's management.
Financial costs have remained stable because of the behavior of
interest rates in international markets.
Since 1965 the company has been following a policy on capitalization
of expenditure based on the ratio between the costs of operation of fixed
assets and annual investment. The ratio will not be greater than 12% of the
amount of investment.
For 1983, with the entry into service of call monitoring equipment,
operating income is projected to reach Bs 5,293 million.
V.       Rate of Return
The World Bank required a rate of return of 11% per annum on net
assets beginning in 1973. According to the financial statements, the results
for the period 1980-82 are as follows:
YEAR     OPERATING PROFIT     AVERAGE FIXED ASSETS    RETURN ON OPERATING ASSETS

and 6.14) has been

VI.      Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable were as follows for 1979-82:

TOTAL
984    1,325      2 O59       2J923       43.7
The reasons for the increase in accounts receivable are:
-    Inefficient collection management
-    Failure to issue credits
-    Deficiencies in the service regulations, with an excessive number of
telephones taken out of service
-    Failure to comply with the Law on Reconciliation, Compensation and
Payment of Debts among government agencies
-    A large number of government agencies -- especially municipalities --
refuse to recognize their debts
-    Breakdown of control in the use of DDN.
Of the total accounts receivable, 47.7% are one year or more overdue:
1979      1980      1981       1982
Overdue more than one year               424         552     1JO33       1,396

Of the Bs 1,396 million in accounts receivable over one year overdue,
64% are owed by the government sector, with the following breakdown:

895          100.0
These delays in collection have meant that the turnover of accounts
receivable is very slow.

Turnover -- accounts receivable             1.84      1.77       1.75      1.49

In order to recover these delinquent amounts, a policy has been
devised to:
-    Step up the collection of accounts receivable.
-   Update the register of pending accounts.
-    Consolidate and codify the debts of government agencies.
1.   Government
For 1981, a special management program was introduced to recover
accounts receivable from government agencies, based on three types of actions:
(a) Settlement of accounts with over 150 public agencies of the
National, Regional and Municipal Administrations. Steps will be taken with
DIMCA to have funds appropriated to pay these obligations, under the Law on
the Credit Program contemplated by the National Executive for this purpose.
With this program it is expected that 70% of the accrued debt through 1979
will be recovered.

(b) With regard to the short-term debt for 1980, special
arrangements are being made with government agencies to recover at least 50%
of the outstanding balance in 1983.
(c) In addition, service contracts signed with agencies of the
centralized and decentralized administrations are being negotiated in order to
increase the amount of the fixed monthly payment for 1983.
(d) Codification of the government debt is being completed with a
view to specific treatment in the future.
2.   Private subscribers
(a) A request is being made that Bs 67 million of the reserve be
applied, which will cover what is believed to be actually uncollectable.
(b) A debt recovery program in all states is in effect and being
implemented, with the aim of collecting most of the debts of private
subscribers and the Government.
(c) Auditing and adjusting of accounts receivable through the
regional collection centers.
