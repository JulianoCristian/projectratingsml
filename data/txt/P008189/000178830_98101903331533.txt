APPRAISAL OF THE 1970-1974 TELECO1EvMNICATIONS PROGRAM
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i,        This report appraises a Project which consists of the Five-Year
Telecommunications Ecpansion Program of Compania Anonlma Nacional Telefonos de
Venezuela (CANTV)-for the period 1970-1974. The Program requires a total
investment of Bs 1.35 billion (US$300 million). A Bank Loan of US$35 million
is proposed and would cover 26.3% of the direct foreign currency costs.
ii.       The existing telecommunications facilities are inadequate as
indicated by the large number of pending applications for new subscriber
connections, and the substantial unsatisfied demand for long distance calls.
The 1970-1974 Program will alleviate the congestion and delays in national
and international long distance traffic, and will meet part of the demand
for telephone connections.  It will provide for the addition of 347,000
lines of capacity to the local telephone exchanges, and for the expansion of
the long distance network. It includes installation of an earth satellite
station to meet the requirements of international traffic. -The internal
financial rate of return of the Program is estimated at 21A.
iii.      All equipment and materials would be procured under international
competitive bidding, except for some switching equipment to be purchased
from suppliers of existing equipment in Venezuela, and a portion of the cable
requirements to be procured fron domestic manufacturers; these two exceptions
would not be financed by the Bank Loan. Domestic manufacturers would be
allowed to participate in the bidding for the portion of cables to be
procured internationally, with a 15  margin of preference or customs duties,
whichever is lower.
iv.       The proposed Loan would be a follow-up to the first Bank lending
operation in Venezuela's telecommunications sector. Loan No.435-VE
(US$37 million) helped set up the basic long distance microwave network,
improve international connections and extend local service. Project
execution has been satisfactory, but, due to delays caused by sone late
equipment deliveries and by building redesigns following the 1967 earth-
quake, the March 31, 1969, closing date of the Loan was postponed twice:
first, to June 30, 1970 and then to October 31, 1970. The Project has been
completed by the closing date.
v.        CANTV, the proposed borrower, has been strengthened as an institu-
tion during the execution of the first Project. To prepare for the large
expansion, the Company has undertaken to hire management consultants to adapt
its organizational structure to present and future needs.



- ii -
vi.          CANTV's financial position is generally satisfactory.  It
has managed to convert a deficit financial situation to one of accept-
able profitability in the past few years, and during 1970-1974 expects
to provide about one-third of its requirements of funds through
internal cash generation; the return on net fixed assets would
increase from 8.6% in 1970 to 144.1% in 1974. CANTV's liquidity is not
fully satisfactory on account of significant receivables, outstanding
mainly from Government agencies. CANTV has agreed to undertake
satisfactory arrangements for the collection of present and future
receivables.
vii.         The Project forms a suitable basis for a Loan of
US$35 million for a term of 16 years, including a grace period of
5 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE 1970-1974 TELECOMNUNICATIONS PROGRAM4
1.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Venezuela has requested Bank assistance in
financing the Five-Year Telecommunications Expansion Program covering the
period 1970-1974. The Program is aimed at meeting part of the demand for
telecommunications services during this period and provides for doubling
of the number of telephone connections and expanding the long distance
facilities to handle the expected increases in traffic. The cost of this
Program is estimated at Bs 1.35 billion (US$300 million). It would be
carried out by Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV)
the wholly Government owned utility that provides the country's public
telephone and telex services.
1.02      The Government enquired into the possibility of Bank financing
for the proposed Project in September 1969. A formal request for a Loan
of about US$40 million was received along with the expansion plan at the
end of February 1970. Between March 21 and April 20, an appraisal mission
comprised of Messrs. F. Gheith, M.F. Kohler and H.B. Nleier visited Venezuela
to evaluate the Project and identify items suitable for Bank financing.
1.03      This would be the second telecommunications Project financed by
the Bank in Venezuela.  The first, financed by Loan No. 435-VE of December
13, 1965, helped to establish a basic high-quality long distance network
between the main cities, improve international connections, and expand
local service. Project execution has been satisfactory, although there have
been some delays due to late equipment deliveries and the need to redesign
the CANTV administration building in Caracas following the 1967 earthquake.
The Loan closing date was therefore postponed from M4arch 31, 1969, to June 30,
1970; another postponement of four months to October 31, 1970, was agreed to
later.

2. THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
A. Economy
2.01      Venezuela's economy is characterized by its dependency on oil,
which accounts for 93% of exports, 67% of fiscal revenues and 19% of GDP.
The labor force employed in agriculture decreased from 44% of the total
labor force in 1950 to 29% in 1969. The highly capital-intensive oil
sector employs less than 1.5% of the labor force; manuFacturing has
absorbed 16%, the service sector 48% (including GoveriiLment, commerce,
transport, etc.) and construction 6%. Most economic activity is con-
centrated in an around Caracas and in the region between Caracas and
Maracaibo.
2.02      There has been extensive migration from rural to urban areas,
reducing the percentage of Venezuela's population living in rural areas
from 46% in 1950 to about 25% in 1969 and requiring la7ge expenditures on
public services for the immigrants to the cities. To improve employment
opportunities for these people and to strengthen the economy's long term
growth potential, Venezuela has made the diversification of its petroleum-
based economy a fundamental principle of economic policy, in which the
improvement of telecommunications facilities plays an important role.
B. The Telecommunications Sector
2.03      Telecommunications are under the control of the Ministry of
Communications, which is the regulatory agency. CANTV provides all public
telephone services. Telegraph service for the public is provided by two
entities. A Department of the Ministry of Communications provides national
and international telegraph service; LineaAeropostal Venezolana (LAV),
a Government-owned domestic airline, provides under a provisional arrangement
international telegraph service which was previously being furnished by a
private company, All America Cables and Radio, Inc. When the license granted
to All America Cables expired in December 1969, its staff refused to become
employees of either the Ministry or CANTV and were temporarily attached to
LAV, where they are continuing to provide the same service. Proposals on
the future organization of the telegraph service are presently under
discussion.
2.04      The existing telecommunications facilities in Venezuela (see
paragraphs 3.18 to 3.25) are inadequate quantitatively and qualitatively
in meeting the demand for telecommunications. Venezuela's density of
telephones--3.76 phones per 100 inhabitants--is low in comparison with
other countries with similar GNP per capita (see paragraph 5.05).
2.05      Partly because of this situation, a number of enterprises and
Government agencies own and operate their own radic circuits.  The improve-
ment of national communications as a result of the proposed 1970-1974
Expansion Program is expected to result in the closing down of many of these
high-cost private telephone facilities.



3. THE BORROWER
A. Organization and Management
3.01       CANTV, the proposed borrower is fully Government-owned and
provides telephone and telex services under the Telecommunications Law of
July 1, 1965, as amended, and statutes dated July 19, 1968; it is subject
to the Corporation Law but is tax exempt. The members of the Board of
Directors, including the President and the General Manager, are appointed
for staggered terms by the Minister of Communications in his capacity as
shareholder. The entity has good management: the President and General
Manager are qualified executives, and the other management positions are
likewise held by competent personnel. Even so, because of the size of
expansion to be undertaken in the 1970-1974 period, it has been agreed
that the Bank will be consulted before there are new appointments to the
positions of President and General Manager.
3.02       The enterprise has a good record of achievement in the past
few years. During the period of the first Bank Loan, some organizational
improvements were undertaken. Further organizational restructuring
and procedural changes are now planned to enable CANTV to handle the large
expansion of the system. Emphasis would be placed on regional decentraliza-
tion and on improvements in the collection system, project planning and
execution, and compilation of data on personnel, stores, costs and traffic.
3.03       CANTV signed a contract on February 6, 1970, with the domestic
consulting firm of Asesores Empresariales (AESA) to analyze organizational
problems of the Metropolitan Zone, which accounts for over half of the
Comparn's assets. WJhile designing an organizational structure for the
zone, AESA has also made proposals concerning the collection system, personnel
administration and stores.
3.04       For its overall reorganization, CANTV is hiring an international
management consulting firm. A contract with one of the two firms, Peat,
Marwick, Mitchell & Co. or Booz, Allen & Hamilton, will be concluded in
November 1970, based on the agreed terms of reference. The consultants will
submit periodic progress reports to the Bank.
3.05       Also, a two-year technical assistance program has been prepared
in Caracas by a representative of the Australian Post Office (APO) to
provide consulting services, mainly in the field of local network planning,
and to offer Venezuelan engineers fellowships for training periods of at
least three months in Australia. An agreement on this assistance is expected
to be concluded by December 1970.



-h -
B.   Staff and Training
3.06      Under the fir.st Loan, CANTTV agreed to reduce its staff from 19.1
persons per 1,000 telephones to 17.2 by 1969. The present level is 18.3
persons per 1,000 telephones.  The reason for this shortfall in performance
was due to difficulties in absorbing and putting to effective use all the
persons transferred during 1967-1968 from the IMinistry of Commmnications to
CANTV along with the transfer of services previously rendered by the Itinistry.
CANTV has been able up to now to retrain and absorb about half of the
persons transferred.  Ihis process has proven to be more complex and
slower than anticipated. The difficulties have arisen due to the fact that
most of the manual exchanges transferred have since been converted to
automatic working to improve the quality of service.  CANTV has still now
about 600 persons on its payroll who are redundant. The efficient utiliza-
tion of staff is important in view of the high average emoluments per employee
in CANTV which are now about Bs24,000 (Us-$5,300) as compared with an average
of Bsl2,400 (US$2,750) for the manufacturing industry excluding the petroleum
sector. The large expansion during 1970-1974 will permit CANTV to lower the
level of staffing considerably. Hanagement agreedl to accomplish this by
retraining personnel and introducing a careful control on hiring new staff
(see paragraph 6.11 and Annex 7),
3.07      Training facilities for telecommunications staff have been expanded
considerably in the past fewi years. The Training Center for Telecommunica-
tions Technicians, which began operations in 1964 tdth UNDP financing and
ITU as executing agency, is working satisfactorily and graduating about 40
technicians per year. Besides the full courses for technicians, the curricu-
lum includes short courses for in-service technical training.
3.08      For the Project period 1970-1974, a major expansion of the
Training Center is planned with similar UIDP arrangements.  This includes
an increase in the number of subjects offered, particularly for apprentices
and in-service staff.  The Center will be transferred from the ilinistry of
Communications to CANTV.  This move will allow the Company to shape the
training to its needs more effectively. The expected output of the Training
Center from 1970 to 1974 is shown in the following table:
Number of Trainees
1970    1971    1972    1973    1974   1970-1974
High level technicians         40      45       45      45      45       220
Medium level technicians       -       20       20      20       20       80
Apprentices                    -      290      310     340     390    1,330
In-service training           200     640     800      960     960    3,560
Total                240      995   1,175   1,365   1,415    5,190

C.  Accounting and Audit
3.09      While its accounting system is in line with generally accepted
commercial practices, CANTV is planning to improve it so as to make it a
more effective tool for management control. The management consultants
(see paragraph 3.04) will therefore assist CANTV in introducing depart-
mentalized cost accounting and to computerize most of the data compila-
tion. This will makce available more promptly to management the essential
data needed for decision-making.
3.10      In addition to the Companyts own internal audit and the external
audit by Price, Waterhouse & Co., CANTV's accounts are being reviewfed by the
legally required Comisario on behalf of the-stockholders and by Venezuelats
Auditor General on behalf of the Government. There is considerable overlap
in the work performed by these auditors and a systematic exchange of infor-
mation between them, along with better coordination of their duties, would
eliminate duplication of effort, curtail auditing costs and reduce interfe-
rence with CANTVIs administrative process. Proposals for coordinating
their functions wiUl be prepared by the management consultants (paragraph
3.04). For the duration of the proposed Loan, CANTV has agreed to retain
an independent auditor satisfactory to the Bank.
D.   Past Financial Performance
3.11      Audited income statements for the fiscal years 1967 through 1969
are shown in Annex 2. CANTV s operating results have improved considerably
in the past five years, as indicated by the rate of return:
1965      1966     1967      1968     1969
Rate of return on average net
fixed assets in service (L-')  2.8       4.3       6.1      8.2      8.6
The increases are due mainly to rapidly increasing revenues following
construction of the high quality long distance network and introduction
of subscriber trunk dialing (SID) and the increase in the number of
subscribers under the first Bank Loan. INhile revenues increased by 138%
during the past five years, operating expenses increased by 112%. The
operating ratio, although decreasing steadily, is still high:
1965      1966     1967      1968     1969
Operating ratio (%)               93        90        87       83       82



3.12      The debt service coverage 'oy internal cash generation dropped
from 3.1 times in 1967 to 2.3 times in 1969.  The debt/eqllity ratio has
changed from 17:83 at year end 1967 to 29:71 in 1969. The proportion of
long-term debt at year end 1969 is still low for two reasons: CANTVts
rate of expansion in the past was modest and the financing of this expansion
was carried out with a relatively small amount of debt and a rather large
amount of interest and dividend free contributions from Government and
assets transferred from the v inistry of Communications, totalling Bs103.9
million (US$23.1 million).
3.13      Audited balance sheets for the fiscal years 1967 through 1969 are
sho=n in Annex 3. A suimmary of the December 31, 1969 financial position is

Other non-current liabilities                              57.4

3.14      CANTV's financial position at December 31, 1969 is generally
satisfactory except for its liquidity. The cash liquidity indicating
the Companyts immediate ability to meet the current operating cash
outflows is insufficient, essentially because of an unsatisfactory col-
lection performance which shows an average outstanding period for current
accounts of about 80 days as against an average of 50 days which would be
normal on the basis of the allowed payment terms. The liquidity could



- 7 -
also be substantially improved by the collection of past due accounts from
various federal, state and municipal governments. Accumulated gradually
over the past few years, these receivables amounted to Bs 34.1 million
(US$7.6 million) as of December 31, 1969 (net after Bs 4.2 million,
US$0.9 million, bad debts allowance of 11% of the gross amount of past due
accounts). Specific arrangements for the collection of these past due
accounts following a defined timetable have been agreed to during negotiation
(paragraph 6.08).
E. Tariffs
3.15       Annex 5 summarizes CANTV's tariffs presently in effect.  Insta-
lation charges and non-refundable subscription rights which make up the
initial cost for new telephone subscribers are rather high averaging
Bs 500-700 (US$111-156). Such rights are levied only in a relatively few
countries, but provide CANTV the necessary resources to expand telephone
service; they can be paid in installments over a period of 10 months.
Monthly rental and local call charges are in line with those in other similar
countries. Long distance tariffs are on the high side, particularly for
intermediate and long distances.
3.16       Tariffs for domestic telex service were fixed in 1969 -- before
the full national telex service was introduced -- at about 50% of correspond-
ing domestic long distance telephone tariffs, which is in line with CCITT
recommendations and justified, in view of the much lower capital investment
per telex circuit.
3.17       Tariff changes must be approved by the Minister of Communications,
who reviews proposed changes with the Council of Ministers before approving
them. The latest tariff change became effective in June 1967, when domestic
subscriber trunk dialing was introduced. The tariffs are generally adequate
to provide CANTV with the necessary revenues to produce an acceptable rate of
return. Internal cash generation amounted to 46% of the funds applied for
expansion during the 1967-1969 period. CANTV does not contemplate tariff
changes for 1970-1974, nor have any been assumed in the financial projections.
On this basis, self-financing in the 1970-1974 period would amount to about
38%, which is reasonable, considering the increased pace of expansion. However
a subscribers' guarantee deposit will be introduced before the date of effec-
tiveness of the proposed loan (paragraph 6.05).
F. Existing Telecommunications Facilities
3.18       Telecommunication services in Venezuela are lagging behind demand.
A large number of applicants are waiting for new telephone connections (see
paragraph 5.04) and due to congestion a large portion of long distance calls
is either not completed or subject to delays.
a.   Local Service
3.19       At the end of 1969, CANTV had 76 automatic exchanges with a total
capacity of 331,820 lines, and 107 manual exchanges with a total capacity of



- 8 -
10,615 lines. The total number of connected direct exchange lines (DEL)
was 248,1661 there were 371,710 telephones, of which 65% were in Caracas
(see Annex 8).
3.20      Automatic exchanges in Venezuela comprise seven different types
of switching systems, putting extra demands on staff training.  In Caracas,
where there are five swaitching systems, difficulties are experienced in
inter-working between the different systems and from congestion due to the
lack of sufficient quantities of interconnecting junction circuits between
exchanges. The number and duration of faults in the distribution network of
Caracas are also above the average, due to lack of trained maintenance staff
which is lagging behind the rapid growth of the Caracas network and poor
installation of cables. The present Project is aimed at correcting these
technical difficulties of the system.
b.   Long Distance Service
3.21      Venezuela has basically two long distance networks --one to the
'west of Caracas and one to the east. In addition, CANTV rents circuits from
the Creole Oil Company on its route (300-channel capacity) to the Haracaibo
area for handling traffic to various towns in that area. CANTV has reached
an agreement with Creole to acquire this route in 1974a, after which Creole
will rent its requirements from CANTV.
3.22      The western network consists primarily of a microwave system of 960
channels constructed under the first Loan. The eastern region is served by a
basic UHF system of 72 channels. This is being replaced by a new microwave
system of 960 channels which is expected to be commissioned by the end of
1970. These networks interconnect 29 switching centers and provide for subs-
criber dialing of long distance traffic between these centers. Smaller towns
are connected by small coaxial cables, VHF circuits and open wire routes with
and without carrier systems. Details of these systems are given in Annexes
9 and 13.
3.23      With the introduction of STD service at the end of 1967, traffic on
the western network increased by 35M/, as compared with the 175% forecast at
the time of the previous appraisal in 1965. CANTV augmented the amount of
equipnent and other facilities, but even so only 30% of the traffic originat-
ing during the peak hour can be completed; 35jo of the peak hour traffic is
not completed because of the shortage of long distance channels, and the
balance for other reasons (mostly insufficient junctions between the local and
long distance exchanges).
c.   Telex Service
3.24      Local telex service, which started in Venezuela in 1962 on a small
scale, experienced a sizeable extension in 1966 and a full national telex
service network was established toward the end of 1969. By the end of that



- 9 -
year, CANTV had 13 telex exchanges with a total capacity of 1,640 lines, of
which 620 were in Caracas with 455 connected subscribers; installation of
the remaining capacity of 1,020 lines in the other cities was not completed
until October 1969 and 228 were connected at the year's end. International
telex service became available in 1967.
d. International Service
3.25      By the end of 1969, Venezuela's international telephone connections
totalled 84 circuits: 46 submarine cable circuits to the United States (in-
cluding circuits to Mexico and Europe via the USA), 6 circuits to Caribbean
countries, 22 circuits to Colombia and Curagao via UHF radio systems, and
10 HF radio circuits to other Latin American countries and to Italy and Spain.
The transmission via submarine cable is of high quality, but the capacity
of the cable is inadequate as shown by the fact that in 1969 only 50-70% of
telephone calls during the peak hour were completed. The submarine cable,
UHF and HF lines also provide telex circuits for international working.

4. THE PROJECT
a. Description
4.01       The Project is CANTV's Five-Year Telecommunications
Program, covering the period 1970-197h, and consists of the following
main physical items:
a. Installation of about 347,000 lines of local
exchange equipment and cable network and
associated facilities to provide an increase of
about 269,000 connected direct exchange lines
(DEL's).
b. Installation of new microwave links and
provision of multiplexing equipment for 6,000
channels on existing and new links.
c. Installation of a satellite ground terminal
station and associated facilities.
d. Installation of about 1,300 telex sets.
A brief description of these items is given below and details are
given in Annex 9. In addition the Project includes the retention of
management consultants (paragraph 3.04).
b. Local Service
4.02       During the Project period, CANTV would increase the
capacity of exchanges, existing and new ones, by about 347,000 lines
(100% increase). Part of the expansion would be achieved by
installation of 191 transportable exchanges with unit capacities of
20 to 200 lines (total capacity 9,940 lines) for smaller localities.
CANTV would also lay additional cables and the associated facilities
required to provide for 269,000 new direct connected exchange lines
(DEL's) during the Project period. The size of the local service
expansion in this Program,arrived at after discussions with the bank
is the most realistic that can be executed *ith the physical and
financial resources available to CANTV, at this stage. This will cover
only 65% of the demand for new subscriber connections as estimated by
CANTV.
c. Long Distance Service
4.03       For long distance service, new microwave, coaxial cable,
VHF links and multiplexing equipment for 6,000 channels would be provided,
interconnecting the main switching centers and local exchanges to cope
with presently unsatisfied demand and to meet an expected growth of traffic
of 15% annually over the next few years. The capacities of the switching
centers would be increased correspondingly.



- 11 -
D.   International Service
4.04      A satellite ground terminal station is being installed to provide
initially 30 new circuits; 5 to the US, 2 to Canada, 4 to Italy, 4 to Germany,
2 to Spain and 13 to Latin American coumtries. These capacities can be
increased as rapidly as needed, by leasing more channels from INTELSATts space
station since the initial equipment in the terminal station can meet expan-
sion needs up to 300 circuits. This system will also provide telex circuits.
The satellite ground terminal station has been put into service in November
1970.
e.   Telex Service
4.05      Total telex exchange capacities would be increased from 1,640 lines
in 1969 to 2,740 in 1974; connected teleprinter machines are expected to
increase from 683 to about 2,000.
f.   Cost of the Program
4.o6      The costs of the five-year telecommunications Program, totalling
about Bs 1.35 billion (US$300.3 million), are detailed in Annex 9, Table 1,
and summarized below:

has been added a contingency provision of about 7.5P.  The costs of telephone
switching equipment constituting 28% of item 1, and of the earth satellite

station constituting most of item 3, are based on actual contracts. The
cable costs, which form 24% of item 1 above, are based on recent purchases;
copper prices and the cost of cables have since come down and are expected
to remain below the estimated costs. The long distance equipment prices in
item 2 are also showing a decreasing trend.  The estimates thus include a
built-in margin for possible price increases; the contingency provisions are
intended for unforeseen design and engineering modifications. The total
cost provisions are reasonable and adequate.

h.   Project Execution
4.09      Execution schedules for the main items of the Project are shown
in Annex 12. The engineering of the long distance system has been carried
out by CANTV satisfactorily. For the local networks CANTV is obtaining the
services of an Australian team (paragraph 3.05).
4.1o      For all long distance equipment and for local and trunk automatic
exchanges--except transportable and mobile exchanges-- CANTV will provide the
installation work force, supervised by suppliers' engineers who will be
responsible for the overall installation and performance. The mobile and
transportable exchanges will be installed by CANTV. The commissioning of
cables for local distribution comprises civil engineering works such as
laying conduits and building manholes together with the laying and joint-
ing of cables.  The civil works will be handled by local contractors while
the laying and jointing of cables will be handled partly by CANTV with its
own personnel and partly through contractors. The execution time tables
are reasonable.
4.11      Formerly contractors were responsible for the supply of conduits,
manhole accessories and other items, and were paid only on completion of
the contract. Some of the contracts were large in size. Further, in many
cases cable deliveries by CANTV for these works were often delayed, placing
a large financial burden on the contractors which in turn limited their
capacity to undertake more work. CANTV has taken a number of steps--prompt
and frequent progress payments properly defined contracts, and expeditious
supply of cables and accessories to contractors--to overcome these difficul-
ties. The volume of this Program would assure the contractors of the conti-
nuity of this type of work, and encourage them to employ more experienced
personnel for better performance.
i.   Procurement
4.12      Except for some cables and switching equipment, as explained below,
all materials and equipment for the Project will be procured through interna-
tional competitive bidding. The part of the cable requirements reserved for
domestic manufacturers and the part of switching equipment to be procured
from existing suppliers for standardization reasons would be financed from
supplier credits or CANTV's own resources.
4.13      Cables.  In the past all the cables for CANTV were purchased from
domestic manufacturers in accordance with a law that requires Government
agencies to purchase locally manufactured goods if their prices are less
than 25% above those of imported goods.
4.14      To obtain benefits of lower prices, CANTV has secured Government
approval to procure two-thirds (Bs16o million) of its total cable require-
ments under international competitive bidding. Local manufacturers will be
permitted to participate in this bidding with a margin of preference of 15%
on CIP prices or customs duties, whichever is lower. At present, nominal



- 14 -
protection is about 12A, on the CIF prices. Bs66 million (US$14.7 million)
of the requirements would be financed by the Bank, the remainder from
CANTVts own funds. There is a possibility that CANTV may procure part
of its cable requirements under supplier credit arrangements if there is
a shortfall of funds from the contemplated soulrces (paragraph 6.06).
4.15      The procurement for the above Bsl6O million worth of cables
will follow normal procedures except that in case wqhere cables are to be
financed under supplier credits, these will be bid for separately under
credit terms.
4.16      The other third of the total cable requirements i.e. Bs8O mil-
lion (US$17.8 million) would be reserved to domestic manufacturers. This
portion is somewhat larger than CGAOTV1s average purchases over the past
5 years, and thus the rate of production of the domestic factories will
not be reduced. The prices obtained from international competitive bid-
ding will enable CANTV in the future to obtain prices from domestic manu-
facturers of not more than 25%, above those from foreign suppliers.
4,.17     The Government has agreed to the proposed arrangements for the
procurement of cables and the issuance of import licenses, as needed.
4.18      Switching Equipment.  As mentioned in paragraph 4.02, during the
Project periold CANTV wouldincrease the capacity of exchanges (existing
and new) by some 347,000 lines. Approximately 10,000 lines of these would
be procured through international competitive bidding and represent the
only portion financed by the proposed loan.
4.19      The balance of the requirements--about 337,000 lines-- is being
procured as set out below and is being financed by supplier credits or
with CANTV's own financing. To expand some of the existing exchanges to
their full capacity, CANTV after negotiation had placed orders for 50,000
lines with manufacturers of the type of equipment currently in these
exchanges. In addition CANTV placed an order in July 1970, for 121,500
lines on the lowest bidder following international competitive bidding and
retained an option to place an order for a further 60,000 lines. CANTV
sought with this supplier to get additional supplies required for the
Program, but the supplier expressed inability to deliver additional quan-
tities during this period, and has agreed that the option could be used
for installations in 1975 and beyond. Following this CAINTV negotiated
and placed an order with the second lowest bidder in the international
bidding for a further 162,000 lines with a discount of 11% from the
original bid prices.
4.20      The switching equipment for the long distance network would
mostly be additions to existing exchanges procured under Loan No. 435-VE
under international bidding. The equipment would be procured from the
same suppliers on the basis of previous prices and on terms obtained
under international competitive bidding, but w-ould be financed outside
the Bank Loan.



- 15 -
j.   Disbursement
4.21      The proposed Bank Loan would be disbursed against CIF costs of
imported equipment and material and the foreign currency cost of the consult-
ant services (Annex 10).
4.22      The portion of the cable purchases reserved for local procurement
is somewhat larger than CANTV's purchases over the past few years. It is
therefore doubtful if the local industry will be able to bid on the supplies
to be purchased under international bidding. If a domestic manufacturer
would be the evaluated lowest bidder after international tendering, only
the estimated foreign exchange cost of about 40/,w ould be disbursed. However,
since the total foreign exchange cost of the cables to be procured is in
excess of the proposed allocation under the Loan, it is expected that the
entire amount will be disbursed for the CIF costs of imported goods.
4.23      After consultation with the Bank, any unused balance of the Loan
should be used for purchasing additional goods, similar to those already
procured under the Loan, which are part of the 1970-1974 Program.

5.   JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The principal economic issues in telecommunications projects are
(1) whether the projects' component parts are in line with the actual priori-
ties, and (2) whether the least-cost design is chosen to meet given volume
requirements and standards of service.
5.02      The Project aims at improving the unsatisfactory local and long
distance services for existing subscribers, taking into account the growth
of traffic generation by existing and new subscribers. After meeting the
needs of achieving a higher quality service -- obviously a matter of first
priority -- the remaining available physical and financial resources are used
for new subscriber connections. It is expected that about 651 of the antici-
pated demand for subscriber connections, as estimated by CANTV (paragraph
5.o4), will be met during the Project period by the addition of 269,000
connections to the existing 248,000, giving a total of 517,000 connections in
1974. This works out to a growth rate of about 10% per year. The high initial
charges levied at the time of telephone connection (paragraph 3.15) have the
effect of allocating the connections primarily to business users.
a)   Demand for Services
5.03      The facilities required to meet the demand for these telecomunica-
tion services with a good standard of service-are set out in paragraphs 5.04-
5.08 below, which are followed by paragraphs 5.09-5.11 below showing that the
least-cost solution has been adopted.
5.04   Local Network Facilities.  During the first Program period (1966-1969),
the annua  th rate of connected DELIs progressed from 7% in 1966 to 11%
in 1969 following the availability of facilities for new connections provided
under the Program. Despite this growth, the registered waiting lists for new
connections increased from 49,000 applications by the end of 1968 to 76,000
by the end of 1969, indicating that the growth of demand is significantly
higher than the 11% actual growth of connected lines achieved in 1969. The
number of waiting applications does not cover hidden demand nor new areas of
service. CANTV estimates that actual unsatisfied demand is considerably -
higher and that total demand amounts to 824,000 by 1974 (Annex 11, page 1).
5.05      In the table below, the telephone densities of Venezuela and its
capital city are compared with a few countries and their capitals having a
similar GNP per capita.

Uruguay           52o            7.23          Montevideo      12.5



- 17 -
The densities in Venezuela and Caracas lag considerably behind those in
the other countries and capitals, which further supports CANTV's estimate
of substantial unsatisfied demand.
5.o6      Long distance facilities.  The forecast of long distance traffic
in the first Project (1956-1969) was for an increase of 175%. Hmth the
introduction of STD service starting in late 1967, the actual increase was
35°h.  CANTV augmented the amount of equipment and other facilities, but
even so they are inadequate as explained in paragraph 3.23 and Annex 8,
page 3. The planned expansions in the long distance and local network aim
at correcting these deficiencies and at meeting an estimated 15% annual
growth of traffic.
5.07      The main additions to the long distance network expand connections
from Caracas to the west -- where most of the economic activity of the
country is concentrated along with the oil production center (Maracaibo)
and regional trade centers (Merida, San Cristobal) -- and to the industrial
towns of the interior (Maracay, Valencia, Barquisimeto). Improvement of
this network will play an important role in developing regional centers
and promoting internal trade. The need for improvement is evident from
the many private radio telephone routes and connections still in existence
(paragraph 2.05).
5.o8      International service.  The construction of the satellite station
under the Project is aimed at meeting the requirements of high-quality
telephone and telex circuits to destinations in Europe and North and
South America. Some of these destinations are now served by a submarine
cable to the-USA whose capacity is inadequate to meet future traffic needs
(paragraph 3.25 and Annex 9, page 4). The traffic to existing destinations
has been growing at 20% annually after an initial spurt of 400% from 1967
to 1968 upon the commissioning of high-quality circuits on the submarine
cable. The establishment of reliable high-quality international telephone
and telex service *ill especially benefit the export sector.
b)   Least-Cost Solution
5.09      Selecting the least-cost design to meet given requirements
involves (a) making the correct technological choices when the system's
basic structure is being laid down in the early years, and (b) following
an "optimizing" path with respect to the design and timing of the deriva-
tive subsequent investments as the system expands. The earlier choice
of a microwave system for the national long distance network was clearly
more economical than the alternative of a coaxial cable system. Given
that, the main arterial routes (including buildings and masts) connecting
the important cities are already in existence, hence the expansion of
this microwave system is now the most feasible solution for expansion
of long distance facilities.

5.10      Another important decision is on the details of expansion,
relative to size and timing, of local exchange systems within the overall
Program. CANTV has handled this well after a detailed exchange-by-exchange
analysis of the spare capacity and growth of demand for each exchange.
5.11      As far as international service is concerned, the opening of
communications via satellite not only will provide direct connections to
destinations in Europe and Latin America, but will also provide CANTV with
diversification and flexibility in adding circuits and direct service to
new destinations as required. The alternative of adding a submarine cable
to meet the requirements would be more expensive as compared with providing
the services through satellite systems.
c) Internal Financial Rate of Return
5.12      The internal financial return of the Program is estimated to be
21% (see Annex 11, page 2) at current tariffs; it gives a minimum measure of
the Program's substantial benefits, considering that the expansion and
improvement of telecommunications will help promote business, transportation
and other economic activities as well as diversify the Venezuelan economy.
The rate of return was determined by equalizing the present values of expendi-
tures and the incremental operating cash flows attributable to the Program.

the 1970-1974 Program are given in Annex 4. Total fund requirements for
1970-1974 amount to Bs 1,517.2 million, as detailed below and include increases

6.02      Internal cash generation is expected to finance slightly more than
one third of total requirements; this is based on CANTV's financial projections
which do not assume any payment of dividends. The financial forecast envisages
an improved staff utilization (see paragraph 6.11). Failure to reduce the
staffing ratio, or to control average expenses per employee as expected, would
1/ Net after deduction of Bs 11.0 million (US$2.4 million) advance payments
made before December 31, 1969, in respect of the 1970-1974 Program.
2/ Bs 5 million retention payments will be disbursed in 1975.



- 20 -
require that tariffs be raised if CANTV is to meet its financial targets
(Annex 7) or that additional outside financing be secured to balance the
1970-1974 financing plan.
6.03      The proposed US$35 million Bank Loan would be for a period of
16 years including a 5-year grace period. For the financial projections
an interest rate of 72r  has been assumed.
6.04      The debenture bonds, amounting to Bs 220 million (US$48.8 million)
and to be guaranteed by the Venezuelan Government, will be placed on the
domestic market during 1971-1974 in equal annual issues.  On the basis of
CANTV's past experience with bond issues, these debentures will be designed
to yield about 9% per year with a repayment period of 10 years, including a 3-
year grace period.
6.o5      The 1970-1974 financing plan contains Bs 135.0 million (US$30.0
million) which CANTV has undertaken to raise by levying a Bs 1,000 (US$222)
guarantee deposit from existing and new commercial and industrial subscribers.
This deposit is refundable to the subscriber at termination of the service
(except if terminated because of payment default) and will bear interest at
6% per annum. The borrower has undertaken to have the start of the levy
of this deposit implemented before the date of effectiveness of the proposed
Loan.
6.06      The financing plan provides for Bs 269.2 (US$59.8 million) in
medium and long-term supplier credits, which have already been contracted.
For these credits the forecast assumes repayment over 5 years after a 2-year
grace period and an effective total cost of 10%. CANTV proposes to cover
any shortfall in funds from the contemplated sources by qbtaining supplier
credits from the tendering of cables (paragraph 4.14).
6.07      The financing plan includes long-term loans and credits from
foreign banks totalling Bs 110.5 million (US$24.5 million). CANTV has
concluded an agreement with the U.S. Export-Import Bank for a credit of Bs 18.8
million (US$4.2 million), at 6% interest and repayable semi-annually over 8
years beginning in May 1972, to finance U.S. goods and services for construc-
tion of the earth satellite station. In addition, CANTV has received from
the Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corporation, a credit of Bs 45 million
(US$10 million) that bears interest at ]l-A above the London 6-month average
Euro-dollar rate and is repayable through May 31, 1977 beginning in August
1972; annual interest of 11% for 1970 to 1971 and 1Ctk  thereafter was assumed
in the forecast. A further credit of Bs 46.7 riillion (US410.3 million) 1Pas
secured from a group of US banks led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
This credit is repayable semi-annually over 61 years beginning in June 1972;
its interest is also based on the London Euro-dollar rate and was assumed to
be 114  for 1971 and 1972 and ICKJ% thereafter.
6.08      The plan envisages that Bs 34.1 million (US$7.6 million) in past due
Government accounts will be settled. Arrangements to collect Bs 2.5 million
(US$ .6 milLion) from state governments in 19?D have already been made.Agreement



- 21 -
was reached during negotiations that CAOTV will complete as a condition
of effectiveness the necessary steps to enable collection of accounts
from Federal Rinistries, autonomous institutes and state enterprises
in due course through 1972 (estimated amount involved Bs19 million,
US$4.2 million). CANTV has also undertaken to arrange that settlement
wtill be finalized during the execution period in respect of the remainder of
Bsl2.6 million (US$2.9 million) representing outstandings from municipalities
and other governLment entities. The accounts not considered collectible are
covered by the allowance for bad debts (see paragraph 3.14). CANTV:s approach
to maintain in future the collection of government and private subscriber
accounts on a current basis is described in Annex 6.
B. Future Operating Results
6.09      Forecast income statements for the 1970-1974 period and an outline
of the assLump-tions are given in Annex 2.  CANTV's financial prospects are
satisfactory. No tariff changes would be required on this basis during the
period. Net operating income is expected to increase from Bs54.5 million
(US$12.1 million) in 1969 to Bs223.4 million (US$49.6 million) in 197h, and
the rate of return on average net plant in service from 8.6% in 1969 to 14.4%
in 1974. The operating ratio would improve from 82 in 1969 to 71 in 1974.
In order to assure that CANTV would generate the fands required to complete
the financing plan and to provide the funds for future expansion, CANTV has
agreed not to reduce the present tariffs without the Bankts approval.  A rate
of return covenant of 11% has been agreed to become effective with the year
1973 until which time the 8% of return prescribed under Loan 435-VE will be
continued.
6.10      The forecast increases in revenues are attributable largely to
the quantitative increase in the number of telephones and to the increased
use of long distance facilities resulting from the improvements expected
in the quality of service. The revenues per telephone connection (DEL)
increase from Bs1,239 (US$275) per telephone in 1969 to Bsl1,88 (US$331) in
1974 and are conservative.
6.11      The forecast of expenses envisages that average expenses per
employee w-Till increase 10W  in 1972 when the collective Labor contract  il-l
be renegotiated and 3% in 1971, 1973 and 1974 and that the ratio of staff
per 1,000 telephones wrould decrease from the present 18.3 persons per 1,000
telephones to 15 by the end of 1974. Since expenditures on personnel cons-
titute a sizeable part of total expenditures, assurances were obtained during
negotiations from CAAlTV on a progressive reduction of the annual staffing
levels, to ensure that total personnel costs will not exceed the amounts
projected. A financing gap would result, if staffing levels or average
expenses per employee exceed the forecast. This is discussed in Annex 7.
C.  Forecast Financial Position
6.12      CANTV's financial position, as shown in the forecast balance
sheets in Annex 3, is expected to remain sound. Since the entity will
finance about 51% of its 1970-1974 fund requirements by medium and long
term borrowings, the debt/equity ratio will increase from the present
29:71 to 40:60 in 1972; it will decrease to 36:64 by the end of the Program



- 22 -
period in 1974. Assuming a slower system expansion and that the increased
internal cash generation is reached in 1975 and 1976 as forecast, the debt/
equity ratio would further improve to 22:78 by 1976. These ratios are reason-
able, which is attributable to the fact that 8.9% of the 1970-1974 expansion
are financed by the subscriberst deposit (paragraph 6.05) for which no repay-
ments are forecast for the 1971-1974 period.
6.13     Based on the circumstances prevailing in 1965, the debt service
test prescribed in Loan 435-VE required a two times coverage of debt service
requirements by net revenues. While this was somewhat conservative, the
requirements were appropriate with a new borrower. At present, CANTV is
takdng up a relatively large expansion program which involves some reliance
on medium term supplier credits (see paragraph 6.06). The debt service
burden has increased though still reasonable as discussed in paragraph 6.12
above. To avoid requiring Bank agreement frequently, it has been agreed
that during the construction period all debt incurred will be for purposes
of the project only and thereafter debt service coverage will be reduced to
a more realistic level 1.5 times instead of the two times coverage in Loan
435-VE.
6.14     Under Loan No. 435-VE, a minimum depreciation of 4% is required.
Based on a review by CANTV of the economic life of its various types of
fixed assets, the company has made provision for depreciation averag-
ing about 5 on average gross plant in service in 1968 and 1969. This rate
has been used in the forecast. Agreement has been reached during negotiat-
ions on the composite depreciation rate to be used, which should be 5% or
such other rate as agreed to by the Bank from time to time.

7. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) Government will consult the Bank before making any
new appointments to the position of President and
General Manager of CANTV (paragraph 3.01).
(b) The appointment of management consultants will be
made in consultation with the Bank (paragraph 3.04).
(c) Employment of personnel will be carefully controlled
so as to progressively reduce the ratio of staff per
1,000 telephones to 15 by 1974 (paragraphs 3.06 and 6.11).
(d) Costs and tariffs will be maintained at levels that
will achieve a rate of return of at least 11% on
average net plant in service beginning with the year
1973; until then the 8% rate of return prescribed under
Loan No. 435-VE will continue (paragraph 6.09).
(e) No debt will be incurred during,the construction of the
project except for purposes of the project, and there-
after, unless net revenues are 1.5 times the debt service
requirements.
(f) Annual depreciation will be charged at a rate of 5% on
the gross value of plant in service.
7.02     The following conditions have to be met before the Loan becomes
effective:
(a)  Satisfactory steps shall have been completed by CANTV
for recovery of outstanding accounts from governmental
entities, and contractual arrangements made for ensuring
prompt settlement of charges for services in future
(paragraph 6.08).
(b) The levy of subscribers' guarantee deposits shall have
been effected (paragraph 6.05).
7.03     The proposed project forms a suitable basis for a Bank Loan of
US$35 million for a term of 16 years, including a 5-year grace period.

Notes on the Income Statements
1. Revenues
i) Rent and Local Service/National Long-Distance Service
The break-down of past revenues into "Rent and Local Service" and
"National Long Distance Service" is estimated, because no separate statistics
are available for revenues from automatic subscriber trunk dialing (STD)
and from local traffic in excess of the basic free pulses. -The subscriber
increases as outlined in Annex 9, page 1, were used for the forecasts,
which do not assume any tariff adjustments during 1970-1976:
- Average rent and local service revenue per subscriber was
forecast throughout at the 1969 level of Bs 503 per annum.
- Average National long distance revenue per subscriber was
forecast to increase 10% during 1970, 7% in 1971 and 6% per
annum thereafter, the last representing the mean growth rate
experienced during 1966-1969. The 1970 rate of increase is
higher than that of 1971-1974 because 24 exchange areas will
get access to STD this year. The comparative rates of increase
have been 12.8% for 1968 and 12.5% for 1969 when STD was
introduced between the exchange areas comprising all key cities.
ii) International Long Distance Service
The forecast of international long distance revenues per sub-
scriber assumes increases of 10% per annum for 1970-1972 and subsequently
8% per annum. These increases are conservative considering the 1966-1969
increase of 29.6% per annum and the expansion of international service
after commissioning of the earth satellite ground station in early 1972.
iii) Telex
Telex revenues were projected at a 6% annual increase of the
average revenues per telex subscriber. Telex service has been rendered
by CANTV on a national scale since 1969, and nearly half of the subscribers
at December 31, 1969 were not connected until late 1969. This projection
is conservatively based on the experience in other countries.
iv) Subscription Rights Revenues
Revenues from subscription rights were forecast at Bs 466.66
average per new subscriber on the basis of 2 new residential subscribers
(Bs 400 subscription right) for each new commercial subscriber (Bs 600
subscription right).



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 3 pages
v)  -her Operating Revenues
"Other operating revenues" comprise revenues from coin boxes;
installations, repairs, maintenance and moving; leased circuits and
channels; and net revenues from advertisements in the telephone directory.
The forecasts of these various items are based on their past development
and on the new subscriber installations.
2. Operating Expenses
1) Personnel Expenses
Considering management's aim to keep labor costs under better
control, the forecast of personnel expenses is based on an average annual
3% increase per employee for merit raises and for changes in the mix of
the labor force except in 1972 and 1975 when raises of 10% are assumed to
result fram contract renegotiations.
ii) Other Operating Expenses
"Other operating expenses" contain office expenses, rent, vehicle
expenses and miscellaneous expenses forecast at annual rates of increase
between 8% and 18%, extrapolating past experience, plus future annual
operating expenses of the communications school, consultants and the monthly
installments to the Creole Petroleum Company in connection with the micro-
wave route Caracas-Maracaibo.
iii) Depreciation
Depreciation was forecast at 5% of average gross fixed assets in
service, extending past practice since actual depreciation was about 5%
in 1968 and 1969.
3. Interest Expense
CANTV expects to charge all future interest expense directly to
income. This is a change from the past practice to capitalize those portions
of interest expense incurred on behalf of particular construction projects.
The interest expense was forecast at effective debt costs per
existing agreements and contracts and for future f inac ing at the rates
shown below:

Notes on the Balance Sheets
1.        The additions to fixed assets during l970-1974 are as shown in
Annex 9, Table 1. The 1975 and 1976 expenditures were estimated at 10%
of gross fixed assets in service at the preceding year-end, in accordance
with the forecast increase in subscribers in 1975 and 1976.
2.        Work in progress has been forecast to represent about 35% of the
sum of the annual capital expenditures and the balance of work in progress
brought forward from the prior year. In 1974 it includes Bs 25 million
expenditures in respect of the subsequent expansion program.
3.        The net amount of non-current receivables as at December 31, 1969
is forecast to be settled by collection of Bs 2.5 million in 1970 from the
states governments, by Bs 19.0 million in 1971 and 1972 from the federal
agencies, and Bs 12.6 million remainder from municipalities during 1973 and
1974.
4.        The forecast for cash holdings was made in line with the require-
ments for a reasonable liquidity, the cash balances for December 31, 1970-
1974 improving from 2.5% to 15.5% of forecast operating cash outflows of
the subsequent year.
5.        Accounts receivable-current at December 31, 1969, represent some-
what more than two months' prior billings. Forecasts were set at 60 days
of prior sales for 1970, 52.5 days for 1971, 50 days for 1972-1974, and
45 days thereafter, considering the payment terms of 30 days by personal
collection and 45 days for payment by mail and a better future enforcement
of such terms as a result of a reorganization of the collection system.
6.        Inventories were increased by 2% of the annual capital expenditures.
7.        Investments and advances contain the gradual investment of Bs 15
million in the share capital of INTELSAT, and also reflect advances to
suppliers for equipment acquisitions.
8.        Government contributions comprise the interest-free non-repayable
contributions from the Government budget and the value of assets transferred
in 1968 from the Ministry of Communications.
9.        The long-term provision for employees' termination and benefits
represents the future obligations toward employees for pensions, severance
and length of service pay.
10.       Accrued interest expense and deferred income have been forecast
to reflect the change in volume of interest expense and subscription rights
revenues, respectively.

Collection Procedures and Settlement of
Long Outstanding Accounts
The December 31, 1969, balance sheet contains an amount of
Bs 34.1 million (net after Bs 4.2 allowance for bad debts) accounts
receivable outstanding in excess of one year from various federal, state
and municipal governments. Moreover, current accounts receivable
amounting to Bs 67.8 million represent an average outstanding period of
about 80 days, which is excessive considering the allowed payment terms
of 30 days for personal collection and 45 days for payment by mail.
CANTV's approach to settle the long outstanding Government
accounts, to collect future bills on a current basis, and to remedy the
major weaknesses in the collection of private subscriber accounts are
summarized as follows.
A. Government Accounts
1.        A payment of Bs 2.5 million for the settlement of long outstanding
accounts from various state governments is scheduled for this year.
Bs 19.0 million is expected to be collected from the various Federal agencies
in 1971 and 1972. The remainder of Bs 12.6 million represents outstandings
from municipalities and other government entities for which settlement
lwLll be finalized during the execution period. For this purpose CANTV has
undertaken to send statements of account to the agencies concerned before
the date of effectiveness of the proposed loan so that they can provide for
payment of old debts by inclusion of a special item in their future budgets.
Some Government accounts are not expected to be collected in full, but the
bad debts allowance will be sufficient to cover the uncollectible items.
2.        To avoid a similar accumulation of unpaid accounts in the future,
CANTV has agreed to make arrangements for a payment routine to be imposed
on all federal agencies similar to the one now in force for the Ministry of
Finance. Under its arrangement with the Ministry of Finance, CANTV receives
at month-end a remittance covering 75% of the average monthly cost of the
Ministry's use of its telephones in the prior year. Final settlement is
made at year-end payable within 30 days of issuance of the total year
statement.
3.        For each state and municipality, CANTV will seek to obtain similar
contractual arrangements.
B. Private Subscriber Accounts
4.        The present weaknesses in the collection system for private
subscriber accounts will be analyzed and improvements suggested, as part
of the AESA management consultant study now going on for Caracas.



ANNEx 6
Page 2 of 2 pages
5.        Because of the absence of an efficient mail service, the
collection of private accounts has been and still is heavily dependent
upon CANTV's own collection staff.  Only 25,000 of the 140,000 private
subscriber accounts in Caracas are handled by mail. CATTV's subscribers
have the option of paying their bills at the payment office of their
particular central exchange. Payment terms in case of personal collection
are 30 days; in case of payment by mail, 45 days.
6.        Up to October 1, 1970 the collectors have been full-time employees
of CANTV. In addition to the basic monthly salary of Bs 425, they earned
a 2% commission on the amounts collected. Their total remuneration ranged
between Bs 3,000 and 7,000 per month. To make the collection process more
efficient and less costly, CANTV has been able to put all collectors on a
flat "per bill"' collection fee and allocating the zones in a more appropriate
way.
7.        The average collection period of private subscriber accounts has
been in excess of the allowed payment terms. This is partly because some
collectors have concentrated in the past on large, heavy-comission accounts
to the neglect of smaller accounts, and partly because the preparation of
disconnection lists for unpaid accounts, which should normally be made
during the first five days of the month following the one in which the
bills were distributed, has been delayed in the past due to administrative
deficiencies. Reduction of the lag in disconnections will result from the
improved processing of collections.
8.        Other shortcomings prevail in Caracas since CANTV1s relatively
few CANTV payment offices are open only on workdays and during business
hours and since subscribers have to use the payment office of their
particular exchange when paying personally. The opening of payment
offices on a trial basis during off hours proved very successful, but
CANTV had to abandon this alternative because the collective labor contract
does not allow personnel to work overtime on a long-term basis.  The
most likely way to improve the situation is by expanding the number of
payment offices (two were added recently in Caracas, with two more soon
to be added) and after the redesign of the computer system for collections,
by allowing subscribers to pay at the payment office of their choice.
9.        CANTVts plans for improving collection include making arrangements--
similar to those of La Electricidad de Caracas C.A. --for the payment of
telci!;hone bills at drugstores and banks as well as in CANTV offices.
The Company will also promote more vigorously the payment-by-mail method.
For the interior of the country, the possibility of combining CANTV payment
offices with those of the electric utilities is being looked into as still
another low-cost means of improving or setting up collection service.

LABOR PRODUCTIVITY AND CO6TS
CANTV's staff productivity is relatively low, due to over-staffing
and high unit labor costs.
A. Levels of Staffing
In comparison with other similar telephone administrations, CANTV
is over-staffed considering that 97.3% of its conmected DEL's are automatic
(1969), most of its plant new,that it does not provide telegraph service
and that a large portion of the construction work is executed by contractors.
Inadequate personnel utilization was noted in the 1965 Appraisal Report
(Loan 435-VE). At that time the Company had a staff ratio of about 19.1
persons per 1,000 telephones, and although the labor-intensive installation
of many new exchanges and long distance routes was planned, the Bank felt
that the ratio should come down to 17.2 by the end of 1968. At the end of
1969, however, the ratio had come down to 18.3 only. Considering that the
1970-1974 Project basically calls for only an extension of existing facil-
ities, and also considering that during this period part of the national
long distance operators will become available to fulfill other functions,
CANTV agreed to reduce the staff ratio to 15 per 1,000 telephones.

1966             5,952             309                19.3
1967             6,555             327                20.3
1968             6,475             346                18.7

1974            11,550             770                15.0
As shown in the above table, CANTV can almost double the number of its
staff during the project period and the ratio will still decline. The
table includes only permanently employed staff. Temporary fixed-term
persons, who in 1969 totalled an average of 740, are not included in the
calculation; the financial forecast assumes that their percentage share
of total staff will remain unchanged.



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 3 pages
Despite difficulties in comparing staff ratios between various
telecammunication administraticns (because of differences in type of work,
educational background, caliber of personnel, etc.) and ignoring line,
cable and conduit craftsmen, the adjusted CANTV December 31, 1969, ratio
of about 17.4 employees per 1,000 telephones compares with roughly 9.1
for the Bell System in the United States, 10.4 for Germany (some personnel
for construction work included) and 4.2 for Switzerland (all telephone
connections done by outsiders). CANTV's average wage costs per employee
are roughly comparable with costs in those countries. On the other hand,
there are many countries with higher relative levels of staff but also
considerably lower levels of conpensation.
The ratio of 15 persons per 1,000 telephones by 1974 can be
attained by increasing the staff efficiency to bring it in line with the
pay level. Policies destined to improve personnel utilization should
comprise the definition of wcrk standards, the reorganization of work-
gangs, the introduction of a wage incentive system, and more contracting
out of installation and construction work (possibly even telephone
connections) to sub-contractors.
B. Labor Costs
CANTV's unit labor costs are not accompanied by high personnel
productivity. Average salary and wage costs per employee have shown
annual increases between 4%1 and 6% for years without collective labor
contract negotiations. The latest three-year labor contract (signed
on December 22, 1969, and effective retroactively to April 1, 1969),
brought salary/wage increases and additional fringe benefits iepresenting
a 15.5% rise in average employee compensation. Average costs per employee
have gone up by 40% between 1964 and 1969. With approximately Be 24,00o
total compensation in 1969, CANTV's employees are among the best-paid
personnel in Venezuela after those in the petroleum industry. Management
is of the opinion that the Company's viability could be endangered if
future average labor cost increases per employee cannot be kept below
10% for years with contract renegotiations and 3% for the other years,
unless compensated by tariff increases. It aims to remain within these
limits, and they have therefore been built into the forecasts.
C. Sensitivity Analysis
The following highlights the sensitivity of the projected 1970-
1974 income and cash flows to unfavorable changes in labor costs and levels
of staffing, and indicates that control of labor efficiency and labor
costs merits close attention:

If annual labor cost        If annual labor cost
per employee increases      increases by 2%/5% more
by 2% 1/  and 5% 2/         and if staff levels are
more than forecast,         5% higher than forecasts
it would result in a
reduction/shortfaIl
of total 1970-1974:               (million of Bolivares)
Net operating income                99.4                          162.6
Net cash flows 3/                  131.1                          214.2
Unless tariffs are adjusted, the rate of return, the debt/equity
ratio and the debt service coverage would be less favorable than forecast.
For example, the rate of return would be below the proposed covenant
limit in 1974 and the debt service coverage below 1.5 in 1972.
1/ Years-without collective labor contract negotiations.
2/  Years with collective labor contract negotiations.
3/ Considering incremental labor costs for CANTV's capitalized own
construction and the depreciation thereon as well as interest
expense to finance the shortfall in cash flows.

3.       There has been a large unsatisfied demand for telephone connections.
The registered waiting list, which usually represents only a fraction of the
total demand, shows by the end of 1969, 42,000 applications for direct
exchange lines in Caracas and 34,000 in the rest of the country. With the
exception of some special cases, waiting time for telephone connections has
varied between two to five years.

5.       CANTV has a multiplicity of types of automatic switching equipment
in operation -- five types in Caracas and seven in all of Venezuela.
6.       The various types of exchanges and their capacities in Venezuela,
as of December 1969, are shown below:

331,820
This has led to problems in training and staffing as well as to operational
problems to provide satisfactory service. CANTV has decided to standardize
on modern crossbar systems for all new installations. To further improve
interworking in the Caracas area and to provide for increased traffic, CANTV
is installing two modern tandem exchanges more suited to handle the inter-
working between the existing systems.

B. Long Distance Service
Routes
7.        The main long distance routes in Venezuela are shown in Map 1.
These consist of:
a. A main microwave artery - Western Network - connecting the
principal cities in Venezuela to the west of Caracas for
telephone and television relay. This was financed by Bank
Loan No. 435-VE.
b. A microwave route (300 channels) between Caracas and Mara-
caibo, owned by the CREOLE Petroleum Co.  CANTV now rents
some circuits to serve various towns on this route. According
to an agreement reached between CREOLE and CANTV, CANTV will
buy this route in 1974.
c. A microwave artery - Eastern Network - connecting the principal
cities to the east of Caracas is now being provided; a con-
tract for this equipment was awarded in 1969 and the system
is expected to be commissioned in 1971. This system will
replace a 72-channel VHF system now in operation in the area.
8.        The details of these routes, the number of circuits provided in
the various sections and the details of the switching centers are given
in the Charts 1 & 2 of Annex 13.
Circuits
9.        There were at the end of 1969 a total of 2,699 circuits in
operation in all of Venezuela. This includes not only the circuits
provided on the main routes referred to above, but also those provided
by cables and open wire lines to the smaller centers.
Exchanges
10.       Subscriber trunk dialing (STD) is in operation between the
principal cities of Venezuela. The automatic switching center exchanges
providing this service and the capacity of these exchanges as they existed
in 1969 are included in the information given on page 3 of Annex 9.
Quality of Service
11.       The service provided to the public is not satisfactory. Even
though tle maintenance and operation of the long distance routes is
satisfactory, there is acute congestion at various sections of the routes
due to the heavy upsurge (about 350%) in traffic that followed the intro-
duction of STD. At present only 30% of traffic originating during the
busy hour is completed. Half of the failures are due to the shortage of
long distance circuits, while the rest is due to congestions in junctions
interconnecting with the local systems. The expansion program is aimed
at eliminating the bottlenecks.

D. International Service
14.        Venezuela's existing (1969) international connections for
telephone servioes are as follows:
Connections to:
U.S.A. - Europe and Central
America included          46                Submarine Cable
Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands       4               Submarine Cable
Dominican Republic                   2               Submarine Cable

Curacao                              2               UHF radio
Aruba                                1               UHF radio
Panama                              1                HF radio
Argentina                            1               HF radio
Ecuador and Peru                     1               HF radio
Trinidad                            2                HF radio
Italy                                2               HF radio
Spain                                2               HF radio
Brazil                               1               HF radio
Total                       84
15.        Before 1966, all international circuits were handled by high
frequency routes.  In August 1966, a submarine cable was commissioned link-
ing Venezuela with St. Thomas Island in the Caribbean and Florida in the
U.S.A.. Telephone and telex traffic is directed to the U.S.A. and, by
extensions through their systems via St. Thomas Island and the U.S.A., to
a number of Caribbean locations, Mexico and Europe. Communications to
Colombia and some other neighboring countries were extended by use of UHF.
16.        Improvements in the quality of service upon commissioning of
these routes resulted in a high upsurge of traffic - over 400% - to these
destinations in the year following their use, and traffic has been increasing
by about 20% a year thereafter. Due to this heavy unexpected increase, there
is some congestion during the busy hour with an average delay of 18 minutes
for calls to the U.S.A. and of 27 minutes for calls to Europe. The establish-
ment of a satellite ground station in November 1970 will give relief and will
be the mode utilized to meet future demand.

Some 240,000 telephone sets for the expansion Program are
going to be financed by the proposed Loan under international competitive
bidding. The balance of requirements has been contracted for in 1969.
B. Long Distance Service
Long Distance Routes
The routes included in the 1970-1974 Program are shown in the
Map and in Charts 1 & 2 of Annex 13.
With respect to the Eastern Network, no new routes are being added
except for the completion of the 960-channel microwave system (Japanese)
already in hand.
The Western Network is being strengthened considerably by two
1,800-channel capacity microwave links from Caracas to Altamira (2 bearers)
and Altamira to Barquisiimeto (one bearer). The existing 960-channel
capacity microwave equipment for Caracas to Altamira (one bearer) will be
shifted to augment the Barquisimeto to Escuque section. The Northwestern
system is also to be augmented and two alternatives are under consideration,
the first to install a system between Caracas to Mirimire (through Pt. Cabello)
and the secnd to erect a new route from Barquisimeto to Curimagua. A decision
on this will be taken after a study to be performed and completed during the
Project period. A number of spur routes are also being provided, including
a short interconnection of the MIerida-San Cristobal link with the Colombian
long distance network across the border. Spur routes in the immediate
vicinity of Caracas are included.
A microwave system to the south from San Juan to Calabozo-San
Fernando is likewise included.
All the systems would be procured by international competitive
bidding and financed by the proposed Loan.
The execution schedules for these routes are given in the Chart
at Annex 12.
Circuits
Multiplexing equipment is being added to the existing routes
and to the new routes being established in the 1970-1974 Project, pro-
viding for a total of 6,000 additional channels to meet the estimated
requirements.

D. International Service
By Nov. 1970, a satellite ground station has been taken into
operation in Camatagua, about 70 miles south of Caracas. The station will
work with the INTEISAT Atlantic satellite and provide circuits to a number
of countries in North and South America and Europe. Initially the following
telephone circuits are being provided:
Venezuela to--
United States                  5
Canada                         2
Italy                          4
Germany                        4
8pain                          2
Latin American countries      13
Total           30
Additional circuits as well as new destinations can be added as
required. The ground station at Camatagua will be connected to Caracas by
a microwave link of 960-channel ultimate capacity. The raquirements of telex
circuits will also be provided through the satellite system. The international
exchange in Caracas is being augmented to meet the increased requirements.
The costs of establishing satellite communication facilities are
shown in Table I, item 3 in this Annex. Item 3.2, shown as "INTEISAT" in this
table, represents the share capital to be contributed by CANTV to INTELSAT
for participating in the INTELSAT World wide Satellite Communication System.

JUSTIFICATIOUT
A. Estimate of Telephone Demand
Since a large part of the less developed areas in Venezuela has
no public telephone service and because waiting lists of applicants for
telephone service are only kept in places which are presently serviced or
where expansions are planned fairly soon, CANTV has attempted to assess the
total present and future telephone demand in Venezuela by use of an econo-
metric model.
Six factors were considered therefor: (a) Towns grouped according
to size into 4 classes; (b) Extrapolated population figures; (c) Number of
persons per household; (d) Distribution of monthly income in 7 income brackets;
(e) Coefficients of interest for telephone connections of the various incomte
brackets, and (f) Ratio of residential to total subscribers.
The resulting overall demand coeffLcients and the calculated demand
for 1970 and 1974 are as follows:

Total                           2481200      657,900   824,600
B. Internal Financial Rate of Return of the 1970-1974 Program
The internal financial rate of return of 21.22% determined on Page
2 of this Annex is the discount rate which equalizes the present values of
incremental operatirg cash flows attributable to the Program and the expendi_-
tures, both at 1970 price levels.  The incremental cash flows were determined
soy difference from the two streams of net operating cash flows (net operating
income before depreciation), considered for the average lifetime of the equip-
ment provided by the Program; those with Program execution by using the
relevant figures shown on the forecast income statements for 1970-1974 and
allowing a 6% growth p.a. of long distance and telex revenues for 1975 and 1976
only and those without Program execution, by using the 1969 actual net operat-
ing cash flows allowing a 6% growth p.a. of long distance and telex revenues
for 1970 and 1971 only.
