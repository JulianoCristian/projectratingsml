I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country background:

1.      Ethiopia is a large, diverse and poor country. At the time of appraisal (2004), Ethiopia
had a total population of 61 million (which has risen to over 90 million today) of whom 83
percent live in rural areas. Per capita income was at US$160, substantially below the Sub-Saharan
African average of US$765, and among the ten poorest countries globally; 39 percent of
Ethiopians lived below the national poverty line of US$0.6 per day.

2.        Ethiopia is implementing a second wave of decentralization. Ethiopia is governed
through a federal, democratic government system established in the early 1990s, with nine
autonomous regions (Afar, Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambella, Harari, Oromia, Somali,
Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (SNNPR), and Tigray) and two chartered cities
(Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa). A phased approach to decentralization has been adopted, first
between 1991 and 1995 with a transfer of powers from the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) to
regions. This was followed by further decentralization of service delivery from 2001 to today,
first to districts (woredas) and, for some aspects, extended to kebeles (villages).

3.      At the time of appraisal, the GoE was implementing a comprehensive economic reform
program with the objectives of reducing poverty and improving human development through its
first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (Ethiopian Sustainable Development and Poverty
Reduction Program (SDRP), 2000). Economic liberalization, redirecting public investment
towards poverty reducing sectors, improvement of economic and social infrastructure, and
decentralization of service delivery responsibilities to the lower level were among the priorities of
the GoE development strategy.

Sector background

4.      At appraisal, water supply and sanitation (WSS) coverage in Ethiopia was the lowest in
Sub-Saharan Africa and one of the lowest in the world. In 2000, access to safe drinking water
was 13 percent in rural areas (7 million of 50 million) and 73 percent in urban areas (8 million of
11 million), with 6 percent access to adequate sanitation in rural areas and 62 percent in urban
areas, one of the lowest rates globally. Water scarcity was considered to have its root causes in
poor sector governance, lack of finance and uneven spatial distribution of water resources, rather
than water availability per se.

5.       Limited financial resources were available for the WSS sector and most financing was
from outside the Government, and supply driven. At appraisal, it was assessed that a five-fold
increase in the annual rate of investment of US$100 million would be needed to meet the targets
set in the SDRP plan and to meet the Millennium Development Goals. User fees were generally
too low to cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the service. Most financing to the
sector was provided by Development Partners, and much of this was through off-budget, supply
driven programs.

6.      Decentralization created an opportunity for more responsive service delivery, but also
exposed major capacity constraints throughout the sector. Consistent with the Government’s
policy on decentralization, many of the responsibilities for water and sanitation delivery were
shifted to the regional and local governments, but their capacity to carry out these new

responsibilities was very limited. There was wide disparity in capacity between the more
developed regions (Oromia, Amhara, SPNNP, Tigray, Harari) and emerging regions (Afar,
Somali, Benshangul-Gamuz, Gambella). In addition, Ethiopia does not have a strong tradition of
stakeholder involvement in decision making which did not encourage an environment of
collaborative governance. There was limited involvement by the private or informal sector in the
design and construction or water supply systems, and almost none in operation and maintenance.

7.      The responsibilities for development and provision of WSS services were shared among
four Ministries (Education, Finance and Economic Development, Health, and Water and Energy)
and their respective Bureaus at the regional level. In addition, consistent with Ethiopia’s
decentralization policy, woredas/towns and communities are responsible for planning and
managing their own water supply and sanitation services.

Rational for Bank assistance

8.      The project design built on relevant experience from prior engagement in the WSS
sector both through analytical work and investment lending. The project was formulated to
contribute toward a number of higher level objectives and strategic programs, including the
World Bank's Africa Action Plan’s priority objective of closing the "infrastructure gap" in Africa
to help achieve the economic growth required for a substantial reduction in poverty. Improved
access to clean water supply and sanitation is specifically included in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) (March 24, 2003, Report No. 25591-ET). The Bank’s issue papers on
affordability of project designs, scheme management models, improving the supply of materials
and services, and integrating sanitation planning and hygiene education with water supply, and a
water chapter in the 2003 Ethiopia Public Expenditure Review helped guide sector reforms and
integrate WSS into government planning. The Bank had also financed infrastructure facilities
through a series of lending operations.

9.        The Water Supply Development and Rehabilitation Project (WSDR) piloted
decentralized approaches to WSS in a number of towns and rural communities. From 1996 to
2003, the Bank financed the WSDR Project in 25 towns across the country and in rural
communities in 11 woredas of the four largest regions. Of particular relevance to the Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (WSSP) were the piloting of the following policy approaches: (i)
decentralization through establishment and capacity building of autonomous Water Boards and
water service providers and implementation of systems for improved tracking, reporting on and
monitoring of performance standards; (ii) improved cost recovery through incorporation of
financial and economic analysis during the project design phase and through tariff reform; and
(iii) involvement of a broader range of stakeholders, including the private sector and communities,
in the design and implementation of urban and rural water supply systems and sanitation
promotion. The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) for the WSDR project
rated the project as satisfactory in achieving its development objective, with a substantial
institutional development impact.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

10.     The PDO was to “increase access to sustainable water supply and sanitation services, for
rural and urban users, through improved capacity of stakeholders in the sector.”

11.       The key indicators identified to measure progress toward achieving the PDO were:
         increase in population with access to improved water supply in rural and urban project
          areas;


                                                2
        number of effective woreda water and sanitation programs established through the
         project; and
        number of effective, autonomous water boards established through the project in
         town/urban areas.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

12.      The PDO and the indicators were not formally revised. As detailed in the table below,
the three sources of financing (original IDA, Additional Financing and MDTF) all used different
formulations of the PDO indicators, though a formal restructuring was never done. The
Government ICR presents another set of targets. For the purposes of the ICR, the targets have
been derived from the multiple project documents in the project files as per the Results
Framework in the datasheet and summarized below. In this case, it does not make sense to judge
the project on the original IDA alone, as the MDTF co-financing and the Additional Financing
increased the project scope and targets, and the project financing increased from US$100 million
to US$291 million equivalent. The revised indicators and targets recorded in the Results
Framework in the ICR include the increased scope and targets from the IDA Additional
Financing and the MDTF financing, though, as noted, a formal restructuring was not done. For
the most part it is assumed that the IDA targets were aggregated during Additional Financing and
the MDTF targets are additional, e.g. for access to water supply, it assumed to be 3 million (IDA
original plus AF) plus 3.2 million (MDTF) for a total of 6.2 million people.

  It should also be noted that the Development Financing Agreement (Schedule 7) lists eight indicators
which are not consistent with the three indicators in the PAD.
2
  In line with business processes at the time the MDTF does not have an equivalent to a PAD and no
restructuring was done. The ICR has used the DFID Project Memorandum (June 2007) as reference. It
should be noted that in subsequent DFID project monitoring reports (which were done jointly with the
Bank), targets were revised downwards. As these figures were never formally captured in a Bank
document, it is difficult for the ICR team to include these revisions, however, it should be noted that the
ICR has taken a conservative view to the targets, i.e, most targets assumed in the ICR are above the targets
assumed by the Government and the Bank team.
3
  The reason this indicator is not included in the ICR is discussed further in section 3.2 (para 75)

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.      The total number of beneficiaries of the project was 6.2 million people, 5.2 million in
rural areas and 1 million in urban areas. These beneficiaries were intended to benefit from
improved access to water supply and sanitation. However, the various documents for the original
financing, Additional Financing and MDTF show different information and no formal
restructuring was done to update the Results Framework. The main beneficiaries identified in the
original project were the 2 million people in rural and urban project areas4; however there is some
discrepancy between the Development Financing Agreement (DFA) and the Project Assessment
Document (PAD), which in some sections refers to 3 million people (2 million people in rural
areas and 1 million people in urban areas) under the project. The MDTF funding set out to benefit
3.2 million people according to the UK Department for International Development (DFID)
Project Memo (2007). The Additional Financing further scaled up the project to benefit another 1
million people. Therefore the total numbers of beneficiaries of the project are 6.2 million people,
5.2 million in rural areas and 1 million in urban areas. These figures are not consistent with the
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) from 2010 to 2013 which used a target
beneficiary population of 5 million people; 4.2 million in rural areas and 0.8 million in urban
areas.

1.5 Original Components

14.     Component 1 – Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (US$59.5 million): The objectives
of this component were: (i) to increase the capacity of participating woredas to effectively
manage their rural water supply and sanitation programs; (ii) to increase the capacity of
participating communities to effectively manage their water supply and sanitation facilities; and
(iii) to ensure that well-functioning water supply schemes are in place in participating

                                                    4
communities. Key outputs as indicated in the PAD include: (a) woreda-wide Rural Water Supply
and Sanitation (RWSS) Programs; (b) woreda staff adequately trained and equipped to support
rural water supply and sanitation; (c) community water committees established and able to
manage and maintain systems; (d) local service providers capable of supporting RWSS at the
community level; and (e) improved water supply and sanitation facilities at the community level.

15.       Component 2 - Urban Water Supply and Sanitation (US$46.3 million): The objectives
of this component are: (i) to increase the capacity of participating water boards/committees and
operators to effectively manage their water supply and sanitation facilities; and (ii) to ensure that
well-functioning and properly utilized urban water supply systems and improved sanitation are in
place in participating towns and cities. Key outputs as indicated in the PAD include: (a)
autonomous Town Water Boards with business plans and improved capacity for oversight; (b)
utility operators with improved management systems and improved water supply and sanitation
facilities; and (c) local consulting firms able to support Water Boards and operators. Funding
would be provided (i) to increase the capacity of participating water boards/committees and
operators to effectively manage their water supply and sanitation facilities; and (ii) to ensure that
well-functioning and properly utilized urban water supply systems and improved sanitation are in
place in participating towns and cities. Cities with established water boards would be supported to
develop financial management systems, business plans and establish creditworthiness for their
entities before they could qualify to borrow for their expansion and further development.

16.      Component 3 – Project management (US$10.2 million): Supporting the Ministry of
Water Resources (MWR) (which later became the Ministry of Water and Energy), Water
Resources Development Fund (WRDF) and the Regional Water Resources Development Bureaus
to carry out an efficient monitoring and coordination of water resources activities under the
program through: (i) building capacity of Regional Water Resources Development Bureaus'
personnel and regionally-based consultants, including practitioner specialist groups, and
establishment of systems to provide ongoing assistance to towns, woredas and communities; and
(ii) building MWR capacity to manage and monitor the program, develop information and
communications technology-based activities to increase networking capabilities, carry out
applied research in the sector, improve water quality testing, support vocational training, and
refine strategies and implementation arrangements for the project and program.

1.6 Revised Components

17.      While the scope of the project has been extended to give more focus to hygiene and
sanitation, the major components of the project have not been changed throughout the life of the
project.

1.7 Other significant changes

18.    The Development Financing Agreement was amended several times. None of the
amendments involved a modification of the neither original project development objectives nor
changes to the results framework or safeguards. The following were significant changes:

19.    Initial cost and financing: The original project cost was US$116 million, of which
US$100 million from IDA (US$75 million credit and US$25 million grant) and US$16 million
from government counterpart contribution. The financing plan was amended to remove the
US$16 million required from the government allowing all costs to be covered from IDA proceeds.
US$13 million was cancelled from the project and allocated to the Emergency Food Crisis
Response Program (November 2008) which cancelled funds from 12 projects totaling US$137


                                                 5
million. The project approved a revised financing plan which did not include a revision to the
results framework and in the project paper for the crisis response program it was cited that: “...the
cancellation of US$13 million will not affect project outcomes”.

20.      Multi-donor Trust Fund (MDTF, TF 91704): During the course of implementation, the
project received co-financing of GPB 70 million to scale up investment through a DFID-financed
and IDA-managed MDTF. The size of the total commitment from DFID was reduced to GBP 66
million as GBP 4 million was allocated to other projects. The MDTF was approved and declared
effective in April 2008 with a closing date of December 2012. The closing date for the MDTF
was also extended to October 10, 2013.

21.      Additional Financing (IDA 47130): The project received US$80 million Additional
Financing to address the financing gap created due to the global financial crisis and related price
escalation. The Additional Financing was approved on March 30, 2010, signed on April, 30 2010
and declared effective on July 30, 2010. The original closing date for the AF was March 31,
2013 which was extended to October 10, 2013 with the others co-financing.

22.     Closing date: The original closing date of March 31, 2010 was extended to March 31,
2013 as part of the Additional Financing restructuring, and extended again to October 10, 2013 in
a second restructuring, processed on March 4, 2013.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background analysis

24.      The background analysis that informed the project design and the rationale for Bank
support was sound. The project preparation process, as seen in the PAD and other preparatory
documents, reflects a sound understanding of the fundamental challenges facing the sector in the
country at the time. This included a thorough capacity assessment at all levels and analysis of
key design issues through sector studies (management models, technical design, supply chains,
and hygiene and sanitation). The capacity assessment revealed that capacity at the national,
regional, woreda and town level was inadequate to prepare, manage, monitor and evaluate large
scale sector intervention in the country. This necessitated including an innovative, cascaded
technical assistance at all levels. In line with the findings of these preparatory works, the project
mainly focused on building capacity through “Learning by Doing” (making systems, procedures
and, most importantly, providing resources for participating regions, woredas and towns to
implement the project by themselves). Moreover a “stepped approach” to capacity building was
used first with a focus on building capacity and investment support for those towns that qualified
for the next stage.

25.      Lessons from previous operations (both AAA and investment lending), and
international best practice in WSS were incorporated into the project design. The project
focused on a number of aspects to improve the sustainability of WSS systems, such as building
the capacity of local governments to construct the schemes and operate them after completion,
involvement of users in project design and a focus on cost recovery to improve financial
sustainability. The project was designed following the completion of two Bank-supported sector
programs in the country, i.e. the Water Supply and Rehabilitation Project (commonly referred as
the 25 towns water supply rehabilitation project) and the Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and
Development Project (ESRDF) that has a major Rural Water Supply and Sanitation component
(about US$75 million). The evaluation of these two projects indicated that any future intervention
in the sector should respond to the government’s decentralization policy. The project took
account of the Government’s focus on gradual cost recovery with regard to urban water supply
and sanitation services based on the Ethiopian Water Resources Management Policy (1998) and
the subsequent Ethiopian Water Sector Strategy (2001). The project design introduced a gradual
approach to commercializing urban WSS services to have a clear organizational structure (Board
and utility), build their capacity, improve their service levels, improve efficiency and gradually
qualify to access commercial sources for future investment.

Project design

26.     The project design was technically sound and appropriate to the Ethiopian context.
The project development objective was clear, realistic and important and responded to a key
development priority for the GoE. The components and institutional arrangements provided a
coherent means to achieve the PDO. It should also be noted that the scale and scope of the project
was large and complex, particularly given the limited capacity at all levels (federal, regional,
woreda, village); however, the ICR judges the level of ambition of the project appropriate due to
the needs of the sector and the capability of the Government and the Bank to address these needs.
The project was intended to support 300 woredas, through 11,700 WSS schemes in rural areas
and 86 urban centers. Each required extensive capacity building to adopt the new demand
responsive approach, and required significant support.


                                                 7
27.      The design was ambitious in scale and scope and was designed to move the sector to a
more sector-wide approach: The project was designed with flexibility to take a more sector-wide
approach in subsequent projects. The massive capacity constraints faced by the project required
significant time to be addressed and a five year implementation period may have been too short to
address this issue. Building the capacity at all levels with innovative learning by doing, as well as
taking woredas, communities and towns in a stepped capacity building process was designed to
take two years, but the implementation plan and disbursement schedule did not reflect this.

28.     Combining rural and urban WSS added to the ambition, but was appropriate. The
approach to rural WSS was different than for urban WSS, which is appropriate. The rural WSS
component was designed for schemes to be managed by local governments (woredas and kebeles)
with extensive involvement of users and support from the regions. In contrast, urban WSS
involved the establishment of commercially viable utilities more focused on operational and
financial aspects. Combining rural and urban WSS into one project made sense, as the Ministry
of Water and Energy oversees both sectors, the project could create capacity across the board and
this would easier lead to a more sector-wide approach; however, these two approaches required
fundamentally different skill sets in the Government, implementing agencies and Bank team, and
added to the complexity of the project.

29.     QAG rated quality at entry as moderately satisfactory. A Quality Assessment of
Lending Portfolio (QALP) assessment was carried out in 2008 which assessed quality at entry
and quality of lending. The team had adequately identified the risks to achievement of the Project
Development Objectives and adequately identified mitigation measures. The assessment rated
quality of design as moderately satisfactory due to the overall satisfactory level of preparation and
appraisal but with a number of shortcomings, including: (i) the complexity of the design, given
the number of stakeholders and attempt to do both rural and urban WSS; and (ii) the level of
ambition, given capacity constraints throughout the government and implementing agencies.

Quality at entry

30.    The quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. Consistent with the QALP
assessment, the ICR rates the quality at entry as Moderately Satisfactory due to the significant
background analysis, appropriateness of the design, but given the shortcomings discussed above.

2.2 Implementation

31.      The project had a number of significant changes during its life that affected
implementation and outcomes: (i) the co-financing from the MDTF in 2007 scaled up the project
in rural and urban areas and provided a renewed focus on sanitation and hygiene; (ii) the
Additional Financing in 2010 further scaled up the urban component, and allowed achievement of
the PDO due to cost overruns; (iii) the inclusion of the Ministries of Education, Health and
Finance and their respective regional bureaus as implementing agencies in 2008 (after the mid-
term review) was also a change in the scope of the project due to increased financing and the need
to further integrate hygiene and sanitation with water supply; and (iv) the disbursement modality
was changed from Statement of Expenditure (SOE) (reimbursement of expenses) to Interim
Financial Report (IFR) (accounting for advance payments) based disbursement. The fund flow
was also changed from Channel 2 (fund flowing directly to the Ministry of Water Resources and
regional implementing agencies) to Channel 1b (fund flowing through Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development and its respective bureaus and offices at regional and woreda level).



                                                 8
32.      Mid-term review: A mid-term review (MTR) was carried out in May 2007 that had
significant impact on implementation. An interim implementation manual (Water Supply,
Sanitation and Hygiene Program Implementation Manual) was developed to guide the change in
implementation arrangements. The MTR tried to re-focus on: (i) sanitation and hygiene
promotion, after the realization that this had been slower than water supply; (ii) special
implementation arrangements to reach remote woredas; (iii) attempt to improve coordination
through establishment of the National Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) Coordination
Office; (iv) improved fund flow through a shift to SOE-based applications and a switch to
Channel 1b; and (v) agreement with DFID to support the scaled-up program through the Multi-
Donor Trust Fund.

33.     The project experienced a lag in implementation at the beginning due to the
(necessary) focus on capacity building. The project piloted a new decentralized approach to
delivery at the woreda and kebele levels. This required an enormous capacity building effort to
train and equip new actors in the sector. This focus on capacity building over the first two years
of implementation significantly impacted project implementation and disbursement.

34.      The project was impacted by significant staff turn-over at every level in the
Government and implementation agencies and inadequate capacity of the implementing
agencies throughout the project. The frequent staff turnover, which is an issue across the Bank’s
lending portfolio in Ethiopia, was the main implementation challenge at all levels. This resulted
in the loss of key trained and well-experienced staff, particularly in engineering, procurement and
financial aspects. This coupled with the lack of an incentive mechanism by the government
aggravated the problem.

35.      Government agencies did not have a tradition of working in an integrated manner.
The project required a high degree of collaboration among the three key WSS ministries
(Education, Health and Water), particularly after the MDTF funds were approved to program
activities jointly across federal, regional and local levels. The ministries signed a Memoranda of
Understanding (MoU’s) in 2003, but the MOU remained inactive until 2007 when it was
implemented with the creation of a National WaSH coordination structure in 2007. Despite the
effort by the Ministry of Water to further reinvigorate the coordination structure, project support
to the coordination structure continued to be weak and remains a challenge. Incomplete reporting
with regard to outcomes on hygiene and sanitation is one of the direct impacts of this ongoing
coordination challenge.

36.      The limited capacity of local borehole drilling companies affected the rate at which the
rural component could be implemented. A challenge during implementation was the shortage of
local borehole drilling companies as well as drilling rigs for exploitation of underground water
resources, causing some project delays. A study conducted on the issue indicates that there were a
total of 68 drilling contractors operating in the country, and most with outdated rigs, and only 20
percent of operating rigs were in good condition. According to the study, 355 drilling rigs were
required to meet the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) target related to groundwater
development. There were a maximum 60 rigs available, indicating an 83 percent shortfall in rigs
needed to meet the target. There was a huge supply gap that needed to be addressed to attract
investment and participation in the field.

37.      The project experienced significant price escalations and cost overruns: The project
faced price escalation and cost overruns largely due to the continuous devaluation of the local
currency and the global oil price hike, and specifically due to: (i) higher than expected per capita
costs for piped systems (from US$47 per capita at appraisal to US$80 per capita at project close);


                                                 9
(ii) larger than expected populations in participating towns6; (iii) the shifting of US$13 million of
project funds to the Emergency Food Crisis Project; (iv) termination of the Government’s
counterpart contribution (US$15.98 million); and (v) negative exchange rate impacts from
depreciation of the GBP relative to the US$. With increased costs, reduced project funds and
without benefitting from the additional financing, the resources remaining for the urban water
supply and sanitation component could only partially fund the construction of water supply
facilities in 28 towns (17 small, 5 medium and 6 large) of the 50 towns originally targeted by the
project, with the financial shortfall of US$80 million.

38.      The project experienced specific challenges in difficult regions. Ethiopia is a large and
diverse country, and the project operated in all of its regions. Remote areas, such as in the Somali
Region, had specific challenges in access, availability of contractors and consultants and very
limited capacity. Project oversight was equally challenging, for example, some of the schemes
implemented under the project were a five-day car trip away from the regional capital, creating
logistical and cost challenges.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.      The M&E system for the Project was inadequate. The focus of project monitoring and
evaluation was to assist the GoE to establish a sector-wide M&E system. While this may have
been an important activity with significant development impact over time, it appears that this
focus limited the development of a project-level M&E system, which is needed to fully capture
project outputs, outcomes and impact. The Results Framework was not updated throughout
project implementation. There was no systematic data collection at the regional and woreda level,
and there was poor sharing of data between the various ministries. The result is that the project
does not have a robust set of data, despite its scope and ambition.

40.      While the project level M&E system was inadequate, the project made a significant
contribution to the development of a sector-wide M&E system. With the support of the Bank
(through WSSP and the Ethiopia Protection of Basic Services Project (PBS)) and other
development partners, the Ministry of Water and Energy (MoWE) has initiated the development
of a sectoral M&E system and Management Information Systems (MIS) to support the
establishment of a web-based WaSH sector MIS for information, data storage and exchange. The
sector-wide M&E has been piloted in 12 test sites and 58 roll-out sites. The roll-out to the whole
country is currently in process (300 computers with associated servers for federal and regional
levels have been procured, and procurement of 500 additional computers is underway). As the
WaSH MIS is cross-sectoral (involving water, education and health), coordination among the
WaSH MIS, the Health MIS, and the Education MIS is among the ministry’s critical remaining
tasks.

41.      A national WaSH inventory was made in 2010-11. Each water point was identified
according to its coordinates d, including the number of users in 730 woredas and 16,000 kebeles
in the country, except for the Somali Region. Information on WaSH at schools and health
institutions was also collected. The National WaSH Inventory (NWI) results were officially
released by MoWE to WaSH stakeholders in April 2013.

  During project design, 15,000 was considered the threshold population size to distinguish between large and small
towns (>15,000 was considered large and < 15,000 as small) with 20,000 average population size. Currently most of
the towns have larger population than originally estimated, with the average population of towns covered under the
project at 40,600 for large towns and 11,900 for small towns.


                                                       10
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.      Procurement: Overall procurement implementation is rated moderately satisfactory.
Under the project, a large number of contracts (works, goods, consultancy) involving different
methods of procurement and contract values were undertaken. The capacity to perform basic
procurement activities has been improved through various tailor-made clinics provided by the
Bank as well as the basic and intermediate procurement trainings provided to regional and federal
by Project Management Unit (PMU) staff, both in country and abroad. Nevertheless, the project
has been facing procurement challenges throughout its life. During the project period, consistent
capacity has not been observed in the MoWE PMU relating to procurement implementation. For
most of the project period, the PMU has functioned with a limited number of procurement
specialists because of high staff turnover. As a result, it was not possible to fulfill even the basic
requirements of the project like compilation of procurement plans and contracts registers. The
linkage of the PMU with regions, towns, and woredas was weak, and procurement
implementation monitoring was limited.

43.      Implementation at regional bureaus faced a number of challenges. Due to the
decentralized nature of the project, the regional Water Bureaus had full control of procurement
administration and decisions, with oversight of the MoWE PMU. There were inadequate numbers
of qualified Procurement Specialists in all regions. This resulted in delays in procurement
implementation, absence of updated procurement plans, unavailability of updated procurement
registers, poor quality of documents, poor record keeping, etc. Post reviews and assessments
indicated numerous irregularities during bidding. The assessments further noted contract
administration as a major challenge, being almost a neglected aspect of implementation. In
addition, the project had faced market challenges that affected implementation, including: (i)
paucity of drilling companies, (ii) few bidders for pipes and fittings and for electromechanical
equipment; and (iii) weak capacity of civil works contracts.(A detailed implementation
completion report on procurement aspects is in the project files.

44.           The following table summarizes contracts entered into during the project life.

45.      Financial Management (FM): The overall FM rating for the project is moderately
satisfactory. The project maintained an adequate financial management system throughout.
Generally, the project complied with the requisite financial covenants outlined in its legal
agreement which included submission of quarterly Interim Financial Reports and annual audits.
The Implementation Status Reports generally rated FM as Moderately Satisfactory with Moderate
financial management risk. The main challenges noted in the project were lack of adequate
internal audit oversight, weak budgetary control mechanism, high turnover of staff, weak contract
management leading to slow disbursement rates, particularly at the initial stage, and weak follow
up of irregularities noted in financial audit reports.

46.      The key FM lesson learned from implementation of this project was that the role of an
internal auditor is significant in highly decentralized operations, and should be given due
attention particularly at the design stage of a project. In addition, project financial reports should
be used by project management to monitor project progress and over- and underutilization of the
budget in order to take timely action to resolve bottlenecks. Furthermore, decentralized
operations should have strong mechanisms in place to monitor advances, cash requirements, fund
flow arrangements and to implement recommendations provided by external auditors.

47.      Safeguard compliance: The overall safeguard rating for the project is moderately
satisfactory. The project triggered four safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP
4.01), Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.1l), Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12), and
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.50). The project was not considered to have
significant environmental impacts and was categorized as B in accordance with the World Bank’s
Safeguard Policy (OP/BP 4.01). Since specific sites of interventions were not known, an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was prepared to screen sub-projects
before they were implemented.

48.      Environmental and social impacts were adequately addressed in the ESMF. Formal
country consultations were held during the project appraisal (March 22, 2004 – April 4, 2004) at
various regional state capitals and at the national level in Addis Ababa, to discuss details of the
program’s design, screening of sub-projects, environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The
ESMF and the Resettlement Policy Frameworks (RPF) was disclosed before the appraisal in the
Infoshop on February 4, 2004. During implementation, sub-projects were screened and separate
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) and Environmental Management Plans
(EMP) were prepared for those sub-projects with expected negative environmental impacts.
Safeguards implementation was rated as moderately satisfactory (Safeguard rating automatically
reflects the lowest rating of the applicable safeguards) in the ISRs. The main contributing factor
for this rating was the overall implementation of mitigation measures that did not follow a
systematic approach. At the federal level, two Environmental Specialists were assigned to follow
the implementation of safeguard measures all over the country. However, there was no focal
person at the regional level to follow the implementation of mitigation measures on a regular
basis.

49.     Social Safeguards: The Project Management Unit at the Ministry of Water and Energy
and the regional, woreda and town level utilities built adequate capacity to deal with social
safeguards and social development issues through the investments made under the project.
Staffing and training issues were addressed to make sure that specific issues of land acquisition,


                                                        12
e.g., related to compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation etc., were addressed as per the
provisions of the agreed Resettlement Policy Framework for the project. In addition, the project
also made sure that issues such as access to water supply services, inclusion of the disadvantaged
in the sub-projects, and any hurdles identified during project implementation were proactively
addressed. In a few of the sub-projects, the preparation of resettlement action plans was delayed
and had to be acted upon once detected. The project undertook a social safeguards audit to
determine and confirm adherence to requirements of the resettlement policy framework in the
case of four sub-projects. The audit confirmed that outstanding issues, if any, related to
compensation or resettlement were fully addressed.

50.      The project also enlisted the services of the South African Institute of Environmental
Assessment (SAIEA). SAIEA provided a 10 day Training of Trainers session on Environmental
and Social Assessment with a specific focus on the Bank Environmental and Social Safeguards
and how these were to be addressed in practice. This training was well-attended by all the
environmental and social safeguards-related staff, highly valued by all participants and proved to
be an effective turning point in enabling the project functionaries to view environmental and
social safeguards as important areas for attention. Even though there was considerable demand
for this capacity building effort from the participants, it is unfortunate that this training effort
could not be continued beyond the first phase. All in all, it would be fair to say that the project
staff progressively increased their capacity to address the social safeguards as detailed in the
ESIA and the Resettlement Policy Framework.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51.    The project had a significant focus on sustainability. However, as these aspects are a
primary objective of the project, they are discussed more fully in Section 3.2 and Section 4.

52.      The Bank has prepared a follow-up operation – Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene
Project (WaSHP) – that builds on the lessons from this project. The project, approved in March
2014, will finance US$205 million equivalent to provide 2.6 people with improved water supply
and sanitation (1.6 million in rural areas and 1 million in urban areas). In line with its intention to
create a unified sector-wide program, the Government intends to establish a consolidated WaSH
account (a basket fund) for Development Partners (DPs) to pool their resources for the One
WaSH National Program. In the course of implementing the proposed WaSH project, the Bank
will continue to play an active role in this dialogue and support the Government’s effort to align
all funding with the program.

53.      The WaSHP has incorporated many of the lessons on sustainability into the design of
the project. The WaSHP design has taken into consideration various technical, institutional,
economic, and social considerations, building on the experience from WSSP, to improve
sustainability. WaSHP will support the selection of appropriate technologies and includes
comprehensive capacity building efforts to ensure the sustainability of rural and urban water
supply and sanitation services. The project will support the creation of sustainable rural water
supply through efforts such as: (i) involvement of beneficiary communities, including women in
water scheme planning, operation and maintenance (O&M); (ii) capacity building activities,
including training and logistical support such as equipment and vehicles for relevant government
staff to provide post construction support for O&M and monitoring of water schemes; (iii)
support for ensuring sustainable supply chains for critical system elements such as spare parts;
and (iv) developing local private sector capacity to support water supply and sanitation services
by establishing O&M training curricula under local technical Vocational Training Colleges to
train local artisans in relevant skills, and supporting small scale micro-enterprises to operate and


                                                  13
manage public sanitation facilities. Similarly, for urban water supply the project will support
capacity building efforts at government and town water board/utility levels to effectively manage
water supply and sanitation services in a sustainable manner, in line with existing policies,
including: reducing unaccounted for water; improving commercial operations such as billing and
collection; and improving customer services to be able to operate as business entities that will
eventually move towards full cost recovery.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

54.    The project objectives are judged to have remained highly relevant throughout
implementation. The Project Development Objectives, design and implementation all remained a
development priority for the country and for the Bank.

55.      The project remains relevant to the Government of Ethiopia’s development priorities as
demonstrated by its place in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP). GoE has set an
ambitious target of providing 98 percent of the population with improved access to safe water and
100 percent with basic/unimproved sanitation, with 84 percent coverage for improved sanitation
and 77 of people practicing adequate hand washing by 2015. The four Ministries involved in the
sector signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in November 2012 to support to the
integrated One WaSH National Program (OWNP). The One WaSH National Program is the
Government’s main instrument for achieving the GTP’s goals with respect to water supply,
sanitation, and hygiene in rural, urban, and pastoral communities, as well as schools and health
posts, in a more integrated manner to coordinate their activities and reduce transaction costs of
service delivery. WSSP had a significant impact in shaping the policy direction of GoE in the
design of the OWNP and in keeping WSS as a priority in the national development agenda.

56.      The project remains aligned with the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 2012-
2015) for Ethiopia (Report No.71884-ET, August, 2012). The project contributes to the CPS by
giving emphasis to increased access to and improved quality of infrastructure services, including
water supply and sanitation. The project is consistent with the CPS principles, and extends the
Bank’s long-term engagement with the GoE’s water sector to support the country’s effort to move
from projects to a multi-sector programmatic approach in WaSH, for which the Bank has played a
catalytic role.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.      This section addresses the efficacy of achievement of the PDO by assessing the aggregate
of outcomes against end-of-project targets identified in the Results Framework, and from analysis
of the extent to which the project achieved the various elements of the PDO. This section should
be read together with section 4 (Risk to Development Outcomes) as the sustainability of the
project intervention was a key component of the PDO.

58.      The achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDO) is rated moderately
satisfactory as three out of four objectives are considered achieved while one was not achieved.
The PDO statement has four main elements: (i) Increased access to sustainable water supply for
rural users, (ii) Increased access to sustainable water supply for urban users; (iii) Increased access
to sustainable sanitation services for rural and urban users, and (iv) Improved capacity of


                                                 14
stakeholders in the sector. Each of these are discussed as intermediate objectives below, looking
at outcomes and outputs achieved under this part of the PDO; using results against PDO
indicators, other indicators, and outputs. The outcome indicators are summarized in table 4
below. The overall achievement of the PDO is discussed at the end.

59.     Achievement of intermediate objective 1: Increased access to sustainable water supply
for rural users. Outcome indicator: access to improved water supply for 5.2 million people in
rural areas. This intermediate objective was substantially achieved as the project reached 81
percent of the target in this indicator through a nation-wide program in 224 woredas. The rural
program focused on community-led rural water supply programs with most beneficiaries gaining
access to a communal water sources. The outputs of the project were very significant, but have
only partially met the targets. As shown in Annex 2, similar to the outcome achievements, the
outputs have been substantially achieved. The project has built 10,050 rural water supply
schemes in 224 woredas against a revised target of 11,700 schemes in 224 woredas.

60.     Achievement of intermediate objective 2: Increased access to sustainable water supply
for urban users. Outcome indicator: access to improved water supply for 1 million people in
urban areas. This intermediate objective was achieved as 95 percent of the target was reached.
949,473 urban residents have obtained access to improved water supply services from increased
production through “Immediate Service Improvement” interventions as well as through expansion
of water supply systems

61.      On lending to sub-loan towns. During project preparation it was found that the only
credit available to towns for urban WaSH was collateral lending at high rates of interest. It was
found that commercial banks were not prepared to provide loans for water supply infrastructure
on terms that were affordable and consistent with those offered in more developed countries. The
project piloted sub-loan arrangements to six project-beneficiary towns deemed capable of
repaying loans in order to encourage higher rates of cost recovery, and move towns towards self-
financing of WaSH infrastructure. The project strengthened the Water Resources Development
Fund (WRDF) (through sourcing technical assistance form the Development Bank of Southern
Africa), a local financial intermediary that administers funds for the sub-loan towns. The WRDF
identifies, appraises and oversees sub-loans to selected towns and has been scaled up by other
agencies. The sub-loan financed utilities have become pioneers for improved operational
efficiency and higher awareness of financial matters. Over 100 utilities have prepared business

  Subsequent to the Government’s ICR submission, the Project team was informed that the final beneficiary figure for
the urban component had risen to 1.5 million people, i.e., 150 percent of the original target.


                                                         15
plans and applied for on-lending financing from the Federal Government. The on-lending terms
are an interest rate of 3 percent, grace period of 5 years and repayment period of 15-25 years. So
far 8 towns have started to repay their loans to WRDF. The on-lending arrangement has also
facilitated the operational viability of utilities, since they were forced to improve their operational
situations. In sub-loan towns, performance agreements have been signed between the utility and
the town water board with systematic monitoring and evaluation.

62.       Achievement of intermediate objective 3: Increased access to sustainable sanitation
services for rural and urban users. There was no outcome indicator in the original PAD. This
intermediate objective was not achieved; however the following are worth noting: (i) all
households benefiting from improved water supply schemes financed by the project have
received sanitation and hygiene promotion messages to encourage the construction of household
latrines and improved hygiene practices; and (ii) 287,800 people have benefited from improved
institutional latrines (latrines constructed as demonstration latrines in health and education
facilities) against a target of 200,000 (as estimated in DFID’s project completion assessment);
however there is no reliable data on this indicator to make an objective assessment.

63.       Access to sanitation was not used as a PDO indicator due to the way in which the project
contributed to improved sanitation. The PDO is to improve access to water supply and sanitation;
however, the project did not include an indicator on sanitation. This was done as the project itself,
consistent with Government policy, and sector best practice, did not invest in the construction of
sanitation facilities, but rather promoted improved sanitation through the sanitation and hygiene
software activities in order to encourage households to construct their own improved sanitation
facilities. The project viewed the sanitation and hygiene component as integrally linked to the
water supply activities, and thus sanitation awareness was a part of community mobilization and
training. During project implementation, this approach to sanitation was formalized through the
“Community-led Total Sanitation” (CLTS) approach that has been popularized over the past
decade. CLTS was used in combination with individual and household hygiene promotion
focusing on “doable actions” was found to have significant results8 in reducing open defecation
and is being used for the WaSHP follow-up project. The project also constructed institutional and
demonstration latrines as summarized in Annex 2. The project team estimates that at least 80%
of the rural communities benefiting from improved water supply also benefited from improved
hygiene and sanitation promotion.

64.      The component made a significant contribution to hygiene promotion, sanitation
marketing, and the integration of hygiene, sanitation and water; however, this sub-sector was not
adequately monitored and data on sanitation aspects is poor. The program focused on the
promotion of sanitation and hygiene activities for households to construct basic latrines in rural
areas. As a result of the promotion of sanitation and hygiene, a number of households have
constructed basic latrines, some improved, others unimproved, and the coverage has gone up.
The joint implementation of the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project and the EWSP has
contributed to increasing sanitation coverage in the Amahra region. This was scaled up to the
other regions (Oromiya, Tigray and SNNPR) in a number of program woredas. But the sanitation
coverage in pastoral regions (Afar and Somali) has been very low when compared to other
regions and needs special focus going forward. As can be seen from the table in Annex 2,
sanitation for institutions was also below the planned outputs: 39.9 percent of the school latrines
were built and 28.6 percent of the latrines for Health Posts were constructed. However, it should

 As documented in “Scaling-up Rural Sanitation: Learning by Doing: Working at Scale in Ethiopia: Water and
Sanitation Program Working Note July 2011.


                                                       16
also be noted that, consistent with the Government of Ethiopia policy not to subsidize household
latrines, but to encourage households to build their own latrines through sanitation and hygiene
promotion, the project did not have an outcome indicator for sanitation. The Additional
Financing project paper included an outcome indicator for sanitation (as stated in Section 1.3).
Other project documents have not included this indicator, however, and it has therefore been left
out of the ICR.

65.      The sanitation component was further strengthened through support from the Water and
Sanitation Program. WSP focused their support in selected woredas in the four agrarian regions
and followed a systematic approach to trigger changes at the woreda level. A good substantiated
example during the project period is the changes made in Amhara where basic sanitation
coverage was raised from 17 percent at baseline to 46 percent at project close and change in open
defecation from 64 percent at baseline to 40 percent at the close. WSP typically selected about 50
percent of the woredas in the project regions for sanitation and hygiene promotion. After the
Amhara “learning by doing” experience, WSP supported 104 woredas in four regions. Hygiene
promotion was carried out by CFTs assigned to the project villages. WSP provided more
significant woreda-wide support in selected woredas to promote sanitation and hand washing
practices. A critical mass of trained implementers was also created.

66.     Achievement of intermediate objective 4: improved capacity of stakeholders in the rural
WSS sector. Outcome indicator: Effective woreda water and sanitation program established
though project in 230 woredas. This intermediate objective was achieved. The project achieved
97 percent of the targeted woredas, but more importantly, established a new demand-driven
approach to rural water supply in the country that has since been scaled-up by the Government
and other Development Partners. The following outputs are worth noting:

       Establishment of 224 woredas WaSH teams in 224 woredas, with each preparing
        woreda-wide WaSH plans;
       The establishment and deployment of more than 36 Woreda Support Groups (WSG) and
        400 community facilitation teams provided support for woredas to prepare their WaSH
        plan and implement it and for communities to prepare and realize their facility
        management plans;
       The training and deployment of more than 2600 local artisans to execute the various
        construction schemes in all woredas;
       At the community level, 12,000 WaSH Committees (WaSHCOs) were established.
        WaSHCOs manage the provision of water supply to rural communities and participate in
        scheme development and its operation and maintenance. All the WaSH Committees have
        at least 35 percent women and almost all the treasurers of these committees are women;
       The project has further laid the foundation for sector harmonization; its implementation
        model has been adopted by the Government for the formulation of the Universal Access
        Plan (UAP) and WIF.

67.      Achievement of intermediate objective 5: improved capacity of stakeholders in the
urban WSS sector. Outcome indicator: Effective, autonomous water boards established through
project in 50 town/urban areas. This intermediate objective was achieved. The project exceeded
the original targets of establishing town water boards by 144 percent and piloted a new, more
commercial approach to urban water supply and sanitation that has influenced the Government’s
policy on the sector and other Development Partner programs, in particular:




                                               17
       The development of the urban water schemes were done through a stepped approach:
        institutional set-up (Step 1), business plans and capacity building (Step 2) and design,
        construct/rehabilitate WSS schemes (Step 3); 124 towns (87 small towns, 31 medium
        towns and 6 “sub-loan program” towns) completed Steps 1 and 2 and 87 towns started
        Step 3; 58 towns completed Step 3;
       All 124 towns completed WaSH business plans, created Town Water Boards and Town
        Water Utilities. All participating towns water boards were established according to by-
        laws and received training;
       The establishment and deployment of more than 17 town support groups (a team of 4
        individual consultants from different fields of specialization working as one group)
        provided support for program towns in training board members and utility operators,
        prepare business plans, prepare study and deign documents and bid processing and other
        forms of support;
       The urban water supply approach has shifted the sector to more commercially viable
        urban WSS through an expanded revenue base, improved efficiency in billing, reduced
        non-revenue water and support to medium and long-term business planning.

68.      Overall achievement of project beneficiaries, project objectives and impact. The project
reached 82 percent of the target beneficiaries. The project has had a significant impact on the
WaSH sector in Ethiopia. The project benefited 5.1 million people with improved water supply,
created significant capacity in the sector at every level and piloted new and improved approaches
to WaSH delivery in rural and urban areas. As confirmed by the Government and key
Development Partners (such as African Development Bank (AfDB), DFID and others), the
project lead the evolution of the Ethiopian WaSH sector from a supply-driven, under-resourced,
low-performance sector, to a demand-responsive approach with significantly improved
performance. The ICR concludes that this project was transformative in the Ethiopian water
sector with high impact.

69.      The project invested in substantial capacity building throughout the sector. The poor
sector capacity at the start of the project necessitated an innovative, cascaded technical assistance
at all levels that included international consultants to support the national level, involvement of a
large complement of national consultants to support regions and Woreda Support Groups. These
Groups were comprised of four individual consultants with planning and management, water
supply, hygiene and sanitation, and facilitation skills, who went through a rigorous mentoring and
capacity building package, and were encouraged to establish a consultancy firms. The WSGs
support a group of woredas. Town Support Groups (TSGs), similar to the WSGs, were
established through rigorous mentoring and capacity building package to support group of towns.
Community Facilitation Teams (CFTs), like that of the WSGs, are also a team of mid-level
technicians (water supply, hygiene and sanitation, facilitation skills) organized to support
participating communities shuttling from woreda centers. Through an innovative capacity
building arrangement of learning by doing, a tripartite arrangement for technical assistance, and a
stepped and gradual approach for rural and urban water supply and sanitation, the project has
managed to support 224 woredas to prepare and implement woreda-wide WaSH plans. Similarly
in urban areas, a total of 124 small and medium towns received support to prepare their urban
WaSH plans and for 83 of them to construct their systems. The implementation approach was
adopted by AfDB which supported about 120 additional woredas in the country.

70.      The project has been scaled-up by the Government and other Development Partners. A
significant achievement of the project is the extent to which the approaches piloted in both the
rural and urban components have influenced government policy and other Development Partner



                                                 18
programs, and have been scaled up through follow-up projects. The Government has adopted
many of the approaches of the project in its Universal Access Plan (UAP), and is implementing
these approaches in the One WaSH National Program. Many Development Partners, such as
AfDB, DFID and others, have replicated the approaches in other projects and attributed these
approaches to the project.

71.     The stepped approach introduced by the project has been instrumental in shifting the
sector support from a centralized supply-driven approach to a demand-driven approach. It also
contributed to the realization of the Government’s policy of decentralization, promoting the
involvement of all stakeholders in service delivery, enhancing community ownership, improving
the level of cost recovery, and integrating hygiene and sanitation and water supply. The follow-
up project Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Project (WaSHP) provides an opportunity to
scale up the achievements of the previous project, based on a programmatic approach to sector
financing, by improving sectoral planning and coordination across the Government and
increasing funding levels in order to meet GTP targets.

72.     The intermediate outcome indicators show a similar achievement. Of the 17
intermediate outcome indicators, 7 indicators have been met or exceeded revised targets, 7 did not
meet targets and 3 were not able to be measured during the ICR.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

73.     The economic rate of return of the project is calculated at 46.7 percent, well above the
rate calculated at appraisal of 20.6 percent. A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken to assess the
economic returns of the project. The analysis follows the same structure as the analysis
undertaken for project appraisal, with costs and benefits assessed over a 10-year period for rural
water supply systems and over a 15-year period for urban water supply systems. Costs and
benefits are discounted at a rate of 10 percent, a proxy of the opportunity cost of capital in
Ethiopia and the Bank’s typical hurdle rate for water and sanitation projects. The economic
analysis is summarized in Annex 3

74.     This review notes that project benefits are heavily weighted toward the value of time
savings generated by the investments in water systems. The review uses the assumptions made
at appraisal on the average time saved due to improved access to water supply. The review also
notes that the estimate of benefits does not include indirect costs related to health caused by poor



                                                19
water availability and systems, e.g., the cost of time lost to water-borne illness, the cost of time
lost to caring for household members who are sick due to water-borne illnesses. These costs are
likely to be substantial, but have not been estimated here. Finally, the review also notes that the
rural daily labor rate is significantly higher than that assumed during appraisal (30 Birr/day at
completion vs. 7 Birr/day at appraisal). The higher figure has been based on data for local
construction projects. If we assume that that rate is only sporadically available, and that, for
example, the average daily labor rate (i.e., the opportunity cost of time) in rural areas is 15
Birr/day, the IRR for rural investments is calculated to be 8.7 percent, compared with an IRR of
86.5 percent at the full rate of 30 Birr/day.

75.     DFID undertook a Value for Money assessment of the project as part of their Project
Completion Report. The assessment concludes that “despite data gaps, the program was good
Value for Money from the economy, efficiency, effectiveness and cost effectiveness aspects”.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.     The overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory on balance because: (i) the
project’s objective remained highly relevant, and the project’s design and implementation are
relevant, as described above; (ii) the project partially achieved its objective with significant
shortcomings; and (iii) efficiency was substantial.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

77.      The project had significant impacts on gender; however these have not been formally
measured as part of the ICR. The project has supported efforts to empower women to manage
water supply and sanitation services in beneficiary communities by involving women in all stages
of project planning, implementation, and operation and maintenance. The project required
beneficiary communities to comprise a minimum of 35% women and required 3 of the 7 office
bearers in the committee to be women. All treasurers of community committees were women.
While the project’s impacts on gender were not formally monitored as part of regular M&E
activities, it can be reasonably inferred that the project had a positive impact on women in
beneficiary communities, who as is the case in many other countries, have primary responsibility
for collection and management of water supply at the household level. The primary benefit
captured in the economic analysis is the time saving from water being closer to the household.
This has been assumed to be on average 2 hours per day (based on assumption from the PAD).
This disproportionately benefits women and girls who typically have the responsibility for
fetching water. This time saving can be used for increased school attendance and other
productive uses that typically have significant development impacts.

78.     It should be noted that the follow-up project (WaSHP) intends to strengthen
monitoring and evaluation of project impacts on service delivery, disaggregated by gender,
based on a new tool that is being developed and piloted by the Bank with support from the
innovation Fund. The tool would allow the project to monitor at critical times, including at the
baseline, mid-term, and project completion, critical indicators such as services delivered,
distances travelled to collect water, water quality before and after the project.




                                                20
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

79.      The project has had significant impact on longer-term capacity and institutional
development. DFID conducted a robust assessment of the capacity building program supported
under the project (Evaluation of WaSH capacity building interventions in Ethiopia by Evidence
on Demand, April 2013) which shows that the approaches piloted under the project were effective
at building capacity throughout the project. In particular, the approaches focusing on learning by
doing, the stepped approach to capacity building, the tripartite agreement (government, private
sector and users) and the cascaded training approach were found to be successful.

80.      Establishment of national network of urban and rural WSS practitioners. The project
contributed to the professionalization of the urban and rural WSS sectors in Ethiopia through the
establishment of the National Association of Water Utilities and regular meetings of rural WSS
service providers. The rural practitioners workshop brought together more than thirty participants
from all the regions, discussed and identified areas that needed further focus such as supply
chains, operation and maintenance, sustainability, management models and others. Some of these
were addressed in collaborative work (such as “Documentation of Proven Management Models
for Multi- Village Water Schemes”, “Sustainable Hand Pumps” and “Spare Parts Supply
Arrangement for Community-based Water Supply Systems”) between the Bank and Ministry of
Water and are being referred to in the preparation of the next Bank project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

N/a

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

81.     Stakeholders were consulted during the ICR in three activities: (i) the Government ICR
team consulted stakeholders in meetings in Addis Ababa and in a few regions; (ii) the two
consultants hired by the Bank to work on the ICR conducted meetings and field visits9; and (iii)
the ICR mission held a stakeholder workshop under the guidance of the Ministry of Water and
Energy on November 20, 2013 (a summary of the workshop findings is in Annex 6).

82.       Key issues identified during the stakeholder consultation were:
         All implementing agencies appreciated the way the project was designed considering the
          country’s institutional set up and decentralized implementation arrangements. While all
          stakeholders recognized that capacities in the Government were limited, they have
          highlighted that the project has invested substantially in capacity building. However,
          capacity building interventions of the project were affected by high level of staff
          turnover;

  The consultants met with the following institutions: Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy; Ministry of Finance
and Economic Development; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Education; Water Resource Development Fund; Oromiya
Region Water Resource Development Bureau; Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region Water Resources
Bureau; Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region Health Bureau; Southern Nations, Nationalities and
Peoples Region Finance and Economic Development Bureau; Somali Region Water Resource Development Bureau;
Somali Region Health Bureau; Somali Region Education Bureau; Weliso Woreda; Debrelibanos Woreda; Mojo Town;
Tilala Town; Dale Woreda; Sodo Woreda; Yirgalem Town; and Jijiga Town.

           Woredas and towns have indicated that as a result of the project they have been
            introduced to project implementation and gained substantial experience in the whole
            project cycle;
           Consultations at the community level have shown that community structures have been
            established and community representatives have participated in project planning and
            implementation. However, post-construction support and monitoring to communities was
            not adequate;
           The foundations for the integration of water, sanitation and hygiene have been laid in the
            project. However due to the limitations of institutional capacity and awareness and lack
            of effective enabling environment, the project’s overall performance was limited and
            should be improved substantially;
           Urban water supply and sanitation projects have been very challenging to implement
            effectively due to limited capacities in consultancies, contractors, drillers and suppliers in
            the country. Unless these capacity constraints are appropriately addressed, project outputs
            and results will remain difficult to achieve;
           The M&E of the project was systematically implemented, but due to limited capacities
            and low priority by implementing agencies, its effectiveness was not satisfactory;
           According to stakeholders, the main challenges in project implementation were limited
            capacities in government and private sector, and price escalation particularly in drilling;
            and
           The project’s implementation was hampered in its initial period due to limited capacity at
            the implementing agencies and the complexity of the Bank rules.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

83.      The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained over the expected life of the
project is rated as significant10.

84.      The project focused on capacity building in order to improve the sustainability of
schemes. The project has financed the capacity building in 224 woredas and 124 utilities in
planning, implementing, operating and managing water supply services in their respective
localities. The philosophy behind supporting the enhancement of institutional capacities of
woredas and utilities is to ensure the post-construction sustainability. Consequently, an attempt
has been made to verify whether the support has ensured the post-construction sustainability (the
DFID-financed capacity building assessment) which found sustainability to be generally
satisfactory.

85.      Government policy calls for urban water supply systems to operate on a full cost
recovery basis and rural communities to cover ongoing operation and maintenance expenses
so that investments in water supply can be sustainable. To achieve this, the project focused on
designing affordable systems in consultation with communities and based on their willingness
and ability to pay tariffs and user charges, business planning for town water supply, establishment
of appropriate institutional arrangements and capacity building for those involved in governance,
operations and financial management, and monitoring and evaluation.



10
     This indicator is rated on a four-point scale: (i) negligible; (ii) moderate; (iii) significant; and (iv) high.




                                                                22
86.      The project made significant efforts to ensure sustainability of rural WaSH schemes
through participatory processes, low cost technologies and local ownership. Key elements of
rural sustainability include: (i) proper planning and allocation of sufficient resources at the
woreda level; (ii) involvement of stakeholders in decisions relating to design to instill a feeling of
ownership and to ensure the system installed is affordable and one that users are willing and able
to support over time; (iii) affordable technology; (iv) proper institutional arrangements at the
community level and systems in place for maintaining the WaSH scheme, collecting user fees and
accounting for funds; and (v) availability of affordable spare parts a reasonable distance from the
community. The availability spare parts – and the supply chains necessary to ensure their
availability – are an important design issue in the WaSHP project in order to improve the
sustainability of rural WSS schemes. The project facilitated establishment of appropriate
mechanisms to ensure regular fee collection that will cover operation and maintenance costs.
WaSHCOs regularly collect fees on different modalities. In order to ensure the sustainability of
the system, WaSHCOs should be continuously supported by woredas. The project supported the
cost sharing arrangement by facilitating the contribution of at least 10 percent of the cost of the
system. The form of cost sharing varied depending upon the technology option selected. The
project has also attempted to facilitate development of the private sector through studies and
training of artisans to provide spare parts and maintenance support to communities. However,
establishment of sustainable supply chain requires a longer period than the project life.

87.     The sustainability of rural schemes is likely to be above the national average. The
sustainability of the rural water supply schemes depends in a large part on the capacity of the
woreda to operate and maintain the schemes, and the ability to maintain this capacity. For rural
water supply facilities the main criteria for post-construction sustainability is the condition of the
schemes; that is whether the schemes are functional or not. According to the National WaSH
Inventory of 2011, the functionality rate of the 224 Bank-supported woredas schemes was 76
percent based on a 50 percent sampling of 112 woredas. Since the project was operating in
limited areas (villages) of the woreda, the actual functionality rate for the project financed
schemes should be higher. Further, more updated figures would definitely give a better picture
due to a higher share of project-financed schemes. Additional comparison of sustainability based
on the availability of WaSHCOs (community management structures) and financial contribution
of beneficiary communities could have provided a more complete picture of post-construction
sustainability. However, due to limited information this has not been verified.

88.      The project promoted the sustainability of urban WaSH schemes through the creation
of commercially viable town water utilities. The government policy for urban WSS calls for full
cost recovery tariffs. The project supported implementation of this policy by strengthening the
financial viability of water supply utilities, providing grants and loans for development of urban
water supply systems, designed to reflect customers’ willingness and ability to pay. Urban WaSH
sustainability was promoted through: (i) proper planning carried out with stakeholder
involvement, including the city administration, the Town Water Board or Committee and
customers; (ii) affordable design, which takes into account technical, environmental, social,
economic and financial considerations; (iii) tariffs sufficient to cover operation and maintenance
expenses, renewal and replacement of assets and expansion of the system as needed; (iv) proper
institutional arrangements, including a Town Water Board or Committee responsible for
governance and planning, a qualified operator with a performance agreement which sets out
service targets, monitoring arrangements and provides autonomy, appropriate incentives and
arrangements for obtaining professional support for tasks beyond the capacity of utility
management and staff.



                                                 23
89.     The project has improved the sustainability of urban WSS schemes. The sustainability
of urban systems depends on the financial viability of the town water utilities. The sustainability
of urban water supply services is dependent on the institutional arrangement, staffing capacity,
financial viability and available facilities. Based on the National WaSH Inventory, all 124 town
water utilities in the project have been organized with a functioning utility and oversight board. In
addition, operational cost recovery tariffs have been introduced at all 124 utilities, of which 18
have full cost recovery tariff and 2 have partial cost recovery tariffs (50 percent and 33 percent
respectively). Out of the six sub-loan towns, three of the town water utilities have full cost
recovery tariffs.

90.      The project has contributed to government policy on improving the sustainability of
WSS services. The project has supported policy and planning instruments in the WASH sector,
including a performance-based stepped approach in planning and business planning in urban
water utilities and Woreda Strategic WaSH Plan, Woreda WaSH Team and support groups for
woredas and utilities. These interventions and government policy moving towards urban and
operational full cost recovery and decentralized community support will eventually lead to higher
post-construction sustainability of WaSH services. Further, the project has contributed to the
Government’s thinking on rural WSS sustainability. The project has highlighted an important
policy debate within GoE on the role of local governments (woredas) versus the role of
communities in ensuring rural WSS schemes are sustainable. The rural water project supported
by the Finnish Government demonstrated that community-based approaches may have an even
greater level of sustainability. It is generally accepted, however, that this level of support is not
scalable throughout the country. WSSP was the first project to focus squarely on woreda-based
delivery of services and have given the Government a rich sense of the trade-offs between
woreda- and community-based delivery.

91.      In 2009, the Bank conducted an assessment of eight rural WSS financing modalities in
Ethiopia (World Bank, 2009). The assessment included the Bank-financed WSSP, UNICEF’s
WaSH program, the Finland-supported CDF, NGOs, regional block grants, woreda block grants,
the Food Security Program, and the Productive Safety Nets Program. The assessment found that
the Bank project was successful at building local capacity, particularly at the woreda level. It
recommended, however, that future externally-financed projects channel financing for rural WSS
directly through the government system while maintaining complementary externally-supported
capacity building initiatives that are government-led. Some of these recommendations are being
considered under the Government’s One WaSH program.

92.       Despite the laudable attempt the project made to improve sustainability, the ICR rates
the risk to development outcomes as significant. This is largely due to the nature of rural water
supply projects that rely on community and local government management, and the immaturity of
the new urban water utilities. The ICR assesses that the project had an adequate focus on
sustainability, and the sustainability is likely to be higher than the national average; however,
given the nature of these types of new institutions to operate and maintain the schemes, the risk is
still significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                                 24
93.      Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory as,
despite significant preparation efforts, there were shortcoming in identification, preparation
and appraisal. The project was fully aligned with the development priorities of the Government
and the prioritization of the Bank. The project was well prepared and drew on lessons from
international best practice to improve the sustainability of rural and urban WSS. The project
addressed a significant capacity constraint in Ethiopia at the time through an ambitious capacity
building component. The Bank conducted extensive preparation studies that assisted in the
project design and helped build capacity throughout the sector. However, as identified in the
QALP assessment, quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory due to shortcomings in the
project design, and therefore the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is also rated as
moderately satisfactory. The project was adequately financed, took three years to prepare which
is longer than the corporate guidance on project preparation and was fully staffed with all
adequate skills represented in the team.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

94.     Bank supervision was commendable in supporting the Government achieve the
significant results in the project but it had shortcomings which affected the project’s outcomes.
The project was large, complex and ambitious, and the achievement of significant results most
particularly, providing 5.2 million people with adequate water supply was due in large part to the
continued efforts of the Bank team. This point was further confirmed by the Government,
Implementing Agencies and Development Partners to the ICR review team and is captured in the
Government’s ICR. Bank supervision benefited from continuity of its members, significant local
knowledge and experience in the sector. Supervision was undertaken in a timely manner and
with full representation of all implementation aspects procurement, financial management,
safeguards and all technical aspects of implementation.

95.      A significant implementation shortcoming was in not restructuring the project to
formalize the changes in the Results Framework. At the time the MDTF was processed in 2008,
Bank policy did not require a restructuring; however, during the processing of the Additional
Financing in 2010, all project financing should have been captured in the Project Paper and a
revised Results Framework should have reflected the full project. As this was not done, it has
been difficult of the ICR to fully capture project achievements. However, the Bank team engaged
intensively with the financiers of the MDTF throughout project implementation and participated
in all annual performance review where the targets and achievements have been evaluated
reviewed and updated. It should be noted that the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
assessed the Bank’s quality of supervision as Moderately Unsatisfactory in 2008 due to (i) poor
candor and realism in ISR ratings, (ii) inadequate supervision of safeguards (particularly social
safeguards) and (iii) inadequate supervision of financial management aspects. The Quality of
Lending Portfolio for the project in 2008 noted a number of implementation challenges, including
weaknesses in safeguards, monitoring, procurement and coordination and recommended remedial
measures. The ICR assessment is that significant improvements were made in all three of these
aspects and more importantly, the significant achievements of the project both in terms of
physical improvement and in contributing to the government’s strategic direction witness the
level of effort and the overall quality of supervision is consistent with a moderately satisfactory
rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                                25
73.    The overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory as both quality at entry
and quality of supervision are rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.      The Government’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory as there were some
shortcomings during implementation. The project was high in the country’s development
priorities and the Government showed commitment to achieving the development objectives.
The Government implemented all measures agreed during preparation, adequately staffed the
Project Implementation Unit and adequately consulted all stakeholders throughout the project.
However, implementation was negatively impacted from poor coordination among the key
Government Ministries responsible for water and sanitation Water, Education, Health and
Finance which resulted in delays and, at times, lack of attention to implementation. In addition,
the Government did not adequately monitor implementation.

97.      Government commitment and support to the project was at times inconsistent. The
Government’s commitment during the preparation of the project and in the initial stages of
implementation was very encouraging. Expressed in terms of monetary contribution, initial
government commitment was about US$16 million (of the initial US$116 million). Though there
were initial attempts particularly at the woreda level to make monetary contributions, this was not
fully met. Although not directly related to the performance on the project, it should be noted that
the Government has made an effort to lead various sector-related activities in the past few years
since the project become effective. These include preparation of the National Sanitation Strategy
and Protocol, organizing of bi-annual Joint Sector Review and annual Multi-Stakeholder fora,
putting in place a national WaSH coordination structure, signing Memorandum of Understanding
between the WaSH sector ministries, and leading the preparation of the WaSH Implementation
Framework.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.    Implementing Agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory as there were
shortcomings in the implementation of the project. Implementing agency performance can be
viewed in different periods during the project implementation.
            November 2004 to May 2007: Implementation of the project lagged during the first
             period. The period is characterized by SOE-based disbursement, fund flow through
             Channel 2 (Ministry of Water and Energy Regional Bureau of Water and Energy
             Woreda WaSH team). As the start of the project and in line with the Development
             Financing Agreement, the period also required sample National Competitive
             Bidding (NCB) documents to be reviewed by the Bank while all international
             competitive bidding (ICB) documents were prior-reviewed. The tripartite
             arrangement with regard to the support system (particularly WSGs, TSGs and CFTs),
             though innovative in its design and objective, took some time to establish the system.
             The combination of these factors resulted in delays in procurement and
             disbursement. Only one sector implementing agency was observed during this
             period and the performance can be considered moderately satisfactory;
            May 2007 to May 2010: During this period, the project underwent major changes.
             The mid-term review (May 2007) helped the project shift to a more programmatic


                                                26
             approach. The main changes were: (i) shift in fund flow ; (ii) introduction of new
             implementing agencies, including the Ministry of Education (MoE) and Ministry of
             Health (MoH), as well as their respective bureaus at the regional level, and the
             active role played by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED)
             in fund management; (iii) establishment and institutionalization of the national
             WaSH coordination structure; (iv) delegation of most procurement activities to the
             four major regional water bureaus, highly reducing procurement document
             submission to the Bank. This period is a time that has eased most of the
             implementation issues, particularly as relate to the Ministry of Water and Energy,
             Regional Bureau of Water and Woreda WaSH teams. Though the new implementing
             agencies (MoE, MoH, and their respective bureaus), and the functionality of the
             entire WaSH coordination structure (though there are regional differences) posed
             real challenges, there was a big improvement with the completion of most of the
             rural water supply schemes as well as initiation of urban water structures.; and
            May 2010 – October 10, 2013: This period continued with the same implementing
             agencies as well as MoFED’s active role, and the project underwent another
             extension of the closing date (March 30 2013 - October 10, 2013). The period has
             observed maximum effort particularly from Regional Water Bureaus, woredas and
             towns to come to closure on works contracts and close the project. Despite some
             general constraints for the sector (limited drilling capacity, delivery and installation
             of electromechanical equipment, delivery of fittings, power connection to the
             electrical grid), implementation improved significantly over the course of
             implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.     Overall Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory based on the ratings for
each of the two dimensions.

6. Lessons Learned

100.    Lesson 1: Local governments are best placed to take rural WaSH to scale in an under-
serviced decentralized country such as Ethiopia. While community-based approaches have
proved successful in improving the sustainability of rural WaSH systems (e.g., the Community-
led Accelerated WaSH Program supported by the Finnish Government), local governments
(woredas) are needed to take rural WaSH to scale. This is not to say that communities should not
be engaged during implementation or operation, but that implementation should focus squarely
on developing the capacity of local government to implement and operate schemes to allocate
scarce government resources and build local government capacity for sustainability.

101.    Lesson 2: The capacity building approach of the project could be replicated in other
large projects of this nature. The project piloted a new approach to capacity building; especially
the master Training of Trainers conducted with selected regional water professionals. The
training focuses on learning by doing, as has been used in Amhara, the stepped approach to
capacity building, the tripartite agreement (government, private sector and users) and the
cascaded training approach. As demonstrated in the DFID-funded assessment, this approach was
successful in building capacity across the board and could be a useful approach in other large
WSS projects. The use of standard implementation manuals and guidelines was also effective in
managing key operational processes in the decentralized environment.



                                                27
102.    Lesson 3: When a project requires significant capacity building (such as this one), this
takes time, and implementation and disbursement schedules need to be adjusted to be realistic.
The project rightly focused on capacity development as a key activity in order to implement a
decentralized approach and improve future sustainability of the water and sanitation services.
However, the disbursement schedule estimates a more typical investment lending profile. The
team should have been more realistic in the implementation and disbursement estimate or
consider alternative financing schemes to first build capacity and later scale up investment.

103.    Lesson 4: Projects should be more systematic in assessing the likely sustainability of
rural and urban WSS. The project did not systematically assess the sustainability of the projects
under implementation. More effort could be made to develop indicators of sustainability
throughout project implementation which can be used to assess the likelihood of sustainability,
and implement remedial actions if needed. The WaSHP (follow-up project) includes an indicator
on the functionality of the rural schemes as a proxy for sustainability.

104.    Lesson 5: A just-in-time monitoring approach is necessary to maximize learning and
make timely course corrections during implementation: In order to learn from implementation
systematically, it is necessary to have robust feedback loops during in project implementation.
This project missed an opportunity to improve implementation through regular, focused project
monitoring, which is essential in developing a programmatic approach.

105.   Lesson 6: Establishing viable urban water utilities takes time. The project piloted more
commercial approaches to urban water supply and sanitation through the establishment of Urban
Water Utilities. However, none of these new utilities are recovering their costs and all need a lot
of support to be become commercially viable. Future urban utility projects may consider
intermediate targets to demonstrate commercial viability.

106.    Lesson 7: Criteria for grant and loan financing for urban WaSH should be made
clearer. The project successfully piloted the establishment of an urban sub-loan facility under the
Water Resources Development Fund. The Fund has been scaled up through other financing,
though as yet, no towns have repaid their loans. The Government should commission a separate
study on the performance of the sub-loans and determine whether towns are likely to honor their
repayment obligations. In other countries, grants have been used for rehabilitation, and loans
used for expansion, due to the commercial viability of activities to expand utilities’ revenue base.
This may be considered in Ethiopia in future operations.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

107.  The Government has prepared and submitted a detailed completion report for the project
a summary of which is attached to this ICR as Annex 7.

(b) Co-financiers

108.     A summary of DFID’s Project Completion Review on the Ethiopia Water Supply and
Sanitation Project (WSSP) is included in Annex 8. The evaluation was based on two scores, i.e.,
achievement of the outputs and outcomes, and looked at output scoring for each component of the
project, results of value for money, as well as the associated risks. In a scale that ranges from A++
to C, the former being of outputs and outcomes substantially exceeding expectation, and the latter
substantially not meeting expectations, DFID has evaluated WSSP outputs as A and the overall
outcomes as B.

109.    Out of SDR 119.2 million original allocation from all IDA sources (IDA 3901-ET, IDA
H085-ET and IDA 4713-ET) SDR 8.28 million was canceled from the project and reallocated in
responses to international crises. Out of the revised allocation of SDR 110.9 million, SDR 107.8
million was disbursed which is 97% of the revised allocation.

110.    Out of GBP 70 million originally allocated from DFID for the MDTF, GPB 4 million was
reallocated to other sectors. The remaining GBP 66 million (equivalent to US$106,788,427) was
subsequently transferred to the MDTF account in seven tranches and fully disbursed to
implementing agencies.

Component 1: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation

112.    Rural Water Supply: The original plan of the project was to construct 11,700 rural
community water points, 5,500 from the IDA funds and 6,200 from the MDTF. The project
implemented a demand responsive approach where participating woredas commenced
implementation by preparing a woreda rural water supply and sanitation plan. The rural water
supply schemes included different types of rural water supply technologies such as deep wells,
shallow wells, hand-dug wells, spring capture, rural piped schemes (with a spring source and with
a borehole source), river diversion with treatment, rainwater harvesting, and other technologies.
A total of 10,050 schemes were constructed, benefiting a total of 4,208,542 people, meeting 86
percent of the original target of 5.2 million beneficiaries. Table 1 below shows the details of the
outputs achieved under this component, as compared to what was originally planned.

113.     Sanitation and hygiene promotion: All households benefiting from new water supply
schemes financed by the project received sanitation and hygiene promotion under the project. As
a result of the intervention, most of the households receiving these messages have constructed
simple basic latrine. In addition, the project financed the construction of institutional latrines,
mainly at schools and health posts. According to the 2003 EFY annual report from the Ministry
of Water, Irrigation and Energy, about 391 institutional latrines (286 VIP for schools and 105 VIP
and placenta latrines for health posts) were constructed, more than 99 percent of which were
constructed in the Oromia, Amhara and Tigray regions. In 2004, 279 institutional latrines (160
for schools and 119 for health posts) were reported constructed in Amhara, Oromia, Tigray and
SNNPR). The overall plan for this period (2003-2004) was the construction of about 1900
latrines (1117 for the schools and 783 for health posts) of which only 660 were constructed. The
performance was very low and in general, of the total planned for the last five years, only 35
percent were reported to be accomplished. Although a number of institutional latrines were
constructed, in most of the program woredas reporting on total numbers was a challenge.
Various factors that affected the outputs of sanitation and hygiene of the project include weak
coordination among the three sector ministries (Water, Health and Education) at all levels, weak
monitoring systems, and poor ownership from the Ministry of Health.

114.     Capacity building of rural WSS: The program invested a lot in capacity building of
woreda staff and communities and stakeholders at different levels to realize the Government's
policies to decentralize resource management to the lowest level by promoting the involvement of
all stakeholders in service delivery. The capacity building part of this component emphasized
providing support for woredas to prepare and implement their WaSH plan. To implement these
plans, international consultants trained national consultants and then the trainings were cascaded
down to 35 Woreda Support Groups (WSG), 1,200 Community Facilitation Teams (CFTs), and
2130 Local Service Providers (LSP) in the project woreda’s community. In this process different
manuals and procedures were prepared and distributed for relevant sector stakeholders.
Communities have contributed about 5 percent in cash and 5 percent in kind, ensuring community
ownership. In addition, training has strengthened the WaSHCOs capacity to manage the operation
and maintenance of their schemes and have made financial contributions. In most cases, 50
percent of the WaSHCO members are woman, but their role is limited when it comes to decision-
making.

115.      The capacity building arrangement has helped establish more than 224 Woreda WaSH
Teams in 224 woredas that prepared and executed woreda-wide WaSH plans. The establishment
and deployment of the 35 WSGs and 1200 CFTs provided much-needed support for woredas to
prepare and implement their WaSH plan and for communities to prepare and realize their WaSH
facilities management plans. In addition, the capacity building involved provision of office
equipment, such as computers, printers, office furniture, hand-dug well construction equipment,
water quality test kits, and motor cycles for most of the program woredas. The capacity building
at the community level was supported by a number of community facilitation teams each
consisting of three members (technical, sanitation and hygiene and social expert) and supporting
three to five communities.

Component 2: Urban Water Supply and Sanitation

116.     The objectives of this component were: (i) to increase the capacity of participating cities’
and towns’ water boards, committees and operators to effectively manage their water supply and
sanitation facilities; and (ii) to ensure that well-functioning and properly utilized urban water
supply systems and improved sanitation are in place in project towns and cities. A total of 124
towns (87 small, 31 medium, and 6 sub-loan program towns) have received capacity building
assistance under the project, of which 97 have performed Immediate Service Improvement (ISI).
Of these, 85 towns have graduated to Step 3 to secure project financing for rehabilitation and


                                                    34
expansion works. Rehabilitation and expansion works for 58 towns have been completed and
started providing access to improved water supply services for about 949,473 urban residents.
The construction in the remaining 27 towns is at an advanced stage of implementation, with
installation of electromechanical equipment and connection to the national power grid are some
of the activities remaining to be completed. With regard to urban sanitation, intervention was
limited to preparation of integrated sanitation plans and construction of a few public and
communal latrines. This has not been uniformly implemented in all regions. In almost all the
program towns in SNNPR and Tigray regions, a number of public latrines were constructed,
while in the case of other regions, public latrines or communal latrines were constructed only in
few of the towns.

117.     Capacity building for Urban Water Supply and Sanitation: 20 Town Support Groups
(TSG) were established to provide assistance to small towns to establish and strengthen board and
utility staff and to prepare feasibility studies and preliminary designs. The same assistance for
large towns was provided by the national consultants. Town Water Boards were established and
strengthened and business plans were developed in all the towns. The capacity of the boards has
improved to oversee the utilities. However due to high turnover and lack of autonomy of the
board, in most of the utilities, the board’s function is limited. In addition, the expected outputs of
these components, such as an autonomous board, merit appointments of utility managers, hiring
appropriate technical, financial, customer managers and other staff, was not fully realized in all
the towns. Moreover, even though the tariff has been revised in most of the towns to cover
operation, maintenance and replacement costs, the revised tariffed was often not implemented.
The major problems in the capacity building components of the project are frequent turnover of
board members, utility manager and key staff.

118.    A number of training manuals (Operation, Procurement, Billing, and Management
Guidelines) were produced to be used in implementing the urban water supply. However the
manuals were hardly used by the utilities and no evaluation was done on their appropriateness
and use. Thus, the capacities of most of the utilities are still weak and need additional intervention
to bring the desired changes. Intervention such as improving billing systems, reducing of non-
revenue, recruiting and training of key qualified staff, improving tariff and provision of
equipment for leak detection are areas where utilities need further technical support.

119.     In the case of urban water supply, hygiene promotion was not included as part of the
Urban Water Supply and Sanitation component and no capacity building activities were including
related to urban sanitation.

Component 3: Project Support

120.     The objectives of this component were: (i) improved system for monitoring water supply
and sanitation works; and (ii) trained staff and consultants at the federal and regional level to
manage and monitor implementation of water supply and sanitation interventions. A number of
capacity building trainings and on-the-job training for monitoring and reporting have been
undertaken for staff at the federal, regional, and woreda levels of different implementing agencies.
This includes staff of the Ministry of Water and Energy (MoWE), MoH, and WRDF at the federal
level and staff of regional water, health and the respective woreda offices. The project support
component has suffered from high turnover of consultants and staff, lack of proper handover
mechanisms, lack of coordination among the signatory ministries, low coordination of WaSH
structure at all levels and lack of follow up for the capacity building interventions. These are
some of the factors that made it difficult to sustain built project capacity. Using a cascaded
training approach, the following number of entities received some level of training:
      9 regional WaSH steering committees (orientations only) and 9 regional WaSH teams
      224 woreda councils and WaSH teams
      87 small town and 31 medium-size town water boards and utilities, in total 236 entities
      9,060 WaSHCOs, with one WaSHCO for each water supply facility (this figure is as of
         October 2012 and assumes all WaSHCOs have received training, also after the contracts
         of the CFTs and WSGs expired)
      Health Extension Workers (HEWs) in some rural kebeles, but it is not known how many.

Annex 3. Economic Analysis

A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken to assess the economic returns of the project. The analysis
follows the same structure as the analysis undertaken for project appraisal, with costs and benefits
assessed over a 10-year period for rural water supply systems and over a 15-year period for urban
water supply systems. Costs and benefits are discounted at a rate of 10 percent, a proxy of the
opportunity cost of capital in Ethiopia and the Bank’s typical hurdle rate for water and sanitation
projects.

     1. Economic evaluation methodology: Cost-Benefit Analysis

A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken to estimate the project’s net present value and the rate of
return on the investment. The project is estimated to have provided improved water supply and
sanitation services to approximately 5.2 million people, of which 4.2 million are in rural areas,
with about 10,050 water supply schemes in 224 woredas. Approximately 949,500 people in urban
areas benefited from improved water supply systems in 124 towns, a number which is expected to
grow over the next decade to approximately 1.35 million people.

Costs include all project investment costs as well as annual maintenance costs estimated at 5
percent of the investment costs.11 Estimated benefits accrue from: (i) time savings from reduction
in time spent fetching water; and (ii) reduced direct health costs due to increased availability of
safe water and sanitation facilities and increased knowledge of good sanitation and hygiene
practices.



11
   Because operating costs are normally covered by tariffs paid by beneficiaries, they are not usually
included as a cost in economic analyses. However, because tariffs and fees for water services have not been
finalized for all the water systems targeted under the project, the analysis has included them as an
additional cost.

Based on the above assumptions, the economic rate of return (ERR) for the project as a whole is
calculated to be 46.7 percent. At a discount rate of 10 percent, the net present value (NPV) is
calculated to be US$79.4 million.

Evaluating the investments only to urban systems, the ERR is calculated to be 9.4 percent. At
the discount rate of 10 percent, the NPV is calculated to be negative US$1.66 million.

Evaluating the investments in rural systems, the ERR is calculated to be 86.5 percent, while the
NPV is calculated to be US$ 81.0 million.

A summary of the project’s discounted (at a 10 percent opportunity cost of capital) costs and
benefits and its ERRs and discounted NPVs, separated into the urban and rural components, is
provided below.

The significantly lower returns generated by the investments in urban systems relative to returns
to rural systems result from:

(i)      Higher per-capita investment and O&M costs in urban systems (US$ 50/beneficiary in
rural systems vs. US$121/beneficiary for urban systems);
(ii)    lower relative time savings generated from improved water supply (rural households
reduce their time spent fetching water by 2 hours per day, while urban households reduce their
time spent fetching water by 1 hour per day); and
(iii)    A lower value applied to those time savings in urban areas than in rural areas (a daily
labor rate of 30 Birr is assumed for rural areas, which is the equivalent of a wage of 600 Birr per
month; in urban areas, the minimum wage of 420 Birr/month is assumed).

This review notes that project benefits are heavily weighted toward the value of time savings
generated by the investments in water systems. The relative contributions of time savings vs.
direct health costs saved is presented below. Note that these figures are discounted at 10 percent.

The review also notes that the estimate of benefits does not include indirect costs related to health
caused by poor water availability and systems, e.g., the cost of time lost to water-borne illness or
to caring for household members who are sick due to water-borne illnesses. These costs are likely
to be substantial, but have not been estimated here.

Finally, the review also notes that the rural daily labor rate is significantly higher than that
assumed during appraisal (30 Birr/day at completion vs. 7 Birr/day at appraisal). The higher
figure has been based on data for local construction projects. If we assume that that rate is only
sporadically available, and that, for example, the average daily labor rate (i.e., the opportunity
cost of time) in rural areas is 15 Birr/day, the IRR for rural investments is calculated to be 8.7
percent, compared with an IRR of 86.5 percent at the full rate of 30 Birr/day.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

An ICR stakeholder workshop was carried out on November 20, 2013 at the Ministry of Water
and Energy, Addis Ababa. The minutes of the meeting are below.

Introduction & Background

1.       A World Bank team lead by Michael John Webster conducted an ICR mission for the
Water Supply and Sanitation Project (WSSP) (P076735) from November 12-22, 2013. As part of
the ICR mission, a half day stakeholders’ workshop was conducted at Ministry of Water,
Irrigation and Energy (MoWE) on November 20, 2013. The workshop was chaired by Ato
Nuredin Mohammed, Acting Director for Water Supply and Sanitation Directorate Ministry of
Water, Irrigation and Energy and attended by staff from the ministry, the project office and World
Bank including the Louise F. Scura (Sector Leader, AFTSN). (List of participants is attached to
this memo).

2.        The workshop commenced with a round of participant introductions. While MoWE is
still in the process of deploying two local consultants to conduct the ICR, the World Bank has
already deployed two local consultants who have visited three regions and collected data for the
ICR. However, MoWE has prepared and presented an end project report showing the background,
cumulative achievements, challenges and lessons of the project. Four separate presentations were
made in the areas of physical implementation, financial performance, procurement and safeguards.
Following MoWE’s presentation, the Bank team presented its early findings of the ICR mission.

3.      The ICR mission early findings in terms of project achievements, major challenges and
lessons learned are consistent with the government presentations and the issues raised during the
discussion. The participants stated that such kinds of workshop are very important to exchange
ideas and factor in lessons in the design of future projects. However, more time should be
allocated and participants should include the regional actors. The following section highlights the
major areas presented at the workshop in terms of major achievements and areas of improvement
(major challenges).

Major achievements

4.      Implementation was initially slow and focused on capacity building activities. About 98
percent of the resource allocated was disbursed to implementing agencies at each level. Only
about US$ 4.7 million remains undisbursed. The results framework completed by the ministry
shows that the project has achieved its results in almost all the indicators.

5.      Rural WS: Cumulatively, 10,050 rural water supply schemes have been constructed in
224 woredas of all regions providing access to improved water supply for nearly 4.2 million rural
people. Due to the project, the Woreda WaSH Team (WWT) and Strategic Woreda WaSH plan
have become the basis for RWSS intervention, WaSHCOs were established and trained to
manage rural water supply schemes, woreda support groups and community facilitation teams
have been recruited and trained to support the WWT and the WaSHCOs, respectively. However
sustainability of the service and the support system is identified as a major challenge to be
addressed in future interventions.

6.      Urban WS: Of 124 towns, 85 towns (including 6 sub-loan towns) were promoted to
Step 3 (expansion of waters supply systems), of which 61 towns (including 3 sub-loan) have
fully completed their system expansion benefiting about 950 thousands urban residents. The


                                                43
remaining towns (except Jijiga) have completed over 90 percent of their WS system expansion.
Town Water Boards have been established and strengthened as an autonomous body to oversee
the town water utilities, and the business plan has become the basis for urban water supply
interventions.

7.       Program management: The project has established program management structures at
all levels of the program implementation. The PMU has been institutionalized at federal, regional
and woreda levels, PMU capacities have been strengthened through deployment of national,
regional and woreda/town consultants, and manuals and guidelines have been developed and
distributed;

Major Challenges

8.       Capacity Limitation: Critical implementation capacity limitations, both on the supply
and the demand side, are raised by the participants as major areas that need to be addressed in the
design of future projects. Major areas raised in the meeting include: (i) Very limited capacity of
consultants, suppliers, and drillers, resulting in failure to commence and complete contracted
activities in a timely manner, as per their contract agreement; (ii) Poor quality of study, design
and tender documents which leads to re-design, re-tendering and also high variation in price and
created complex contract management issues; and (iii) Limited contract administration capacity
has constrained PMU’s ability to properly follow up on contractual matters and take appropriate
actions in accordance to the contract agreements. As a result, adherence to contractual obligation
is loose, cost and time overrun is common and sometimes quality compromise is observed; (iv)
Very high staff turnover has undermined capacity building efforts and affected implementation
progress; and (v) In most program towns, water boards and utilities are not strong enough to
assist and follow up project implementation and to properly manage their new systems.

9.      M&E/Reporting: The ICR team emphasized that while financial performance is
properly reported by category of expenditure, as stated in the financing agreement, utilization of
resource by project component and the physical and financial report on hygiene and sanitation are
not clearly reported. This is an area which needs to be properly improved in future intervention.
Participants also show their agreement on the need to strengthen reporting, data collection and
management in the sector. During the discussion participants raised that vertical reporting (from
community upward to woredas, zones, regions and federal) and horizontal reporting among major
WaSH ministries and regional bureaus at regional and federal level are not strong and need
strengthening in the future. In addition, the culture of proper documentation and information
sharing among major stakeholders at each administrative level is not well developed. It is an area
that needs to be properly considered in future intervention.

10.      Weak Integration: Integration of the hygiene and sanitation component into the water
supply was found very difficult as coordination among the WaSH sectors – education, health,
water and finance – has become difficult. Actions of WaSH sector ministries and bureaus have
failed to demonstrate their commitment beyond signing the MOU. There is no enforcing
mechanism to ensure adherence to the principles of the MOU and delivery of shared and specific
institutional responsibilities among parties to the MOU.

11.     Sustainability: Sustainability of operational scheme is raised by both the ICR
consultants and the participants as a major challenge with significant implications beyond the
current project. Strengthening and establishing effective post-construction support, supply chain,
rural scheme management system, and O&M systems are areas highlighted for consideration in
future interventions to improve sustainability of rural water supply schemes. In terms of urban


                                                44
utilities, promotion and emphasis on strengthening utilities’ operational efficiency and cost
recovery mechanisms are highlighted as remedial actions to be considered in urban areas.

12.      Hygiene and Sanitation: While there is significant improvement in the implementation
of hygiene and sanitation, lack of regular reporting on the physical activities, as well as on fund
utilized by education and health sectors, is raised as a concern. It was expected that the MoH and
MoE were to report on the progress of hygiene and sanitation progress through the National
WaSH Coordination Office. However due to the weak integration, this is not happening. In
addition, the woredas produce a general health sector progress report; hence it is difficult to pull
out WaSH-related sanitation and hygiene activities financed by the project.

13.       Safeguards: It was stated that while the MoWE has good experience in preparing
safeguards instruments and screening sub-projects to identify environmental and social impacts,
its institutional capacity for the implementation of mitigation measures is limited. As a result,
some town water supply projects have started implementation without undergoing through proper
safeguard procedures. However, where Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) are involved, the post-
audit has shown that they have been done under the government policy which has clear guidelines
for properly addressing this issue. Proper documentation is also one of the gaps identified both
for rural as well as for urban areas.

14.      Contents of the ICR: Participants raised concerns that the ICR presentation missed some
major factors affecting implementation, strategic approaches adopted and their evaluation, and
their performance, weaknesses and recommendations. However, it was stated that the ICR is at its
early stage and what was presented at the workshop are the major areas where the ICR team
needs participant discussion and feedback.

Way forward

15.      It was stated that the major issues raised have to be properly documented and considered
in the design and preparation of future projects. In particular, the team preparing the follow-on
project (WaSH II), which is currently under preparation, has to take seriously the lessons learned
from the ICR and ensure that these lessons are properly considered and addressed.

16.     As a way forward, the ICR consultants stated that the ICR is an exercise to be completed
by both the Government and the Bank within six months of the project closing date. The
Government ICR is a very important ingredient in the Banks’ ICR and needs to be completed
within the short period of time. Unless completed by the end of December or mid-January, it will
not serve its purpose. The MoWE has agreed to use either its own force or deploy the consultants
immediately to complete the report by the end of the year.

17.      ICR consultants have thanked the participants for their informative and candid comments
and suggestions. The exercise is still in its early stage and the comments and suggestions raised
by the participants will be incorporated as appropriate in finalizing the report. Once the report is
finalized it will be communicated to all stakeholders and will be disclosed to the public.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Government submitted a draft Borrower’s ICR on January 15, 2014. A summary of the final
Borrower’s ICR has been requested (in 10 pages or less) and will be attached. The Executive
Summary of the draft report is below.

EXCUTIVE SUMMARY

Project Objectives: The IDA/DFID-financed Water Supply and Sanitation/Hygiene Education
Project (2004 – 2013) is part of its continued effort to support the development of the water and
sanitation sector in Ethiopia. The objective of the project is to provide increased access to
sustainable water supply and sanitation services, for rural and urban users, through improved
capacity of stakeholders in the sector.

Project Description: The project activities are defined and were implemented under three main
components; namely Rural Water Supply and Sanitation, Urban Water Supply and Sanitation, and
Program Support. The total cost of the project/allocation was about 4.1 billion Birr. As of
February 10, 2014, cumulative disbursement from the project account was 4.29 billion Birr. The
overall disbursement in the period accounts for about 104.6 percent of the total project budget.
Total expenditure reported for the period on the other hand was 4.21 billion birr or 98 percent of
the total disbursement and 102.68 percent of the project budget. Performances at the regional
level are encouraging and satisfactory.

 Implementation: The IDA/DFID Project was planned for 5 years starting from 2004. The
project is now in its tenth year of implementation. Most of the implementation activities were
started late due to delays in preparation and financial disbursement.
With regard to the program evolution and important milestones, the chronology is:
      MWIE Water Resources Policy
      Universal Access Program
      IDA-financed Water Supply and Sanitation Project
      ADB adopted a similar approach, start-up benefits from existing WSGs
      IDA WSSP switches to channel 1B, IFR disbursement, and raising prior review
         thresholds to bigger regions
      Ministries of Health, Water and Education sign MOU for integrated WASH Program
      National Coordination Unit established
      DFID joins the IDA to finance Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the WaSH Program in
         Ethiopia
      Capacity Building Pooled Fund established
      Additional funding secured from IDA.

The primary objective of the project is to improve access of the rural and urban population in 204
woredas to water and basic sanitation services. In its original form, the project would provide
safe drinking water for 1.8 million rural people. After the co-financing with DFID and additional
funding from the IDA, the project target is providing safe drinking water for 3.7 million rural
people, as indicated above; almost 10,050 rural water supply schemes were completed up to the
end of February 2014. The total population currently benefiting from the completed rural water
schemes is estimated at about over 4.4 million, which is almost 2.44 times of the original and 19
percent more than the revised number of beneficiaries. Therefore, the conclusion is that the
project is effective in meeting this objective and its performance is satisfactory.

The urban water supply and sanitation project, in terms of completed construction of physical
structures and availing potable water for the population is satisfactory. However, the weak
performance of the contractors and inadequate supervision from the consultants
contributed to delay in the implementation of the urban water supply projects. Up to the
end of the February 2014,          from the total 124 towns, 85 towns were financed for full
construction works (60 small, 19 medium, 6 sub-loans). Of this, 62 towns fully completed the
expansion and rehabilitation works and benefited 896,966 people, including beneficiaries from
ISI intervention. The remaining 23 towns, on average, are at more than 95 percent completion
stage and are expected to be completed at the end of this 2006 E.F.Y. The expected beneficiaries
of the remaining 23 towns, when completed, total 658,000 people. The total number of
beneficiaries of the completed and the ongoing projects is 1,554,966 urban people, which will be
119 percent of the target population.

Almost all woredas, 224 rural towns and 124 small, medium and sub-loan towns prepared and
submitted their sanitation and water programme. The progress in each year is increasing and
projects have been completed and the majority of the rural and urban population are benefiting
from clean water supply.

All participating woredas were able to prepare their water and sanitation program and implement
their annual plans successfully, particularly water supply schemes. The support from the Woreda
Support Groups (WSG) has enabled woredas to prepare their WaSH program even though the
duration of the support was not adequate.

However, the overall observation is that woredas have now better capacity to plan, implement
and manage their projects effectively than the pre-project period. Sectoral integration and
collaboration and the spirit of partnership have been developed through the capacity building
activities (consultation and review meetings and trainings). Regional Help Desks will be
established to link communities to local professionals who can help them.

Community capacity building focuses on participatory water supply planning, community
management, including financial, operations and maintenance, gender and other social issues,
hygiene and sanitation promotion, and problem solving. Capacity building activities (community
training) have been provided by the woreda technical teams, the community facilitation team, and
the woreda sector institutions. Reports on the number of communities trained, the frequency and
adequacy of this training were not available for further analysis.

As of September 30, 2013, 31 medium and large towns, 87 small towns, and six sub-loan towns
organized their independent water boards. Capacity building training was provided for all the
water boards. However, the outcome is inadequate due to lack of regular training, technical
support and monitoring and supervision. Even so, this PDO was met effectively in all regions,
woredas and towns regardless of the problems faced in areas of capacity, monitoring and
evaluation, inadequate technical support and poor performance of support groups.

Capacity building activities are also well underway and performance seems adequate. Staff
training in program management, management information systems and financial management,
operation and maintenance, water utility administration for federal and regional bureaus as well
as town water boards, was given particular emphasis in 2005 EFY. Training and technical
support provided to the woredas, the WSG and TSG, consultants and water boards and local
operators through different mechanisms are also some of the achievements of the project. Other
capacity building activities accomplished in the period were technical support for regions and
towns on project implementation and contract administration, effective and timely budget transfer,


                                               48
participation on water sources identification studies, environmental and social impact assessment
of projects, procurement of Information Technology equipment and vehicles.

Currently, the majority of the regions and towns have developed the capacity in financial
management, procurement administration, project implementation and contract administration.
The changes were satisfactory and encouraging.

As per the recent performance report (MoWIE, 2013), the rural water supply performance is that
10,050 schemes are completed and this is 102.9 percent of the last updated plan. At this stage,
these rural water supply schemes are expected to benefit over 4,410,450 people. As per the Multi-
Donor Trust Fund midterm review (2011), the sanitation coverage of the country was raised from
37 percent in 2008 to 86 percent in 2011, though the findings of the 2013 National WaSH
Inventory reduced this figure by nearly 20 percent. This success since 2008, in part, was
attributed to the joint sanitation and hygiene planning.

There were gradual improvements with respect to procurement, contract management and
construction quality. In particular; raising the works threshold to US$ 5,000,000 across the four
bigger regions significantly expedited project implementation. On the other hand, there were
limitations in contract management and project supervision towards the end of the project. Some
of the reasons for this are early withdrawal of woreda and town support groups and the rolling
over of defective projects.

Recommendations

       Some donors like ADB, IDA and DFID support a woreda-based modality. All other
        donors and NGOs support a community-based modality. Similarly, monitoring and
        evaluation and reporting systems follow different patterns. In other words, there is a lack
        of harmonization of modalities and alignment of plans among WaSH development
        partners. Therefore, all WaSH executors (government and donor) should come together
        and try to integrate their work programs in order to maintain the organizational and
        management sustainability of WaSH interventions.
       The WaSH project, as a national project, should have an autonomous agency at the
        federal and regional levels, respectively which will be accountable for the Ministry of
        Water Irrigation and Energy and Regional Water Bureaus or Steering committees.
       Ministry of Water and Energy shall assess the capacity of emerging/smaller regions,
        strengthen them and raise the procurement threshold limits.
       The WaSHCOMs’ roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined and should be
        institutionalized/legalized within the woreda structures.
       The project brought considerable changes in the lives of targeted communities and towns.
        However, as compared to the size of the country, few woredas and towns were targeted.
        Besides, very few kebeles were addressed in project woredas. Further, few communities
        benefited from each intervened kebele. Therefore, the project shall continue to address
        the remaining woredas, kebeles, communities and towns.
       Any future similar intervention shall have clear baseline data, measurable objectives and
        logical frameworks.
       When there is considerable currency devaluation and escalation, the project shall consider
        some form of adjustment. Some contractors and consultants complained that while the


                                               49
    government was collecting taxes from windfall gains during the 2011 devaluation, it did
    not compensate contractors, consultants and suppliers. Because of this, some of the
    private sector firms were unable to tolerate and withdrew from the business. Especially
    WSGs and TSGs were poor in tolerating financial shortages and stresses.
   The ongoing projects shall be completed and handed over to the users. The contractual
    issues with rolling over projects and those in defects liability period shall be given
    emphasis and be resolved by consultation among stakeholders, including project woredas
    and towns.

121.    DFID conducted a project completion review during the period Sept. 17 – Nov. 12, 2013
on a total of £66 million provided by DFID over five years (2008-2013), through its trust fund
arrangement with the World Bank, to support implementation of the Water Supply and Sanitation
Project (WSSP). DFID support to the WSSP was formalized by an administration arrangement
signed between the DFID and the World Bank on April 8, 2008.

122.    The evaluation was based on two scores i.e achievement of the outputs and outcomes,
and looked at output scoring for each component of the project, results of value for money as well
as the associated risks. In a scale that ranges from A++ to C, the former being of outputs and
outcomes substantially exceeding expectation and the latter substantially failing to meet
expectations; DFID has evaluated WSSP outputs as A and the overall outcomes as B.

123.    The evaluation has taken into account the long time that it took to get started because of
WSSPs effort to reform the rural and urban water sectors by establishing a harmonized WaSH
financing, planning and management approach. The evaluation also considered the project’s
effort to apply the new water policy in line with decentralization of WaSH planning and
implementation to the woreda and the town with a central role for the private sector. The
evaluation recognized the support from the project to the development of a comprehensive set of
principles, guidelines, and Project Implementation Manual and the training of Woreda and Town
Support Groups, known as WSGs and TSGs.

124.     It further documented the project’s effort to build the WaSH infrastructure in 224
woredas, recruit train and equip the Woreda and Town WaSH teams, and facilitate the
recruitment and deployment of the Woreda Support Groups and Town Support Groups. This was
a slow and expensive process involving a considerable number of consulting hours before
woredas and towns even had operational plans let alone the skills, the confidence and the
equipment to apply the very comprehensive, ‘demand-driven’ WaSH procedures. Starting from
such a low base and introducing many radical shifts was not without its problems and its costs.
Among the many challenges were the creation and/or bolstering of the WaSH private sector and
its acceptance by the Ministry as well as the regional and zonal bureaus. The evaluation stresses
that the high cost of this ‘front-loading’ plus the impact of oil price hikes and devaluation of the
Birr accounts for the relatively high per capita cost of water scheme installation averaging out at
$55 but ranging from $15 to $90 depending on a range of factors.

125.    Key lessons captured by the evaluation include

           The need to strengthen sustainability of rural schemes through the proven community
            management approach, complemented by spare part supply chains systems.
           Coordination between Water, Health, Education and Finance remains a priority at all
            levels.
           Reporting against agreed targets particularly for Sanitation and Hygiene components
            needs to be strengthened and Sanitation and Hygiene Action Plans need to be
            continually updated in line with the MIS data and also to reflect the new focus on
            sanitation marketing.
           Procurement and contract management capacity needs to be strengthened with better
            planning, supervision, quality control and training.
