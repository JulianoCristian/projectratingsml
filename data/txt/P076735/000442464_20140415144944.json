(WSS) Project for Ethiopia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: local\n            governments are best placed to take rural water, sanitation,\n            and hygiene (WaSH) to scale in an underserviced\n            decentralized country such as Ethiopia. The capacity\n            building approach of the project can be replicated in other\n            large projects of this nature. When a project requires\n            significant capacity building, this takes time, and\n            implementation and disbursement schedules need to be\n            adjusted to be realistic. Projects should be more systematic\n            in assessing the likely sustainability of rural and urban\n            WSS. A just-in-time monitoring approach is necessary to\n            maximize learning and make timely course corrections during\n            implementation. Criteria for grant and loan financing for\n            urban WaSH should be made clearer."}, "docdt": "2014-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
