                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Further to Bank re-engagement in Guinea and payment of country's arrears, closing date for both IDA and GEF financings was retroactively extended from December 31, 2010 to
                         June 30, 2013. The Project is on track to meet its development objective by new closing date. Out of a target of 30 villages, the Project has already electrified 24 villages, but only
                         60% of households originally targeted for electrification have been reached on average.
