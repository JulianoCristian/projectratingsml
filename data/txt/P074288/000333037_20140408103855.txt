1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Political context. Guinea has had a history of authoritarian rule since
independence. General Lansana Conte was in power for 24 years, from 1984 to 2008,
initially through military seizure and subsequently (1993, 1998, and 2003) through
elections. Upon his death in 2008, a military coup suspended the Constitution. After two
years of turmoil, elections were held in 2010. Following the 2008 coup, the Bank
suspended disbursements and only resumed them upon the return to civilian rule.

2.      Economy. Guinea ranks as one of the poorest countries in the world (204th out of
213 countries in per capita income according to the World Bank Atlas). Its GNI per
capita in 2002 was US$330 and it increased to US$460 in 2012 using the Atlas method
(US$790 and US$980 in PPP terms, respectively). Its population at appraisal (2002) was
around 8 million, which increased to around 11 million in 2012.

3.      Electricity sector. Electric power facilities in Guinea consist of a number of
separate unconnected systems. The power company, Électricité de Guinée (EDG),
supplies the Capital, Conakry, and a number of smaller towns or prefectures. Mining
companies and some large consumers generate electricity for their own use. In addition,
there are a number of small diesel and run-of-the-river hydro stations in several towns
whose operation is sporadic, inefficient and unreliable. The quality of urban electricity
service is poor and consumption remains constrained by shortfalls in supply. At appraisal
EDG had reverted to public sector management after being under an affermage1 contract
with SOGEL, a private operator. The contract failed in 2001 due to disagreements
regarding tariff adjustments and cost recovery measures. The affermage contract was
conceived to operate in urban areas and neglected the peri-urban and rural areas. Filling
this gap was one of the drivers behind the project. With the assistance of ESMAP, the
Government of Guinea (GoG) conducted several surveys to develop a framework for a
decentralized electrification program. Taking into account the findings of the surveys,
GoG adopted a new strategy for Decentralized Rural Electrification (DRE). This was
reflected in a sector policy letter of February 1998 that called for: (i) establishing a
regulatory framework for the DRE (applying to power plants with up to 250 kW of
installed capacity), including the liberalization of tariffs on DRE delivery and services,
and the elimination of import taxes and VAT on specific DRE equipment; (ii) creating a
small rural electrification office, Bureau d’Electrification Rurale Décentralisée (BERD),
for DRE planning; (iii) creating a financing mechanism (Fonds pour l’Électrification
Rurale Décentralisée—FERD) to be managed by a local financial institution. In June
1998 the GoG promulgated the Law 97/012/AN, which allowed the financing,
construction, management and operation of infrastructure assets by the private sector.

 An “affermage” contract is a type of management contract in which the contractor will
be remunerated, based on the performance of the entity being managed.

4.      Access to electricity. Less than 5 percent of the population has access to
electricity; about 35 percent of urban households (the capital and large prefectures) and
less than 1 percent in rural households. Rural households have no prospects of receiving
electricity services from the national grid over the foreseeable future. In peri-urban areas,
there are still thousands of potential consumers who are not connected to the grid for
technical and/or financial reasons, who use batteries to run their TVs and lights. The
reason for EDG not serving these potential rural and peri-urban clients is their small
energy demand, their location far away from existing grids, and lack of resources for grid
extension. Additionally, the cost of expanding power supply to the remote areas with low
population densities is prohibitively high.

5.      Project concept. The operation was conceived as a pilot project to apply lessons
learned from the ESMAP Decentralized Rural Electrification Studies in several African
countries (e.g. Ivory Coast, Guinea, Cameroon). The choice of instrument (Learning and
Innovation Loan—LIL) reflects the exploratory nature of the project oriented towards
testing and implementing approaches to rural electrification which combine private
investment, community-based decentralized electrification schemes, and the promotion of
renewable energy technologies (RETs).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

6.      The project development objective as stated in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) is to test institutional, financial and delivery mechanisms to promote better access
to electricity in rural and peri-urban areas. In support of that objective, the project seeks
to:

       (a) Test institutions, regulations and delivery mechanisms to develop
           decentralized and affordable village electrification schemes; and

       (b) Test financial mechanisms to deliver increased access to electricity and
           mobilize private sector financing for energy projects in rural communities.

The PDO above is different from the one included in the Development Credit Agreement.
The latter eliminates the concept of testing which is the essence of the LIL and adds other
elements that are already encompassed in the PDO above and the GEO shown below.

7.      The key indicators include: (a) whether the institutions and regulations put in
place have worked reasonably well and contributed to the achievement of project
objectives; (b) individual loan collection rates, as a measure of the extent to which the
project has been successful in establishing a sustainable delivery mechanism, do not fall
below 75% at the end of the project; (c) the decentralized electrification financing
mechanism (FERD) is operational and has a sustainable source of government financing
and financial support from donors; and (d) the necessary private sector financing has
been mobilized to provide electricity to some 20,000 households by the end of the project.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
8.    GEO objective: Promote the adoption of renewable energy technology by
removing barriers and thus mitigate CO2 emissions.
9.      Key indicators: (a) increased share of renewable energy technology in electricity
generation; (b) avoided CO2 emissions of about 30,000 tons by the end of the project, as a
result of photovoltaic and micro-hydro electricity use.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
10.     The PDO remained the same throughout the project. Key indicators were refined
as indicated below and as documented in supervision mission aide-mémoires; however,
no formal restructuring took place.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11.    The GEO remained the same throughout the project; however, as the project
progressed, it became evident that the original key indicator of 30,000 tCO2 avoided was
too ambitious.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

12.    The main beneficiaries of the project identified in the PAD include:

       (a) The primary target group, which comprises rural households and rural firms
           (whose business is generated because of electricity availability);

       (b) Electricity providers and investors, who develop the electricity supply
           business; and

       (c) Microfinance institutions (MFIs) and the commercial bank in charge of
           channeling resources to beneficiaries, who benefit from the business of
           financing electrification schemes.

Additionally, at a more general but significant level, beneficiaries include villages that
will reap economic, social, and environmental benefits as well as the country at large.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

13.    The project was designed with three components:

(a) Capacity Building. This component consists of technical assistance oriented
    towards:
        The implementing agency, BERD, in the monitoring, evaluation,
           dissemination and replication of activities, as well as the definition of priority
           areas, the evaluation of Decentralized Rural Electrification (DRE) proposals,
           and the coordination, supervision, and monitoring of the execution of DRE
           projects;
        Private providers in the identification and setting up of electricity service
           delivery under concession arrangements, and training in installation and
           maintenance of equipment; and
        Village associations, to encourage them in organizing service delivery through
           an operator.

(b) Financing Mechanism and Implementation of the DRE program. This
    component consists of setting up a rural electrification fund, FERD, to respond to the
    lack of long-term credit and the high up-front cost of rural electrification systems; it
    would be used to: (i) cover the operational cost of managing the BERD, (ii) provide
    loans to promoters of RE projects, and (iii) provide grants to promoters of RE
    projects.

(c) Project coordination and management. This component supports and strengthens
    the operation and the capacity of BERD to coordinate, supervise, and monitor the
    execution of the project with qualified staff; it includes training and the acquisition of
    vehicles and equipment.

1.8 Revised Components

14.    The components did not change.

1.9 Other significant changes

15.     The project has benefitted from three closing date extensions (for a total of six
and one half years) from the original closing date of December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2008,
then to December 31, 2009 and finally to June 30, 2013, further to the Bank suspension
of operations in 2009 and 2010 after a military coup.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.     The project was prepared based upon studies supported by ESMAP regarding the
possibilities for rural electrification in several African countries. It also incorporated

                                              5
lessons learned from other Bank projects in Guinea (the Power II Project), Sri Lanka
(energy service delivery), Indonesia (solar home systems), and China (renewable energy).

17.     The design recognized the limited capacity of human resources in Guinea, and
allocated funds for capacity building that were oriented to the major stakeholders,
including BERD staff and potential entrepreneurs, in order to ensure capable
management of the supported sub-projects.

18.    One of the main axes of action in the Government’s strategy for the power sector
was to promote decentralized electricity supply as well as mobilize private sector
financing to invest in the electricity sector. Based on this strategy the Government
showed its commitment during the preparation of this project by adopting a new strategy
for DRE, creating the BERD for DRE planning, and establishing a financing mechanism,
the FERD. Moreover, the Government also committed to cofinance US$1.1 million; the
disbursements were delayed and the Government finally only contributed US$0.78
million.

19.     The proposed financing mechanism was new in the country so a phased approach
was considered. Promoting attractive rural investments was also a risk because of lack of
previous evidence of profitability and sustainability; subsidizing capital costs, limiting
the technology options to only the mature and commercially available ones, the creation
of a steering committee with public and private institutions, as well as a specific
regulatory framework, were designed to lower this perception of risk.

20.     How the project was supposed to work. The conceptual implementation of the
project at the field level can be summarized as follows:

(a) A potential investor/operator expresses interest in putting in place an electricity
    production and distribution facility in a village lacking power and applies to BERD,
    the Government Bureau for Decentralized Rural Electrification; in most cases this is a
    person from the region who is interested in the business itself, as well as providing a
    service to improve the general welfare of the village.

(b) BERD provides technical support and training regarding the setup and operation of
    the proposed facility, including basic feasibility analyses and design.

(c) If the proposed project passes the feasibility tests, the investor/operator is awarded a
    concession contract by the MHE to supply electricity within a defined service area,
    thereby legalizing its operation.

(d) Based on the design of the project, the investor/operator provides his equity
    contribution, which is deposited in the commercial bank supporting the project; the
    investor/operator receives a loan and a subsidy channeled through the commercial
    bank managing the funds on behalf of the FERD.




                                             6
(e) The BERD then provides support for procurement of equipment and works required
    to setup the project; the funds are disbursed directly by FERD to the suppliers and
    contractors involved in setting up the facility.

(f) Once the facility is in place, including connections to clients, the operator provides
    electricity service on an agreed schedule, and collects payments from clients.

(g) The operator pays back the loan during a ten-year period and the resources are made
    available to other projects. This particular phase of the project, i.e. the operation of
    the financing facility as a revolving fund, is yet to be agreed with the Government.


21.    The GEF component was designed following the same methodology as stated
below but with focus on RE technologies by a higher subsidy of the investment cost.

2.2 Implementation

22.    Commercial arrangements In June 2003, the BERD entered into an agreement
with a commercial bank (BICIGUI) to channel IDA and GEF funds to the private
operators as loans and grants. The agreement with the commercial bank required
extensive negotiations and was a major factor in the delayed effectiveness of the project.
The initial concept was that the commercial bank would disburse the grants and loans,
and that it would take on the risk of the latter; this was not acceptable to the commercial
bank. Finally, an agreement was reached whereby the commercial bank would manage
the funds for a fee. With the approval of the agreement, effectiveness was achieved in
June, 2003, 11 months after Board approval.

23.     The commercial arrangement proved to have flaws during implementation, as the
commercial bank’s fee was not tied to its performance. It was set at 4 percent of
outstanding loans to sub-project operators. The commercial bank was incentivized to
lend as much money as possible, but had no incentive to recover the repayments from the
operators.

24.     Implementation: preparatory phase. The project posed a major challenge to
service a little-known market through an, as yet, unproved approach, involving actors
with little technical expertise, and financing, putting in place and operating commercially
very small electricity systems. Consequently, BERD initiated a first preparatory phase
including an extensive training program, putting in place custom tools to evaluate
projects proposed by private sector entrepreneurs, and instructing local consulting firms
in designing, dimensioning, evaluating, and preparing business plans for the scale of
assets envisaged in the program. This was achieved through seminars, workshops, study
trips, and hands-on practice to gain familiarization with IT resources through technical
assistance.

25.    BERD also undertook the dissemination of information regarding the project in
order to stimulate interest among potential entrepreneurs. This took place through

                                             7
regional workshops advertised in the newspapers and local radio stations. The result was
a positive response from several interested parties, who were in general either associated
with, or originated from, the communities they were interested in electrifying. With a
few exceptions, most of the candidates had a limited level of education and sketchy
knowledge regarding the technology and possibilities for electrification of their
communities. Many of the applicants were attracted by the subsidy and loan components
of the project, but balked at providing their share of equity, and, as a result, they dropped
out of the program. During this initial phase, training of potential investors/operators
took place through on-site visits and talks, as well as sessions held at the BERD
headquarters.

26.      Implementation phase. From mid-2003, it took about two years to put in place
the procedures and software for evaluating and designing projects. The first eight
projects were processed in 2005. The mid-term review, conducted during three missions
in July, October, and December 2005, noted that the project had entered a phase of
effective implementation, with around thirty identified candidate operators. These
expectations materialized partially in the following four years (2006–2009), which saw
the approval of 3, 5, 10, and 6 applications, respectively each year, for a total of 32 in the
whole period (2005-2009) at project closure a total of 35 applications were received. The
first five projects became operational in early 2007.

27.     In January 2009, the Bank suspended payments due to the December 2008 coup,
and the project was put on hold until late 2010; activities were reinitiated in early 2011.
During this 2 year hiatus, the BERD continued to operate (twelve projects were put in
service in 2010) but the processing of ongoing operations was halted. During the 2011–
2013 final phase, three new applications were processed.

28.    At project closure, 35 applications had been processed, of which 32 resulted in
signed agreements. 26 of the micro-grids are currently operating and 3 are still under
construction (including the pico-hydro project). For the remaining three signed
agreements activities never took off.

29.     The failure to execute renewable energy projects: Under the GEF, no RET
subprojects were put in service. Because the project was demand-driven, the high
upfront cost of RETs discouraged local investors in developing electricity supplies with
these technologies. One pico-hydro project (Bofossou) was supported but construction
was not completed before the project closure and the developer is looking for alternative
sources of finance to complete construction. There was also an effort to support the
development of PV projects; a proposal was received and the BERD supported the
developer but procurement issues led to delays and the project closed before the delivery
of any PV equipment. Due to the low level of implementation of RET subprojects, only
US$427,000 of the GEF funds were disbursed from the initial amount of US$2 million
(the funds financed the development of methodologies for RET project evaluation,
training, study trips, as well as a portion of the investment costs of the Bofossou pico
hydro). The undisbursed GEF funds were not reallocated to other projects. Even though
the GEF grant agreement does not explicitly forbid supporting non-RET projects, GEF


                                              8
funds are not intended to be used to support projects, such as diesel generation, which do
not reduce GHG emissions.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.      One shortcoming of project implementation was the delay in establishing the
M&E arrangements. This is essential for a LIL, which is an instrument to promote
learning. The client was therefore unable to measure the multiple effects of rural
electrification through the proposed approach. Monitoring and evaluation design and
implementation was recognized in the PAD as an important dimension of the project with
regard to the sustainability and replicability of rural electrification projects. Independent
consultants were expected to undertake two performance reviews to evaluate the
implementation experience. The responsibility for monitoring and evaluation was
assigned to the BERD, with the support of consultants. The areas to be covered included
the economic, financial, technical, social, and environmental dimensions.

31.     However, the actual monitoring activity only took place at a late stage in the
implementation of the project with the assignment of a member of the professional staff
responsible for executing it. Given that this operation is a LIL where new approaches are
being tested, M&E is of primary importance and interest, in order to assess multiple
consequences of the proposed RE strategy, such as the effect on households, on
community relations, and on village economics. Moreover, the quality of the indicators
defined in the PAD was poor as some of them were difficult to measure. Over the project
period, the indicators were refined informally as between the Bank team and the client,
however no formal modifications were made.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.    Safeguards. The project did not trigger any safeguard policies. However, on the
environmental front the project included training, both for consulting firms and for
operators, in best practices regarding project design and operation (e.g. disposal of waste
oil and used batteries and filters, evaluation of RET projects). Project studies also
included social aspects (e.g. through surveys of potential users) in order to evaluate the
potential impact on target communities and the affordability of the service to be offered
to them.
33.    Procurement.        Procurement included two large categories: services and
equipment for the implementing agency, the BERD, which required Bank no objection,
and services, equipment, and works by the private sector operators, which were not
subject to Bank oversight. Regarding the first category, the BERD’s direct expenses
other than personnel included contracting for technical assistance (including auditing
services) and supplies (including vehicles); these were procured mostly through local
shopping or local bidding; one large technical assistance contract was procured through
ICB. Regarding the second category, the BERD supervised and escorted the private
operators for procuring project requirements and prepared a procedure to be followed by
the operators, with different approaches according to whether the operator had an interest
as a supplier to the project, and the instructions for competitive bidding and/or

                                             9
shortlisting. The BERD drew up a roster of proven local suppliers, which were invited to
participate or submit bids. The BERD also assisted in choosing least cost design
alternatives. In two special cases, which involved international bidding (PV equipment
and mini hydro equipment), BERD assisted the operators by executing the procurement
on their behalf, subject to Bank procedures. The BERD’s performance in procurement
aspects was constructive and instrumental in putting the sub-projects into service.
34.     Financial management. Throughout project implementation, the financial
management arrangements were implemented adequately.            The audits of the
implementing agency and project financial statements were submitted regularly, albeit
with some delays in a few instances. Project audits did not highlight any major
irregularity. Counterpart financing received from the Government was 30% below the
budgeted amount, and was delayed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.      Operation and maintenance of subprojects financed through FERD.
Operation and maintenance of the small diesel plants and their associated network
financed by the project do not require any specialized skills and basic maintenance
includes well-understood procedures for avoiding motor breakdown. The networks, with
simple designs, do not require any special arrangements to keep them functioning.
Project operators were trained through BERD’s workshops. Projects visited and project
operators that were interviewed during the ICR mission showed a thorough
understanding of the procedures required to keep the services running. The economic
and financial analysis in Annex 3 confirms that the projects are financially viable from
the point of view of the investors and are likely to be sustainable at least until the useful
life of equipment currently in place.

36.     Sustaining the institutional capacity. One of the objectives of the project
consists of putting in place a sustainable rural electrification agency for implementing,
with the support of donors, a more extensive electrification program, which would build
upon the experience gained with the project. The approval of the Rural Electrification
Law in October 2013 by the National Assembly, is an important first step. The AGER is
being established, but at this early stage, it is difficult to assess its sustainability.

37.    Sustaining the FERD. The financial sustainability of the RE fund is low. To
maintain DRE’s momentum, it is essential to maintain the availability of FERD resources.
Sustaining the FERD can be accomplished with resources from the repayment of loans,
and fresh funds from alternative sources. When the project was designed, the destination
of funds recovered from repayments of loans was not taken into account. The logical
design for sustaining the FERD would be to recycle the repaid funds into new projects,
thereby creating a revolving fund for a portion of its loans. The PAD does not mention
this concept; in fact, the BICIGUI-Government subsidiary agreement mentions the
recovery of funds in connection with the repayment by GOG of the IDA loan. The PAD
conceived FERD as being fed with fresh resources from Government and donors, which
makes sense, given the success in co-opting private sector entrepreneurs into providing
RE services. Consequently, sustaining the FERD will require improving its current

                                             10
management arrangements: (a) renegotiate the subsidiary agreement with BICIGUI to
provide an incentive to recover loan payments from operators, thereby improving the
fund’s sustainability; (b) revise the FERD rules in order to allow recycling repaid funds
to new projects (revolving fund); and (c) develop and implement a plan to disburse fresh
resources from Government and donors into the FERD.

38.     Recovering the loans. The principal issue regarding the sustainability of the
decentralized electrification concept sponsored by the project lies in the poor recovery
ratio (only around 59%) of outstanding loan obligations. Currently, BICIGUI is
responsible for loan recovery of obligations, which extend until 2023, but this will
require covering the bank’s fees, and BERD does not have the corresponding resources.
This requires a prompt solution within the scope of a renegotiation of the BICIGUI
agreement, possibly with IDA support.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

39.      To assess project outcomes it is necessary to recall that the project was conceived
as a LIL. Implicit in this choice are factors involving uncertainty and risk, as evidenced
by the Bank’s definition of a LIL: “LILs are loans of US$5 million or less, financing
small, experimental, risky and/or time-sensitive projects in order to pilot promising
initiatives and build consensus around them, or experiment with an approach in order to
develop locally based models prior to a larger-scale intervention. LILs are predominantly
used in sectors or situations in which behavioral change and stakeholder attitudes are
critical to progress, and where 'prescriptive' approaches might not work well”; it further
adds: “A LIL focuses on experimentation, learning and piloting in search of possible
developmental solutions, prior to potential larger-scale operations.”

40.     The final outcomes which ultimately provide the frame of reference for rating the
project consist of benefits to consumers including, among others, extended leisure and
study hours from improved lighting, savings from reducing kerosene purchases, avoided
indoor pollution by eliminating smoke from lamps, and communications benefits derived
from facilities such as TV, radio, and cell phone charging. These benefits are quantified
and analyzed more closely in Annex 3, where it is shown that the DRE approach is well
justified from an economic standpoint.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

41.     Objectives. Electrification is essential for Guinea’s priorities given that its
economic strategy includes developing programs with high export potential (tourism,
trade, crafts) engaging the private sector. The project’s objectives of testing institutions
and mechanisms for the private sector to deliver electrification to off-grid communities is




                                            11
fully coherent with the goals adopted jointly by the country and by the Bank through the
CPS for underpinning economic growth2.

42.     Design. Orienting the project towards rural areas is consistent with seeking to
reduce the disparities between urban and rural areas, as geographic location is the
primary determinant of poverty in Guinea. Designing the project based upon engaging
the private sector is a realistic approach for introducing electricity to areas where
coverage is practically nil and where extending the main grid is neither economical nor
feasible due to the lack of resources. The detailed design was conceived as a small scale
but realistic application of procedures and principles to achieve the PDO objective of
testing a private sector led approach to rural electrification in order to gain insight into its
advantages, drawbacks, and limitations, all of which are relevant for further large scale
reproduction.

43.     Implementation. Putting in place the project was relevant: it responded to the
objectives and design and managed to attract interest from entrepreneurs. Project
management focused on helping the entrepreneurs to put in place a service which would
be economically designed and well-managed, providing the level of service associated
with a very basic setup which would nevertheless be relevant to the communities
involved. Insofar as the sub-projects are economically successful (with ERR of 60%),
they provide a showcase for replication in different villages.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives
Overall Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Achievement of Project Development Objectives

44.     The project achieved its PDO (for the IDA LIL) as a pilot project to demonstrate
the opportunities and limitations for advancing RE to promote access to electricity in
rural and peri-urban areas, where connecting to the grid is not economically feasible. The
PDO consists of (a) Testing institutions, regulations and delivery mechanisms to develop
decentralized and affordable village electrification schemes; and (b) Testing financial
mechanisms to deliver increased access to electricity and mobilize private sector
financing for energy projects in rural communities.

45.     Outputs and outcomes. Given the scope of a LIL, the specific numerical key
indicators should be considered as guideposts for project outputs, rather than measures of
success, and must be evaluated in terms of the information they provide as a guide to
future efforts using a similar approach.

46.     Based partly on the results, the PDO achievement can be qualified as follows:


2
 The Bank’s 2014–2017 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Guinea dated September 4, 2013, was
endorsed in October 2013.


                                                12
47.      Whether the institutions and regulations put in place have worked reasonably
well and contributed to the achievement of project objective: The regulations through
which the projects are operating have proven to be successful in providing the legal
assurance for decentralized projects to be financially sustainable, as evidenced by the
continued operation of all sub-projects. The BERD and its steering committee are
functional and have proved that they are capable of supporting rural electrification
projects following the original concept as demonstrated by the execution of 26 rural
electrification projects which are in service. The National Assembly adopted the rural
electrification law for the sector in October 2013 but the decrees of application were not
yet developed, for example to transform the BERD into a permanent Rural Electrification
Agency. It can be concluded that the organization and institutions developed through the
project have been working well.

48.     Individual loan collection rates, as a measure of sustainability, do not fall below
75% at project end: This is an important weakness of the project. Loan collection rates
at the end of the project were on the order of 59%. This indicates that the financial
mechanism for recovering the loans to project operators/investors has important
weaknesses in its design and cannot sustain a revolving fund for further electrification
using the proposed decentralized procedure.

49.     The decentralized rural electrification fund financing mechanism (FERD) is
effective. Regarding the financial vehicle for channeling funds to entrepreneurs, the
project shows that the “subsidy plus loan” concept is effective in sparking private sector
interest for developing and managing off-grid projects in villages. The project facilitated
the testing of the management of the financial scheme, and it evidenced as a major
obstacle the need to address effective mechanisms to recover a satisfactory percentage of
outstanding financial obligations, without which the concept behind the project is
impracticable. The results at project close are as follows:

       (a) FERD is operational and has a sustainable source of funds: the Government
           had agreed to provide support through Budget allocations, but its contribution
           during project execution was only 71% of the level expected when the project
           was designed. Donors can be expected to support the Fund, but they should
           be complementary resources. The fund could function as a revolving fund but
           this is still under discussion with the Government.

       (b) 32 rural electrification conventions signed. 26 projects were financed and are
           operational; three other projects were approved and are underway—including
           a pico-hydro project—which require further financing from sources other than
           those of the project. This represents a 90% achievement rate (29/32), which
           can be qualified as satisfactory; it also supports the feasibility hypothesis
           regarding the proposed approach.




                                            13
       (c) 20% of investment cost of diesel mini-concessions provided by private
           operators. Private providers contributed 18% of total investment cost (84%
           achievement of the target).

       (d) 5% of investment cost for renewable mini-concessions provided by private
           operators. Given the absence of renewable projects, this indicator was not
           achieved. However, one pico hydro (Bofossou) was partially funded by the
           project but was not completed before project closure; for this project, the
           private entrepreneur provided 5.1% of the cost.

50.     Increased access to electricity. Household electrification is achieved when the
electricity service uses modern lighting (like CFL) to replace non-electrical lighting (like
kerosene lamps or candles). When compared to alternative solutions based on kerosene or
batteries, electricity delivered to end users is affordable despite a high price per kWh.
Project areas of intervention (rural concessions) are non-electrified villages, therefore
with no access rate to electrification. The results at project close are as follows:

       (a) 30 electrified rural concessions: 26 projects are operating at the end of project.
           Three more are underway.

       (b) 86% access rate in electrified concessions. The access rate achieved in
           electrified concessions is currently 58%. It is lower than the target because
           business plans overestimated poor people’s ability to pay for electricity and
           underestimated the cost of electrification in rural areas where houses are quite
           spread-out.

       (c) 5 rural concessions electrified using renewable energy. At the end of the
           project there were no electrified concessions using renewable energy. This
           result is considered a significant shortcoming of the GEF project, given the
           expectation at appraisal that ‘the Project would have demonstrated RETs to be
           a viable business opportunity’.

       (d) 12,000 rural connections established. The sponsored projects have 14,116
           available connections, of which 8,248 are being used; the balance is expected
           to be completed within the next two years.

51.    Two intermediate results indicators are worth mentioning: 14 consulting firms,
compared with a target of 10 were trained; and 35 applications were received form
entrepreneurs and are awaiting financing, as compared with a target of 30.

52.      Based upon these considerations, the project achieved its PDO as a pilot project to
test a risky approach and to demonstrate its possibilities and limitations for advancing RE
in an economically poor country in areas where connecting to the grid is not
economically feasible.




                                            14
53.    The achievement of the PDO for the IDA LIL is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory, which takes into account that some indicators are partially achieved.

54.     This rating is higher than the rating in the last ISR. When the ICR team examined
the indicators of the project, some of them had increased from the date of the last ISR (i.e.
32 rural electrification concessions signed instead of 30, 26 rural concessions
implemented instead of 22, 58% of access rate instead of 56% and 14,116 connections
instead of 8,800). The majority of the target values were substantially achieved;
therefore, the achievement of the PDO merited a better rating.


Achievement of GEO objectives

55.    GEO objectives consisted of:

       (a) Removing barriers to the adoption of RETs. Regarding the reduction of
           barriers to RETs, (i) the training sessions conducted through the project
           included instruction on RETs, and (ii) the project facilitated the identification
           of 49 pico-hydro sites, which could be developed in the future.

       (b) Reduction of GHG emissions. The revised key indicators consisted of an
           increased share of RET in electricity and a reduction of 5800 tCO2. At project
           closure no RETs associated with the project had been put in service and no
           GHG emissions had been reduced.

56.     The two GEO objectives were complementary, as removing barriers to the
adoption of RETs (by providing long term financing) was expected to lead to putting in
place RET projects and hence reducing GHG emissions. As a part of the LIL, the project
allowed for testing the financial mechanism to develop RET projects as well as
identifying reasons for failing to put any in place. Nevertheless, the achievement of GEO
objectives was practically nil.

57.     Based on the major shortcomings described above, the achievement of the GEO
objective is rated as unsatisfactory.

58.    Combining the ratings of the achievement of the PDO and the GEO, and giving
more weight to the PDO rating (due to the larger size of the IDA financing), the
achievement of the overall Project Development Objectives is rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

59.     The DRE approach is well justified economically. The economic Net Present
Value of the project is US$6 million and the economic Rate of Return (ERR) is estimated
to be 60%. This compares favorably with the ERR estimated in the PAD of about 7.75%.

                                            15
This large difference can be explained because the ICR used a different methodology
from the PAD; the latter was done using the so-called incremental cost approach, which
was developed by GEF to evaluate RET projects, and it did not account for consumer
surplus (indeed, the PAD states that “the project benefits will be somewhat understated”).
The ICR methodology takes into account consumer surplus, and the high economic return
is a result of the very large benefits from the replacement of traditional lighting through
kerosene lanterns as well as the willingness to pay for new services, such as television,
which are possible through electricity supply. From the standpoint of quality of the
service, a kerosene lamp only produces around 10% of CFL luminance. Moreover,
regarding the costs, monthly kerosene charges are three times CFL consumption.

60.     The sub-projects are financially justified for the private sector operator, but
they require subsidies. Considering the capital costs and O&M costs of the operators
and the sales and tariffs charged to the consumers, as well as the PERD subsidies, the
NPV financial return to operators is US$61,000 and the rate of return is 14% in a
timeframe from 2006 to 2020. Without the subsidies the NPV and the rate of return are
both negative (minus US$1million and minus 2%, respectively). This is not surprising
given the relatively high cost of rural electrification, irrespective of the technology used.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

61.    Despite the high relevance of the objectives, design and implementation and the
highly satisfactory efficiency for the project, the moderately unsatisfactory achievement
of the PDO and GEO combined leads to an overall outcome rating of Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62.     sub-projects that have been put into service have had significant social and
poverty-related impacts by improving living conditions for users. Visible benefits
include improved leisure hours, access to communications services, refrigeration in small
shops, and community activities through shared facilities such as the so-called video
clubs, as well as powering equipment of health facilities. This is an important
contribution to the Government’s poverty reduction strategy, particularly in rural areas,
where it is most visible. Gender issues were not reflected during the preparation stage,
nor was the gender impact monitored during the major part of the implementation of the
original project.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.      The project has provided the basis for strengthening the rural electrification
activities under the MHE, including the approval of the Rural Electrification Law. With
the project’s resources, the BERD has been able to put in place a qualified team which is


                                             16
more prepared for managing donor resources, once the Rural Electrification Agency is
established.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Not Applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not Applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Moderate

64.   The different activities of the project present the following risk profiles which
cumulatively are assessed as moderate:
      (a) On the learning front, there is a substantial appropriation of knowledge at the
          level of the BERD concerning the challenges and pitfalls of rural
          electrification and the means to address them, and the capacity thereby
          acquired can be conserved by judicious governance. Losing this knowledge
          could come about through a return to political instability; however, Guinea’s
          prospects in this regard appear to be improved.
      (b) The financial mechanism which has been put in place through the FERD is
          likely to be more successful when reforms to improve its sustainability are put
          in place, including support from other donors and GoG.
      (c) The risk associated with investments in electrification sub-projects is low,
          given the diversification among multiple small companies. Whereas some of
          them may fail for different reasons, such as mismanagement, most are being
          managed with private sector criteria by trained operators and, as a group, and
          are unlikely to fail.
      (d) Related to GEO, the decreasing cost of RETs and the first experiences in RE
          rural electrification in the region provides better prospects for the
          implementation of new RE projects. However, there is still a need to partially
          subsidize upfront costs and the difficulty of obtaining such subsidies makes
          this risk moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.    The project addressed a critical issue in terms of its strategic relevance for the
economic development of Guinea. Electricity supply had been addressed previously in
the context of the national power company (including a brief period of privatization) but
addressing access, particularly in rural areas, required an innovative approach. Moreover,
the operation was conceived as a pilot project to apply lessons learned from the ESMAP

                                           17
Decentralized Rural Electrification Studies in several African countries. The choice of the
LIL instrument correctly reflected the need to test a decentralized approach to access to
electricity in rural areas which combined private investment, community-based
decentralized electrification schemes before a more comprehensive effort was attempted.

66.     The project tested the appropriateness of RETs for rural electrification, an
alternative that had been promoted in other Bank projects, given their small scale and the
possibility of installation in non-interconnected areas, together with their possible
environmental impact. The project concept for pico hydro development lends itself to a
decentralized approach but, for photovoltaic energy, it is not as straightforward since it
involves the high cost of SHS installation.

67.      Project preparation also took into account the social impact that rural
electrification would have on communities lacking electricity service. Implementation
arrangements were designed to fit the decentralized concept, including the identification
of the commercial bank to manage the electrification fund.

68.     Although monitoring and evaluation arrangements were designed and the specific
dimensions to be supervised were well identified, the results framework was poorly
defined and thus was difficult to measure properly. Additionally, while project risks
were identified during preparation, including the risk of low recovery of loans, in
retrospect the proposed mitigating measures were not bold enough.

69.    Based on the foregoing, Bank performance during identification, preparation and
appraisal of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

70.     The Bank undertook 11 supervision missions during project implementation
period. Following effectiveness (June 2003), the first mission took place in October 2004,
during which a workshop was held with the project staff to determine the strategies and
procedures needed to attract operators. Given the complexities associated with this
previously untested approach, earlier support by the Bank would have allowed the project
to move ahead more rapidly. Subsequent missions, including the mid-term review
undertaken in 2005, should have noted the poor progress being made by the RET projects
and proposed alternative approaches, including restructuring this component of the
project to respond to the lack of progress.

71.     During the 2009-2011 political hiatus, project supervision decreased. The lack of
progress of the RET component was only discussed with the GoG after 2011, when there
was little time left to complete the single pico hydro project. At an earlier stage, the Bank
team should have revisited the PV component and adapted it to the then present
circumstances with a view to improving implementation.




                                             18
72.     As it is well documented in the supervision aide-memoires, key indicators were
refined to better assess the reality on the ground. However, no formal modifications of
the results indicators took place, even though two closing date extensions were granted.
Similarly, the client pointed out that one of the obstacles to implementation was
associated with the low thresholds for establishing the procurement method and although
this was recognized by both BERD and the Bank, the thresholds remained unchanged
throughout the project.

73.    The Bank provided regular performance reporting and supervised project
execution closely. However, there was a delay in establishing a monitoring and
evaluation in place at BERD until late in the project and the Bank team did not
emphasized it from the beginning of the project. Moreover, the client indicated that the
Bank’s interventions, such as no-objections, were considerably slow.

74.     Based on the strong technical supervision and some shortcomings in M&E
supervision and no earlier actions on renewable energy, the Bank’s supervision quality is
rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.    The rating reflects both the preparation and supervision ratings.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

76.     The Government supported the project and maintained the agency’s staff even
during the political upheaval and Bank suspension period. Regarding key legislation
associated with the project, the approval of the Rural Electrification Law and the
establishment of the Rural Electrification Agency faced serious delays. However, the
Government did not consider the pilot nature of the project which implied scaling up the
intervention to a nation-wide level, making FERD sustainable and transforming BERD
into a permanent Agency for Rural Electrification. Currently there are no prospects to
replicate the approach in the country.

77.    The Government’s planned financial participation in the project was US$1.1
million, however, the government’s counterpart financing amounted to only US$0.78
million at project close.

78.     Finally, the economic environment of the project, which was important for project
success, was characterized by high inflation which impacted the project negatively,
particularly for sub-projects executed between 2006 and 2008. In addition, reduced taxes
and import tariffs needed to support the project were granted with significant delays, due
to disputes with customs authorities.


                                            19
79.    Given the above mentioned significant shortcomings, the Government’s
performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     The BERD was committed to project execution and was strongly involved in all
aspects of implementation. Fiduciary responsibilities were discharged according to the
rules set out in the Credit Agreement. In particular, the BERD’s performance in
procurement aspects was constructive and instrumental in putting the sub-projects into
service. However, there were delays in project implementation as a result of the
exploratory nature of the project. Although the project implementation period was 10
years (albeit with a 2-year interruption due to political reasons), the outcomes of the PDO
were almost achieved and BERD succeeded in creating and establishing all the
procedures for project implementation. The GEO objectives were not met, but the lack of
experience on RET in rural areas in the country, the small scale of the systems and the
high capital costs of RET, made the implementation of this component very challenging
and resolving those challenges was not always within the full control of the BERD.

81.    However, monitoring and evaluation procedures were also implemented late in
the project and lacked coverage of social outcomes of electrification, which would
provide valuable data for project continuation. Moreover, the BERD did not succeed in
making the FERD sustainable.

82.     Overall, the commitment of BERD to the learning objectives of the project was
strong and the shortcomings in performance noted above were often outside of its direct
control. The implementing agency performance is therefore rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.     Considering that the shortcomings from the Borrower’s side had limited impact
on the PDO achievement, which was accomplished mainly thanks to the dedication and
continued work of the BERD, the shortcomings are considered minor and, therefore, the
overall performance of the Borrower is judged to be Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

84.     The project provides several lessons that can provide useful guidance in preparing
similar operations.

Lessons specific to LIL Operations
85.    LIL projects are designed and prepared with a degree of uncertainty in some
aspects, including the choice of approach, technology, and financing. During the

                                            20
preparation phase allowance should be made for these characteristics; in particular, the
project team should be on the lookout for those aspects that require on-course adjustment.
Examples from the PERD include: the low collection rate, which should have been a red
light signaling the need to examine the commercial bank incentives; and the lack of RET
interest, which suggested the need for an alternative approach. Also, the transformation
of FERD into a revolving fund could have been addressed well before project closure.
The mid-term review would have been an appropriate moment for addressing these issues.

86.     During project execution of a LIL, the learning component is the most important
goal. Consequently, a LIL should have a well-designed M&E framework, with regular
reporting, in order to internalize the learning experience of the project, with a view to
applying this experience in similar contexts, either within the country or elsewhere.

87.    The M&E of an electrification-oriented LIL should not be limited just to the
technical aspects of the project, but should also try to assess ultimate outcomes in terms
of the social and economic consequences within the beneficiary communities. As a
consequence, M&E budgetary provisions should be committed during project preparation
and the M&E results should be closely monitored during supervision.

2. Lessons specific to Rural Electrification and RET Operations

88.     Implementation of RETs should take into account their high capital costs, together
with the greater demands and risks on operators. As a result, PV projects would not
appear to be well suited to a decentralized approach where small private operators
undertake electrification at the village level. Other models, such as the dealer model or
the concessioning of services to a large enterprise, may have better prospects of success
because more experience and resources can be provided by larger firms, as evidenced by
the satisfactory implementation of other Bank-supported projects in poor countries (e.g.
Nicaragua and Bolivia).
89.     The PERD is a good example of blending equity, loans, and subsidies to achieve
effective electrification in remote rural areas. The actual proportions of these inputs must
be adapted to specific circumstances. During PERD execution it came to light that the
proportion of loan plus subsidy required was higher than initially estimated, and this
would have signaled the need to track loan payback rates more closely to ensure
sustainability of the approach.
90.      An innovative pricing approach contributed to the success of the sub-projects
financed through the FERD. Rather than rely on traditional metering, the sub-project
concessionaires were able to charge for their services on the basis of tangible benefits (i.e.
per lamp outlet, per TV outlet etc.); although this is not an orthodox approach (and can be
criticized from a strict economic viewpoint), it is better adapted to commercializing
electricity supply in a rural community where the notion of “purchasing kWh” might be
too abstract and viewed with suspicion.
91.     Projects in which private financial institutions are expected to play a significant
role during implementation should include a detailed assessment with potential interested
commercial banks about the conditions under which they are expected to perform,

                                             21
aligning the incentives of the institutions with those of the project. Specifically, the fees
for the commercial bank and their relation with loan recovery should be identified and
agreed, at least in regard to key aspects, during preparation. In future similar operations,
an incentive related to loan recovery should be established and prioritized in the contract
with the commercial bank.

92.      Project preparation should include realistic expectations with respect to physical
objectives and their implementation times. The PERD was too optimistic in this respect
(e.g. it had a goal of 5000 SHS in 50 villages). Realistic financial schemes related to
RETs in rural areas should always be part of the analysis.

93.      Critical assumptions with respect to sustainability should be validated during
project preparation through consultations. In the case of PERD, the assumption concerns
the prospects for repayment of loans in rural settings and the procedures for mitigating
this risk.

94.     In recent years, the RET ‘learning curve’ has been high, costs have been reduced
dramatically, and several examples in Sub-Saharan Africa have become a reality. As
financing schemes have started to prove successful and an enabling environment is
created, a similar approach could be replicated in Guinea but focusing on RETs. However,
as these technologies are not yet commonly used, more preparatory work would need to
be carried out.

Economic analysis
There is a very low rate of rural electrification in Guinea (around 5 percent), with most
rural households meeting their lighting and small power needs with kerosene and dry cell
batteries. The following benefits result from the availability of electricity in a home: (a)
improvements in lighting quality and quantity extend the working day and allow for
income-generating activities after dark, and lead to better conditions under which
children can read and study, (b) access to radio and television, (c) reduction of indoor
pollution, contributing to improved health, and (d) access to refrigeration (small
refrigerators) with food conservation benefits.
User data. The levels of service were classified by the BERD as follows:

This classification reflects the way the service is marketed. Rural concessionaires bill by
the type of use (i.e. they don’t measure and bill electricity consumption directly). The
overwhelming use of electricity corresponds to lighting needs, with some outlets for TV
use or minor appliances. Electricity service in communities powered by diesel units
provides between 4 and 5 hours of power a day (typically from 7pm to 11:30pm).
Refrigeration outlets correspond to commercial users (store owners) who use electricity
to cool drinks.

Lighting benefits. Expenditures on kerosene amount to a cost of around 44 liters per
year per lamp, at a price of US$1.50 per liter, in addition to the purchase price of the
lamp. Dry cell batteries are used to power radios, and can cost around US$4 to US$5 per
month. Electricity brings about important qualitative changes; for example, a 15 W



                                                               27
compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) produces around 800 lumens, while a kerosene lamp
will produce only around 60-70 lumens at best 3 . In terms of useful illumination
(measured in terms of lux, i.e. lumens per square meter), the CFL produces 122 lux,
while the kerosene lamp provides only 10 lux.
Consequently, economic benefits associated with better lighting derive from two sources:
(a) savings from the substitution of kerosene and batteries by lower cost power, and (b)
the benefits of additional consumption derived from the higher illumination provided by
electricity. Figure A3-1 illustrates the benefits as represented by a consumer demand
function.
        Figure A3-1 Demand Function for Lighting




In Figure A-1, (PK, QK) is the initial point of consumption (based on kerosene), and (PE,
QE) is the final point of consumption, based on electricity. Areas A+B+D represent total
(gross) surplus in the initial situation, where B+D is the cost of kerosene and dry cell
batteries; the net surplus is therefore area A. At the final point of consumption, gross
surplus increases to (A+B+C+D+E); areas D+E are the costs of supply with electricity,
and areas B+C yield the net consumer surplus gain to beneficiaries.
Communications benefits. Lighting benefits can be estimated with some degree of
assurance, as there exists a quantifiable alternative (kerosene lamps); no such information
is available for benefits such as watching TV (hearing the radio has the associated cost of
dry cell batteries). Also, consuming TV is a one-off experience, i.e. there is no
continuum of consumption. The benefits of TV availability have been estimated from
willingness to pay studies in developed countries. For example, in the UK a survey
commissioned by the Radio Communications Agency in 2000 (later Ofcom) assessed the

willingness to pay (WTP) for radio and TV4. It found a willingness to pay on the order of
£10 per month per household (around US$15 per month). At the time, income in the UK
for poor households was on the order of US$12,000/year5. They would be willing to pay
up to around 1.5% of disposable income for TV. Although extrapolating this value to
another country, such as Guinea, is debatable, it would represent a WTP of around
US$37/year based on an average income of US$490/year and a household size of 5.
The economic analysis was performed based on the following estimations:
         Benefits: gross consumer surplus of lighting and TV viewing;
         Costs: investment costs in village electrification projects, fuel costs,
          administrative costs, and operations and maintenance costs;
         Available connections utilized in their entirety by 2020.
Table A3-4 summarizes the costs and benefits over the period 2007–2020. These figures
yield the following indicators:
Net Present Value: US$6.0 million Internal Rate of Return: 60%, corresponding to the
most conservative estimation of consumer surplus.
The high rate of return can be explained by the substitution savings associated with CFLs
providing lighting benefits: the use of kerosene lanterns has a cost of around US$124 per
year for two lanterns, which can be replaced by one CFL. A 15W CFL operating 4.5
hours per day consumes just around 25kWh per year; a diesel unit will consume around
0.4L per kWh, i.e. 10L per year per CFL. At a cost of around US$1.30 per liter, the
running cost associated with one CFL is around US$13. This yields a margin of about
US$110 to pay for capital costs of production, administration and O&M. The investment
costs of small diesel units plus the associated minigrids averaged about US$1200/kVA or
around US$1300/kW; even with the very low load factors of the project (about 500 hours
per year), the capital cost per kWh is only around US$0.34, and the associated capital
cost per CFL would amount to around US$8.50, for a total of US$22 including O&M and
a net benefit of around US$100 per CFL.
Financial analysis
This analysis concentrates on the returns to the entrepreneurs based upon the sales and
tariffs charged to the consumers. Table A3-5 summarizes the financial results for the
investors based on an average weighted tariff of US$3.30 per month per CFL outlet,
US$5.44 per TV outlet, and US$9.97 per power outlet.

These cash flows yield a NPV of US$61,000 and an IRR of 14%. Considering that the
values are expressed in constant dollars, the financial results can be considered
acceptable, as long as the operators can fully connect the clients to the available outlets
by 2020. The financial viability for the entrepreneurs is also subject to the availability of
subsidies. Without the PERD subsidies, the financial NPV is negative (minus US$1
million) and the IRR is negative too (-2%).

       Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

This is a summary of the “Rapport d’Achèvement du Projet d’Électrification Rurale
Décentralisée” prepared by BERD and dated October 2013.
Project Objectives. These include: training project participants in “learning by doing”
by implementing micro-concessions at the village scale; lifting barriers to developing RE
for village electrification; and providing sustainability to the functions of BERD through
a permanent RE agency (AGER).
Project Components. The project includes three components: training, establishing a
financial mechanism, and project coordination and management.
Project Startup. Reaching project effectiveness required a substantial amount of activity
starting in 2002. The 11-month delay between the signature of the credit agreement in
July 2002 and effectiveness in June 2003 can be explained as follows: (a) Project
ratification by the National Assembly in November 2002; (b) Promulgation of the
ratification law in December 2002; (c) Gazetting in March 2003; (d) Preparing legal
opinions by the Supreme Court in relation to the Credit Agreement and the GEF grant,
the Subsidiary Agreement, and the Project Agreement; (e) Putting in place the Project
Information and Management System; (f) Signature of the Subsidiary Agreement with
BICIGUI (which took the longest).
Component 1: Training and Capacity Development. This component included three
main activities: identification of potential RE partners, support for private operators, and
training of RE participants. Identification of potential partners included the organization
of a database, including: 35 private RE operators, 31 candidates, 31 consulting
organizations (4 foreign), 94 suppliers/installers, 62 civil works companies, and
information on equipment prices. This activity permitted a characterization of potential
operators, by where they were domiciled (most of them proceeded from the targeted
communities), by their level of instruction, and by their corporate organization.
Support for private operators was centered on executing feasibility studies, preparing the
financing and concession applications, following up on the applications, as well as
assisting with procurement, on-site control of project execution, and training for the
management teams. 43 feasibility studies were executed, 35 applications were processed,
of which 30 were approved and financed.
The training of RE participants included: instruction for BERD staff through seminars,
workshops, hands-on instruction with software developed for the project, trips to visit
similar projects and conferences. The training for RE partners was centered on the
management of RE enterprises and was conducted through seven training sessions.
Consulting firms were trained, particularly on the operation of small hydro plants.
Finally, the FERD agents were trained over two sessions on procedures for screening and
processing financial applications.
Component 2: Financial Mechanism. The FERD put in place a procedure for
processing applications which included requirements such as a business plan, a
concession agreement, and guarantees. Applications were processed through: the BERD,
which assessed the technical and economic viability of the project; the BICIGUI, which

                                            35
36assessed the financial viability and the loan guarantees; the API which authorized
fiscal advantages, and the MEH which awarded the concession.
Thirty-five applications were processed for a projected cost of 17.1 billion GNF (around
US$4.1), 4 million of which FERD would provide 4.6 billion GNF (US$1.1 million) in
loans and 9.2 billion GNF (US$2.1 million) in subsidies. Initially, the financing
mechanism was expected to consist of a 20% contribution by the developers, 30%
subsidy and 50% loans; initial cost overruns had to be financed through public funds to
avoid paralyzing the sub-projects, and as a result 16% of financing was contributed by
the operators for the first 12 sub-projects; subsequently a closer follow-up by BERD led
to 21% financing by the operators for the last 17 sub-projects. The final real
disbursements corresponded to 12.1 billion GNF invested (US$3.1 million) of which
FERD contributed 10.1 billion GNF (US$2.6 million).
Loans were initially made at 20% interest in GNF, corresponding to the base banking rate
(17.6% on average) and an additional 0.5% margin. The loans had a grace period for
payment of principal of two years, during which time the operators had to pay interest
and a 10-year term of loan payment.
The first loans were agreed in 2005 and led to problems, due to delays in execution,
which took up to two years in getting resolved. During this period large interest
payments accumulated before electricity sales could take off in the villages and, as a
result, operators started to lag in their loan obligations. Some of the reasons behind this
include the slow materialization of connections by potential clients and management
weaknesses in several operating companies.
The BERD addressed the problem in 2009 through: a restructuring of the loans to FERD
in order to align payments more closely with operating characteristics of the projects; a
closer monitoring of project execution, and following up with the operators to improve
their commercial operation and their respect for financing obligations. The measures
taken by the BERD included the annulment of unpaid interest for the first 17 projects
which had accumulated unpayable balances, a fixed 10% interest rate and a reduction of
loan participation in project development from 50% to 30%, with a corresponding
increase in the subsidy component from 30% to 50%. These measures were disseminated
through a symposium organized in November 2011.

Physical results are summarized according to the number of electrified areas, the number
of available connections, and the connection costs. 29 subprojects were financed and
executed. These 29 subprojects resulted in 14,116 available connections, of which 8,248
were utilized, i.e. an average connection rate of 58.4%. Connection costs varied as
follows: 350,000–600,000 GNF (US$90–154) for 5 subprojects, 600,000–1,000,000 GNF
(US$154–256) for 16 subprojects, and 1,000–1,800,000 GNF (US$256–461) for seven
subprojects.
Component 3: Coordination and Management. Activities of this component can be
organized into six major categories: human resources, finance, procurement,
communication with stakeholders, auditing, and project management and supervision.
At initiation, BERD personnel included 14 staff, supported by consultants that provide
technical assistance through a contract that expired at the end of 2007, through an

                                            36
international resident expert with point-wise assistance from short-term experts. When
the contract expired, the expert’s functions were taken over by one of the two BERD
project engineers. At the end of the project, BERD staff numbered 11 persons, a
reduction that was agreed with the TTL.
Total project expenditures amounted to US$6.51 million, broken down into US$5.32
million from IDA, US$0.43 million from GEF, and US$0.76 million from Government.
At project closure, undisbursed funds amounted to US$0.48 million on the IDA credit
(from a 2007 allocation of US$6.04 million) and US$1.27 million from GEF. With
respect to the original allocations, the principal changes concern the coordination and
management component due to successive project extensions, from US$0.44 million in
2002 to US$1.22 million in 2007; actual disbursements for coordination and management
of the project amounted to US$1.95 million. Counterpart funds from the Government,
initially budgeted at 2.2 billion GNF (US$1.1 million), fell short by 626 million GNF
(around US$0.16 million).
Procurement for goods was performed through NCB (for vehicles) and through National
Shopping, due to the small amounts involved. For consulting services, ICB was
performed for technical assistance and individual consultants. Short-listing was
performed for the selection of the firm in charge of recruiting BERD personnel, the
auditing firm and the firms in charge of supervision of sub-projects and accounting
assistance to operators. It is worth mentioning that one of the project’s difficulties was
associated with the low ceilings for establishing the procurement method; although this
was recognized by both BERD and the Bank, they remained unchanged throughout the
project.
Procurement practices followed by the subproject operators complied with those in use
by the private sector (if found acceptable by the Bank). Given the modest amounts
involved in goods and services procured by the project operators, shopping through
quotations was the rule. This procedure was validated during a Bank mission, which
considered it effective and transparent. To assist operators developing RET projects two
ICB procedures were executed by BERD on their behalf. Four PV projects were
supported by seeking the delivery of equipment through a joint ICB procedure that finally
didn’t succeed due to misrepresentations on the part of the winner of the award. The
other RET project concerned a pico hydro project, for which the procurement conducted
by BERD was truncated due to project termination.
Communication with stakeholders included several initiatives: (a) project promotion -
through workshops, radio and TV programs, newspaper publications, information
dissemination through printed advertising (e.g. calendars and agendas), and a quarterly
BERD bulletin; and (b) direct communications with - potential developers, the Private
Sector National Council and user associations, informal business people, collective
associations, and oil product distributors.
Project auditing took place on an annual basis from the preparatory phase until 2009.
The audits examined the IDA and GEF special account, project expenses, the utilization
of counterpart funds, and recommendations for internal controls. No anomalies were
detected, but several suggestions for improving internal controls were taken into account.


                                           37
Three fiduciary missions took place to validate the accounting information and
management systems as well as the procurement processes.
Project management and supervision took place through six Bank supervision missions,
together with three videoconferences and two follow-up teleconferences. A mid-term
review took place through three missions in 2005, which proposed restructuring the
project to allocate funds for supporting EDG, the national electricity company, which
wasn’t approved. Project extensions were agreed, initially from June 30, 2006 to June 30,
2008 and subsequently to 31 December 2009; after reinitiating the project in mid-2011,
the closing date was extended to June 30, 2013.
Project issues and constraints. These are classified as management constraints and
associated with achieving the performance indicators. Management constraints include:
(a) Mobilization of funds by the operators, which was one of the main causes of delays in
execution, given that it was a prior condition for any disbursement by FERD; (b)
Commercial bank commitment, which can be traced back to the initial negotiation in
which BICIGUI insisted on a fixed remuneration rather than one associated with the
results of its mandate; (c) Delays and amounts in the mobilization of counterpart
Government funds, which impacted the project’s margin of maneuver; (d) The economic
and monetary environment, associated with high inflation and a devaluation of the
Guinean Franc, which led to frequent budget adjustments, in addition to periods when
public funds (including those of the project) were frozen due to limits on public
expenditures set by the IMF and World Bank; (e) Delays in obtaining the exemption of
import duties; (f) The procurement ceiling, set at US$5,000, which required all operations
above this amount to be approved by the Bank; and (g) Delays and uncertainty associated
with the possible restructuring of the project in 2005 that finally didn’t go through.
Limitations in achieving the project performance indicators include: (a) Weak
commitment of certain operators, which resulted in poor planning and operational
problems, together with budget overruns; (b) Delays in client commitment to connect to
the mini grids, which impacted most of the subprojects (the connection rate achieved at
closure was 58%); (c) Delays in client payments which have impacted negatively on the
financial results of several operators; (d) Low consumption of electricity for productive
uses which has led to a sub-utilization of the facilities and a consequent financial
vulnerability of the operators; (e) Increases of fuel prices, which have led to higher
electricity prices and have had a negative impact on demand for subproject services; and
(f) The interruption of disbursements by the Bank, which paralyzed the project, together
with the difficulty in reinitiating the project in mid-2011.
Project perspectives. At the institutional level, the objective consists of putting in place
the Rural Electrification Agency (AGER) as a successor of BERD; this should be
accomplished in the short term with the support of the EU and should facilitate execution
of a rural electrification strategy by internalizing the lessons learnt through the project. It
should also allow the financing of future rural projects by mobilizing funds from donors.
Some lessons learned for developing future projects include technical adjustments,
contracting conditions, and management improvements. With regard to ‘technical’
lessons, the following are worth noting: (a) adjusting demand expectations during project
preparation to the ‘capacity to pay’ of future users; (b) improving the treatment of wood

                                              38
poles to avoid rotting and insect penetration; (c) insistence on realistic projections for the
preparation of business plans; (d) greater concentration on socio-economic studies during
preparation; (e) regular surveys of the norms adopted in order to reflect materials
available in the marketplace; and (f) reinforcing the inspection of procured goods and
equipment, works, and execution according to plans.
With regard to relationships with suppliers, the lessons learned include: (a) setting after-
sales realistic conditions in the supply contracts of generating sets; (b) seeking training of
operator technicians with suppliers; (c) limiting suppliers of generating sets to those
having technical installations in Guinea, and a capability of mobilizing technical teams
on site. With respect to system management, (a) obligation of operators to present BERD
with their management team in order to evaluate their expertise and to eventually provide
training, at least one month before the in service date; (b) requiring operators to follow
strictly the rules set out with their FERD contracts, including the advance prepayment
and depositing all of their income from electricity service into the local CRG account; (c)
requiring and insisting on the production of monthly reports by the operators; (d) seeking
community support for sustaining the service; and (e) engaging local authorities in
assuring the connections and recovering billings, thereby creating economies of scale and
an eventual reduction of tariffs.

Certain improvements are already being put in place as a result of the experience of
project implementation, such as: (a) introducing sensitivity analyses into the feasibility
studies; (b) closer follow-up of the commercial and financial management by the BERD;
(c) promotion of productive uses of electricity through artisanal activities in electrified
communities; (d) motivating micro finance institutions to support RE projects, notably by
financing equipment for productive uses of electricity; (e) seeking the support of oil
companies to facilitate the supply of fuel for the generating sets; and (f) facilitating the
exchange of practices and experiences among operators.

The BERD received a copy of the draft ICR but did not provide any comments.
