                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Further to Bank re-engagement in Guinea and payment of country's arrears, closing date for both IDA and GEF financings was retroactively extended from December 31, 2010 to
                         June 30, 2013. Out of a target of 30 villages, the Project has already electrified 24 villages, but only 70% of households originally targeted for electrification have been reached so
                         far. In 4 villages (out of the 24), power is not being supplied due to either social conflicts related to the project or to management deficiencies by the private operator. The
                         disbursement rate is at 78% for the combined IDA and GEF financings.
