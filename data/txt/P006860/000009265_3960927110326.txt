MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTEtNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A
SMALL-SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Colombia for US$78.2 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan, which would be repayable in 17 years,
including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, would help to finance a small-scale irrigation project.
2.       Background.  About 600,000 ha are presently under irrigation in
Colombia. This is only about 172 of the area that can be technically
irrigated, less than 12 of the total land area and about 22 of the area
presently under agricultural use. About 802 of the existing irrigation
infrastructure (500,000 ha) was developed and is managed and maintained by
the private sector, serving predominantly large farms. Public sector
investment in irrigation began in the 1940s and expanded to cover about
275,000 ha in 25 districts, primarily during the Agrarian Reform push of
the 1960s. However, many of the irrigation systems were not completed due
to the reduced budgetary appropriations for the Agrarian Reform program in
the 19709. This resulted in inadequate water supply, inadequate
maintenance and cost recovery shortfalls. This, in turn, led to the
deterioration of the irrigation districts, so that only about 402 of the
areas in the districts were receiving water by the late 19708 and a large
proportion of the irrigated areas were underutilized, being used for low
value or subsistence crops or for livestock.
3.       With domestic and external demand projections for foodstuffs by
the year 2000 indicating that between 29 and 39 million ha would be
required to be in agricultural production by that year to meet the
additional demand, compared with the 27 million ha now under production,
the Government, with Bank support (Irrigatien Rehabilitation I and IT
Loans), initiated a program to complete and rehabilitate the
25 irrigation/drainage districts and to improve cost recovery. This
approach together with increased emphasis on research to increase
productivity through agricultural intensification and improved yields,
rather than through land development, was considered the most efficient way
to meet the projected demand and increase rural incomes. Also, starting in
the mid-1980s, the Government began to assess the technical and economic
feasibility of small-scale, gravity-type irrigation schemes to raise the
productivity of small farmers, of which there are some 1.8 million in
Colombia with less than 20 ha each. To date, about 17,000 ha have been
developed through small-scale irrigation schemes, of which almost 4,200 ha
have been financed by the Bank as part of a 8,000 ha pilot component
included in the Bank's Irrigation Rehabilitation II Project. Evaluations
of such schemes have been positive. The schemes have: (a) been
effectively planned and constructed; (b) low investment costs (US$1,200 per
ha); (c) significantly increased productivity and income of the poorer
segments of the Colombian farmer population; (d) reduced crop and market



- 2 -
risk associated with agroclimatic conditLons and cyclical production
patterns; and Ce) promoted community involvement in their construction,
operation and maintenance. Implementation problems identified, i.e., need
for training in optimal water usage, improper utiliszation of some on-farm
irrigation equipment and the insufficiency of technical assistance are
being tackled by HIMAT and are specifically addressed under the proposed
project. HIMAT, the main implementing agency for the proposed project, has
nationwide responsibility for public sector irrigation and drainage in
Colombia. HIKAT is an efficient institution with a well-deserved
reputation for sound engineering. It is well managed and has a relatively
small but well motivated staff. It has been adequately funded, mainly
through budget transfers and external oorrowing. Inadequate recovery of
irrigation investments and operating costs is one of the weaknesses which
is being addressed under an ongoing Bank loan to HIMAT and would also be
addressed under the proposed project. Other areas which need strengthening
in connection with the small-scale irrigation program are staffing,
monitoring and evaluation, and interinstitutional coordination.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project supports the
Bank's dual strategy for the agricultural sector of promoting efficient.
growth, and alleviating rural poverty. Specifically, the project would
build on results of a recently completed irrigation subsector analysis, by
helping to ensure that: (a) sound and efficiency-based criteria are
established and applied for the selection of areas to receive irrigation
infrastructure; (b) measures are taken to achieve greater involvement of
corunity in the construction, financing, operation and maintenance of
irrigation schemes; (c) continued attention is given to improving cost
recovery and to rationalizing public sector outlays in irrigation; and
(d) environmentally sound methods are employed in the use of water
resources and the introduction of irrigated agricultural practices onto
small farms. It would also help to ensure the sound development of the
environmentally fragile La Mojana area for agricultural purposes.
5.       Project Obiectives.  The major objectives of the project would be
to: (a) increase agricultural productivity and cropping intensity and
therefore rural incomes of about 43,000 small-scale farmers; (b) reduce
market risks by smoothing out production throughout the year; lc) develop
the technological base for the future development of La Hojans Region;
(d) improve cost recovery from public sector investment in irrigation and
thereby reduce the subsidy to water users for fiscal as well as for
resource allocation purposes; and (e) strengthen coammnity participation in
the construction, financing, operation and management of the irrigation
schemes.
6.       Project Description.  The project would provide supplementary
irrigation for about 43,000 farmers in about 60,000 ha over a six-year
period by financing: (a) the off-farm irrigation infrastructure and road
repair investments needed to establish some 850 small-scale irrigation
schemes, each ranging between 20 and 300 ha in size, with each beneficiary
receiving irrigation on an average of 1.4 ha; (b) the on-farm irrigation
infrastructure and the incremental on-farm agricultural investment required
to efficiently use irrigation; this would be financed through credit
provided by local sources; (c) technology improvement and transfer
comprising: (i) applied field research by the Colombian Agricultural
Institute (ICA) for the validation of technological packages for



- 3 -
irrigation; (ii) incremental extension services by Caja Agraria and other
extension agencies; and (iii) community training programs in operating and
maintaining the irrigation schemes; (d) an institutional strengthening
program for HIMAT, Caja Agrari*, the Colombian Institute for Agraria Reform
(INCORA), ICA, the National Apprenticeship Service (SEMA) and the National
Institute for Renewable Natural Resources (INDERENA) which would comprise:
(i) 42 nanlmonths of consultant services for organization and management,
community support and monitoring and evaluation for HIMAT; (ii) local and
e-ternal training for staff of HDMAT and the other agencies; and
(iii) vehicles and equipment for HIMAT; (e) soil conservation activities in
the proposed project areas and INDERENA's incremental operating costs;
(f) studies, consultant services and field tri.ls to ascertain the
agricultural potential of La Mojana area, and the type of agriculture that
could be developed while avoiding damage to the environment. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$196.0 million equivalent, of which
the Bank would finance US$78.2 million (40X), equivalent to the foreign
exchange component. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of jisbursements,
together with the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Colombia are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map
is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7624-CO dated July 11, 1989,
is also attached.
7.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government in regard to ensuring the availability of credit from
Caja Agraria and the Agricultural Financing Fund (FFAP) for beneficiaries
of the irrigation schemes. It was agreed that an adverse change in present
agricultural interest rate policy would be a condition of default.
Assurances were also obtained that HIMAT would: (c) adopt and use for the
duration of the project the criteria to be applied for the selection of
irrigation subprojects and for road repair, including accessibility of the
areas for the purposes of execution and supervision; (d) enter into a Road
Maintenace Agreement with the Municipalities where roads are to be improved
or repaired; (e) submit by September 30, 1989 and December 31, 1989 final
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank for project evaluation and
institutional development consultants, respectively, and employ the
consultants by March 31, 1990; and (f) submit to the Bank annual work and
operational training programs and progress repo2ts, and bi-annual project
evaluation reports. Conditions of effectiveness would be that: (a) the
Borrower has entered into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with HIMAT,
satisfactory to the Bank; (b) HIMAT submits to the Bank final contractual
agreements and letters of understanding between HDMAT and the implementing
and extension agencies; and (c) HIMAT has formally approved the Manual
establishing the technical criteria for selection of subprojects and cost
recovery policies and mechanisms, i.e., full recovery of operation and
maintenance (O&M) irrigation costs and of on-farm investment costs, and the
recovery of at least 202 of off-farm irrigation infrastructure costs.
8.       Benefits.  The major benefits of the project would be of three
types. First, the project would help increase incomes and reduce crop and
price fluctuations for about 43,000 small farmers. Second, the project
would expand agricultural production of primarily food crops and some
export and import-substitution commodities and increase crop



diversification into higher value crops. Third, the project would rosult
in the reduction of public sector subsidies for irrigation and improve
rsozurce allocatiu. The expected Eli for thc project would be 23S.
9.       Risks. The economic risk of the project appears to be low. The
main risk would * slower-than-expoctcd transition towards more intensive
land use if satisfectory levels of technical assistance are not achieved.
The extension and research component under the project should mitigate this
risk. Likewise the availability of credit could be a risk. However, the
risk would be minimised by the very small size of the credit requireents
in relation to total agricultural credit, and by the strengthening of
extension services under the projoct. A secondary risk relates to the
possibility that the selection of areas and individuals would be biased in
favor of larger farmers In view of the expected high profitability of
small-scale irrigation, This risk would be minmisoed through the regular
supervision of the application of the agreed selection criterLa.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommnd that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
