each with infrastructure, public services, and\n            social facilities and will strengthen their economic role\n            and fiscal position. The main categories of investment will\n            be street paving, storm drainage, water and electricity\n            distribution, street lighting, sewage disposal facilities,\n            slum upgrading, schools and kindergartens, health posts,\n            community centers and sport grounds. Equipment will be\n            purchased to improve and maintain farm-to-market roads and\n            to expand local stone quarries; vehicles will be procured to\n            convey children to school; and technical assistance will be\n            extended, mainly by state corporations and utility\n            companies. The project is likely to induce rural migrants to\n            settle in these towns, instead of crowding into the larger centers."}, "docdt": "1983-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
