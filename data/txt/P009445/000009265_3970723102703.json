damage due to floods;\n            (b) to improve the physical environment to allow farmers to\n            adopt improved agricultural practices; and (c) to strengthen\n            the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). The project\n            will consist of three sub-projects (Gumti Phase I, Naogoan\n            Polder I and Madhumati-Nabaganga), covering an area of\n            104,500 ha under flood control and drainage (FCD) and 14,350\n            ha under irrigation. About 115,000 farm families or about\n            670,000 people will benefit. The project will include: (i)\n            the construction and rehabilitation of embankments, water\n            control structures, drainage channels and irrigation\n            facilities and the upgrading of roads; (ii) support to BWDB\n            to improve the planning, design, and monitoring of FCD\n            projects, and to improve land acquisition and operation and\n            maintenance procedures; and (iii) the preparation of\n            programs for the further development of agriculture and\n            fisheries within the project area."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
