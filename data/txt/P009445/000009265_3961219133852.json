The project as\n            designed at appraisal included some components which had to\n            be dropped later as uneconomic. Some lessons learned\n            included: land acquisition compensations should be based on\n            land value market studies and the land acquisition system\n            itself ought to be carefully planned and the bureaucratic\n            process streamlined before  project negotiations or credit\n            effectiveness; board presentation prior to detailed\n            engineering investigation and design increases the risk of\n            need to modify project components and of pre-construction\n            delays; and timely preparation of an appropriate O&M\n            plan and adequate funding for its implementation are\n            essential to ensure sustainability of project-supported investment."}, "docdt": "1996-09-04T00:00:00Z"}
