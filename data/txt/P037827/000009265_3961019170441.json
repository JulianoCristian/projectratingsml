health status of the population throughout all districts,\n            with a specific target of reducing infant and maternal\n            mortality by about 30 percent over a four year period.\n            Improved health status will result from achieving the\n            following four objectives: 1) improving quality and\n            sustainability of primary health care, including preventive\n            measures; 2) increasing cost-effectiveness and coverage of\n            government health and family planning services; 3)\n            strengthening the capacity of the health sector; and 4)\n            building institutional capacity. The project will comprise\n            four main components: 1) strengthening of community and\n            nongovernmental organization participation; 2) strengthening\n            government health services; 3) human resource development;\n            and 4) management and organizational development."}, "docdt": "1996-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
