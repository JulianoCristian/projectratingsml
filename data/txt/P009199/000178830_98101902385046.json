promotion of export-oriented subprojects.\n            The project also includes a pilot type component to support\n            the Government program for energy savings and increased use\n            of domestic energy resources in industry in the two\n            Republics. This will involve a program of studies to\n            identify energy conservation/conversion subprojects which\n            may be financed under this or subsequent industrial credits.\n            Other objectives of the project are to contribute to the\n            institution building of the borrowing banks and to encourage\n            joint ventures and cofinancing. The project also includes a\n            technical assistance component of $300,000, which will be\n            equally split between the Borrowers, to identify and develop\n            energy conservation/conversion subprojects in industry."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
