3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The development objective of this $14 million credit was to provide, in conjunction with other
components of an IDA/IDB Emergency Package, a rapid infusion of liquidity to support the
closing of the government's end-of-year $94 million fiscal gap. The fiscal gap was due to the
result of both unexpected lower tax collections and higher expenditures. These unexpected
changes were largely in part due to the ongoing sociopolitical tensions that had led to frequent
episodes of civil unrest over the last 2 1/2 years, escalating in February 2003, and culminating in
October 2003 with riots that caused the death of close to a hundred civilians and the subsequent
resignation of President Sanchez de Lozada. These tensions slowed down the economy and led
the government to compensate sectors of the economy directly affected by the social unrest, e.g.,
the families of the protest victims. In addition, the drop in external financing (amounting to
0.1% of the overall deficit in terms of GDP) had largely resulted from the government's difficult
situation to produce a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which in turn led to postpone the
Bank's $30 million planned Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit and the IMF's Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility.

The primary purpose of this emergency package was to provide assistance to the government in
financing its domestic public service obligations (i.e. wages and salaries of civil servants). It also
helped finance ongoing reforms and programs in the social sectors to support the poor and
vulnerable, thus mitigating the possibility of further civil unrest, which given the circumstances
could have spiralled into an uncontrollable disruption of Bolivia's social stability and democracy.

As such, this credit was integral part of the Bank's short-term strategy (articulated in the
February 2004 CAS) to provide the new administration headed by President Mesa with the
necessary support to build a forward looking and sustainable strategy to address the country's
pressing social and developmental challenges.

3.2 Revised Objective:

No change in the objectives of the project was made.

3.3 Original Components:

This credit's sole component was to provide financing (retroactively) against a list of foreign
goods (whether or not directly imported by the Government), including medicines, agricultural
machinery (tractors), and diesel oil/gasoline, which could not be financed through the existing
Bank portfolio or by other donors.

The Bank complemented this loan with additional financial contribution by accelerating to end of
December 2003: i) the pending second tranche of a $10 million of an existing Social Safety Net
credit; and, ii) $20 million towards the funding of wages and salaries of civil servants from the
ongoing Bolivia Institutional Reform project. In addition, the IDB contributed financial support
to financing the fiscal gap through a $50 million Enhanced Competitive loan.

3.4 Revised Components:

The Credit's sole component was not revised.



                                                 - 2 -

3.5 Quality at Entry:

Overall quality at entry was Satisfactory. Despite the speed with which the operation was put into
place the documentation was well prepared and well received at the Board. The project had full
government ownership. Even though the Emergency Recovery instrument was not fully tailored
to the operation requested, project design enabled over 60% of the credit to disburse before the
end of the year as programmed. As is mentioned in Section 8, Lessons Learned, this credit set the
background for the Bank to revise its lending policy when confronted with socioeconomic crises
such as the one presented by Bolivia at the end of 2003.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

Satisfactory. The project achieved its objective of providing financial support to close the end of
fiscal year fiscal gap. However, due to Government problems in retrieving the required receipts
against the retroactive positive list of imports that had been agreed upon during negotiations,
only $10 million of the original $14 million credit was disbursed. The bulk of this disbursement
($8.5 million) took place before the end of the fiscal year as originally programmed and thus
effectively contributed to provide part of the necessary liquidity transfer to help close the
government's end of year fiscal gap.

Upon request of the government this credit was extended for an additional 4 months, to close
end of June 2004, in order for the government to retrieve additional receipts for the project to
disburse against. Between the request for extension and the closing date, an additional $1.5
million was disbursed which helped finance the government ongoing social agenda, including
social safety net programs, and programs aimed at reducing inequality in education, health and
water and sanitation across municipalities, ethnic groups and income levels.

4.2 Outputs by components:

Satisfactory. The disbursed amount, as an integral part of the IDA/IDB emergency package, did
provide the necessary liquidity to allow the government to meet its end-of-year domestic
financial obligations (i.e., wages and salaries) and maintain critical ongoing social agenda,
including social safety net programs as well as programs aimed at reducing inequality in
education, health and water and sanitation across municipalities, ethnic groups and income
levels.

The inability to fully disburse retroactively against an agreed positive list of imports raised the
question on the appropriateness/efficacy of the use of this instrument in a moment of
sociopolitical crisis. Since the Social Safety Net as well as the Institutional Reform credits had
already been fully utilized to address the fiscal gap (and the IDBs $50 million Enhanced
Competitive Loan was in place), Bank management was left with no other alternative within the
ongoing IDA portfolio and the existing pipeline to fill the remaining $14 million other than think
creatively and push the envelope on available Bank instruments. For example, the use of a new
adjustment operation was openly discussed, but it was deemed too difficult to design given the



                                                - 3 -

fact that new conditionality not already associated with other planned operations was absent.
Against this background, it was decided to opt for an Emergency Recovery credit although Bank
management had its reservations on the efficacy of using such an instrument as defined in OP/BP
8.50 in order to provide fast disbursing money. Indeed, a waiver to the definition of OP 8.50 as
part of the proposed approval of this operation was presented to the Board since it was
recognized that Emergency Recovery assistance programs as defined in OP 8.50 did not strictly
apply to the ongoing economic and political situation in Bolivia.

Based on the initial reservations and the ensuing Board discussion which approved the project on
an Exceptional Basis, Bank senior Management has recently reviewed its policies for Bank
support in gap-filling situations during periods of sociopolitical crisis (see section 8: Lessons
Learned).

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

The Vice-Ministry of Public Investment and External Finance (VIPFE), the implementing agency
for this credit, depended on other agencies, some completely decentralized, such as the Cajas de
Salud and the Bolivian Oil Company, to provide the supporting documents/receipts for this
project to disburse against. Some of these receipts were either difficult to find or had
disappeared given the poor capacity in record keeping of these entities. Because of this, the full
amount of the project was not fully disbursed against the positive list of imports (in this case,
agricultural equipment and machinery, medicines and medical equipment and gasoline and
fuel-oil) that was agreed upon during negotiations.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

There was very little that the government could control to affect implementation and outcome of
this operation within the limited time horizon of the project (three weeks from concept to
disbursement). Beyond the horizon of the project, the government was able to put in place a
fiscally sound public program supported by an IMF Stand-by Arrangement (SBA). The fact that
the government will close the 2004 fiscal year having met all the fiscal quantitative performance
criteria set by the IMF's ongoing SBA is a case in point.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

VIPFE, within its limited staffing capacity, was very efficient in securing (and vetting) the
required receipts for Bank approval.          It spent a lot of its staff resources in seeking that the



                                                     - 4 -

project disburse on a timely basis, i.e., before the end of the government's fiscal year. Despite
these efforts, the decentralized nature of the agencies that could provide disbursement
documentation impeded full disbursement of the credit.

5.4 Costs and financing:

Not Applicable

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:


Likely. This operation, together with the wider Emergency Package put together at the time,
effectively closed the $94 million end of year fiscal gap and helped prevent possible further civil
unrest and thus mitigate the sociopolitical tensions. The Emergency Package ultimately secured a
buffer for the new administration of President Mesa to start building on a clean slate, together
with the IMF, the support of the IFIs and the international donor community, a fiscally sound and
sustainable program for the new fiscal year. It must be noted that the Emergency Package clearly
served as a backstop to the ongoing and pipeline program of the Bank, as defined in the February
2004 CAS, to support the new administration of President Mesa in providing the necessary
framework to the future macroeconomic stability of the country.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

This credit served as a simple stop-gap measure operation.          Given its three week horizon,
transition arrangements for the project's operation were not applicable. The project operated
within the three week horizon with operational arrangements (mainly a disbursement mechanism)
that were tailored to accomplish the objective of the project (and the Emergency Package).

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Satisfactory. The project resulted from a crisis situation and it was put together in record time,
two weeks from concept to Board discussion, in order to meet with the government's end of fiscal
year financing requirements. The Bank at the time did not have a suitable lending instrument to
confront emergencies as the one presented by the Bolivian crisis and went beyond its call of duty
to present an operation that could be legitimately presented to the Board for approval.

7.2 Supervision:

Highly Satisfactory. Supervision of this project was exemplary thanks to the services rendered
by the Bank's Fiduciary Specialists, in particular Financial Management, which ensured that the
receipts matched against the retroactive list of imports. Very close supervision ensured that the
funds disbursed went to cover only for past accounted expenditures.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:




                                                  - 5 -

Highly Satisfactory. The Bank was able to put together and send to the Board for approval an
operation in record time, and to supervise its disbursements in an exemplary fashion.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Satisfactory. The Borrower effectively formulated its strategy to meet the financing gap and
identified the positive list of imports against which the project was to disburse. It also placed
considerable effort into implementing the project.

Nevertheless, the positive list of imports proposed by the borrower and negotiated with the Bank
proved less than ideal since: i) the amount committed did not fully disburse by the end of the CY
as originally envisaged in the project design; and, ii) at project closure, 30% of the project
remained undisbursed. In essence, failure of producing timely receipts acceptable to the Bank
prevented the project from disbursing all of its commitments. Once again, however, one must be
reminded of the speed of the operation.          At the time, nobody could have predicted the
unacceptability to the Bank/unavailability of a portion of the required receipts.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Satisfactory. Within the less than ideal list of imports, VIPFE's performance was highly effective.
VIPFE was critical in helping put together in record time the list of positive imports agreed upon
in the Grant Agreement. Implementation, i.e., collection of receipts for Bank to disburse against,
was done within the limits of their capacity. VIPFE managed to collect enough receipts to
disburse over 70% of the loan (60% before the end of the FY and the remaining amount between
January-June 2004) despite the clear difficulties presented by the poor record keeping capacity of
the some of the decentralized government organizations which handled the purchase of the agreed
upon goods.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

The Government, through VIPFE, was the implementing agency (see above).

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:


Satisfactory. Considering the response to the crisis situation, the speed with which the project
was put together, and the limited record keeping capacity that became apparent within the
decentralized government organizations, the Borrower's performance is rated satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned


It was clear from the outset that use of the Emergency Recovery Loan instrument as defined in
OP/BP 8.50 was to pose challenges both internally (at the Board) and with the client (in terms of
providing fast disbursment) given that the instrument was not designed to provide fast disbursing
liquidity transfers.

Based on the shortcomings of this experience, OPCS has now devised a new policy, under the


                                                 - 6 -

new Development Policy Lending guidelines, to adress crisis and post conflict situations where
there may not be sufficent time or country capacity to adequately adress design considerations or
a strong policy program developed with stakeholder consultation. It has now been established by
OPCS that in such situations, development policy lending (rather than investment lending as was
used in this case) is justified on an exceptional basis.

* The Emergency Economic Recovery Project was an integral part of the Emergency Package put
together by the Bank and the IDB to close the fiscal deficit gap, which at the time was projected at $94
million (See Table 3 of Technical Annex for EERP credit). Although the EERP only disbursed $8.5
million by the end of December 2003, the other credits that composed the Emergency Package (SSN, BIR
and ECL) disbursed the required amounts (SSN and ECL were adjustment operations which simply
accelerated their one tranche disbursement to the end of the year and the BIR, an investment operation,
revised its components and was able to disburse against wages and salaries of public employees) and
were able to cover the full amount of the fiscal deficit gap, which ultimately proved to be a little less than
the initially projected $94 million.
