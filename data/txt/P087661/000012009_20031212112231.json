exclusion, support macroeconomic stability - this Emergency\n            Economic Recovery Project, structured as an emergency\n            recovery operation in recognition of the crisis nature of\n            the long-standing socioeconomic tensions that have led to\n            frequent episodes of civil unrest, will provide support to\n            the poor and vulnerable, by making available external funds\n            for critical foreign goods (whether or not directly imported\n            by the Government), including medicines, agricultural\n            machinery (tractors), and diesel oil/gasoline. Quick\n            disbursing financing will be provided for critical goods for\n            reconstruction, economic recovery and mitigation of the\n            social crisis, and for financial management, consistent with\n            the emergency nature of this operation, these arrangements\n            have been simplified and streamlined to the extent feasible.\n            However, risks remain, above all, the presence of radical\n            elements among the union-indigenous movement opposed to the\n            current political environment, and, the unsure political\n            power to ensure new legislation. In addition, civil service\n            capacity constraints may undermine implementation of new\n            policies, and, the gas referendum may prove difficult to implement."}, "docdt": "2003-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
