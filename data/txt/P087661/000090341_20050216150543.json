The\n            lessons learned indicate that it was clear from the outset\n            that the use of the Emergency Recovery Loan instrument was\n            to pose challenges both internally (at the Board) and with\n            the client (in terms of providing fast disbursement) given\n            that the instrument was not designed to provide fast\n            disbursing liquidity transfers. Based on the shortcomings of\n            this experience, OPCS has now devised a new policy, under\n            the new Development Policy Lending guidelines, to address\n            crisis and post conflict situations where there may not be\n            sufficient time or country capacity to adequately address\n            design considerations or a strong policy program developed\n            with stakeholder consultation. It has now been established\n            by OPCS that in such situations, development policy lending\n            (rather than investment lending as was used in this case) is\n            justified on an exceptional basis."}, "docdt": "2004-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
