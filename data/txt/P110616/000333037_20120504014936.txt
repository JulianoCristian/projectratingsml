                            RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      The change proposed is the reallocation of the Grant proceeds to enable the
project to finance (a) a gap for Health Equity Funds (HEFs) in five districts of target
provinces; (b) a gap for free deliveries in two pilot districts; and (c) the renovation of
the roof and other leaks at the Friendship Hospital so that the hospital can be fully
functional. The funds required for these will be reallocated from categories 3, 4, 7 to
categories 1, 2 and 6. The Disbursement Table in Section 1 of Schedule 1 to the Grant
Agreement will be amended to reflect these changes.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      Progress towards the Project Development Objective (PDO) is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory, and Implementation Progress is rated as Satisfactory. To
date the overall disbursement amount is US$ 16.36 million of which US$ 15.4 million
is from the H1830-LA Grant. Overall implementation is on track to meet the extended
closing date of June 30, 2012, and the Development Objectives.

3.       Most activities have been completed successfully such as the upgrading of
health infrastructure (integrated community health centers, district hospitals, and
provincial hospital), and training of health staff (community midwives, primary health
care workers, and family medicine interns). Together with system-wide improvements
such as the implementation of a new health management information system, these
activities have enabled the provision of a minimum package of health services.
Equitable utilization of health services by the rural poor has increased through support
to HEFs and the piloting of free deliveries in two districts.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Background

4.     The PDO, which is to assist the Lao PDR to increase utilization and quality of
health services, particularly for poor women and children in rural areas of Project
Provinces, remains relevant and unchanged.

5.      During the restructure to extend the closing date for this source of financing
by one year, it was anticipated that the additional financing being sought for this
Project would become effective by July 2011. However the additional financing only
became effective on January 4, 2012. The proposed reallocation is necessary to
provide financing for the HEFs, pilot free deliveries and finalizing renovations to the
Friendship (Mittaphab) Hospital.

6.     To date the HEF Implementing Agency- the Swiss Red Cross/Lao Red Cross -
has been covering the administrative costs of these HEFs, but not the provider and
beneficiary payments: estimated at US$92,000.
7.    The reallocation will allow for the payment for free deliveries in the two
(Nong and Thapanthong) pilot Districts for the period April to December 2011.

8.      The Ministry of Health has committed to finance the gap, as well as the sum of
approximately of US$148,606 to renovate the roof and internal leaks to the lower
floors of the Friendship (Mittaphab) Hospital so that it can be fully functional and
operational prior to the closing date of June 30, 2012 for this source of financing. The
proposed repairs will have no major adverse environmental impact during the
implementation as the scope of works will only involve extending the building roof
with metal sheets. No new safeguard policies are triggered.

Reallocation

9.    The proposed reallocation of Grants proceeds involves reallocation from
Category 3 (Training, workshop and study tours), Category 4 (Consultant’s Services),
and Category 7 (Operating Cost) to Category 1 (Civil works), Category 2 (Goods),
Category 5(b) (District Sub Grant), and Category 6 (Sub-Grant under Health Equity
Fund) as follows:
