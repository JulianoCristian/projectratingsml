                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Bank team notes that the NBI has made progress on the delivery of the ISP in the last several months and the three NBI centers are now more focused on key deliverables.

                         However, the Bank does remain concerned with the quality and timeliness of the delivery of the ISP. To date, though 56% of the overall US$24.02 million Grant has been expended,
                         progress towards delivery of key outputs under the four operational ISP components remains delayed
