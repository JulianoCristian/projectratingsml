                         since the Mid Term Review due to the dedication and leadership of the senior staff. All three Centres have solid foundations, with ENTRO and NELSAP-CU already established but
                         stronger due to ISP, and the Secretariat basically establishing itself as an institution in the four years of ISP. The project is rated satisfactory for achievement of the objective and
                         implementation progress. This reflects the substantial progress made to strengthen the institutional and financial basis as well as to strengthen the technical and management
                         capacity. Assessment against the projects' results framework shows that the majority of indicators will be fully achieved at objective and outcome levels. There are a few key

                         deliverables remaining which require attention from the three Centres and are on track to be completed. Despite the success of ISP, there are issues beyond the influence of the
                         project that could jeopardize NBI's institutional sustainability. ENTRO is currently particularly vulnerable due to the implications of non-participation by two of its Member States.
