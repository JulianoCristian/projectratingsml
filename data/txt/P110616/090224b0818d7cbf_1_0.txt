                         but stronger due to ISP, and the Secretariat transformed as a technical institution within the four years of ISP. Each of the Centres is unique and whilst each forms part of the NBI,
                         they have been strengthened to reflect their role and needs within the boundaries of decisions by their respective governance bodies. This substantial progress has been attained
                         due to the dedication and leadership of the senior staff and with all staff contributing to ISP’s success.

                         The ISP’s NBTF budget of US$24m is virtually 100% spent. This demonstrates the sound financial management of ISP resources to maximise the value of the project to the NBI.
                         External audits have been unqualified for the last three years.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is rated satisfactory for achievement of the objective and implementation progress. Assessment against the project’s results framework shows that the majority of
                         indicator targets have been fully achieved at objective and outcome levels. In addition, an assessment of the institutional and financial basis as well as to technical and operational
                         capacity has been undertaken for each Centre. All three are broadly considered to be ‘fit for purpose’ within their given mandates and the direction of their governance bodies.
