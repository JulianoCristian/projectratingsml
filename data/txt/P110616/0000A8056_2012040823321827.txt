                         review in October 2011. During a difficult and busy time for the NBI, the organization has made great progress towards implementing the ISP Mid-Term Review Action Plan, with
                         almost all activities complete by the time of this mission. On this basis, the project rating has been upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory. Deliverables are on track, but the project
                         extension planned since the MTR is still urgently awaiting approval by the World Bank so that the project does not close on March 31, 2012. The pending approval of the extension is
                         a key project risk.
