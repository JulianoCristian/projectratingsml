                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation continues to make good progress: (a) significant pilots were observed on all three areas of health financing, service delivery, and public health; (b) most
                         indicators have exceeded the targets; (c) experiences in project provinces have directly contributed to the formulation of government policy; (d) based on the project's exit strategy, 5
                         counties were identified as the slowest performers and were asked to take remedial actions for 6 months and be re-evaluated early of this year by Center of Project Supervision and
                         Management(CPSM) of MoH and by the World Bank team during the supervision. The 5 slowest performance counties have completed their ratification plan and met the ratification
                         targets. As a result, it was agreed during the mission that all the 5 counties remain in the project; (e) disbursement has increased by 15% by the mission and increased to 85% by
                         July 20th; and (g) the fiduciary review found that Bankâ€™ s policy was followed.

                         Moving forward, implementation will focus on summarization and dissemination of project experiences and lessons learned. The dissemination strategy, with key approaches and
                         responsibilities laid out, has been developed and presented to the provinces and counties. The end-of-project household survey and institution survey are being planned. The surveys
                         are planned to be conducted in conjunction with the National household health utilization survey which is conducted every five years and to be done in the late fall of this year.
