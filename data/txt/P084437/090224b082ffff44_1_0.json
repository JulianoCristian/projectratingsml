performance by\n            the Bank, and satisfactory performance by the borrower. The\n            lessons learned were: (1) the project was able to capitalize\n            the existence of a policy environment favorable to rural\n            health reform and push the envelope, delving into difficult\n            issues such as provider payment and incentives. (2) The\n            implementation of a complex reform project in such a large\n            number of counties and provinces undermined the\n            effectiveness of the project. (3) Capacity building and\n            strategic thinking has enhanced the project\u2019s impact and its\n            long-term sustainability. (4) The Results Framework should\n            include lower level indicators that can be regularly\n            monitored using routine data from the management information\n            system. (5) By focusing on evaluation, documentation and\n            dissemination of experiences, results and lessons learned,\n            the project transferred knowledge and fostered a culture of\n            evidence-based decision-making."}, "docdt": "2015-06-22T10:12:00Z"}
