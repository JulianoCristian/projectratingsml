                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continued to make progress in implementation in the first half of 2014 and is well on track to achieving the Project Development Objectives. The end-line household
                         survey which was completed in late 2013 has re-confirmed the project achievements in the following three areas: (i) increased use of health services, decreased out of pocket
                         expenses by patient, and improved equity of health services; (ii) increased health financing resources for the rural population and improved public health management; and (iii)
                         improved technical quality of care, internal efficiency in service delivery, and rate of overall satisfaction with the rural health services.

                         There are no outstanding issues in fiduciary and safeguards aspects. A procurement post review and a financial management review by the Bank staff are planned for August 2014.

                         By June 30, 2014, US$48.134 million or 96.32% of the loan proceeds has been disbursed. The Center for Project Supervision and Management (CPSM) has advised the Project
                         Offices at provincial and county level to accelerate the reimbursement process, including the process of preparing and submitting withdrawal applications to the Bank. It is expected
                         that funds from the loan will be fully utilized before the Project Closing Date of December 31, 2014.
