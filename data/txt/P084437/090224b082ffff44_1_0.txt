  At the beginning of the Project, 13 project counties already had C-section rates below the WHO standard
of 15% and 10 of them had rates below 10%. That is, they had an underuse of the procedure and a positive
trend would have been to increase in the C-section rates to around 15%. At the end of the Project, five out of
these 10 counties increased C-section rates from underuse to overuse, i.e., their rates surpassed 15% by a
non-negligible amount. In another four counties, rates changed little, and in one county, the rate declined to
4.4 compared to 7.1% at baseline. At the onset of the Project, 26 counties had rates higher than the WHO
standard and a positive trend would have been to reduce their rates. Among these counties, 38% managed
some reductions, but most have rates that are still considerably higher than 15%. Since progress towards the
target can be either an increase or decrease in the rate, the average rate is not a meaningful measure. It would
not capture the Project’s achievements and efforts. Indeed, the objective of the indicator was not well
understand by many Project counties. Further interventions needed to address the problem of misuse of C-
sections, would have had to be tailored to each county depending on whether it was over or underusing the
procedure. This was not done.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     China witnessed a remarkable period of rapid growth in shifting from a
centrally planned to a market based economy. Income per capita increased on average
8.5 percent annually from 1980–2007, more than in any other country.7 China’s economic
miracle, which lifted approximately 640 million people above the international poverty line
of $1.25/day, was pivotal in reducing global poverty from 1.5 billion people in the early
1980s to 800 million today.1,8

2.      This period of unprecedented growth was, at least in part, due to health
policies that yielded marked improvements in health outcomes in the preceding
decades. Starting in the 1950s, through the deployment of “barefoot doctors” and other
programs, China made substantial inroads in improving public health, resulting in a rapid
decline in child mortality, from 225 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1960 to under 64 per
1,000 by 1980.1 Declines in child mortality and the accompanying reduction in the fertility
rate, increased the portion of the working-age group in population and contributed to
reducing the dependency ratio, spurring economic growth. Paradoxically, the fast pace of
improvements in health status achieved from 1950–1980—when China had a worse
relative position in the world in terms of its per capita income, economic growth and health
infrastructure—was not matched during its economy’s strongest period of growth.2
Economic gains did not translate into health improvements for the entire Chinese
population. The transition from a collective economy to a market economy resulted in the
collapse of the commune-based cooperative medical scheme (CMS), which was the main
source of health financing for the rural population. By 2003, eighty percent of China’s
rural population was not covered by any health insurance.

3.     By the turn of the millennia, the Government of China (GOC) had become
increasingly aware of the challenges it faced in the health sector and began to
formulate a series of policy initiatives to address them. The Government’s 2002 Paper
“Decision on Further Strengthening Rural Health Work” laid the foundation for a new
health financing system for rural areas, which included the New Cooperative Medical
Scheme (NCMS) and the Medical Assistance Scheme (MA) as cornerstones. The 11th Five
Year Plan for the period of 2006-2010 promoted “balanced development” and health sector
development, particularly in rural areas, was one of the priorities of the Plan. The
Government also launched a number of system wide health reforms—such as a
comprehensive payment system reform, regional health service integration and
development of multilevel management platform for prevention and treatment of
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)—though progress in implementation of these reforms

was modest. More comprehensive reforms would be needed to overcome existing
challenges and achieve the stated objectives of containing costs and improving provider
performance.

4.      At appraisal in 2008, the project identified four major challenges faced by the
health sector: (a) persistence of significant health inequalities—for example, the maternal
mortality ratio in the poorest quintile was three times higher than in the richest quintile; (b)
decreasing affordability of health care as indicated by increasing out-of-pocket spending
for health care and more people falling into poverty due to health spending; (c) poor quality
and inefficiencies in the health system, with unnecessary prescriptions and longer-than-
needed hospital stays; and (d) weaknesses in execution of public health functions, as
evidenced by the response to the 2003 SARs outbreak. Pilots financed under the project
would test innovative approaches to address these challenges.

5.      The project was aligned with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for China 2006–2010 (Report No. 35435) discussed by the Board of
Directors on May 23, 2006 and the GOC’s co-terminus 11th Five Year Plan.
Specifically, the project was expected to contribute to the CPS outcomes of (a)
strengthened social insurance, including rural health insurance, and (b) increased and more
appropriate use of health services, especially among the rural poor. The rationale for the
World Bank’s involvement was twofold. First, the World Bank had in-depth knowledge of
the country, built through its long-standing partnership with the GOC in the health sector,
dating back to the early 1980s and involving ten health sector operations. Second, the
World Bank brought global knowledge from working with client countries on topics
relevant to China, such as health insurance, provider payment methods, and delivery of
quality NCD care. Indeed, in preparation for the 11th five-year plan, the GOC had requested
World Bank’s assistance in carrying out an extensive program of Analytic and Advisory
Activities (AAA) to capitalize on the ability of the World Bank to draw on international
experiences relevant to a middle-income. More so than the incremental financing it
generated,9 the value-added of the project was to test various policy options and develop
new approaches that can be expanded nationwide to strengthen the health system so it can
more effectively address the changing health needs of the population.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

6.      The PDO was to achieve increased and more equitable access to quality health
services, improved financial protection, and better management of public health threats in
pilot provinces and counties, with lessons to support reforms in non-project areas. The
project’s results were measured through seven PDO indicators and 15 intermediate results
indicators.10


9
  Project financing represented less than 1% of government health expenditures.
10
   PDO indicator is shorthand for PDO Level Results Indicator from the April 2013 restructuring paper or
Project Outcome Indicator from the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). Intermediate result indicator is the
term used in the restructuring paper and replaces the PAD’s Project Outcome Indicator.

                                                   2
7.      The Project’s PDO indicators were:

        a. PDO Indicator 1: Ratio of hospitalization rate of MA (Medical Assistance
           scheme) vs. non-MA beneficiaries;
        b. PDO Indicator 2: Ratio of outpatient visit rate of the bottom 20% vs. the top
           40% in the income distribution in the previous year;
        c. PDO Indicator 3: % of households with annual health expenditure in excess of
           20% of total income;
        d. PDO Indicator 4: Rate of overall satisfaction with rural health services among
           men;
        e. PDO Indicator 5: Rate of overall satisfaction with rural health services among
           women;
        f. PDO Indicator 6: Public Health System scorecard rating; and
        g. PDO Indicator 7: Innovation accepted and rolled out at provincial or regional
           level. 

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

8.      The PDO was not revised during project implementation. However, one
intermediate result indicator was modified during the April 2013 project restructuring.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
 
9.    The primary beneficiaries of the project were to be the rural residents in the
40 project counties, with a population of 20.6 million, across eight provinces/
municipality (Gansu, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Qinghai, Shaanxi and Shanxi;
Chongqing).11 Additionally, knowledge generated from the pilots was intended to benefit

non-project counties. Project outputs, such as technical guidelines and innovative practices,
have been disseminated to non-project areas and some have become government policies
and laws, which benefits a much larger population within China. In addition, the
knowledge and good practices generated from the project have been disseminated to
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia through
workshops and exchange visits, and are expected to benefit more people globally.

1.5 Original Components

10.     The project consisted of two components, with the following initial loan allocation
(final expenditure in parenthesis) and main activities (Annex 2).

11.      Component 1: Health Reform Innovations Supported via Block Grants. The
project was to support innovations that would contribute lessons on practical approaches
for implementing government health reform policies. The primary activity of the project
was to pilot and then evaluate innovations in reform areas the government identified as
priorities. At a minimum, pilots had to involve: (a) measures to improve equity of access
to quality health services, including by gender; (b) measures to strengthen the NCMS
design and management (management information systems, governance and accountability
arrangements, resource mobilization, benefit package design, links with the MA program,
etc.); (c) reforms of provider payment methods; (d) reforms to enhance quality that link
quality standards and procedures with financial and other incentives; and (e) institutional
and financing reforms to improve public health functions and delivery of public health
services. Counties were to receive block grants to finance pilot activities. Forty counties
were selected to implement the project. These counties would submit proposals to be
evaluated according to the agreed upon criteria, including demonstrated commitment to
reform, piloting innovations in line with the project concept documents, ability and
capacity to lead and support innovations, and overall quality of the proposal.

12.    Three reform areas were identified:

       Reform Area One: Improving Rural Health Financing. This reform area
covered efforts to: (a) develop information flows and integrate information systems, and
strengthen fund management and control capability; (b) introduce international experience
on feasible approaches to control costs, and pilot alternative provider payment
mechanisms, such as capitation and diagnostic-related groupings; (c) better link the NCMS
and MA programs; (d) improve financial protection while improving access to affordable
services for currently excluded or marginalized groups; (e) strengthen mechanisms for
supervision and broader accountability to the community; and (f) train and build capacity,
beyond routing training activities supported by national programs.

       Reform Area Two: Improving Quality, Efficiency and Cost Control in Service
Delivery. The main goals under this reform area were: (a) effective control of health care
costs; (b) improved technical quality of care; (c) increased internal efficiency in service
delivery; and (d) increased focus on prevention and health promotion. To achieve these
goals, the project was to support interventions to: (a) address existing weaknesses in

                                             4
provider capacity to define performance standards, monitor costs and performance, enforce
contractual obligations of hospitals and other providers; (b) develop and implement an
integrated primary care model; (c) provide technical input to support the development and
implementation of new or revised regulations, and of systems for regulatory monitoring
and enforcement; and (d) upgrade material conditions and capacity of rural health providers
through limited training and civil works to ensure adequate skills and capabilities in the
health system to meet higher quality standards and requirements.

       Reform Area Three: Strengthening the Financing and Organization of Core
Public Health Functions. Under this reform area, the project was to support the
development of a coordinated public health strategy at the county level; to test different
approaches for improving the quality, efficiency and equity of existing services; and pilot
new interventions to address emerging health challenges (such as NCDs and associated
behavioral risk factors). The approaches piloted would include: (a) evidence-based and
multi-sectoral planning and coordination for public health service provision; (b) purchasing
of clinical public health services; (c) financing and service models—including outreach
and incentives for health workers—to improve access for remote populations and other
vulnerable groups in the community; (d) community mobilization mechanisms for public
health emergencies; (e) management of NCDs according to standardized protocols; (f)
disease surveillance at the county and village level; and (g) monitoring equity of access to
and satisfaction with clinical public health services.

13.     Component 2: Project Coordination, Policy Development and Lesson Learning.
This project coordination, policy development and lesson learned component aimed to
guide project implementation and identify replicable models for rural health reform. The
major principles informing the operation of this component were to include: (a) focusing
on learning-through short feedback loops, policy debates, and special studies; (b) actively
using monitoring indicators to assess progress and manage fund release; (c) facilitating
efficient implementation and course adjustment for the project; (d) flexibility based on
clear business rules; and (e) an integrated multi-sectoral and cross-component approach
with equity concerns integrated throughout.

1.6 Revised Components

14.    The components did not change during project implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

15.     The project was restructured three times during implementation. The March
2011 and June 2012 restructurings reallocated loan proceeds based on project progress and
need to achieve the PDOs; the June 2012 restructuring also merged the expenditure
Category A (block grants) and Category B (goods, consultant services, training, Program
Support) into a single Category C in order to ease disbursement management. The final
restructuring (April 2013): (a) extended the Closing Date from December 31, 2013 to
December 31, 2014 to allow sufficient time for the project to complete the latest pilots,
carry out evaluations of the new pilots, and disseminate and roll out to non-pilot areas; (b)

                                             5
removed reference to the National Validation Panel in the Loan Agreement and replaced it
with the National Expert Panel (NEP), as the NEP had been carrying out this function
during project implementation; and (c) revised the definition of indicator 10 to better align
and assess the progress of implementation on the ground.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.     A thorough and solid sector analysis was beneficial to project design, but
preparation was long. Project identification and design were informed by the findings of
the Rural Health Reform Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) (P082296), which drew
on the World Bank’s global knowledge gained in supporting health reform in wide range
of countries. The AAA clearly identified policy and institutional deficiencies present in the
Chinese health system at the time and pointed to the need to test concrete operational steps
to implement reform. Project design took into account the priorities identified in the AAA
and focused on leaning-by-doing and on the institutional development needed to support
reform. Building on the lessons learned from other countries' efforts to implement health
reform, the preparation team suggested various policy innovations that the project might
test within three main reform areas: health financing, service provision and public health.
Successful pilots could then be expanded to other areas in China or even other countries.
Although the AAA was beneficial, delays in reaching an agreement between the World
Bank and the GOC on final publication of the AAA report, Reforming China’s Rural
Health System, did have the unintended consequence of slowing down project preparation.
Project preparation took three and a half years from the pre-identification mission in
November 2004 to the appraisal mission in September 2007 to Board approval in June
2008. Delays in finalizing the project design were also partly due to the Government’s
decision to expand the scope and coverage of the project by introducing new provinces. It
took the Government almost one year to reach a decision about the selection of these
additional provinces. In the end, five provinces (Gansu, Heilongjinag, Henan, Jiangsu and
Shanxi) were added to the original three provinces at appraisal, which increased number of
project counties from 24 to 40 and more than doubled the population in project areas. In
retrospect, the long design had some unexpected benefits; it allowed for a thorough analysis
and made the project timing align more closely with the Government’s health reform
timetable.

17. The project had an innovative and ambitious design. The project had several
design features that had not previously been part of World Bank supported health projects
in China, namely: (a) provision of block grants to project counties with the central and
provincial Government (instead of counties) being responsible for repayment; (b)
introduction of the incentive and exit mechanisms to manage performance and encourage
healthy competition; and (c) using bottom up approaches to empower counties to design
their project activities. Such project design features provided incentives for innovation and
for promoting changes at local level, without increasing the financial burden on rural
counties. However, the project had its downside. It was designed to pilot very difficult
reform measures in three areas (financing, service delivery and public health function) in

                                             6
40 counties in eight provinces. This is a complex design that requires intensive supervision
and technical support. 

18.      Project design incorporated lessons learned from previous operations in the
health sector. The Basic Health Services (Health VIII) Project, successfully closed on June
30, 2007, was particularly relevant. It was an important pre-cursor to this project because
it pioneered the development of new approaches that built upon government policy
initiatives in rural areas. A noteworthy example is the Medical Financial Assistance
program, which provided the foundation for the current Medical Assistance scheme that is
now been rolled out nationwide. An important lesson from Health VIII concerns the vital
role of technical assistance in supporting institutional change at the local level. From the
beginning, project preparation fully utilized the capacity of the Government and national
experts. A great deal of work was undertaken by the Borrower at central, provincial and
county levels. The Center for Project Supervision and Management (CPSM) 12 and the
National Experts Panel (NEP) played critical roles in project preparation. There was no
Quality Enhancement Review for this project.

19.     The project is closely aligned with the Government’s overall reform agenda in
rural China. The project was initiated when the GOC was preparing a comprehensive
health reform. The aim of the project was to pilot changes on a small scale, document the
results and accumulate experiences that could be used to deepen and broaden the reform,
including by rolling out the pilots nationwide.

2.2 Implementation

20.       The project operated under a highly volatile and fast-evolving policy
environment. The project design was intended to test reform measures at a small scale
first, to inform the Government’s overall Rural Health Reform. However, when the project
was under the second year of the implementation, without waiting for results of the pilots,
the Government launched its health reform with a significant increase in investment in
NCMS and rapid rollout of the MA. The Government specified some rules and procedures
for the NCMS and MA that every county needed to follow. However, the reform launched
nationwide was a general policy framework and it was up to the provinces to figure out
how to implement the reform in their local areas. The project made adjustments to stay
relevant and meet the changing needs of the reform. Taking advantage of the enabling
environment at the national level, the project fund allocation and procurement plan for civil
works and equipment were changed quickly to avoid duplication in investment and pilots
were focused on testing various pathways for implementation of the reform.

21.     A midterm review (MTR) and subsequent restructurings of the project made
positive changes. The MTR was conducted in September 2011, as originally planned. It
was done jointly with the GOC and Department for International Development (DFID). As
a result of the MTR, some procedures were simplified. For example, before the MTR, the



12
     Previously called the Foreign Loan Office (FLO).

                                                 7
annual activity plans at the central and provincial level were approved by the World Bank
and county plans by CPSM, which led to delays. The MTR decentralized the power of
approval for county plans from CPSM to Provincial PMOs, with CPSM and NEP making
spot checks of county plans. The project had also been restructured to reallocate funds
according to need. The amount allocated to civil works and equipment was reduced,
whereas funds for training and technical assistance were increased. The project was
restructured again later to reduced disbursement categories from two to one, which further
simplified project design. The speed of implementation was improved as a result.

22.     The incentive and exit system built into the project design was very effective.
The project innovatively designed an incentive and exit system that rewarded best
performers and let poor performers leave the project. Twice during implementation, the
project rewarded counties that were making fast progress; this produced excellent effects.
Twenty-two project counties were rewarded and their enthusiasm for better performance
and innovation was further stimulated. At the same time, five project counties were
identified as being poor performers, received targeted support and were asked to carry out
rectification measures. Even though in the end no project county was removed from the
project, this system put political pressure on poorly performing counties to improve and
injected energy and motivation for good performing counties to do even better. As a result,
all 40 counties put forth significant effort during implementation.

23.      Implementation capacity was uneven across project counties and provinces.
Provinces and counties that had past experience implementing World Bank supported
projects, or had strong leaders, were more efficient in preparing and implementing the
annual plans. These were provinces where capacity was higher in general. Frequent
shuffling of personnel in some provinces or counties led to a gap in both knowledge and
institutional memory, negatively affecting implementation. Overall, implementation
progress varied greatly among provinces and counties. Although some measures were
adopted such as providing special TA to support weaker counties to try to narrow the gap,
the results were not always satisfactory.

24.    Changed exchange rate affected the use of the total projected project
expenditures. Due to exchange rate fluctuations, the project experienced a reduction in
funding in local currency terms. For instance, the DFID grant for Gansu was in the amount
of GBP465,000, which was equivalent to RMB 6.51 million at project appraisal (1 GBP=14
RMB Yuan). By implementation, the grant amounted to RMB 4.67 million; a loss of RMB
1.84 million or 28.3 percent of the value of the grant. The World Bank loan of US$50
million was equivalent to RMB 350 million at appraisal (1 US$ to 7 RMB), but the actual
amount was RMB 310 million by the end of the project completion, a loss of RMB 40
million or 11.4 percent. Planned activities had to be adjusted and/or financed with
Government funds to account for the shortfall.

25.     At the request of the Government, the project was extended for one year. This
allowed sufficient time for completion of the latest pilots, for evaluations of the new pilots
to be conducted, and for innovations to be disseminated and rolled out to non-pilot areas.


                                              8
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26.     M&E Design. The project adopted a result-oriented management method and had
a clearly defined results monitoring and evaluation framework, with well-specified
indicators. Most of the indicators in the Results Framework measured high-level outcomes
and relied on survey data to be updated; only five out of the 22 indicators in Results
Framework relied on routine data from the NCMS or the health management information
system. Therefore, the project was designed to include three surveys (at baseline, mid-term
and end-of-project) to assess progress toward achievement of the PDOs. In addition,
assessment of progress was done by reviewing implementation of activities in the approved
project annual activity plan. Project counties identified triggers for each important pilot
activity, which was used as a precondition for the disbursement application for project
funds. CPSM compiled an M&E Operational Manual that specified the contents, methods
and division of tasks between institutions at different levels. CPSM also tracked 23 regular
process indicators, in accordance with the national reform monitoring framework. This
data was used to inform supervision and decision-making during the life of the project.

27.     M&E Implementation and Utilization. A project management information system
(MIS) was developed and used to collect, store, process, retrieve, transmit and aggregate
information. The MIS was used to provide the project with comprehensive, real-time and
interactive information. It had 10 modules including planning management, basic
information management, objectives management, procurement management, financial
management and data management. Since it became operational in February 2010, it
continuously produced six-monthly M&E reports and annual reports. The MIS also
established an online reporting system for routine project M&E, which included output and
process indicators; this rectified the weakness of the Results Framework that was noted
above. It was used not only as a source of data for project supervision, the mid-term review
and final evaluation, but also as the basis for the incentive and exit systems. Project surveys
were synchronized with the national health surveys to allow comparisons and analyses
between the project and the broader national health reform. The project mid-term and final
evaluations were conducted at the same time as the 4th and 5th National Health Survey,
respectively, allowing comparable information to be collected for non-project areas.13

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

28.     Environmental Safeguards. The project was classified as Category B based on
two potential environment impacts: (a) new construction and rehabilitation of village
clinics, and (b) medical waste disposal at village clinics. The project followed the
Government’s national guidelines on medical waste disposal and chemicals use, and



13
  The three surveys were conducted by Center for Health Statistics and Information of NHFPC and the total
sample households of 36,000 from 40 project counties in 8 project provinces and with about 110,000 people.
The detailed survey method, content and quality control were described in “the Final Survey Report for China
Rural Health Development Project” NHFPC October 2014.


                                                     9
developed a Medical Waste Management Plan (EMP) as part of the Project Operations
Manual. Since the primary focus of the project was on testing the viability of institutional
innovations, such as cost control and improving health insurance, a substantial increase in
medical waste related to the project was unlikely. Indeed, no significant safeguards issues
surfaced during implementation.

29.     Social and Indigenous People Safeguards. The Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP
4.12) and Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) safeguard policies were triggered. The
Resettlement Policy Framework and the Ethnic Minority (Indigenous People)
Development Planning Framework were developed during project preparation.
Refurbishment and construction of facilities were mainly done on existing sites and no
outstanding issues found during supervision. The ethnic minority development plan was
satisfactorily implemented and some preferential policies were given to ethnic minorities
such as higher reimbursement rate for their medical expenses. The implementation of
safeguards was satisfactory.

30.     Fiduciary.    The project maintained acceptable financial management systems
that provided basic financial information. Project funds were used for the intended
purposes and adequate accounts were managed. Some innovative features, such as
establishing Operating Accounts in County Finance Bureaus and Report-based
Disbursement, were implemented to meet project needs. These mechanisms improved
disbursement efficiency and were particularly beneficial in a decentralized project, such as
this one. However, because there was no counterpart fund requirement under this project,
some counties encountered problems related to lack of working capital that delayed project
implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.      Rural health care reform is ongoing in China and the outputs and outcomes
from the project are likely to be sustained and even expanded nationwide. The project
piloted various interventions that are well aligned with the Government’s rural health
reform policies and there is buy-in at the highest level to scale up successful experiences.
Indeed, some innovations developed under the project have become law and are fully
institutionalized. Additionally, as confirmed in interviews with the Government, one of the
long-lasting contributions of the project is that it built technical and managerial capacity,
expanded the knowledge base and created a change in the mindset of implementers,
encouraging innovation and experimentation from the bottom up. The health reform
process in China is ongoing; project reform experiences will continue to provide a basis
for Government to adjust and refine national health policies and implementation of those
policies at the subnational level.

32.    The World Bank and the Government are discussing a follow-on operation
that will build upon the experiences of this project and support the Government in
deepening the rural health reforms that have been started. The new project is expected
to support selected provincial governments in implementing service delivery reforms to
enable the health system to more effectively respond to the health needs of an aging

                                             10
population facing an increased burden of noncommunicable diseases. The project is
currently under preparation (the estimated Board date is October 2017. The estimated loan
amount is US$400 million to be allocated across three to four provinces.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

33.     The PDOs were highly relevant at appraisal and remained so throughout the
implementation and consistent with China’s priorities in the rural health system
reform. China’s 12th Five-Year Plan has a continued focus on improving quality of growth
and addressing economic and social imbalances, including in financial protection from
health shocks and access to quality health services. Innovations financed and technically
supported by the project have helped operationalize reforms that move China closer to the
goals outline in the 12th Five-Year Plan. After reviewed the report on this project prepared
by the Ministry of Finance, Vice-Premier Liu Yandong requested rollout of pilots to non-
project areas. This further validates the current relevance of the project objectives,
implementation and design.

34.     The drive toward universal health coverage has gained importance in the post-
2014 development agenda, as the world defines the targets that will replace the 2015
Millennium Development Goals targets. The proposed Sustainable Development Goal
3—to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages—includes a target on
achieving universal health coverage (UHC), which is defined as “ensuring that all people
can use the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services
they need, of sufficient quality to be effective, while also ensuring that the use of these
services does not expose the user to financial hardship.”14 This definition embodies three
related objectives and project design: (a) equity in access to health services; (b) that the
quality of health services is good enough to improve the health of those receiving services;
and (c) financial-risk protection. The project is fully aligned with each of these objectives.

35.     Project objectives are consistent with the World Bank’s twin goals of ending
extreme poverty by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity among the poorest 40
percent of the population. In particular, by improving equitable access to quality and
financial protection, the project contributes to achievement of the World Bank’s Health,
Nutrition and Population Global Practice pledged to assist client countries in accelerating
progress towards UHC as a means to achieve the twin goals.

36.     The project supports the implementation of the World Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy for China for the period FY2013-2016 (Report No. 67566-CN,
October 11, 2012). The CPS intended to exploit synergies between investment lending and
analytical work, while recognizing that demonstration projects supported through lending
introduce and localize international knowledge and experience. The CPS, supporting more

                                                    11
inclusive and balanced rural development, is also aligned with China's 12th Five-Year Plan.
In its review of the CPS, the Board noted that its success would hinge on transfer of
knowledge through innovative projects that are sustainably replicated across the country.
Further, the Board supported continued enhancement of knowledge services and
innovation under the CPS, and stressed the importance of drawing broader lessons for
World Bank work in other countries, particularly middle-income countries. This project
piloted and tested integrated rural health reform programs in 40 counties in eight provinces
and has proven to be a useful vehicle for knowledge generation and sharing. As indicated
earlier, knowledge from the project has been disseminated to visiting delegation from
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

37.    Project efficacy is evaluated based on achievement of the PDO: increased and
more equitable access to quality health services, improved financial protection, and
better management of public health threats in pilot provinces and counties, with
lessons to support reforms in non-project areas.  
 
38.      Achievement of each of these four project intermediate objectives was
substantial. Three PDO indicators measured achievement of increased and more equitable
access to quality services, of which all were achieved and two were surpassed. The access
to and utilization of health care have increased, particularly by the poor. The number of
counties where the poor utilized outpatient services less than the rich (despite having
greater need) dropped by two-thirds. Quality of services was also enhanced as evidenced
by increased overall satisfaction (proxy indicator) with rural health services by both male
and female patients (increasing from 63.8 to 85.4 percent for man and 66.6 to 85.5 percent
for woman, and surpassing the target by 17.6 and 14.9 percentage points for men and
women respectively). Two PDO indicators measured achievement of improved financial
protection. The share of households with health expenditures in excess of 20 percent of
income decreased and the 15.2 percent target was surpassed by 2 percentage points.
Membership in the Medical Assistance Scheme was associated with higher utilization of
hospital care, indicating that those covered by the scheme have fewer barriers to access.
Better management of public health threats was measured using the public health system
scorecard; the score at the end of the project was 90.22, compared with 61.78 at the onset
of the project. Finally, a qualitative indicator was used to gauge achievement of the
crosscutting intermediate objective that implementation of activities in project areas yield
lessons to support reforms in non-project areas. The target was also surpassed. As noted
earlier, lessons from the pilots were widely disseminated domestically and internationally.
Meeting all PDO targets is a considerable achievement given that these are high-level
indicators that require interventions on multiple fronts.

39.     The project has had a profound impact on rural health reform beyond what
can be measured through its PDO and intermediate results indicators. During project
implementation, the GOC launched a major rural health reform policy that included rapid
scale up of the NCMS15 and MA, backed by considerable increases in public investments
in the health sector, which undoubtedly contribute to achievement of PDOs. However, as
is typically, the case in China, policies are defined in broad strokes, without providing
details on how they should be operationalized. A major contribution of the project was that
it supported the design and testing of approaches to operationalize the reform, drawing on
international best practices. Additionally, the project achieved important results that are
not necessarily captured by the indicators in the Results Framework. These include
intangible, but important result such as the shift towards evidence-based management and
policy decision-making, more openness to new ideas, and willingness to experiment. These
changes will have a lasting effect on the development of China’s health sector. 
 
40.      Some of the main accomplishments of the project pilots in each of the three
reform areas are highlighted below. Annex 2 has a more comprehensive list of outputs
by component and Annex 3 has a discussion of the linkages between project activities and
results, which illustrates how the project contributed to program outcomes. 
 
Reform Area One: Improving Rural Health Financing

41.     The project played a key role in reforming financing mechanisms under the
NCMS, which increased resources available to finance services. Exploring financing
modalities for the NCMS at the local level was a core project activity. Project counties
were innovative in creating ways to increase the reimbursement rate under the NCMS,
which in turn allowed them to expand services coverage. Many models were created and
tested, including the ‘Health Service All-in-One Card’, ‘three-fixed financing’, ‘rolling
financing’, and ‘bank withholding and collecting’, among others. Some of these models
also reduced the financial burden on NCD patients of obtain care for services covered under
the NCMS. The hospitalization rate in the eight project provinces increased from 6.6
percent in 2008 to 8.9 percent in 2013, even though the cost of hospitalization increase
76.3 percent during the same period. Affordability of hospitalization increased with
expansion of NCMS coverage and out-of-pocket payments for hospitalization declined by
more than 50 percent in this period.

42.     Under the project, the Government established innovative NCMS payment
systems to increase sustainability of the NCMS. Project counties explored various
options to pay providers for services covered under the NCMS. Payment methods were
tested for both outpatient services (e.g., per capita payments, lump-sum payment for total
expenditures) and inpatient care (e.g., per capita hospitalization payments, payment per
patient discharge, per diem payments, single disease case-based payments, and payment
for diagnostic-related groupings). Among 40 project counties, 22 counties implemented
outpatient lump-sum payments, covering 40 county-level medical institutions, and 365


15
  During project implementation, health insurance coverage expanded rapidly, reaching 96 percent across
the project counties.

                                                  13
hospitals and township health centers. In 23 counties, 87 county-level hospitals and 413
township-level hospitals and health centers used inpatient single disease payment systems,
while the classified and grouped comprehensive payment system was implemented in 8
counties, covering 36 county-level medical institutions and 154 township-level hospitals
and health centers. A book entitled "NCMS Payment Reform" was produced by the project
and recommended by the Central Government as reference material for national trainings.
The project also produced an "Operational Guide for Payment Reform" for use in project
counties and a book, "Take the Lead in Payment Reform Innovation, Realize the Double
Coverage of Payment Reform," which summarizes the innovations in payment reform
implemented under the project. Some of the models tested are now the standard financing
policy for the local NCMS and have been adopted in non-project counties. 

43.      The project strengthened the rural medical insurance system and increased
financial accessibility by the poor. The rural medical insurance system consists of the
NCMS and MA scheme. Project counties explored ways to improve coverage and
sustainability of the MA. Efforts included expanding benefit packages, increasing
reimbursement rates and capturing more beneficiaries under the MA. Project counties
established MA networks with 170 county hospitals and 1172 township health centers in
the project areas. Some counties lowered the deductible for inpatient services for the poor,
reduced or waived their medical bills, or provided short-term assistance for people who are
slightly above the qualification threshold for the MA. These measures have significantly
improved accessibility to rural health services and equity. For instance, there is now a
greater gap in use of hospitalization services by MA beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries
than at the beginning of the project, an indication that affordability has improved for those
covered by the scheme. Access to outpatient care for the poor also improved. There has
been an increase in the number of counties in which the poor use relatively more services
than the rich; this is a desirable outcome given that the poor are likely to have greater health
needs.  
 
Reform Area Two: Improving Quality, Efficiency and Cost Control in Service Delivery

44.     Under the project, the Government formulated a quality-based and service-
oriented long-term performance management system. Since 2009, project counties
began to implement the system, which included quantitative evaluation indicators. Some
project areas like Jiangsu, Chongqing, Qinghai and Henan built a dynamic system in which
indicators were given different weights in accessing performance, based on priorities,
degree of difficulties of tasks and quality of services. The performance management
system built a direct connection between performance and compensation, effectively
enhancing the quality and efficiency of health services in the project areas.

45.    The project improved rural healthcare infrastructure and expanded physical
access to care. The project financed construction (1109), expansion (599) and renovation
(582) of village clinics, as well as clinical and office equipment (62,880 pieces in all). The
share of the population living within 15 minutes of the nearest heath facility increased by
9.4 percentage points on average. In Gansu, the province with the most significant
improvement, the rate increased by 28.9 percentage points, from 53.6 percent in 2008 to

                                              14
82.7 percent in 2013. These investments also improved structural quality of village clinics,
enabling them to provide better services.

46.      The project strengthened the rural health workforce by developing and
implementing plans for recruiting, retaining and building capacity of health staff.
Most project areas developed recruitment and management mechanisms for health and
technical personnel at the township and village levels. For example, Jiulongpo District in
Chongqing standardized the recruitment procedures for village doctors and attracted young
village doctors by including them into the civil servant system. Gaochun in Jiangsu and
Yongchuan in Chongqing introduced a development plan for village doctors to obtain a
college degree, which had a strong impact on the education level and age structure of
village doctors in their areas. All project counties developed training plans and provided
capacity-building opportunities, adapted to local needs, for rural health workers in their
territories. For example, Heilongjiang and Jiangsu built training schools for village doctors.
Jiangsu provided education and training that allowed village doctors to meet current
educational requirements. Project counties, such as Zhen’an in Shaanxi and Huining in
Gansu, set up training bases for village health personnel. Jiulongpo in Chongqing and
Linkou in Heilongjiang applied a “master-guides-apprentice” model that updated staff
technical skills, strengthening the 3-tier rural health system.

47.     The project has supported comprehensive public hospital reform in some
project counties with a focus on changing the payment system from fee-for-service to
case-based payment. Implementation of IT-based clinical pathways has been carried out
with the aim to standardize quality of services and control costs. Along with the
introduction of performance-based payment system, these reform activities have led to
better care, shorter length of hospital stay and lower costs for rural patients.

Reform Area Three: Strengthening the Financing and Organization of Core Public
Health Functions

48.     The project improved management of essential public health functions. An
“Operational Guide for Management and Implementation of Basic Public Health Service”
was developed and implemented early on in the project. Taking into consideration the
specific public health issues relevant to an area, the area’s level of economic development
and local capacity for service provision, project counties created tailored approaches to
incentivize supply of public health services, including by introducing performance
evaluation and linking performance to payment.

49.    Management improved by promoting a culture of evaluation. All project
counties developed and implemented evaluations of basic public health performance by
2010. The project conducted a “comprehensive evaluation” connecting essential public
health functions with basic medical care, which included a third-party evaluation
mechanism to assess results in providing basic public health services. Survey results show
improvement in NCD control and prevention. From 2008 to 2013, the hypertension
prevention and control guidance rate under the project increased from 76.8 to 91.3 percent
and the compliance rate for diabetes treatment reached 94 percent.

                                             15
50.     Under the project, counties operationalized the “Healthy Village” model as a
means to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent NCDs. A Healthy Village Pilot
Construction Brochure and a Manual for Healthy Village Construction were developed to
guide counties in defining local requirements to establish a Healthy Village that would take
into consideration the county’s health problems, environment, and capacity. Each project
county explored a different "healthy village" format that could be feasibly implemented
given their particular circumstances. At the end of the project, 35 out of 40 project counties
initiated Healthy Villages and 277 villages had met the Healthy Village standard. Full
implementation is still underway and it is too early to assess its impact, as behavior-change
is a slow process.

51.     The project explored ways to improve health promotion and communication
at the local level. Based on the requirements of the Government’s “National Public Health
Service Specification,” the project developed health promotion models and special health
education materials. This initiative targeted housewives, motivating them to take charge of
family and community health. Some project counties carried out a wide range of health
promotion activities, such as financing the local Health Education Association, promoting
health self-management, establishing health education websites and setting up a public
health service team called “Sunshine Rider,” and biking to villages to promote health
education. The project’s final survey indicated a 0.8 percentage point reduction in smoking
and an 8.9 percentage point increase in regular exercising compared with the 2003 baseline
survey.

52.      A multi-sector management platform for NCD prevention and control was
established. The project adopted a comprehensive multilevel approach to NCD prevention
and control, including multi-sector coordination, comprehensive training, and innovative
health promotion and provision of preventive services. The project focused on improving
the capacity at grassroots health institutions for NCD prevention and control so that these
institutions are able to carry out health promotion and early detection in rural communities.

Improving management capacity at all levels

53.     Knowledge generation and transfer were major contributions of the
project. Project preparation and early implementation included the use of both
international and domestic technical assistance for knowledge transfer and this continued
to be a key element of the project through implementation. The DFID grant of GBP 1.2
million financed international technical assistance, as well as overseas study tours and
training. After the closure of the DFID grant, technical assistance was funded by the World
Bank. During project implementation, 22 international technical assistance missions were
organized, with international experts providing, after each mission, written reports that
summarized their findings and recommendations. The technical assistance covered priority
areas for which China needed support, such as clinical path management, performance
management and payment system reform. The implementing agencies acknowledged that
the most important impact of this project was knowledge transfer and human capacity
strengthening at the local level. 


                                             16
54.     The overseas training and exchanges organized by the project played an
important role in introducing innovative ideas and appropriate technologies, and in
having pilots that were done in a scientific and orderly manner. The project organized
12 overseas visits and training for relevant project staff. These overseas visits, training and
exchange workshops were considered very useful by project staff of all levels. The study
tours introduced new ideas in project management, and increased cooperation between the
project and international organizations. Exchanging international experiences and ideas
with neighboring countries was another effective ways of generating and transferring
knowledge. The experiences from the project were shared with other countries and project
staff also benefitted tremendously from the process of identifying best practices and
summarizing lessons learned.

55.     The project strengthened human capacity in the rural health system, which
had a positive impact beyond the project areas. A lasting impact of the project is that it
build technical and managerial skills among health staff. Project management staff at each
level were subsequently promoted and assumed positions of responsibility in health care
reform. More than half of the project staff in Jiulongpo District of Chongqing, for instance,
were promoted to other managerial positions by the end of the project. Project staff
reported that working on this project was like going to graduate school, as it required hard
work but that the reward was immeasurable.

Focused on Knowledge generation and dissemination

56.     Operational research under the project was key to generating knowledge.
Eleven operational research studies were organized at the central level covering difficult
topics in each project component. Research results have been used for revising and
refining reform policies. For example, the public health system scorecard and the ‘Healthy
Village’ guidelines developed by the project were based on initial research results and since
then these have been developed into operational standards to guide implementation.
Noteworthy is the regulation on increasing NCMS financing, promulgated by the Jiangsu
government. This regulation was based on operational research carried out by the project.
Such pioneering work has provided evidence for the State and other provinces to identify
ways to increase the NCMS financing. 

3.3 Efficiency

57.     The efficiency of the project is deemed to be Substantial. The challenges of
conducting the economic analysis for this project also existed at the time of preparation
and they remain valid today. Many economic benefits, such as improved equity, are
difficult to quantify in monetary terms; there is scant evidence on which to base
assumptions (and, indeed, some assumptions made in cost-benefit analysis at project
preparation—e.g., a decline in total health expenditure in project counties—did not hold);
and, it is difficult to measure quantitatively the spillover effects of the pilot experience,
which were about knowledge building and creating an openness to innovation and
experimentation. For these reasons, the net present value (NPV) or the project’s economic
rate of return (ERR) were not calculated. Instead, the economic analysis in Annex 3,

                                              17
illustrates how the project activities contributed to economic benefits and positive results.
Data from before and after the project show improved financial protection (illness-related
expenses were less likely to be a cause of poverty); increased service utilization,
particularly by the poor; better quality of services; and an improved public health
environment. In addition, the project contributed to generation and transfer of knowledge
about health sector reform and health management, and to strengthening capacity in the
sector. Given its overall achievements relative to the small financial contribution of the
project (less than 1 percent of government health expenditures in the project areas during
the loan period), the project was highly efficient.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

58.    The overall outcome rating of the China Rural Development Project is Satisfactory.
This is based on: (i) a high overall relevance; (ii) substantial efficacy based on
achievement of results across all intermediate objectives; and (iii) substantial efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

59.     The project had a focus on poverty and gender-related issues in the health
sector. The project improved equity in access to care by building new health facilities, as
well as improving the structural quality of existing health facilities. The project also
reduced direct payments for health services, making services more affordable for the poor
and reducing financial barriers to accessing needed services. Project surveys suggest access
to and utilization of health services by the poor improved in the project period. The ratio
of hospitalization rates of MA and non-MA beneficiaries has increased by 0.6 percent
point. The share of households with annual health expenditure in excess of 20 percent of
total household income declined from 19.2 to 13.2 percent.

60.     The project also showed improvements in indictors to monitor gender equality
and addressed special health needs of women. The share of women who have access to
a qualified health worker in project areas increased from 92.6 to 95.9 percent. The share of
women age 15–49 who undergo gynecological check-up grew from 44.1 to 66.3 percent,
with Gansu showing an impressive two-fold increase in the rate. On quality of services
provided, the project collected gender disaggregated indicators in order to monitor
potential disparities. There was virtually no gender difference in satisfaction and the
majority of the population (85.4 percent of men and 85.5 percent of women) expressed
satisfaction with the health services provided, a marked improvement from the baseline
(63.8 percent for man and 66.6 percent for woman).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

61.    The project made a significant contribution to improving the institutional
infrastructure at the grassroots level. It has strengthened staff capacity to formulate
health policies and implement reforms at the county, provincial and central levels. The

                                             18
establishment of an improved information system, bolstered by specific surveys, broadened
the evidence base on which to ground decision-making. Significant capacity was built,
particularly in these areas: (i) development, implementation and monitoring of annual work
plans; (ii) operational research to provide additional evidence for policy-making; (iii)
collecting, analyzing and using data to monitor service quality; (iv) effective management
of health facilities; and (v) development of complex administrative processes to implement
NCMS and MA schemes.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

62.     Project staff at different levels of the system felt strongly that the single largest
benefit they derived from the project was that they became more receptive to learning
about and testing new ideas. They became more independent thinkers, taking a more
active role in the design of their own projects and programs, instead of passively following
orders from above. 

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

63.     A third party hired by CPSM to conduct an independent evaluation of the
project fielded an end-of-project survey in the 40 project counties across eight
provinces. Interviews were conducted in 36,000 randomly selected households in
townships and villages. As noted above, results showed a higher level of satisfaction with
rural health services at the end of the project (above 85 percent), considerably better than
the pre-project level (63.8 percent of patients were satisfied). Additionally, compared with
2008, the proportion of outpatients who considered outpatients' waiting time to be short
increased by 18 percentage points, and the proportion of outpatients who considered the
medical environment to be good increased by 34.1 percentage points.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

64.     Overall, project development outcomes are expected to be sustained and
expanded given that the current political and financial environment is favorable to
implementation of further rural health reforms. While the degree of sustainability will
vary by province and county, the positive outcomes from project areas are likely to
continue, as the project contributed to a broader Government reform agenda for which there
is strong ownership at the national, provincial and county levels. The Government is
committed to rural development (as reflected in the 12th Five-Year plan) and will continue
to further refine the NCMS and MA, which are the principal financing mechanisms for the
rural health care system. New modalities for reimbursement under the NCMS, provider
payments methods and approaches to reduce the financial burden on the poor were tried in
the project areas; successful ones have been integrated into the NCMS financing model,
while others, such as the use of Diagnostics Related Groupings (DRGs) in provider
payment, continue to be developed. The evaluation and management systems established
under the project to support the rural health reforms are robust. Legislation, policies and
training materials developed under the project, as well as knowledge, and technical and


                                             19
managerial skills obtained by project implementers have built an important foundation for
both sustainability of outcomes and their further achievements.

65.    It should be noted, however, that some provinces and counties have weak
capacity. They would need continued support from the Government to make substantial
progress toward achievement of more equitable access to quality health services, improved
financial protection, and better management of public health services.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

66.     Project design benefitted from extensive sector knowledge and experience
accumulated from previous World Bank operations in China, as well as
comprehensive analytical sector work. During project design and preparation, the World
Bank team worked in close collaboration with the Government to conduct research and
analyses of China’s rural health sector in order to identified major challenges and
underlying causes. The project preparation team was comprised of strong national
counterparts, prominent domestic and international experts, and lead specialists from
within the World Bank with experience in implementation of health projects in China and
across the world.

67.     The World Bank, with support from DFID, introduced the concept of
innovation to the project and encouraged implementers to think outside the box to
address sector issues and challenges. A series of workshops and trainings was carried to
encourage this shift in mindset that ultimately translated into a bottom-up approach to
project design, whereby block grants are given to project counties to design their own
activities under guidelines that promote local participation and foster ownership and
sustainability of the project. Innovative features, which had not been previously used in
World Bank health projects in China, were brought into the design, including: (a) use of a
single disbursement method to give more flexibility to implementers; (b) no counterpart
funding requirement to allow for speedy use of project funding; and (c) no repayment
requirement from project counties, reducing the financial burden at the county level. The
design was sufficiently flexible, allowing for adaptation to different local settings and for
adjustments to be made during implementation.
 
68.     The project design was complex, however, and challenging to implement. The
project design covered comprehensive reforms in three major areas—health financing,
service delivery and public health. The wide breadth of the project was technical grounded;
the aim was to provide a large menu for implementers to select reform areas based on their
local needs. Implementation risks were correctly assessed at project design and mitigation
measures put in place, including utilization of international technical assistance, guidance
and supervision at provincial and central level, and adequate funding for knowledge
sharing, among others. However, at the request of the Government, the project was to be
                                             20
implemented in a large number of counties (40) and provinces (8), with varying degrees of
managerial capacity and financial and human resources availability. This imposed
significant challenges to implementation, pushing the limits of the World Bank’s capacity
to provide, within the available resource envelop, the technical and managerial support
required for successful implementation.  
 
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.     The supervision missions done by the World Bank team were regular, diligent
and supported the client in addressing implementation challenges. The project
benefitted from a committed World Bank team with a close relationship with Government
counterparts. However, TTL changes created gaps in knowledge and institutional
memory. 16 This exacerbated the challenge posed by weak capacity to implement
innovations in some counties and hampered implementation, particularly at the beginning
of the project. Despite the slow start, the Bank strengthened supervision and developed
many good practices, including setting up a learning platform for project counties,
organizing biannual dissemination workshops and facilitating South-South knowledge
sharing. Additionally, the World Bank fiduciary team’s oversight, support and timely
training were considered by the clients to be very beneficial. The midterm review was
timely and simplified some procedures that helped speed up implementation.

70.     With financial support from DFID, the World Bank team provided strong
technical support and knowledge transfer. However, after DFID funding was exhausted,
the World Bank team did not have the resources to draw on as many experts to support
supervision. The GOC had a strong and competent counterpart team for this project, with
high expectations and demands for the World Bank technical team (including international
consultants), which could not always be met within the allocated supervision budget. It
should be noted that client expectations were high and the level of support from
international experts that was expected is generally beyond the scope of supervision and
normally requires an operation with a technical assistance component. 
 
71.      Given that a key feature of the project was to use a bottom-up approach that
gave counties flexibility to design project activities, it was challenging to construct a
Results Framework that would capture activities that were yet to be defined.
Therefore, not all indicators selected were in line with the interventions that project
counties chose to implement. This was the case, for instance, with the intermediate result
indicator on the percentage of deliveries by cesarean section. This issue was discussed
during the MTR, but ultimately no consensus was reached on alternatives indicators; only
one indicator was updated during restructuring. The Results Framework continued to rely
heavily on high-level outcome and output indicators that were not as directly linked to
project activities, making it harder to monitor the project’s outputs, as mentioned above in
Section 2.3 on M&E.


16
 The project had three TTLs during implementation. Though this is not necessarily unusual for a six-year
World Bank project, transitions can create challenges for smooth implementation.

                                                  21
72.    Summarizing, the Moderately Satisfactory rating stems from: (a) weakness in
implementation at the onset of the project; (b) insufficient resources to support a non-
standard project; and (c) the missed opportunity to revise the Results Framework following
the MTR.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     Given the Satisfactory rating for quality at entry and the Moderately Satisfactory
rating for quality of supervision, the overall World Bank performance is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory, according to the World Bank’s ICR rating guidelines. However,
given the challenges of implementing a complex project and the strengthening of
supervision in later stages of project implementation, as well as the successful completion
of the project, a “Satisfactory” rating for Overall Bank Performance would be justified in
this case, despite the shortcomings in supervision noted above.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

74.    Overall, the Government remains highly committed and supportive of rural health
reforms, and has demonstrated strong ownership of the project from beginning to end. The
Government has made significant investments in the rural health care system, which
created an enabling environment for project implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

75.     Center for Project Supervision and Management (Highly Satisfactory). CPSM
has successfully led the project to completion, with funding fully utilized and key PDO
indicators achieved. It has also provided strong leadership in both project preparation and
implementation, drawing on its long experience managing World Bank projects. CPSM
has developed and maintained institutional capacity and sector knowledge in coordinating
and managing a complex and multilevel project in a dynamic national policy
environment. 17 They have monitored implementation progress closely and proactively
resolved issues, drawing on expertise from the World Bank and international experts when
needed. The CPSM team successfully organized joint supervision missions with the World


17
  At the national level, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) through CPSM was
responsible for overall coordination of the Project and implementation of national level activities. The
NHFPC established a national Leading Group (LG), chaired by a Minister of Health, and comprised of high-
level representatives from the NHFPC, NDRC, MOF, and other agencies, who were responsible for high-
level oversight of all aspects of the Project. CPSM acted as a secretariat to the LG and operated the national
level Project Management Office jointly with the NHFPC’s Department of Finance and Planning. A National
Expert Panel provided technical assistance to CPSM and lower level implementers.

                                                     22
Bank and DFID, as well as national teams comprised of provincial PMOs and national
experts. They coordinated with the Center for Health Statistics and Information to conduct
three surveys (at baseline, mid-term and end-of-project) and provided valuable information
for project monitoring and evaluation. Under their leadership, the project has reviewed and
collected innovative case studies and successfully disseminated the results in project and
non-project areas. Project covenants were largely complied with and quickly rectified when
there was a risk of noncompliance. There were no major fiduciary issues relating to
financial reporting, auditing, and procurement. The Project Manager led the CPSM team
from the beginning to the end of the project, providing a continuity that was a key factor
in the strong performance of the CPSM and in the successful implementation.

76.     Provincial Project Management Offices (Satisfactory). Coordination of project
activities at the county level was the responsibility of the provincial government, primarily
through the Provincial Bureau of Health (BOH). Each BOH established a Project
Management Office (PMO) responsible for logistics of implementation, preparation of
work plans, progress monitoring and reporting at the provincial level; the PMOs were
supported by the Provincial Expert Panel and the Central level. All eight PMOs provided
strong implementation support that made achievement of project results possible; though
some provinces, namely Henan and Chongqing, excelled in this respect.  
 
77.     County Project Management Offices (Satisfactory). County level implementation
was the responsibility of the Project Management Office at the county level, with guidance
from the provincial PMOs. Most participating entities were fully committed to achieving
project objectives and worked diligently, although capacity and performance varied greatly
across provinces and counties. Financial management had a slow start at the county level
because staff need to learn World Bank procedures, especially the payment of advances
which was a new disbursement method introduced by the project. Intense training by the
World Bank team as well as CPSM was instrumental in addressing this shortcoming.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

78.       The Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory for reasons outlined above.

6. Lessons Learned

79.     The project was able to capitalize the existence of a policy environment
favorable to rural health reform and push the envelope, delving into difficult issues
such as provider payment and incentives. The project covered comprehensive elements
of the rural health reform and encouraged counties and provinces to experiment with
innovative approaches to resolving local issues. Because the project design was (and still
is) consistent with the national reform agenda, the project had the support of local
governments, which made it possible for measures to be implemented that would have
otherwise not gotten off the ground. Piloting reform measures at the provincial and county
levels generated valuable knowledge and experience that can be applied to the design of
future reforms. It was an effective way to get impact from the World Bank’s relatively
small financial contribution to overall health financing in China.
                                               23
80.     The implementation of a complex reform project in such a large number of
counties and provinces undermined the effectiveness of the project. This project was
designed to pilot very difficult reform measures in three distinct areas—financing, service
delivery and public health. Though the breadth of the project is justifiable for a technical
standpoint, the design required intensive technical support, as well as close monitoring.
Implementation in 40 countries across eight provinces scattered geographically pushed
capacity of both the Government and World Bank teams to the limit. It was difficult for
the World Bank team to remain fully engaged with implementation across all counties,
contribute to the policy dialogue and provide adequate technical input during supervision,
particularly given its limited supervision budget. DFID support for technical assistance was
instrumental in mitigating some of these constrains for a portion of the project life.

81.     Capacity building and strategic thinking has enhanced the project’s impact
and its long-term sustainability. The project created an enabling environment in which
implementers were encouraged to be open to new ideas and take risks in trying new
approaches to health care financing and provision. It also encouraged local implementers
to experiment and learn from the experience of designing activities and interventions to
address their local issues; and facilitated intensive knowledge exchanges and training to
give implementers the tools to design new approaches. Project staff at all levels felt that
the longest lasting gain from the project would come from their ability to apply the skills
and knowledge they learned to their future work. This one of the ultimate successes of the
project.

82.    The Results Framework should include lower level indicators that can be
regularly monitored using routine data from the management information system.
The project Results Framework design closely linked monitoring indicators to overall
project objectives and included mostly indicators that measured high-level outcomes.
These indicators were dependent on household survey data to be updated. During project
implementation, a project management information system was created to monitor
implementation progress, but it would also have been beneficial to formally modify the
Results Framework.

83.     By focusing on evaluation, documentation and dissemination of experiences,
results and lessons learned, the project transferred knowledge and fostered a culture
of evidence-based decision-making. The rollout of project pilots benefited from use of
evidence generated throughout implementation. A learning network for project counties
was set up to encourage learning, and knowledge generation and transfer. Dissemination
workshops were organized through the network every half-year as part of project
supervision. A vast array of knowledge and dissemination materials were generated,
including data, reports and videos, which are now housed in a data repository managed by
the central PMO, hence ensuring sustainability. Each province focused on collecting best
practice case studies from participating counties. The lessons learned from the innovative
approaches in health financing and services delivery have been disseminated not only
among the 40 project counties, but also to non-project counties. In the last year of
implementation, the project also exchanged experiences on health reform with countries in
Central Asia and South East Asia. Using data collected from the project baseline, mid-

                                            24
point and final survey, implementation results were evaluated and discussed at the project
completion and dissemination workshop. In this way, the project was effective in building
and transferring knowledge.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

(b) Cofinanciers

84.      DFID was a cofinancier of the project, contributing US$6.14 million (4.18
million pounds) in grant funds plus 1.2 million pounds on direct technical assistance,
and made a significant positive contribution to the project. DFID was able to fill a
critical gap by providing incentives through its grant that made the Government more
willing to use loan resources to finance reforms. Specifically, the grant financed: (a)
analytical sector work on rural health through its other project; (b) technical assistance,
including short-term consultants for project preparation and implementation; (c)
operational support for the National Expert Panel, the Provincial Expert Panels and CPSM,
which allowed them to provide technical support to project implementation; (d) World
Bank supervision missions; and (e) a portion of the project’s annual plans. The DFID-
World Bank collaboration was strategic and created a single, cohesive platform for
dialogue and partnership with the GOC. Both the GOC and the World Bank agreed that
DFID’s support to the project was valuable and a key factor in strengthening the project
and its contribution to furthering implementation of rural health reforms in China.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The ICR’s economic analysis builds upon the economic analysis at project
preparation. It and assesses the economic rationale of the project and assumptions made
at project appraisal.

2.       The PAD stated a number of challenges of conducting economic analysis for
this project. The first challenge was that many important project benefits, such as
improving equity or reducing financial risk of falling ill, would be difficult to quantify in
monetary terms. Second, there was scant evidence on which to base assumptions about the
impact of project activities on desired outcomes. Third, it was difficult to establish a
plausible counterfactual—i.e., what would happen in the absence of the project—given the
fast changing environment in China. Finally, it was not possible to measure quantitatively
the spillover effects of the pilot experiences, in terms of stimulating or informing rural
health reform elsewhere, which was one of the project’s key qualitative outputs. Under
these challenges, the approach the appraisal team used in the economic analysis was to
illustrate the economic logic of the operation by linking project activities to expected
results and ultimate economic benefits (Figure 1 below, from Annex 9 of the PAD).

                                          Figure 1.
                                       Key Project Activities
   Enhancement of NCMS compensation arrangements (benefit package) and the MA Scheme
   Introduction of new provider payment methods, such as case-based or capitation-based
    payment, along with other cost control measures
   Development and implementation of improved systems and incentives for promoting health
    care quality – e.g. through the use of clinical guidelines and other quality standards
   Development of institutional and purchasing arrangements for core public health services
   Strengthening of management information systems and management capacity in areas of
    health financing, service delivery, and public health

                                     Expected Project Results
   Improved equity in financing burden and use of health services
   Improved financial risk protection
   Improved technical quality of care
   Improved patient satisfaction
   Expansion in coverage of key preventive services
   Increased internal efficiency in management of government health financing
   Increased internal efficiency in service delivery

                              Expected Economic Benefits of Project
   Improved health outcomes and quality of life
   Reduction in time lost from illness and improved productivity
   Increased consumption due to reduction in precautionary savings
   Resource savings (for households and government) due to improved resources allocation,
    rains in internal efficiency, and cost-control measures
   Improved patient satisfaction
   Reduction in risks and costs associated with disease outbreaks and other public health
    emergencies

                                              32
3.      The team used the links illustrated in figure 1 to quantify, for illustrative
purposes, the net present value (NPV) of one expected project benefit—namely, the
potential resource savings of improved resource allocation, cost controls, and internal
efficiency. However, some of the assumptions made for conducting the cost-benefit
analysis at project design did not hold and repeating the cost-benefit analysis done for the
PAD is not meaningful. The following are the major reasons for not recalculating the net
present value (NPV) or the project’s economic rate of return (ERR) in the ICR.

4.       Lack of the counterfactual. The cost-benefit analysis in the PAD assumed “Annual
growth in total health expenditures in project counties will gradually decline from 12.1
percent to 11.1 percent in project counties, without any worsening of health outcomes or
risk protection relative to the counterfactual.” In 2009, shortly after the 2008 start of
project implementation, the Government began nationwide rollout rural health sector
reforms. The government made a strong commitment to transform the health system with
the goal to establish universal basic healthcare by providing safe, effective, convenient,
and low-cost health services by 2020. Government health expenditure was increased by
28 percent from 2008 to 2009 and more than doubled (2.6 times) from 2008 to 2013.18
These changes swamp any effect the project may have had on reducing the rate of growth
of total health expenditures in project counties compared to non-project counties. It is not
possible to establish a counterfactual to assess the impact of the project because both
project and non-project areas received a massive influx of funds from the Government and
many reform measures, such as an expansion of the NCMS coverage, were carried out in
both project and non-project areas.

5.      Project benefits were difficult to measure in monetary terms. Recognizing that
project financing was a drop in the bucket, representing less than 1 percent of government
health expenditures in the project period, the project aimed to support innovations that
could contribute lessons on practical approaches for implementing evolving government
health reform policies. The primary activity of the project was to pilot innovations, rather
than supplement government expenditures. The project generated knowledge on a range
of new approaches to increase financing of NCMS, tested various provider payment
methods and piloted incentive systems to improve quality of health services, among other
achievements. The experiences and lessons learned have been evaluated, documented and
disseminated to project and non-project areas. These innovations will continue to have
impact and generate benefits over the medium-term as China continues to implement health
reforms. It would be difficult to capture, in monetary terms, the qualitative contribution of
the project in stimulating ideas and informing ongoing reforms.

6.     The economic analysis in this ICR focuses on the contribution made by the
project. It compares expected results with actual results based on the economic logic
outlined in the PAD, without attempting to attach a monetary value to these outcomes. The
ICR team did not have access to the national survey data in order to conduct project vs.

non-project comparison analysis to assess attribution of the project. Only before and after
project comparisons were conducted. The results indicated that the project contributed to
project outcomes and economic benefits.19

1. Expected Project Results

a. Improved equity in financing burden and use of health services

7.      Utilization of health services increased in project areas. There was a clear rise,
for instance, in use of inpatient care in all project provinces (table 1). This may be partly
due to expanded coverage of NCMS, as well as increased reimbursement rate for inpatient
care. The project supported pilots explored various methods to improve the NCMS and
MA benefit packages, contributing to expansion of the programs.

8.      Underutilization, including due to financial barriers, has declined. Survey data
indicates that the share of patients who should have been hospitalized according to medical
advice but were not has significantly decreased from 30.6 percent in 2008 to 13.5 percent
in 2013. Among the patients who did not use hospital care, the share who reported financial
constraints as the main reason for not obtaining care dropped from 76.9 to 48.8 percent
during the same period.20

9.      Equity improved, as envisaged. The poor typically use health services less than
the rich even though they generally have greater health needs. That is, if there were no
barriers to access, one would expect the ratio of service utilization between the poor and
the rich to be greater than one to reflect greater need among the poor. Taking outpatient
visits as an example, the ratio of utilization between the bottom and top of the income
distribution increased in five provinces, remained unchanged in two provinces and
decreased in one province. The number of the counties with a ratio below 1:1 decreased

b. Improved financial risk protection

10.     Coverage of health insurance for rural population has increased. Comparing
data from the project’s baseline survey to the final survey, coverage of NCMS increased
from 93.9 percent to 97.3 percent in all project provinces (table 3).

11.      Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for health as a share of gross domestic product
(GDP) have declined significantly. It is well established that the population in countries
that rely heavily on OOP payments to finance health are more exposed to financial risks
due to health shocks. Health sector investments to improve insurance coverage in the
project area and nationwide have greatly reduced the financial burden of health care on
patients. As government spending on health in China increased, OOP spending as a share
of total health expenditure shrank, as shown in figure 2.

12.     Even though the cost of care, particularly inpatient services, increased during
the project period and medical treatment became more expensive, partly due to
quality improvements,21 the share covered by direct payments decreased significantly
for farmers covered by the NCMS—from 74.7 to 48.4 percent (table 4). The reduction
was more substantial in poorer provinces, such as Heilongjiang and Shanxi. Jiangsu still
had the highest proportion of out-of-pocket expenses among all the provinces in 2013.
Additionally, OOP payments for inpatient costs as a proportion of the surveyed
population’s annual per capita income dropped markedly from 57.7 to 28.1 percent. This
is the most significant benefit achieved during the project period.

13.     Even though cost of health care has increased, due to the expansion of health
insurance coverage, households spend proportionally less of their income on health.
In 2013, percentage of households who spent more than 20 percent of their income on
health decreased 6 percentage points, down from 19.2 percent in 2008 (table 5).

14.     More of the poor received medical assistance (MA). However, the coverage of
the MA program remain small and uneven among project provinces. The number of poor
people receiving MA under the project increased from 2,148 in 2008 to 3,053 in 2013,
representing a little more than 3 percent of the population in the project areas. The poorer
provinces, such as Gansu, had the highest rate of MA coverage (7.4 percent), while Jiangsu,
a better-off province, had only 0.7 percent of the population covered by MA in 2013 (table
6).

   As new medical technologies are made available, price may rise but the output has also changed, making
prices comparison across time difficult unless a quality adjustment is made.

c. Expansion of coverage of key preventive services

15.     To address the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases, the project
focused on disease prevention and health education. With project support, prevention
measures have increased for rural populations, particularly women and the elderly. In 2013,
the gynecological examination rate for women aged 15-49 was 66.3 percent, an increase
of 22.2 percentage points compared with 2008. The prenatal care rate for pregnant women
was 98.9 percent, up 5-percentage point from 2008. The postpartum visit rate was 84.2
percent, an increase of 34.9 percentage points during the same period. The basic
vaccination coverage of children aged 1-4 also increased. The hypertension management
rate increased from 76.8 percent in 2008 to 91.9 percent in 2013. Physical examination for
people aged 65 and over was 80.5 percent, a significant increase from 15 percent in 2008
(Table 7).

2. Expected Economic Benefits

a. Improved health outcomes and quality of life

16.    Data on evolution of health outcomes or quality of life in the project areas is
limited. Available data is consist with the overall increasing trend in noncommunicable
diseases in China and elsewhere. For instance, the project collected information on the
prevalence rate of chronic diseases among the population aged 15 and over. Prevalence of
chronic disease refers to respondents diagnosed by health professionals as having one or
more chronic illness during the six months prior to the survey, including chronic infectious
diseases (such as tuberculosis) or chronic noncommunicable diseases (such as coronary
heart disease or hypertension). The results show an increase in the prevalence rate of
chronic disease from 2008 to 2013, particularly among females.

17.    Nonetheless, some improvement in risky behaviors that are known to
contribute to the onset of NCDs were seen in project areas. The project also initiated
implementation of the “Healthy Village Model,” which emphasizes health prevention,
improving health education, promoting healthy diet and physical activities, and creating a
clean environment. Based on global evidence, these activities should have a long-term
impact on improving the health status of the Chinese population. The project survey in
2013 has already shown some improvement among population in project areas: smoking
rate was 26.2 percent, down 0.8 of a percentage point from 2008; physical exercise 24.1
percent, up 9 percentage points and the use of sanitary latrines has increased to 70.5
percent, a 24-percentage point increase.


b. Reduction in illness as cause of poverty

18.    Fewer people had their ability to work negatively affected by illness or
reported payment for medical treatment as a cause of poverty. These measures
improved overall in the project areas and, for the most part, the poorer provinces of
Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi saw a reduction of these indicators. However, improvements
were not shared across all provinces. In Chongqing and Henan, more people were not able
to work due to illness and fell into poverty due to payment for medical treatment.

c. Improved Patient satisfaction

19.     Project investments in improving infrastructure of health facilities and
training health workers to improve quality of services had the desired result. The
before and after project surveys show that patient satisfaction in project areas has
drastically increased. Compared with 2008, the proportion of outpatients who considered
outpatients' waiting time to be short increased by 18 percentage points, and the proportion
of outpatients who considered the medical environment to be good increased by 34.1
percentage points.

20.     In sum, comparing expected and actual project results and economic benefits,
the project delivered on expectations. Project areas saw progress in equity of access to
care and reduced economic burden of impatient care, as well as improved patient
satisfaction with health services. Provinces, particularly poor ones, had a reduction in the
population unable to work due to illness or driven into poverty because of payment for
medical care.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.       WB/DFID China Rural Health Project (RHP) was launched in October 2008 with a total
investment of 50 million USD of WB loan and 5 million GBP DFID/UK grant, and the account
was closed on 31 December, 2014 (the DFID grant closed on March 31, 2011).The project
implementation period is 6 years (including one year of extension), 8 provinces/municipalities and
40 counties were selected as project provinces and counties. They are Shaanxi, Chongqing, Qinghai
and Gansu in western part of China; Henan, Shanxi and Heilongjiang in the middle part and Jiangsu
in the eastern part.

2.      In line with the project log frame, the project has carried out comprehensive and
systematic pilot reforms on rural health protection system, rural health service delivery
system, delivery of basic public health service, and comprehensive reform of county-level
hospitals, to set up cross-sectorial mechanism to lead, coordinate and disseminate the
experience of rural health reform pilots. After 6 years of implementation, the project has
gained expected outputs in all components and achieved its designed objectives.
Meanwhile, it has practiced result-based project management model. The achievement of
the project is briefed as follows:
    I. Realization of project result indicators

3.      The Mid-term survey conducted in 2011 revealed that out of the 22 result
indicators, 20 had achieved the expected target and only two not yet achieved. Since mid-
term review, CPSM and relevant provinces tried measures such as focused supervision,
intensified intervention, real-time monitoring and quarterly reporting to strengthen
achievement of expected targets before the closure of project accounts. According to the
final survey result and the M&E data between Oct. 2013 and 30 Sept. 2014, all 22
indicators have achieved their targets.


    II. A set of innovative experience and practice developed

    1. The development of rural health protection system

4.     Experience and practice on rural health protection system have been developed in
term of financing, payment, linkage between NCMS and MFA, medical insurance
information management, M&E and capacity building of administrative agencies.
5.     The payment reform of the project is characterized by 1) diversified exploration to
cover almost all practices at county level in China; 2) continuous improvement to
accumulate practical experience; 3) parallel advancement of payment reform and other
reform. Project experience and practice are of high value of reference and have offered
examples for the country.
6.     The experiences explored by the project on NCMS payment reform was recognized
and promoted by the former responsible department of MOH. CPSM and Rural Health
Management Department of former MOH jointly organized a workshop to promote the
experience on NCMS payment reform in April, 2012. The workshop was attended by

                                               44
officials of provincial health department and NCMS administrative offices and experts in
31 provinces, representative from NHFPC pilot counties of NCMS payment reform.
    2. Rural health service delivery system

7.      Targeted at improving the quality and efficiency of health service delivery and
focused on quality control and performance management, the project innovative
explorations have been carried out in performance management and compensation
mechanism; comprehensive reform of county-level hospitals; supervision and management
of health service quality; integration of township-village management and human resource
development.
8.      The performance management in project areas is characterized by more weight to
quality and work load; combination of centralized evaluation and routine evaluation,
external evaluation and internal evaluation, evaluation of institution and individual staff;
linkage of evaluation results and rectification with government subsidy, NCMS payment
and allocation; attention to both economic incentive and non-economic incentive. The
concept of performance evaluation and management has rooted in project areas, the
efficiency and performance of the health service system in project areas have been greatly
improved through diversified measures.
9.     In May 2013, CPSM and WB jointly organized a workshop to share project
experience on health service performance management. The representatives of System
Reform Department and Grass-roots Health Department of NHFPC confirmed the project
exploration, expressing that the pilot work had explored ways and means for the
performance management in rural grass-roots medical institutions, which were quite
operable.
    3. Provision of basic public health service

10.    Targeted at public health service equity and focused on exploring means to provide
equal public health service, pilot activities have been implemented on purchase of public
health service, NCD management, management of mental health, mode of health
promotion and health village development.
11.    Many typical delivery modes such as government purchase, contractual
management, performance based payment, township-village integration, contract plus
service coupon, one-stop service card were developed. At the same time, the project
explored a third-party evaluation mechanism and set up a mechanism to monitor and
evaluate the delivery of “service package”.
12.     Health village development: All project provinces and counties through a series of
innovative practices such as environment improvement, election of health households,
various kind of propaganda on health, health promotion targeted at focal groups and key
diseases. A group of health villages with typical features have been developed and are
replicable.



                                            45
13.     A high-level workshop to share experience on basic public health service equity
under this project was held in December 2010 in Zhengzhou of Henan. Vice Minister Chen
Xiaohong of MOH confirmed the innovative service delivery model of basic public health
characterized by “government leadership, management by relevant department, township-
village co-action, contractual control, multi supervision and performance based payment”.
In October 2013, CPSM and WB jointly organized a workshop to share experience on
Health village. The representatives of Disease Control and Prevention Bureau of NHFPC
confirmed the explorations.
    4. The comprehensive reform of county public hospitals focusing on payment
system reform

14.     The project explored the comprehensive reform of county public hospitals as a
breakthrough to the public hospital reform. A pilot model has been gradually established,
in which the patients are the center, service is regulated by clinical path, expense is
controlled through comprehensive payment system, the improved supervisory system is
used as a guarantee, incentive mechanism as impetus and the information platform as a
support.
15.    In June 2012, an external review on the pilot reform in Henan was conducted. The
Health Reform Office of MOH organized a special survey and research on Yiyang County
of Henan about the comprehensive reform of county public hospitals. The survey and
research report was commented by five Ministers of MOH who requested for wide
dissemination and replication of Yiyang experience.
16.     In October 2012, CPSM and Health Reform Office of MOH organized an
experience sharing workshop on the comprehensive reform of county public hospitals.
Officials from the health reform office of provincial health department and county health
bureau from 18 provinces piloting the comprehensive reform of county public hospitals
selected by MOH attended the workshop.
    5. Project experience widely disseminated

17.     China National Radio, Health Daily, Health channel and China Health Pictorial
reported the innovative experience and practices of NCMS payment reform, basic public
health service delivery, coordinated care and health village development.
    6. Project experience caught the attention of the international organizations and
neighboring countries

(1) CPSM worked with WB to arrange a delegation of 18 officials and experts from WB
    health sectors in East Asia and Pacific region, Latin America, Middle East and Africa,
    South Asia to visit Yiyang County of Henan on the pilot comprehensive reform of
    county public hospitals in November 2012.
(2) Project experience shared with countries of Mekong River basin



                                           46
18.     In April 2013, CPSM held a high-level seminar jointly sponsored by WB and DFID
to share experience on China health reform and universal coverage for delegates from Laos,
Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. The delegation of 53 participants visited
Henan to learn Project experiences.
(3) Experience sharing and cooperation carried out with two countries of Central Asia
   (i) In September 2014, CPSM and representatives from project counties went to
   Tajikistan to attend a symposium on primary healthcare service delivery jointly held
   by WB and Health and Social Security Ministry of Tajikistan and shared the RHP
   experience.
   (ii) In November 2014, a delegation from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan attended the RHP
   summary and experience sharing workshop and visited project areas in Henan.
   (iii) In addition, at the invitation of Laos’s government and Ministry of Health of UZ,
   Representatives from project provinces and counties visit Laos in 2013.

   III. Rural health service equity received attention and improvement

19.     The project carried out a series of innovative practices centering on improving the
social equity. The equity in health financing and the health service for disadvantaged
groups(including ethnic minorities) has been improved through reforming NCMS payment
system, making the reimbursement easy for the poor, linking NCMS and MFA, and
lowering disease-born economic burdens of the poor. All project counties have achieved
the seamless linkage between the two systems and worked out corresponding policies to
ensure the poor to benefit from the two systems as much as possible. RHP project also
explored ways to establish fund for catastrophic diseases, thus to reduce the financial
burden of health-seeking for the poor.
20.      Supported by the project, gender equity has received wide attention. The project is
also dedicated to gradually improving rural health service system, as a result, the service
capacity at township and village level has strengthened, service quality improved and the
accessibility of health service enhanced. The development of rural health team has
produced good effects, the number, structure and quality of health staff increased fairly.
To increase the need of health service among women, the project has carried out effective
pilots, and the percentage of women receiving service from qualified women doctors in a
majority of project provinces has evidently increased.




                                            47
   IV.A set of innovative experience and practice on project management achieved

    1. Result-based project management and implementation

    (1) Result-oriented project management

21.     The project adopted the result-oriented management, used the achieved project
objectives as the basis to measure project effects, arranged project activities and fund
according to the results achieved. The prepayment of project fund is also dependent on the
realization of periodic objectives.
    (2) Innovative fund arrangement
        (i)    Project counties are not liable to repay the loan
22.     The project arranged for 80 percent of loan fund borrowed and repaid by central
fiscal and the remaining 20 percent repaid by provincial fiscal, and the amount of
repayment differed according to provincial financial resources. Project counties are not
liable to repay the loan or provide counterpart fund. This arrangement has made project
counties free from financial constraints and go all out to explore feasible and innovative
practices.  
        (ii)   Prepayment of fund
23.    The project for the first time adopted prepayment mechanism and abolished
payment categories, and used annual activity plan of project counties as basis and condition
for fund use and disbursement, thus improving the flexibility and promptness of fund use.
    (3) Incentive and exit mechanism tried out
24.     The project innovatively adopted incentive and exit mechanisms and rewarded
twice the project counties with significant progress and excellent effects. 22 project
counties (28 county times) were rewarded and their enthusiasm to innovate was further
stimulated. At the same time, five project lagging counties received targeted support and
were asked to carry out rectification. As a result, all 40 counties made great progress or
even a breakthrough with their performance. The incentive mechanism injected vitality and
impetus into the project implementation.
   V. Experience acquired from project implementation

    1. A forward-looking project design is a precondition and guarantee for project
success

    (1) The contents of the project design highly conform to objectives and directions of
        the health reform in China.
25.    The project was designed through close collaboration between WB, Chinese
government and experts home and abroad. During the two years of project design, Chinese
and foreign experts conducted profound research and analysis of Chinese rural health and

                                            48
demonstrated main problems and their reasons in the development of rural health. On this
basis, a targeted intervention plan was formulated. Although the design was earlier than
the disclosure of opinions on new round of national health reform, the project framework,
main contents highly conformed to the objectives and direction of the Chinese health
reform, thus allowing the project serve as pilot and catalyst in the process of Chinese health
reform.
    (2) Integration of international experience and national experience to avoid straight
        copy
26.     While introducing international concepts and methods, the project considered
different situation in project areas when integrating international practices with domestic
practical situation. All project provinces and counties took the initiative designing their
own innovative pilot activities based on their situation, sought for a bottom-up route for
the pilot reform, thus making the pilots more practical, operable and replicable.
   2. A clearly defined mechanism of project management, organization and
operation is the basis for the success of project

    (1) Project management office

27.     The project involves central, provincial and county levels, thus a mature, stable and
experienced project management office is needed to coordinate relevant agencies to carry
out pilot activities. The project management offices play an important role for the project
implementation.
    (3) Expert team
28.     As a worldwide challenge, health reform keenly requires experts at all levels to
provide technical assistance and guidance. The experts especially central experts need to
understand the dynamic health development home and abroad, know well relevant health
policies, have strong professional capacity and rich theoretical and empirical experience.
At the same time, international experts are needed to provide the project with international
experience and best practices.
    (3) Project coordination mechanism

29.     The rural health reform deals with many departments, systems and levels. The
project set up a mechanism for smooth communication and coordination. This is normally
achieved through regular meeting, work meeting and brief report to inform main project
achievements, discuss main problems and come up with solutions and reach a consensus
on strategic and directive issues.
    3. Innovative management safeguards the project implementation

   (1) The project adopted the result-oriented management, fund arrangement (Project
counties are not liable to repay the loan, the project for the first time adopted prepayment
mechanism and abolished payment categories). The project innovatively adopted incentive

                                             49
and exit mechanism and rewarded twice the project counties with significant progress and
excellent effects.

    (2) Timely summary of project experience and practices

30.     The project tried to address challenges and difficulties in the implementation;
summarized and produced operational guiding books on several important innovative
activities based on pilot and exploratory practices to regulate pilot exploration in project
counties and outside project areas. Meanwhile, the Project Case Studies of Innovative
exploration and practices was written and as a publication issued domestically.
    (3) Project progress monitored to allow timely adjustment

31.     To allow real-time and dynamic monitoring of the overall project progress, the
project designed M&E indicators of various kinds including the 22 result indicators to track
the realization of project objectives; 23 routine M&E indicators to understand the
implementation process (same as indicators of the national health reform in order to allow
dynamic comparison); two-year milestone indicators to understand the progress of key
implementation nodes, and objectives of annual activity plan. The complete monitoring
system has provided important data support for timely detection of problems, formulation
of counter measures and timely adjustment.
   VI. Problems Exist

   1. Influence from adjustment of the management system of some project counties
   on project innovation

32.     The project innovation was carried out in the context of national and provincial
health reform, some pilots might be so restricted by existing policies or regulations that
could not continue or achieve expected effects. For instance when Chongqing was
exploring payment reform in general hospitals, there were both life insurance department
and social insurance department, due to departmental adjustment followed, health reform
policies were all planned at municipal level, this situation made project counties difficult
to advance the reform of county public hospitals as scheduled.
    2. The clinical pathway coverage of diseases need to be extended

33.     The clinical-path-based comprehensive payment system reform is still under
exploration, Even though all project counties have carried out payment reform related with
clinical path, progress varies a lot. Some areas have only applied clinical path to a few
number of simple diseases without setting up supervisory mechanism, there is still room
for advancement.
    3. Room for improvement in performance management

34.    Health staffs in project areas still have different views on the existing performance
evaluation system. Village doctors in some areas received the performance management
and equitable public health favorably, they could have some stable income from providing
                                            50
public health service, the more people they looked after, the more they would earn. But
some other doctors believed that the merit pay led to times of “big rice bowl” and people
did not have much enthusiasm. Due to the implementation of performance management
and basic drug list, township health centers in some areas did not have any other business
except general outpatient service, doctors had less enthusiasm.
   4. The prepayment mechanism has not come into its full play. Implementing
   agencies still lack of working fund and burden to pay for the project activities is
   still big.

35.     Since the prepayment was made to county bureau of finance and did not require
counterpart fund, project offices still followed conventional reimbursement system and
made advance payment and then got reimbursed from the county bureau of finance. The
project implementing agencies had no additional fund as working fund and faced a pressure
of advance payment; this led to imbalanced fund use and affected the disbursement of the
project.
    5. Exchange rate affected the use of project fund

36.     Due to the change of exchange rate when the project was appraised and when it was
implemented, central project office and provincial project offices all faced with risks
brought about by the changed exchange rate. For instance the amount of DFID grant for
Gansu was 465,000 GBP and was equivalent to 6.51 million RMB Yuan at the exchange
rate when the project was appraised (1 GBP=14 RMB Yuan) , it turned out to be only
4.6733 million RMB Yuan in actual use with a loss of 1.8367 million RMB Yuan; the
amount of WB loan was 5.15 million USD when the project was appraised and equivalent
to 36.05 million Yuan at the exchange rate of 1 USD to 7 RMB Yuan, but by the time of
project completion, the actual amount used was 33.37 million RMB Yuan with a loss of
2.68 million RMB Yuan.
   VII. Recommendations

    1. On future loan project design

37.     The RHP project design and implementation have proved that a design built on
survey and research and accorded with national macro health development strategy does
not only guarantee the realization of project objectives but also allow such a project to push
forward the Chinese health reform, thus maximizing the added value of a WB loan project.
The system and mechanism innovation, advance concept and technology introduced and
influence on future health reform bear much more profound and sustainable significance
compared with the scale of capital input. The design and implementation of future
international health project may use the mode and path of this project for reference.
    2. On project execution

38.    Top-level design, guidance and central level coordination and planning are vitally
important for innovative projects aimed at pushing forward health reform and providing
evidence for national policy-making. The implementation of an innovative project requires
                                             51
inter-departmental coordination and communication, and also requires implementing
agencies to timely track the changes and progress with relevant national policies so as to
make relevant adjustment and ensure project effects. All these rely on guidance from
relevant ministries and departments, coordination of central project management agencies
including the coordination and communication with international financing agencies,
project provinces and counties, and coordinate team of experts at all levels.
    3. On the design of evaluation indicators

39.     The design of project result indicators should accord with the project interventions,
and the two should be directly related. Otherwise, it is neither objective nor fair to have the
realization of indicators evaluate project impact where there have been not corresponding
interventions carried out. Take cesarean section rate as an example, and the indicator of
gynecological check-up of last year among women aged 15-49 (married and of
childbearing age) did not closely correlate with project interventions.
