        Rural Health Project (P084437)


 The underlying motivation for the project is to support innovations and generate knowledge useful to the government for its on-going health reform
 program. the project has generated a number of innovative pilots which have directly contributed to the policy development and reform implementation
 in project counties and for the nation as a whole.The project has met all the 22 project monitoring and performance indicators and in genenal has
 achieved the Project Development Objectives in the following three areas: (i) increased use of health services, decreased out of pocket expenses by
 patient, and improved equity of health services; (ii) increased health financing resources for the rural population and improved public health
 management; and (iii) improved technical quality of care, internal efficiency in service delivery, and increased rate of overall satisfaction with the rural
 health services. Final evaluations have been completed by the project counties, provinces and central level. Collection of best practice case studies
 have been published. Successful experiences have been summariezed and disseminated to the non-project areas and have contributed to national
 policy developments. A project completion and dissemination workshop has taken place in November, 2014. The central CPSM is in the process to
 prepare a borrower's ICR report based on its comprehensive project final evaluation report, and a province PMO director workshop has been held on
 Dec 17, 2014 for World Bank ICR report preparation.

               The change is toward the positive direction, but not significant in value. This largely due to the following:
               The reform on payment to the THC staff as the results of essential drugs and zero markup policy has to some extent de-motivated the
               health professionals at THC. As the results, the productivity has dropped at the THC and the utilizaiton at higher level hospitals has
               increased all over the country. To be able to remain the same productivity, this is already an achivement for the project counties.

               The whole country has seen an increase of the c-section rate in the past years, based on the national health utilization survey: the national
               rate for 2008 is 27%, for 2013 is 41%. Under this context, the rate of project counties dropped rather than increased.
