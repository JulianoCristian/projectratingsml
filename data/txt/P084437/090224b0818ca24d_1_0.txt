                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation towards achievement of the development objectives, which continue to remain in line with Government health reform policies, has overall been steady. The
                         out of pocket expenses of health services for rural health insurance schemes (NCMS) have further decreased to 51%, which has over performed the target of 2013. The public health
                         scorecard rating has reached 86 which also has exceeded the target of 2013 as 80. Good innovations continue to be generated in the three reform areas of health financing, service
                         delivery, and public health; variability of progress remains across the Counties and Provinces.

                         The project will give priority to the timely evaluation and dissemination of the innovations and good practice; a dissemination strategy, including an action plan, has been developed
