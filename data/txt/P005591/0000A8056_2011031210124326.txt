                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         As per the TF Grant Agreement of June 1994, the project's objectives are "to assist the Recipient in implementing a strategy aimed to establish the institutional
                         and regulatory framework for decreasing the use of ODS and introduce, on a demonstrational basis, ODS-free technologies to the country's refrigeration, foam
                         and aerosol industries so as to initiate actions leading to an early ODS-phaseout program". The project consists of two main elements: Technology
                         Development and Institutional Strengthening. The technology development component consists of 5 components in three ODS-using sectors focusing on
                         demonstration projects, technical assistance and training: (a) Refrigeration: (i) the introduction of HFC-134a as a substitute for CFC-12 as a refrigerant in the
                         manufacturing of refrigerators; (ii) the replacement of CFC-11 as a foam-blowing agent for refrigerator insulation; (iii) the introduction of a CFC-recycling and
                         refrigeration maintenance program through training. (b) Flexible Foam: Replacement of CFC-11 with a non-ODS substitute. (c) Aerosol: A sectoral study to
                         determine assistance needs and training. The initial project costs were US$ 2.32m, of which US$ 1.79m would be financed through the grant. Subsequently, the
                         Multilateral Fund (MF) of the MP authorized new sub-projects bringing the total project costs to US$ 4.2m, of which US$ 3.79m would be financed through the
                         grant. It is expected that further sub-projects will be approved by the MF.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                            Yes           No
