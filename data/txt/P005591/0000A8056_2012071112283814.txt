                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's objectives are to: a) establish the institutional and regulatory framework for decreasing ODS uses; and b) introduce ODS-free technologies to the
                         refrigeration, foam and aerosol industries as a first demonstration phase in completing an early ODS phaseout program.
