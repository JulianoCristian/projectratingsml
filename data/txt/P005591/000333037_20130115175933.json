Demonstration Project\n            for the Phase-out of Ozone Depleting Substances in Tunisia\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the lack of any formal evaluation of\n            project performance until the Implementation Completion and\n            Results Report, or ICR has left inherent weaknesses and\n            performance issues undiscovered for too long. In future,\n            regular mid-term reviews should be held, and sector units\n            should strongly consider the option of a series of\n            programmatic or repeater projects to carry out a long\n            mandate such as this. Such an approach will allow regular\n            opportunities to reassess the project design and objectives\n            and will help to ensure that a large gap does not develop\n            between the intended purpose of the project and its actual\n            activities. This lesson is widely applicable across the Bank\n            portfolio, but in most cases regular review is already in\n            place and prevents 'mission creep' from reaching\n            the very large proportions it reached in the case of this project."}, "docdt": "2012-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
