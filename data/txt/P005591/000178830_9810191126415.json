The project consists of two main components\n            involving institutional strengthening and technology\n            transfer. The technology development component includes the\n            following: 1) in the refrigeration sector, introduction of\n            hydrofluorocarbon 134a (HFC-134a) as a refrigerant replacing\n            chlorofluorocarbon 12 (CFC-12), replacement of CFC-11 as a\n            foam-blowing agent by a low CFC and/or non-CFC substance,\n            and the introduction of a CFC-recycling and refrigeration\n            maintenance program to train refrigeration technicians how\n            to recycle CFCs and handle non-ODS refrigerants; 2) flexible\n            foam which will demonstrate the replacement of CFC-11 with a\n            non-ODS substitute; and 3) an aerosol component which will\n            consist of a sectoral study in order to determine the full\n            technical and financial needs for technology development.\n            Finally, the institutional strengthening component will\n            consist of establishing the Ozone Project Implementation\n            Unit which will be responsible for execution of the project."}, "docdt": "1993-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
