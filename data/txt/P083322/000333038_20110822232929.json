It was the most damaging earthquake since the 1976\n            Tangshan Earthquake and resulted in almost 70,000\n            causalities, extensive damage and economic losses across the\n            province. Among the 4 cities of the SUDP, Mianyang was the\n            most affected by the earthquake. As a result, the Mianyang\n            Municipal Government received substantial support from the\n            national government for recovery and reconstruction\n            activities. Land use plans were changed to accommodate\n            affected population and economic activities. Domestic funds\n            were used for infrastructure investments originally under\n            the SUDP in both the Southern Economic Development Zone\n            ('SEDZ') and Pioneer Park. The Mianyang Government\n            is to allocate the unused SUDP funds, totaling US$ 11.8\n            million, to infrastructure investments in the Xinglong Area\n            of Pioneer Park. The changes will not affect the overall\n            project development objective (PDO), but will require some\n            adjustments to the project result indicators."}, "docdt": "2011-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
