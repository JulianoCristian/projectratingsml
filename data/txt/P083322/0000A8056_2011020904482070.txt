                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project initially fell behind schedule after the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake which diverted management attention from the project and caused a shortage of counterpart funds.
                         Although the project is still somewhat behind schedule, significant implementation progress has been made in the last six months. A number of investments have been completed
                         that are helping alleviate travel bottlenecks and improve core urban functions in Suining and Panzhihua.For example, wastewater pipelines financed in Panzhihua have been
                         completed and connected to treatment facilities, which are helping to improve the urban environment. Many investments are nearing completion and will further help alleviate traffic
                         bottlenecks, improve urban environment and help improve land use efficiency in the target cities. Although a complete assessment cannot be carried out yet, land development and
                         sales have been growing as a result of project-related infrastructure development in selected economic development zones in Mianyang and Suining. In the particular case of
                         Mianyang, the earthquake prompted changes to land development plans, so the municipal government is adjusting some project activities to align them with new priorities and land
                         use zoning plans to better serve earthquake reconstruction activities. Therefore, a restructuring of the Mianyang Component is being processed and is expected to be finalized by
                         June 2011. Overall the relevance of the PDO remains high and the Mianyang restructuring will enhance project relevance further.
