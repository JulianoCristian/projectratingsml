I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Urbanization has been a key driver of economic growth and poverty reduction in China. It has
transformed the country from a rural, agricultural economy into an increasingly urban and
economically diversified one. When the Sichuan Urban Development Project (SUDP) was
designed, urbanization was anticipated to continue to accelerate as increasing numbers of people
from rural parts of China sought employment in cities across the country. In 2005, urbanization
in Sichuan was only 28 percent but was projected to reach 40% by 2010, representing over 10
million new inhabitants and a corresponding need to plan new urban land and higher level of
infrastructure investments. Sichuan was a driver of economic development in the inland
provinces, a process supported by the central government’s Western Development Strategy at the
turn of the century, which sought to move economic growth inland from the coastal areas.
Urbanization was similarly an important strategic goal of successive five year plans, including
the 11th Five Year Plan (2006 – 2010). The four second-tier cities (Mianyang, Suining, Yibin and
Panzhihua) chosen to be part of the project were all among the fastest growing urban centers in
the province and were found to have considerable growth potential, making them a likely
attractive target for migrant workers.

When the project was approved in August 2006, China’s economy was growing at a rate of 10.7
percent, the fastest pace in a decade and much of the growth was generated in the country’s cities.
The movement of people to cities was seen as key to economic growth and migration was
encouraged. Yet urbanization also produced a myriad of economic, environmental, regional and
social challenges due to its speed and scale. As cities continued to grow, the pressures of
urbanization led to inefficient urban sprawl, urban-rural inequality resulting from barriers to
migration, uneven access to quality public services, and inequitable distribution of gains from
rural-urban land conversion.

Rationale for Bank involvement. SUDP aimed to address one of China’s most pressing
development problems, namely promoting equitable and resource-efficient development in four
of China’s rapidly growing second-tier cities through innovative strategies – particularly with
respect to social impacts on project affected people. The intention was also to generate important
lessons for future engagements elsewhere in China. The Bank’s experience in infrastructure
planning and peri-urban development planning and its work to develop resettlement guidelines
and compensation systems for project affected people were considered key reasons for its
engagement. The Bank had also financed the Sichuan Urban Environment Project (SUEP)
gaining important insight about the province and its challenges.

The objectives of SUDP cut across three of the five pillars of the Country Partnership Strategy
2006-2010, including: (i) promoting efficient and balanced urbanization and migration of surplus
labor from rural to urban areas by improving the quality of urban management and infrastructure;
(ii) building a resource efficient society by promoting more financially sustainable utility
systems, expanding urban wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and by promoting

                                                1
urbanization with transport option including public and more efficient transportation modes that
reduce pollution and fuel consumption; (iii) improving land administration management by
clarifying landholder rights, land acquisition and compensation practices, and support alternative
approaches to acquisition of rural land, and help enhance the role of land as a stable revenue
source; and (iv) strengthening regional competitiveness in the lagging inland regions to attract
foreign and domestic investment.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

In the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the PDO was “to improve core urban functions in an
equitable and resource efficient manner by removing identified infrastructure bottlenecks
hampering land development, transport, and environmental conditions in four second-tier cities
in Sichuan Province”. The PDO in the Loan Agreement (LA) was “to assist the Borrower’s
Sichuan Province in facilitating rational urban development by removing identified infrastructure
problems that impede land development, efficient transport movement and environmental
protection”. The LA PDO will be used to evaluate achievement of the PDO in this report.

The one key outcome indicator was “evidence that identified bottlenecks hampering core urban
functions have been removed in participating municipalities, as expected by the strategic
investments of the project, including a high level of satisfaction among users of the investments
funded under the project and among those affected by land acquisition and resettlement under the
project.” The PAD did not define what “evidence” or which “reports and technical audits” were
to be used in determining achievements of the project; however detailed outcome and output
indicators for each city were included in Annex 3 of the PAD.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
N/A

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The beneficiaries were the populations of the four project cities: Mianyang (1,170,000), Suining
(740,000), Yibin (870,000) and Panzhihua (560,000), for a total of 3,340,000. Moreover, the
management capacity of the provincial and city PIUs was strengthened in areas such as financial
management, procurement and contract management, and application of safeguards. Indirect
project beneficiaries also included private sector companies in the Economic Development
Zones in Suining and Mianyang.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Urban Infrastructure Investment Component (Total cost: US$365.56 million. Loan allocation
of US$180 million or 49% of total project cost). This component was planned to fund strategic
investments in different second-tier cities in Sichuan.

Mianyang. (Total component cost: US$98.70 million; loan allocation: US$47.91 million or 49%
of component cost). Mianyang’s key urban challenges included limited urban space and

                                                2
inefficient spatial development along existing trunk roads leaving large areas of land closer to
downtown undeveloped. This led to overstretched public transport systems, increased travel
times and congestion. The project was to construct trunk and secondary infrastructure, including
drainage and environmental improvements, for two major urban development areas: Pioneer
Park (US$49.96 million) and the Southern Economic Development Zone (SEDZ) (US$48.73
million). Investments would provide a well-organized road network and developed land for
industrial and commercial activities as well as public facilities and housing.

Suining. (Total component cost: US$64.98 million; loan allocation: US$28.8 million or 44% of
component cost). Suining marketed itself as a satellite city for spill-over growth from
neighboring Chongqing. It followed a similar development pattern as Mianyang: linear growth
along a trunk network and along the Fujian River (extending 16 km along the river). The city
master plan proposed developing new districts across the river and to the west of the city. The
project was to construct secondary infrastructure and roads in the newly developed Xining
District Area (US$58.23 million) to the west of the city, including an associated link road to the
city railway station area, the Xining Road (US$6.75 million).

Yibin. (Total component cost: US$ 76.35 million; loan allocation: US$28.3 million or 37% of
component cost). Due to its location at the confluence of two rivers, Yibin’s economic growth
was constrained by fragmented form and function due to land scarcity. The scattered city scale
prevented the formation of the city core as a commercial and business center, and the existing
road system lacked effective traffic connections and network functionality. Moreover, parts of
the old city were in dire need of redevelopment. The project was to construct two riverbank
roads: Route A (US$40.44 million) and Route B (US$35.91 million) designed to improve access
within the city and works would also enhance the degraded riverbank environment.

Panzhihua. (Total component cost: US$125.53 million; loan allocation: US$ 67.99 million or 54%
of component cost). As a major mining town and regional industrial center, Panzhihua had
significant potential, but a poor layout, an underdeveloped transport network and little urban
character which posed challenges to its continued development. The project was to improve
access and traffic circulation in two urban roads, viz. Bing-Ren Road (US$80.22 million) and Bin
Jiang Road (US$9.32 million), and would upgrade the city’s sewerage systems (US$10.41
million), riverbanks, and landscape conditions (US$25.60 million).

Institutional Development and Capacity Building (IDCB) Component (US$7.00 million;
100% Loan financed). This component consisted of technical assistance (TA) for IDCB for the
project municipalities (US$3.30 million), and for Project Implementation and Management,
including EMP/RAP implementation monitoring (US$3.70 million). The goal of the TA was to
help municipalities improve urban planning and management capacities related to spatial
planning, land management, transport planning, and utility and asset management.

1.6 Revised Components

Sichuan province was severely impacted by the Wenchuan Earthquake on May 12, 2008. The
city of Mianyang, which was especially affected, consequently changed its master plan and
received significant assistance from the central government for reconstruction. As a result, the
following changes were made to its planned works (Part A. 1 of the project) in a restructuring
dated November 18, 2011:
    1. Construction of the section of the Second Ring Road from the interchange with Yingbin
       Avenue to the boundary of Pioneer Park (Part A.1 (b) in Schedule 2 of the Loan
       Agreement) was dropped and the associated indicators related to the Ring Road were
       removed as the road was financed by domestic resources;
    2. As a result of land use changes and national support for earthquake reconstruction efforts,
       selected road and landscaping contracts in the SEDZ were dropped;
    3. Savings amounting to US$11.8 million from these cancellations were utilized for new
       investments in the Xinglong area (a new development zone within Pioneer Park) and
       included: (i) 4.60 km of roads, (ii) 9.3 km of storm pipelines, (iii) 6.1 km of sewer
       pipelines, (iv) 1.1 km of drainage channel, and (v) slope protection, landscaping, lighting
       and traffic signals.

1.7 Other significant changes

Following the Wenchuan Earthquake, Mianyang, Suining and Panzhihua were unable to meet
counterpart funding requirements due to unexpected expenditures associated with earthquake
recovery and reconstruction activities. The Loan Agreement was therefore amended on
December 9, 2008 to increase the percentage of expenditures to be financed from the Loan for
works (Category 1) in these cities from 70% to 100%.

The mid-term review in November 2010 adjusted infrastructure works in several cities. As a
result, the Xining road in Suining (S6 and S7 in the procurement plan) was cancelled; route B in
Yibin was shortened from 3.5 to 2.1 km; and a sewer line in Panzhihua was shortened.

In addition to the revised components mentioned above, the November 2011 restructuring
included a reallocation of Loan proceeds, changes in the Results Framework, and an increase in
the threshold of international competitive bidding for goods from US$500,000 to US$1 million.



2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis. Sichuan’s strategic location, large population size
substantial GDP, resources and growth potential made it a driver of development for China’s
Western Region. Urbanization in Sichuan was expected to increase rapidly and reach 40 percent
by 2010 (it actually reached 43.5 percent in 2013). That combination of growth potential and
resources made it fertile ground for an innovative project combining careful urban planning and

                                                4
higher levels of infrastructure investment to meet economic and social needs while addressing
environmental challenges of rapidly expanding cities. The four small and medium sized cities
selected for the project were chosen as representative candidate cities for this kind of
intervention.

Lessons learned. The project design incorporated lessons learned from the implementation of
the Sichuan Urban Environment Project (SUEP, closed January 2007) which financed water and
wastewater treatment facilities in the provincial capital and three other second-tier cities.
Specifically, lessons included: (a) the need to develop urban infrastructure projects as part of an
integrated spatial plan rather than as a discrete activity; (b) the importance of thorough project
preparation to avoid delays and avoid problems with fund flows; and (c) the importance of
carrying out detailed socio-economic surveys in preparing high quality resettlement action plans
(RAPs) to avoid implementation delays.

Other background studies. The Bank initiated a number of studies to further inform the project
design, including detailed economic and financial analysis of the investments. The Bank team
examined the viability of some of the industries expected to be located in the economic
development zones in these 4 cities, drawing on analysis of the electronics components industry1
and supply chain for automotive components.2 Moreover, the Bank benefited from a value chain
analysis undertaken by the IFC to identify opportunities and challenges associated with
strengthening the electronic and agribusiness sectors. 3 During preparation, the Bank was also
able to draw on work undertaken by IFC and MIGA through the China Project Development
Facility (CPDF), a multi-donor small and medium sized enterprise facilities located in Chengdu.4
An investment climate survey and benchmarking study completed in March 2006 analyzed the
opportunities and challenges associated with promoting economic activities of SUDP cities in
areas such as industrial clustering and investment promotion. MIGA and IFC organized a
workshop to present the outcome of this study in which the representatives of Mianyang and
Suining participated. Findings from a strategic review of wastewater management in Panzhihua
City undertaken by the World Bank-Netherlands Water Partnership Program also informed the
preparation of the project.

Assessment of project design. The project design responded to a clear need to address the
expected pressures of urbanization in medium sized cities in Sichuan province while supporting
the government’s strategy of fostering economic growth in the Western Region. The design was
complex, involving urban area development, urban transport, wastewater and scenic

improvement in multiple investments in four cities with no prior experience in implementing a
Bank project. The project sought to be innovative by helping these cities promote efficient
spatial development through rational rural-urban land conversion in peri-urban areas and
development of the urban transport network connecting these areas. The strengthening of
infrastructure to support Special Economic Zones, including support to resettle farmers living in
these areas, added to its complexity as did the intention to monitor a range of factors, including
market movement and prices of land.

The project sought to address critical issues to the urbanization process in a more systematic way,
including land conversion, valuation and resettlement. It is not clear, however, that the
conditions were right to implement a project of such complex and whether the potential risks
were adequately identified or mitigated during project the design. As the borrowers ICR notes, a
key lesson of the project is to avoid setting unduly optimistic goals and objectives.

PDO/KPI Formulation. As mentioned, the PDO in the LA was inconsistent with the PDO in
the PAD. Furthermore, the PAD did not provide guidance on what “core urban functions” were,
which “infrastructure bottlenecks” needed to be removed, and the causal links between the PDO
and the infrastructure investments was less than obvious. The key performance indicator
“evidence that identified bottlenecks hampering core urban functions have been removed…”,
was neither quantifiable nor measurable. The “evidence” was to be established “via reports from
technical and social audits” but these were not defined, nor did the Results Framework specify
what should be contained in these reports. The Results Framework did, however, contain detailed
outcome and output indicators by city, which were measurable (see Section 2.3).

Safeguards. The project was correctly categorized as a Category “A” given the scope of the
investments and the substantial resettlement work to be carried out. The government acquired
rural land from agricultural collectives and auctioned or sold it for urban development. As a
result, significant emphasis was placed on conducting field-based due-diligence for
environmental and social aspects of the project. Because of the sensitivities involved, the Bank
conducted a special safeguards review in Mianyang and Suining, based on a revised RAP and
undertook an enhanced analysis of the land components in support of project appraisal.
Resettlement activities were designed (and implemented) by the four municipal PIUs, and
overseen by the provincial PMO and the Bank. Furthermore, as part of the design, resettlement
implementation was to be regularly monitored by an independent external resettlement
monitoring agent.

The capacity of the PIUs in the four cities varied significantly, and as a result, the need for
support and capacity strengthening was not uniform. This should have been recognized upfront
and a more comprehensive assessment undertaken to inform the project design, and develop
appropriate and targeted training methodologies for each city.

Assessment of risks. The PAD identified a range of risks, the majority judged to be moderate,
with just two deemed substantial (delay in land sales and inadequate compensation levels). The
team did not assign an aggregate rating to the project, which should have been considered given
its complexity. The project was included in the corporate risk list due to its resettlement
requirements, and was subject to review by the Resettlement Committee. The overall risk profile

                                                6
should have been at least “substantial” if not “high”, especially considering the reputational risks
and controversy surrounding the land valuation and resettlement.

This potential market downturn on land value was not identified as a risk in the PAD. While the
market trajectory cannot be predicted, the results framework included an indicator specifically
related to land prices, and the potential impact of the market and macro-economic situation
should therefore also have been taken into account.

The PAD assigned a moderate risk to implementation delays caused by lack of experience
implementing World Bank projects on the part of the municipalities. The risk mitigation
envisaged was systematic training and the recruitment of procurement agencies and project
management consultants. An additional risk to capacity was, however, that the PIUs had
inadequate capacity to ensure that key lessons could be extracted from resettlement and land
valuation activities, and especially from the development of the Special Economic Zones.

Finally, the risk assessment did not mention the risk of natural disaster even though Sichuan is
historically seismically active and prone to other hazards including flooding. The PAD should
have referenced disaster risk management, for example in ensuring that selected contractors
would incorporate disaster risks methods in the construction of civil works.

Adequacy of government commitment. The commitment from the government was strong
from the beginning of the formulation process. A leading group headed by a Vice Governor
designated the Sichuan Construction Commission as the agency responsible for project
management. The Commission subsequently appointed the Provincial Project Management
Office (PPMO), which had been responsible for implementation of SUEP to prepare and execute
the project, thus ensuring that the extensive capacity and experience gained from SUEP would be
applied to SUDP.

Quality at entry was moderately unsatisfactory. Significant resources were spent on
preparation, spurred not only by the need for careful preparatory work for Bank investments
supporting the conversion of rural land to urban land, but also to put in place an adequate
framework for implementation. There was strong World Bank Group collaboration early in
project preparation, although little evidence of it having continued through appraisal. The PDO
in the PAD was inconsistent with that in the LA, and the key performance indicator was not
measurable which complicated monitoring and evaluation. Causal linkages between the PDO and
investments were somewhat tenuous. While the team paid significant attention to the technical
aspects of the project during preparation, the institutional complexities and capacity constraints
would have benefited from further analysis, and the results framework was poorly designed.
Many outcome indicators were not project specific as they were equally influenced by external
factors (e.g. land prices, traffic volumes, and economic growth). The Bank team also did not
include experts on industrial or development zone during the design stage to help build local
capacity on planning these zones. Not much attention was given to strengthening the local
capacity to manage resettlement and rural to urban hukou conversion, as capacity building was
more focused on project management for infrastructure development. The project involved four
cities that had never worked with the Bank before, incorporated multiple sectors, including
economic zone development, wastewater, transport, and very complex resettlement and land

                                                 7
valuation. Risk assessment was somewhat wanting as noted above. At the time of its design, the
project was highly innovative and attempted to address critical challenges in China’s
urbanization process. By the standards at the time, the quality at entry would have been
considered satisfactory, but applying the standards expected from projects today, the quality at
entry is considered moderately unsatisfactory, accentuated by the lack of a clear PDO and results
framework, which significantly complicated evaluation of the achievements of the project.

2.2 Implementation

Key factors outside government control

On May 12, 2008, an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Scale of Richter struck Sichuan Province.
The epicenter was located in Wenchuan County (see map in annex 13) and the quake inflicted
severe damage across Sichuan and a number of other provinces. The numbers of people dead or
missing reached 87,150, more than 370,000 people were injured and 4.8 million became
homeless. More than 45 million people were affected in some way by the earthquake, and it
stands as one of the most expensive earthquakes in human history in terms of socio-economic
losses.

Due to their proximity to the epicenter, Mianyang, Yibin and Suining were declared heavily
affected disaster areas. Authorities immediately turned their attention to providing emergency
relief for the affected areas, followed by an extended period of recovery and reconstruction. This
work took precedence over all other infrastructure development, and authorities were forced to
reassess the existing master plans and carefully evaluate existing investments, including those
under SUDP, to ensure these were still relevant and a priority. As a result, the attention of both
the client, including the PPMO, and task team was re-directed to the preparation of a $710
million emergency loan for the Wenchuan Earthquake Reconstruction Project, which was
approved in February 2009.

Understandably, the PMO and cities were stretched to the limit overseeing recovery activities
and were unable to supervise the SUDP adequately. In addition, a planned supervision mission in
June 2008 had to be postponed as the affected areas were closed due to marshal law. The next
could not take place until March 2009 to give provincial and Bank staff the opportunity to devote
their energy to reconstruction activities from the earthquake. The earthquake forced alterations to
the cities’ master plans and hence the project scope. City officials also struggled to obtain
counterpart funding as all available resources were directed to reconstruction activities.
Skyrocketing prices of construction inputs in the aftermath of the earthquake imposed further
financial constraints. At the same time, the project was affected by the global financial crisis of
2007/2008, which led to a depreciation of the RMB.

Due to its distance from the epicenter, the city of Panzhihua was less affected by the devastation.
Three and a half months later, however, it was hit by an earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Scale
of Richter, causing 40 deaths, the collapse of some 10,000 houses and significant damage.

The inability of the PMO and cities to devote adequate time and resources to the supervision of
the SUDP in the aftermath of the earthquake, led to the downgrading of progress towards

                                                8
reaching the PDO to unsatisfactory in mid-2010. Following a successful restructuring and re-
engagement to complete the SUDP, the project was upgraded to moderately satisfactory in early
2012 and to satisfactory in late 2012. This also reflected the fact that the cities had to address
multiple reconstruction challenges, infrastructure works under the project slowed down but
continued to progress.

The restructuring did not change the overall scope of the project, and although the original plan
was to complete all works by August 2011, they were not completed until June 2013. This
prevented a more in-depth study and documentation of the long-term impacts and lessons learned,
particularly on experiences gained rural-to-urban land conversions.

Key factors subject to government control.

The Earthquake affected the subprojects in Mianyang and Yibin the most. In Mianyang, the
SEDZ and neighboring areas were used for temporary housing and to resettle a number of
affected people away from high-risk mountainous areas of Sichuan. In Yibin, a new master plan
was developed which prioritized the expansion and construction of a new administration center
in the south-western part of the city. Consequently, Route B ceased to be a priority and the
distance was reduced. As a result, the road did not actually address any specific transport
bottleneck, though it did contribute to improved accessibility to an area adjacent to the river and
significant riverbank beautification. According to the city, there has been a substantial increase
in land prices as the area has become more attractive to development and citizens, but there is no
data to back this up.

The changes in Master Plans were most significant in Mianyang, which was also most heavily
affected by the earthquake. The city changed the plans for Pioneer Park and the SEDZ with the
former focusing on high-tech, electronic industry development as well as development of a
commercial and residential area, whereas the SEDZ would focus on industrial development.

Throughout the project, significant attention was placed on ensuring the timely completion of
construction, but less emphasis was devoted to institutional development. The institutional
development component introduced a GIS/MIS as a major instrument for municipal institutional
development and capacity building. Furthermore, workshops were to be held linking SUDP cities
with other cities worldwide for information sharing. This global linkage was also meant to
induce foreign investment into the Economic Development Zones, but there is no evidence that
this training had significant impact. Moreover, while the project introduced both GIS/MIS
hardware and software in the four cities and training was provided, the actual impact of these
systems is not measurable.

Key factors subject to implementing agency control

Road design. The roads in Suining and Mianyang were designed to accommodate traffic flows
that were greater than the ones observed during field visits. Even if the roads will accommodate
higher traffic flows in the future, the operation and maintenance costs in the meantime will be
significantly larger than necessary. It would have been more efficient if the PIUs had secured the



                                                9
right-of-way for a larger road, but only built the road to standards based on the current or near
future projected traffic flows.

Lack of procurement experience. The Chinese construction sector is gradually transitioning
towards a more competitive and market oriented system, and cost estimates were often based on
national or state level guidelines. The project cities were not familiar with the Bank procurement
practices, and in a number of cases awarded contracts to the lowest bidder, which were not fully
qualified or did not have the necessary capacity and experience to undertake the works in a
timely manner.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design

Beyond the inconsistency in the PDOs in the PAD and the LA, the results framework lacked
clear and quantifiable key performance indicators. The reference in the key performance
indicator to “evidence” identifying bottlenecks hampering core urban functions have been
removed in participating municipalities is not quantifiable and therefore offered little in the way
of a useful tool for management to monitor project progress.

Tailoring the indicators to each city was appropriate given their differing situation, but many
tracked things not directly attributable to the project. This was the case with the output indicators,
especially for Mianyang and Suining, where attribution to the project was not straightforward.
Indicators pertaining to land, e.g. area of land sold each quarter, auction price of land, time lag
between lease attribution and land use/occupation, price per square meter sold, number of new
resident on site, etc. were subject to factors beyond control of the project, and should have been
refined to have a more direct correlation with the investments. While travel time provided is a
critical way to measure the impact of road construction, it can be influenced by many external
factors such as increase in car ownership and overall traffic, improvements in public
transportation systems and adjacent roads. Alternative indicators such as “percentage of People
Affected by the Project who are trained or re-employed” and “percentage of the population who
have access to sewerage services” would have provided more meaningful indications of the
results of the project.

Some of the intermediate indicators, such as “satisfaction of PAPs with resettlement process and
outcome” were measurable only at the end of the project, and therefore could not guide project
implementation. The project would have benefited from having clearer targets, disaggregated by
year, to allow for more accurate monitoring as well as to enable management to take corrective
action sooner.

Implementation and utilization

M&E focused on collecting data on the basis of the outlined indicators, and to this effect, the
system was implemented as designed. However, monitoring and evaluation were not strong tools
to support project management or decision making and it is unlikely that the project M&E
arrangements will prove sustainable after project closing. However, despite these difficulties, the

                                                 10
importance of the learning process that grew out of the development and evaluation of the
project has helped to demonstrate to the municipal governments the value of well-designed,
quantitative monitoring in decision-making and project management.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
The project triggered the Environmental Assessment (OP4.01) and the Involuntary Resettlement
(OP 4.12) safeguard policies, and the project was assigned a Category “A”. The project did not
affect any indigenous people and the Indigenous Peoples policy under OP 4.10.

Environmental Assessment. The project’s road and sewer investments were determined to have
adverse impacts during the construction and operation phase. Consequently, an Environmental
Assessment (EA) was carried out in each project city. The Environmental Monitoring Plans
(EMP) followed national procedures and standards and Bank safeguard policies. Two rounds of
public consultations on the EAs were held in each city, and the issues and concerns raised were
incorporated into the final EAs and EMPs. The EA was disclosed in English in November 11,
2005 and locally in Chinese in October 2005.

The PPMO hired an independent agency to conduct external environmental monitoring for the
works in all four cities. The agency monitored implementation of the works vis-à-vis the relevant
EMPs. The independent external monitoring agency confirmed that the infrastructure in all four
cities was completed with due consideration to ensuring that adverse environmental impacts
were properly mitigated. The infrastructure in Panzhihua and Yibin was judged to have a
positive environmental impact on wastewater discharge and improved environmental aesthetics
along the river embankments (see pictures in annex 12). As such, project performance with
respect to compliance with environmental safeguards is considered satisfactory. However, the
medium to long term aggregate environmental impact of promoting industrial development in
designated geographical locations, inter alia how companies dispose of waste and limit
hazardous emissions, was not part of the scope of the project.

Involuntary Resettlement. During preparation, it was determined that the project’s resettlement
requirements would affect enterprises, people and assets in all four cities. Each city carried out
extensive surveys on the impact of the project on project affected people (PAP) and their assets,
and detailed Resettlement Action Plans were prepared and disclosed in the Infoshop in English
and locally in Chinese in October 2005.

Due to its extensive resettlement, SUDP was included in the corporate risk list and was subject to
review by the Resettlement Committee, which endorsed the approach of the project in a meeting
in April 2006. With the exception of a few relatively isolated cases where the lack of agreement
on compensation caused implementation delays, there was no significant adverse impact on
PAPs. This was confirmed by surveys undertaken as part of the project, and the work of the
independent monitoring consultancy on resettlement. The surveys also confirmed overall high
levels of satisfaction on the part of the PAPs. Beyond their monetary compensation, resettled
individuals were entitled to unemployment insurance and job training. Moreover, the actual

                                               11
  impact of the project on land acquisition, house demolition, and relocated households was less
  than anticipated in the RAP. Surveys have confirmed that livelihood restoration was successfully
  achieved and related compensation paid to PAPs. (See annex 10 for further discussion on
  resettlement results). The table below summarizes land acquisition, housing demolition,
  enterprises and PAP impacts on the project, comparing RAP estimates to actuals.

  Each municipality developed independent RAPs for their own resettlement activities. While
  resettlement was also subject to delays, implementation of the RAP’s was complete by project
  closing. Resettlement, which received major attention in the design phase, does not appear to
  have been a significant challenge in the course of project implementation.

  One road in Suining was affected by a refusal of two household to vacate the land forcing a
  redesign and narrowing of the road, preventing completion of sidewalks, posing safety hazards
  and voiding their full use as per their original design. The implementing agency should have
  addressed the failure to come to agreement with the residents of the areas blocking road
  construction prior to construction moving ahead, or modified the design as a result of anticipated
  difficulties.

  On the basis of the measures implemented and results recorded in the final surveys, the project
  complied satisfactorily with the resettlement policies of the Bank.

  Financial Management. The project financial management system was continuously maintained
  by the PPMO and municipal PIUs from appraisal through closing. Project audit reports were
  submitted in a timely manner and auditors' opinions were all unqualified (clean). The internal
  control weaknesses detected by auditors were properly addressed by the implementing agencies.
  PPMO, as an experienced agency, provided the necessary training and guidance to municipal
  PIUs, and its strong capacity in project management and coordination attributed to sound
  financial management and efficient disbursements. The overall project financial management
  performance is satisfactory and the Bank’s fiduciary requirements were complied with.

  Procurement. The PPMO was experienced with Bank procurement guidelines and procedures
  and no substantial procurement issues were identified. The PPMO implemented the procurement
  plan as agreed, maintained smooth communication with the Bank on issues for attention and
  action, kept procurement files safe and complete and guided the PIUs on contract management.
  During project implementation, three procurement related complaints were received regarding
  three contracts. In one of the three cases, the Bank validated the complaint and the PPMO agreed


                                                          12
to re-bid. The overall procurement performance is satisfactory and the Bank’s procurement
requirements were complied with.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The four PIUs have continued to operate as integral parts of their respective municipalities, and
are expected to implement projects wholly financed with government resources. As their
fundamental institutional structure remained in place after closing, a seamless transition to post-
completion operation of the investments can be expected.

The infrastructure completed under the project is now operated and maintained by experienced
entities with adequately knowledgeable personnel, and are funded through budgetary allocations
from the municipal governments. All four project cities have furnished the Bank with an annual
O&M plan, including budget, for the infrastructure constructed under the project (as required in
paragraph 14, schedule 2 of the Project Agreement), and continued budget allocations for the
works are expected in the future. Nevertheless, during the ICR mission, some recently completed
infrastructure was in need of repair, which had also been identified by the task team as a
challenge in the course of implementation, emphasizing the importance of continually ensuring
adequate attention and resources to O&M.

Both construction investment companies in Miangyang were converted as part of the market-
oriented reform agenda of the government to facilitate private investments and manage the
economic development zones. In Panzhihua and Suining the companies are moving towards
developing comprehensive asset management systems, a concept currently in its infancy in both
cities. By the end of 2012, the Panzhihua Water Affairs Company was running a surplus as the
cost-recovery rate reached 115%, but it falls short of the targeted 130% set in the Project
Agreement.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives and design: High
China’s policy makers have intensified the focus on urbanization in recent years inter alia by
launching the New Urbanization Agenda to sustain economic growth by promoting urbanization,
which gives higher priority to developing small cities and towns, recognizing their role in linking
the cities and rural areas. China’s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) encouraged the permanent
settlement of rural migrants in medium and small cities and spending programs focused on
reducing the rural urban disparities in public service delivery. The 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-
2015) continued the emphasis of urbanization as a driver of economic growth.

The development trajectory of China in the years since appraisal of the project reinforces its
relevance in addressing relevant challenges for the country. Urbanization has assumed a key role
in the Bank’s continued engagement in China, and cuts across the pillars of the Country
Partnership Strategy FY13-16. In 2012, the Bank and Chinese authorities agreed to work on a
joint study (“Urban China: Towards Efficient, Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization”) to define

                                                13
a new model of urbanization, one that is more efficient, inclusive, and sustainable. It has been
recognized that to achieve this goal, significant reforms will be needed, among other in land
management, household registration and the provision of social services, all areas that were
critical aspects of SUDP.

With a PDO that aimed at facilitating rational urban development by removing identified
infrastructure problems to further land development, efficient transport movement and
environmental protection, the project addressed a critical challenge for China’s growing cities.
Ensuring that farmers received adequate compensation according to transparent criteria, an issue
that was paid significant attention in the design phase of the project, has become a critical aspect
of the country’s urbanization strategy. Promoting livability in the project cities through a range
of measures including improved environmental conditions, beautification of public spaces and
ensuring cleaner water, are also well aligned with the current and future priorities of the country.
The lessons of the project have therefore provided important input to the Bank’s continued
engagement on the urbanization process in China and to new projects in the country.

The relevance of the project was substantial. It was implemented in context of extraordinarily
challenging circumstances, and the Bank was highly responsive to the changing needs in the
aftermath of the earthquake and restructured the project. Nevertheless, important work on
monitoring urban-to-rural conversion activities and associated impacts on farmers was not
undertaken due to the challenging and demanding post-earthquake situation in the province. As a
result, an opportunity was missed to gain more detailed knowledge on this process for other
cities in China and elsewhere.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
As mentioned in Section 1.2 above, this report will use the LA version of the PDO to argue for
the achievement of the PDO because it is clearer and more closely related to the component
outputs. That formulation is: “to assist the borrower’s Sichuan Province in facilitating rational
urban development by removing identified infrastructure problems that impede land
development, efficient transport movement and environmental protection.”

Urban Infrastructure Investment Component

Mianyang

City Level Objective. The objective was to rationalize the city’s spatial development by
expanding two urban development areas (Pioneer Park, SEDZ) adjacent to its overcrowded city
core area, and to construct a connecting urban road, to provide new urban space and relieve
congestion.

Project investments. To develop land closer to the city center, the project funded the
construction of trunk and secondary infrastructure, including drainage and environmental
improvements, in Pioneer Park where the focus was on construction of local access roads and
associated bridges, sewers, and drainage, as well as landscaping activities, to expand the park

                                                14
area and a section of the Second Ring Road within Pioneer Park; and the Southern Economic
Development Zone (SEDZ) where the investment was aimed at supporting the construction of
local access roads, together with associated drainage infrastructure and landscaping.

Achievements. At closing, the following infrastructure had been completed in Pioneer Park: (i)
the construction of 22 sections of local access roads and associated sewers and drainage, as well
as landscaping activities with a length of 18.60 km of roads to expand the park area; and (ii) in
the Xinglong area: the construction of three sections of local access roads and associated sewers,
and 2 km drainage.

The construction of the roads in the Pioneer Park opened up new areas and enabled the
establishment of three service centers for development of science and technology. Community
hospitals and primary schools are now under construction as is an urban park and public
transportation hubs. Infrastructure in Pioneer Park contributed significantly to relieving its
congested core (see before and after photos in annex 12). The number of new residents on site at
65,020 reached twice the target of 30,440. High-tech enterprises have entered the Park, and the
tax revenue has increased significantly as shown in table 2. Incomes across Mianyang have
increased as outlined in annex 10.

In the Southern Economic Development Zone (SEDZ), the output was 10.85 km of local access
roads constructed, together with associated underground basic infrastructure and landscaping.
After completing the infrastructure in the SEDZ, it was assigned status of National Level
Economic Development Zone by the central government in October 2012. Since 2008, the SEDZ
has attracted foreign investment of RMB 365 million, and local investment reached RMB 25,785
million by 2012, with the annual fiscal revenue increasing accordingly. The area of land sold
only reached 192 ha per quarter compared to the targeted 312 ha, and the number of new
residents on site only reached 3,850 compared to the targeted 18,202.

People affected by land acquisition received multifaceted compensation, including living
expenses, social security and employment training. Relevant training provided by each zone
facilitated employment for the resettled residents.

Achievements in Mianyang are satisfactory, with the project largely meeting or exceeding its
targets, with the exception of lower than expected numbers of land sales in SEDZ and a shortfall
in attracting residents to SEDZ. This, however, is explained by the change in master plan and re-
zoning of specific areas following the earthquake. Nevertheless, all data related to the city needs
to consider the very substantial transfers of central government financing to the city in the
aftermath of the earthquake, which have skewed the impact of the project making attribution
difficult. Moreover, a range of measures was put into place to attract new investors as a means to
help the city recover, which further complicated the task of accurately assessing the causal
relation between outputs and outcomes for Mianyang.

Suining

City Level Objective: to support the city’s urban area development on its western side, by
developing a new urban area including a connecting urban road, to provide new urban space and
to relieve congested core areas.

Project Investments. The project sought to expand the city’s western part (Xining District some
1.5 to 4 km from the city center), and support an associated link road of 8.5 km from Xining
District to the Suining Railway Station in order to lower commuting distances and alleviate
traffic congestion on the trunk road network.

Achievements. At closing, the project had completed 13.2 km of access and distributor roads,
seven bridges, 3.5 km of river embankments, sewers, and landscaping in the Xining District Area.
The infrastructure provided a foundation for the further development of an area of 351 ha for
mixed residential, administrative and commercial use. With regards to the Xining Road, only
2.97 km were constructed from the Suining-Mianyang express highway to the Suining Railway
Station with the remainder cancelled following the earthquake, but completed using local funds.

The Xining EDZ went through significant changes in the course of implementation including a
new master plan. In 2006, it was 10.96 km2 of which 5 km2 had been developed. From 2007 to
2013, its area increased to 66.02 km2. In 2012, the Suining EDZ was designated as a National

                                                       16
Level Economic Development Zone (NLEDZ), the fourth NLEDZ in Sichuan Province
(NLEDZ’s receive a number of regulatory benefits and privileges aimed at reducing the cost of
investment and facilitating importing and exporting, they have greater autonomy and
administrative tasks can be completed more quickly and they generally benefit from more central
government support). Furthermore, Suining EDZ was designated as an Electronic Industry Zone
in Sichuan to attract these types of companies (from 2007 to 2011, a total of 147 new electronic
enterprises have established themselves in the Suining EDZ).

Results in Suining have been moderately unsatisfactory. With the cancellation of the Xining
road, it is not possible to ascertain the reduction in travel time, though there have been
improvements in the short stretch of the road that was completed with project financing. The
infrastructure improvements targeting the Suining Economic Development Zone have been
completed successfully, but the development of the economic development zone has still not
reached the anticipated results, and the roads suffer from overdesign. The number of new
residents on site reached 17,500, short of the project target of 19,380. Only 50% as much land as
expected had been sold on a quarterly basis, but this reflects in part the change of the master plan
as well as the reduction of the size of the residential areas to accommodate an expected increase
in enterprises. Moreover, in one area road construction was not completed as designed due to the
refusal of two households to accept the established cost norms for resettlement.

Yibin

City Level Objective: To improve the city’s strategic traffic function, relieve congestion in city
core areas, and to improve the landscape of the new administration area.

Project Investments. The project sought to construct two riverbank roads: Route A (US$40.44
million) and Route B (US$35.91 million) designed to improve access within the city and fund
works to enhance the degraded riverbank environment.

Achievement. Under the project, the city completed Route A, a 6.7 km (100% of appraised
distance) distributor road along the north bank of the Min Jiang and Chang Jiang rivers,
connecting the old city and existing urban areas with the Tianyuan District and the new Lingang
Economic Development Zone (LEDZ), which was established in 2009. LEDZ, which will
encompass 193 km2, will be an important gate from Sichuan to the rivers, oceans as well as hub
of southeast transportation in China, and was designated as a National Level Economic
Development Zone in January 2013. The project also completed 2.1 km of Route B (compared to
3.52km at appraisal), an extension of the existing riverbank wall, connecting with an 800 meter
walkway from the Cultural Square in the center of Nan An District. The construction of this road
has opened up an area of the riverbank, where the city is establishing a large beach and
recreational area.

The performance of the project in Yibin is satisfactory. Despite the increase in travel flow,
there has been a decrease in travel time exceeding the target set by the project. As a result of the
construction of route A, the travel time has been reduced from 10 minutes at appraisal to 6
minutes at project closing. The project connected key parts of the city with high quality transport
arteries and renovated riverbank areas to recreational areas for use its citizens. The road stretches
financed by the project have been constructed to a high standard and have removed key
bottlenecks of the city’s infrastructure as shown by the reduction in travel time.

Panzhihua

City Level Objective: To develop the city’s comprehensive and sustainable wastewater system,
and to improve strategic urban transport functions and the environment and landscape of the
riverbanks.

Project Investments. The project had four subcomponents designed to accommodate growth of
the city by improving access and traffic circulation (two urban roads), and upgrading the city’s
sewerage systems, riverbanks, and landscape conditions.

Achievements. The primary results include the completion of the following 4 sub-components:

The Bing-Ren Road. The project constructed a 6.7km (100% of appraisal estimate) stretch
linking the existing central business district and the expanding residential district of Renhe. It
links the recently completed Airport Access Road to Duren Road (West) in Renhe. The rear
section of the road has opened up a passage connecting Shizong District and Renhe District and
constitutes the first road to the new Huacheng District, which will house 250,000 people. The
road has also become the axis of the newly planned Ganbatang district, with a range of services,
inter alia a new hospital currently under construction. The planned targets for reduction in traffic
flow and travel time were all exceeded, and the roads had a significant impact in removing a
constraining infrastructure problem.

Bin Jiang Road. The completed road improvement work (2.54 km or 94% of appraisal) relieves
congestion in the downtown area and provides additional capacity for longer distance cross-town
traffic. The travel time led to an improvement of 85% compared with the targeted 20% at
appraisal.

Sewage pipelines: The project built 12.5 km sewer interceptors, which were connected to the
Qingxiangping Waste Water Treatment Plan (WWTP); 3.4 km sewer interceptors along the Bin-

                                                           18
Jiang Road, which were connected to the existing Bingcaogang WWTP; and 8.8km of sewer
pipelines that were connected to the Dadukou WWTP, which was financed under a JBIC loan
project. Based on the Borrower’s ICR, after many years of decreasing cost recovery rates, the
Panzhihua Water Affairs Company has reached a cost recovery rate of 1.15 in 2013, largely due
to the increase in the water tariffs, which now exceeds the operational costs.

River Embankment and Landscape Improvement. The project supported a series of
improvements along the Jinsha River including cleaning up debris, constructing an embankment
to prevent slope and soil erosion, and improving landscapes at two scenic spots, including
planting trees and bushes along the 15 km of river from Xinzhuang Bridge to Jinsha railway
station. These works contributed to the beautification of the river area where city residents
expressed a 100% satisfaction level with scenic improvements in the last survey (see photos in
annex 12).

 Note: Data based on the borrower’s ICR; Includes both “moderately satisfactory” and “satisfactory” ratings.

The performance of the project in Panzhihua is satisfactory. Activities have been
successfully implemented and assisted in alleviating Panzhihua’s urban development challenges.
Completion of the Bing-Ren road has significantly reduced the travel time from Renhe District to
the downtown or airport, and it is a major transport artery for the recent planned residential
living–area Ganbatang district. As an innovation under the project, solar LED lamps were
supplied along the Bing-Ren road, resulting in energy savings totaling at least RMB 230,000
yuan annually. Due to the positive results, the lamps are being installed across the entire city.

The project has met its target on the volume of wastewater to be treated, though it fell slightly
short of the target on the length of sewer constructed, in part because the landscape offered
extreme conditions (steepness) for construction. The data is not valid on the results of the
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) loading. The original indicator was setup on the basis of
BOD loading, but in the course of implementation it became apparent that the Panzhihua
Environment Protection Bureau was only in a position to provide data for COD loading
(Chemical Oxygen Demand), and the values between BOD and COD cannot be converted. The
cost recovery rate of the wastewater operation under the Panzhihua Water Affairs Company

                                                       19
(PWAC) has increased to 1.15 times the sum of its total operating expenses and the amount by
which its debt service requirements exceed the provision for depreciation by end of 2012, falling
short of the 1.30 times outlined in the project agreement.

The river embankment and landscape improvement investment along the Jinsha River have also
led to an improved environment with high satisfaction levels, and the city is actively promoting
itself as a tourist destination.

Institutional Development and Capacity Improvement Component

The four project cities had no prior experience with the World Bank and a comprehensive
package of technical assistance was put together to support the implementation of the project and
provide advisory and quality control services for the infrastructure components. It provided
assistance to the municipalities in reviewing project designs, preparing and evaluating bids,
negotiating contracts and monitoring contract execution. As part of this component, assistance
was also provided to monitor and implement the EMPs and RAPs.

The project undertook a range of training for the PPMO as well as the PIUs in the project
municipalities and the PIU’s recruited international consultants to help support project
management and construction supervision tasks. The project strengthened the capacity of the
project municipalities to use Geographical Information System and Management Information
Systems, supporting local efforts to increase the use of information technology in city planning.

In Panzhihua and Yibin, the following activities were undertaken: (a) Improvement of urban
infrastructure information platform, regulation of Data Collection and Management, and setup of
an Urban Master Plan Management System; (b) establishment of a model using GIS basic data
and geological disaster data; (c) information technology training and establishment of a technical
group for the database maintenance. In Mianyang and Suining an internet service platform and
GIS basic data platform were established and information technology training was undertaken
for. The PIU’s have used the GIS information and information technologies to manage
infrastructure and quality of public services, but evidence of how the systems have improved
overall efficiency, competitiveness and sustainability of city development is unclear.

All project cities cited a major benefit of the project to be strengthened project management
skills in areas of planning, procurement, and financial management.

3.3 Efficiency

Land

ERR analysis at appraisal: Economic analysis was conducted at appraisal for the Urban Area
Development components in Mianyang and Suining. The objectives of these components were to
provide new urban land for city development and to relieve congestion in core city areas whilst
providing infrastructure for city development and at the same time relieving congestion in core
city areas. An economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated based on the projected appreciation
of land value, net of all costs of development, including resettlement costs payable to the original
rural land owners. Recognizing the difficulties in estimating the market prices of rural land at the
fringes of cities, the value of salable land was estimated using a residual land pricing model5.
The ERR analysis used a 30-quarter timeframe starting from July 2006, and a number of
assumptions which turned out to be quite conservative: The assumed infrastructure costs and
resettlement costs were over-estimated, while the market prices of salable land were under-
estimated.

ERR analysis at ICR: For the purpose of the ICR, data on actual land sale transactions and
actual infrastructure and resettlement costs from 2006 to 2013 were collected. An updated ERR
was calculated using the same economic analysis model as the one at appraisal, with costs, land
sale revenues, implementation schedule, and inflation rates updated to reflect the actual
economic rate of return. All other minor assumptions made to the model use a prudent approach
so that the actual ERR at ICR is calculated on the conservative side6.The results are presented in
the following table:

Transport

ERR analysis: Economic analysis was conducted at appraisal for the urban transport
components in all project cities (sub-section of the Second Ring Road in Mianyang; Xining Road
in Suining; Bing-Ren Road and Bin Jiang Road in Panzhihua; and Route A in Yibin). The ERRs
of the roads were calculated based on time and vehicle operating cost savings. All roads
generated adequate ERRs. At project completion, ERRs were also calculated based on the same
assumptions used at project appraisal. The following listed all ERRs of these roads, not only
calculated at project appraisal but also at project completion.

                                                 ERR (%)
                                     At Appraisal           At ICR
 Mianyang: Second Ring Road             14.5%              Cancelled
 Suining: Xining Road                   13.8%               16.2%
 Panzhihua: Bing-Ren Road               13.8%               23.2%
 Panzhihua: Bin Jiang Road              18.4%               24.9%
 Yibin: Rout A Road                     15.5%               11.2%

On the basis of the analysis, the project generated satisfactory ERR.

Sewerage, Embankment and Landscape Improvement

Due to the difficulties in quantifying the benefits of the sewerage, embankment and landscape
improvement in Panzhihua and Yibin, ERRs were not computed, but cost-effectiveness analysis
was carried out at project appraisal. At project completion, the cost-effectiveness was only
conducted for sewerage component.

Since the planned sewers were completed with lower cost, the objective of this sewerage
component to develop comprehensive wastewater collection systems was achieved, though with
some delays in completing contracts for sewers construction.

Financial Analysis

Sewerage Component in Panzhihua. At project appraisal, financial projection was conducted to
predict the wastewater tariff which could make the wastewater systems full cost recovery. The
financial information for 2011 and 2012 shows that the Panzhihua wastewater company is
running a profit.

Assessment of project efficiency: Based on the above economic analysis, the efficiency of the
project is considered substantial.




                                                22
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The overall rating is considered moderately satisfactory. The project had significant
achievements, completing the vast majority of all planned infrastructure within the timeframe
despite extraordinary disruption caused by natural disasters. The available data and completion
of infrastructure indicate that a satisfactory number of the project targets and objectives will
ultimately be achieved, despite the delays.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project was not designed to specifically track impact on the poor or to take into account
gender aspects. However, the key outcome indicator in the PAD was articulated around ensuring
a high level of satisfaction among users of the project investments and among PAPs. Their levels
of satisfaction have consistently registered highly in project monitoring. Overall, people in all
project cities have benefitted from the environmental and transportation improvements brought
about by enlarging the urban areas and improving living conditions. The PAPs were
predominantly farmers with rural registration, and were worse off than their urban registered
peers before the project. It is therefore highly probable that the project disproportionately
benefited the poor, whose incomes increased as a result of their resettlement (see resettlement
annex 10). As part of the resettlement, the farmers were entitled to construct multi-story houses,
and many rent out rooms or operate businesses with the excess space. Farmers were also offered
training to strengthen their skills in new areas.

The conversion to the urban hukou registration ensured equity with their former neighbors,
bringing benefits such as easier and faster access to schools, hospitals, and other social services.
The hukou household registration system in China has led to inequity between urban populations
and farmers, with the former having access to a wider range of services. In the project cities, this
inequity was becoming pronounced as the growth of the cities meant that populations registered
as rural residents were de facto living within city areas but not enjoying the associated benefits.
The project contributed to addressing this inequity for the 3,262 households that were relocated.
Residents have remarked that access to services has improved markedly and household incomes
have risen in all four cities as outlined in annex 10.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional strengthening under the project built on the capacity already put in place by SUEP.
The placement of the project under the overall leadership of the Sichuan Construction
Commission headed by a Vice-Governor ensured proximity to provincial authorities and thereby
a channel through which noteworthy results of the project might be recognized and replicated in
other parts of the province. The anchoring of the provincial management in a provincial PIU
which is also responsible for implementing government financed investments, ensures that the
lessons learned and the capacity strengthened at central level will be sustained after project
closure.



                                                23
All four city PIUs cited strengthened capacity in planning, procurement (contract bidding, award
and supervision), project management and financial management as key outcomes of the project,
as well as an improved awareness of O&M requirements of newly constructed infrastructure.
Moreover, the PIUs emphasized that as a result of the project, they now choose investments
based on economic and financial considerations to a greater extent than previously, and have
improved their capacity to evaluate the merits of individual investments. The introduction of
GIS/MIS has similarly improved their overall capacity to prioritize, monitor and evaluate
investments and improve public service delivery though measuring this impact has not been
possible.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

In Panzhihua, the construction of the Bing-Ren road opened up a transport corridor to an entirely
new district planned to house 250,000 people. Innovations from the project further had spill-over
benefits. An example of this includes the introduction of solar panel street lighting, which was
piloted under the project in Panzhihua, and has now been replicated in major areas of that city.
The embankment and landscape improvement works were key components in the efforts to
promote city as a tourist destination for people in Sichuan province and beyond.

In Yibin, the construction of Route B and the linear park along the river improved the access to
the river, as a result the city decided to create an artificial beach along the river bank, which is
expected to be a major draw for its citizens.

N/A.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

A key premise of the project was the selection of cities anticipated to see population growth, but
according to census data, the total population in Suining has actually shrunk 4% in the past
decade, and the urban population in Panzhihua has decreased by 1%, whereas Sichuan province
as a whole over the same period has seen outward migration to other parts of China. 8 Larger
cities across the country have greater appeal for many migrant workers than second-tier cities.
This development should have been anticipated at the time of design and explicitly addressed. It

8
  Population data in China’s cities is unreliable, with differences in provincial and municipal reporting. Migrants are at time s not
taken into account in local figures except in some cases where the Public Security Bureau reports on migrants who have, as
required by law, registered with the PSB, which many migrants do not do. The National Bureau of Statistics recognized these
problems and, in 2000, instituted measures to enumerate all persons (including migrants resident for longer than 6 months) at
their actual place of residence in the national census. The 2000 census is widely believed to be the most reliable reporting of
population in China. The same measures were followed in the 2010 census so data are fully comparable with 2000. The figures
used at appraisal were based on locally obtained figures and may therefore be unreliable.




                                                                24
calls into question whether the selection of the cities was appropriate, although it is an important
motivation for these cities to improve their services to make themselves more attractive
destinations for migrants. Careful study of migration patterns also will offer critical insight for
future initiatives that have similar objectives as SUDP, and failure to attract labor raises
questions about the ability of cities to reach their growth projections.

The considerable investments in new road infrastructure will result in higher operation and
maintenance (O&M) cost for the project cities. To address this challenge, the project helped
build the capacity of project cities to develop well financed O&M plans. A covenant in the legal
agreements required the cities to furnish the Bank an annual plan and budget for O&M. However,
in the absence of sustained effort towards asset management and the over-design of some of the
public infrastructure, the allocation of sufficient resources for O&M will likely remain a
challenge and mostly based on yearly assessments of wear and tear. This will be a particular
challenge if the projected economic growth patterns are not reached and at times of greater fiscal
pressure and lead to infrastructure falling into disrepair due to the lack of resources.

Sichuan is vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. Project infrastructure
was designed based on national level earthquake standards and should withstand major disaster,
although flooding and landslides could still inflict considerable damage in high risk areas.
Another issue that might affect the outcomes of the project are the long-term cumulative
environmental impacts of industrial development in the EDZs. The EIA did not consider these
impacts and the cities give limited attention to the cumulative environmental impacts of their
development plans.

The Wenchuan Earthquake posed a significant threat to the project, but sustained efforts by the
PMO and PIUs enabled completion of most infrastructure investments before its closing date.
However, the delays ruled out the ability to conduct a more detailed post-completion assessment
on the long-term outcomes of the project on land development and resettlement, and providing
insight into the sustainability of the project and draw lessons for other similar projects.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Given the complexity of the project and the potential reputational risk related to the large scale
land acquisition and resettlement activities, the Bank team involved a wide range of experts with
different backgrounds, including: urban planners, economists, social scientists, engineers and
lawyers. The team prepared background reports in areas of urban planning, economic and
financial analysis and the legal complications of resettlement, improving the design of the project.
The design of the project was also complex, however, seeking to address a range of issues at the



                                                25
same time, and the capacity of the client to undertake all of these simultaneously as
overestimated.

During preparation, there was significant internal discussion about the merits and risks
associated with the project’s land conversion and resettlement. The team sought guidance from
the Bank’s Resettlement Committee, particularly on compliance of related RAPs with the Bank
policy, OP 4.12. The Resettlement Committee endorsed the approach for addressing resettlement,
noting that the policy did not anticipate interventions of this nature, though it represented an
increasingly common challenge in Bank financed projects in China and elsewhere. The
preparation and background analysis were solid, and an extended period of time was included
after the completion of infrastructure to assess the impacts and outcomes of the project.

Substantial attention was paid to the differences between Government of China and the World
Bank procurement practices. Instead of relying on using standard prices by the Provincial
Government, the Bank team worked intensively with the PPMO and local consultants during
appraisal to verify the cost estimates and revise cost estimates based on market prices. Extensive
efforts went into reviewing procurement packages to improve cost-effectiveness and technical
soundness.

A major weakness of the project was the design of the PDO (which also was not consistent
between the PAD and LA, and outcome indicators. The results framework, in particular,
included too many indicators (68 in total), many of which were not solely attributable to the
project. As a result, it was difficult to comprehensively assess the actual outcomes of the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

During the 7 years of project implementation, the Bank only undertook 6 full supervision
missions. The Bank management and the Chinese Government made a conscious decision to
prioritize the preparation and implementation of the Wenchuan Earthquake Recovery Project
(WERP), and decided not to overburden the same PPMO with too many visits. Moreover, given
the team’s frequent WERP missions to the PPMO in Chengdu, there were more regular
exchanges on the SUDP than indicated by the number of full supervision missions.

As a result of the impacts of the Earthquakes in project cities, the Bank, Provincial Government
and four municipalities worked closely together to restructure the project and ensure that it
supported the cities overcome the disaster. The counterpart financing requirements were eased
and adjustments were made, in particular in Mianyang. The Bank team and the PPMO invested
considerable efforts to help cities to move with the implementation. During the mid-term review,
the team discussed changes to the PDO, but the client felt there was strong ownership in the
various cities of the PDO and did not wish to change it. The team, however, should have made
the PDO consistent in the LA and PAD, and the results framework should have been overhauled.

Supervision missions typically included procurement, financial management and safeguards
specialists, and aide memoires demonstrate a consistent focus both on ensuring that resettlement

                                                26
was undertaken appropriately and that construction was progressing in accordance with signed
contracts including the EMPs.

The comprehensive AAA tracer study to monitor rural to urban conversion was never undertaken,
nor did the issue receive substantive attention in any of the supervision missions conducted by
the Bank. This resulted in a missed opportunity to focus on some of the project’s more
innovative aspects related to land value and the potential benefits for the rural population whose
land is converted for urban use. However, the independent resettlement monitoring agency
closely monitored adherence to resettlement guidelines to ensure that compensation was carried
out effectively during project implementation. Affected population received either new urban
housing with transferable title or compensation to build own dwellings in new settlements. The
affected households received monthly payments for loss of income from agricultural production,
which were adjusted annually. To improve the livelihood conditions and provide better job
opportunities for resettled people, skills and job training was conducted in connection with job
opportunity programs. At the end of the project, data points to incomes being higher than before.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance was moderately satisfactory. It exhibited sufficient flexibility to the
changing realities and involved a wide range of experts. Nevertheless, the implementation of the
project suffered due to an overly complex design that was not sufficiently focused, evidenced
through two separate PDOs and a results framework that made the progress of the project
difficult to measure. The project has achieved the vast majority of the planned outputs following
Bank procedures, but due to the lacking post-completion analysis of the broader impact, the
long-term impacts are not evident at this stage.

5.2 Borrower Performance


(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Notwithstanding the disruption caused by the Wenchuan Earthquake, the commitment of the
provincial government to the project was strong, witnessed most strikingly by the ability to
ensure the completion of all infrastructure activities without requesting an extension of the
closing date. During the preparation of the project, the borrower conducted extensive
consultations with PAP’s and prepared a RAP of a good quality. The municipal PMOs
consistently quote strong and supportive oversight by the PPMO.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory



                                               27
Based on the experience with SUEP, the PPMO engaged a joint venture between an international
and a domestic consultancy company to provide support to the PPMO and PIUs with project
management and supervision. This arrangement, which is not common in China, helped ensure
improve the quality of construction supervision and transfer international knowledge and best
practices to local consulting firms as well as project cities. The municipal PIUs had designated
the necessary resources to execute the subprojects providing adequate support for the
infrastructure investments. Most of the construction sites required strong coordination for land
acquisition and resettlement, and municipal PIU’s provided satisfactory support to this effect.

In Mianyang, the heads of the local PMOs were the directors of the Pioneer Park and SEDZ, who
provided great support to move the project towards successful completion, even though
Mianyang was heavily affected by the Wenchuan Earthquake and the municipal government had
to shift their efforts and resources to the reconstruction and recovery of the city.

In Suining, the local PMO was established in the Suining Economic Development Zone
Administration under the local DRC. The municipal PMO adequate support and guidance to the
implementation and completion of project activities even though changes were made to the
Zone’s Master Plan and some of roads were completed using domestic funding.

In Yibin, the vice secretary-general of Yibin City Government was the head of the municipal
PMO. The municipal PMO provided great supports during the implementation of the sub-
component, especially to secure counterpart funding for land acquisition, resettlement and civil
works.

In Panzhihua, the municipal PMO was established in the City Urban Planning and Construction
Bureau. The PMO was very engaged in the supervision of the project, especially in optimizing of
the designs and managing land acquisition and resettlement. The strong leadership and guidance
contributed to the successful completion of this sub-component, which included complex civil
works.

The performance of the PMO and PIUs has to consider the enormously disruptive nature of the
Wenchuan Earthquake, which justifiably distracted attention and resources from the supervision
of SUDP. Despite the severe impact of the natural disaster notwithstanding, the project cities
showed strong ownership throughout its implementation period, and the local teams were able to
overcome the challenges it faced and ensure investments were completed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the borrower was satisfactory, especially taking into account the challenges
it faced during implementation and efforts made to address and overcome them.




                                              28
6. Lessons Learned

One of the lessons from the borrower’s ICR focuses on the need to be candid about the
capacity of the client and ability to implement projects with due regard to the full range of
Bank requirements. The project introduced a number of new management measures, with
special attention provided to the social safeguard policies. The complexity of the project required
the involvement of a wide range of experts in urban development, infrastructure and transport
planning, land valuation and development, resettlement and economic zone development, and
placed considerable demands on the capacity of the client. The demands were amplified by the
Wenchuan Earthquake, and the strong focus on completion of the physical infrastructure at the
expense of some of the other objectives of the project. In infrastructure focused lending
operations, the defined project objectives should adequately reflect the underlying investments
and avoid setting too ambitious an agenda.

The design of a clear and measurable Results Framework is critical. Defining a clear,
strategically focused and measurable PDO is key to measure the results of the project and to
guide its implementation. The absence of a high quality results framework complicates the
measuring of project outcomes. The Bank continues to improve in new operations as teams
become increasingly familiar with the tool and learn from the past, but it is an area that should
receive considerable attention throughout the project cycle. Additional training for Bank staff as
well as the client should be considered.

Increased attention should be given to safeguard issues and the risks they pose on the
timely completion of infrastructure investments. Engineering designs should allow for more
flexibility to reduce resettlement impacts. In some cases, like Suining, the lack of consultation
and ability to reach an agreement with a couple of affected households should have triggered
some modifications in the road design, as suggested by the Bank team.

The project also highlighted the importance of considering a strategic environmental
assessment (SEA) for these type of projects. The EIA and EMP focused narrowly on
construction related impacts and did not consider overall and cumulative impacts of attracting
industries and foster economic development in economic zones. Future projects should build the
capacity of local authorities to assess and manage the cumulative environmental impacts and
risks of concentrating industrial and economic development in specific zones.

The challenges associated with O&M were anticipated during project design and included in a
covenant; however the project should have provided greater support to cities on capital
investment planning and asset management. Strengthening of capacity for O&M planning and
budgeting should become an integral part of future infrastructure investments and urban
development projects. It is inadequate to require the submission of O&M plans and budgets on a
regular basis, as training in ensuring strong systems is also required. Moreover, Bank teams
should pay special attention to the life-cycle costs of infrastructure and help cities make more
cost-effective decisions based on actual demand, capacity and availability of resources.

The development of EDZ has to be accompanied by significant technical assistance and
capacity building to understand the local competitiveness and design effective policies and

                                                29
incentives to attract private investments. The project was narrowly focused on infrastructure
investments, but it should have included more support to the project cities in developing
strategies to attract investments and industries, and share best practices from around the world.
Inter alia, this should also be addressed by the Bank ensuring that he has the requisite expertise
on its task team during design and implementation of the project. The private sector was also not
consulted during project preparation, missing an important opportunity to understand the needs
and demands of enterprises that were targeted by the EDZs.

Project designs should consider the risk of changes to city and regional master plans. With
multi-year investments, there is significant risk that plans change, impacting planned investments
and the expected project outcomes. Project design needs to be cognizant of the risk of changes to
master plans, and incorporate provisions for flexibility accordingly.

Attention to disaster risk management and climate risks must be given due regard in
infrastructure projects. Sichuan Province is located in a seismic active area, and is regularly
affected by floods, but the risks of natural disaster were never considered in the project design or
included in the project ORAF. While earthquakes cannot be predicted, the associated risks
should have been considered in the design of project and its infrastructure investments.

                              Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Land Development in Mianyang and Suining

Economic analysis: At appraisal, economic analysis was conducted using a 30-quarter timeframe
starting from July 2006. Since market price for under-developed rural land at the fringes of cities
in China is not available as the transactions do not take place within a free market, the model
used the market price for floor space and the price of construction to derive the residual value of
land, net of all cost of development and buildings on it, including resettlement costs. Three ERRs
were calculated: two major urban development areas (Southern Economic Development Zone
and Pioneer Park) adjacent to the city center in Mianyang; and the Xining District Area in
Suining, adjacent to the old downtown area. The estimated ERR of these three urban area
development components in a 30-quarter timeframe (7.5 years) were 7.2 percent, 7.4 percent,
and 7.4 percent, respectively.

At ICR the actual ERRs as of 2013 are higher (103 percent, 82 percent, 138 percent respectively)
than the original estimates – this is mainly due to very conservative assumptions of key
parameters used at appraisal. A comparison of key parameters is shown as follows using
Mianyang SEDZ as an example:

Table 3.1 Comparison of Key Parameters in ERR Calculation for Mianyang SEDZ
                                           Estimated value             Actual value           As a % of the
                                             at appraisal                at ICR                estimated
 Total construction costs (RMB)               449,216,393              145,245,466                 32%
 Total resettlement costs (RMB)               284,737,969              129,579,400                46%10
 Sale of developed land (RMB)                 957,572,200             5,404,542,326                564%


When calculating the actual ERR at ICR, other than updating the costs, revenues,
implementation schedule, and inflation rates to reflect actual value, no major changes are made
to the economic analysis model. Some prudent assumptions are adopted, and the actual ERR is
calculated on the conservative side:
     All unsold salable land as of 2013 is assumed to have zero value as it is hard to predict
        when and at what price these lands will be sold
     The model assumes the starting quarter of the calculation is July 2006 both at appraisal
        and at ICR. All land sales prior to this quarter were excluded from the calculations as the
        infrastructure and resettlement had not started and the gain in land value was not directly
        from the work of urban area development components.
     All resettlement costs were paid in full at the start of the project, so that land sales can
        start as early as October 2006.



10
  From ICR Resettlement Component, part of the reasons that this figure differs a lot from the projected value were some
changes in local economic growth patterns as well as the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake.


                                                          36
Based on the above economic analysis, the project efficiency with regards to land can be
considered as substantial.

Urban Area Development Components in Mianyang and Suining

Objective of the Components. The objective of the urban transport network improvement
components was to allow the four project cities to: (a) improve cities’ strategic traffic function;
(b) reduce congestion and traffic in core and downtown areas; (c) reduce travel time and vehicle
operating costs; and (d) improve reliability of public transport services. During implementation,
this objective remained unchanged. However, due to the limitation of additional counterpart
funding, increased marketing price on construction materials, as well as adjustment of
city/regional master plans during the implementation, the project scopes were changed in some
areas. Since a number of these works were dropped from the project and completed using
domestic funds, the benefits were not measured as part of this project.

Methodology. The urban transport components were evaluated at project appraisal based on time
and vehicle operating cost savings calculated relative to the “do-nothing” scenario. The travel
demand was forecasted by using standard four-step transport models. The economic analysis at
project appraisal used Net Present Value (NPV) methods and all estimated costs and benefits
reflected 2005 prices.

At project completion, the economic re-evaluation also used NPV methods, but the investment
costs are actual costs and the operating cost and benefits estimated at project appraisal were
scaled up to 2013 by national inflation rates, assuming that the estimation made at project
appraisal reflected real situation.

Benefits. At project appraisal, there were four incremental benefits of the planned strategic roads
in the four cities. Due to the lack of appropriate data, only savings in passenger travel time and
vehicle operating cost were taken into account. The other two are savings in accident-related
costs and savings in environmental costs (noise and air pollution).

To compare with the results of economic analysis at project appraisal, the same benefits of
project strategic roads were calculated at project completion.

At project appraisal, forty percent of the average hourly wage was assumed as the value of time.
This was calculated for each city as the GDP per capita divided by the number of yearly working
hours. Average vehicle operating costs per kilometer traveled were estimated for different
vehicle categories (e.g., small passenger cars, light goods vehicles, heavy goods vehicles, etc.).

At project appraisal, the estimation of the travel time saved and vehicle-kilometers (traffic
performance for the scenarios with and without the proposed road components. For each forecast
year (e.g., 2009, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029), the differences between scenarios with and
without the new roads in total travel time spent, and total travel distances, were calculated. Each
vehicle category's share of total vehicle-kilometers saved was then calculated, and multiplied by
the respective average vehicle operating cost, which resulted in vehicle operating costs saved for
each category. The savings in passenger travel times were calculated accordingly, taking into

                                                37
account average vehicle occupancy for each vehicle category and using the values of time
estimated above. All these assumptions at project appraisal were followed when the economic
reevaluation on urban transport components was carried out.

NPV and ERR. The outcomes of economic analysis made at project and reevaluation carried out
at project completion are summarized as follows.

Following the Wenchuan Earthquake, adjustments were made to the Pioneer Park component in
Mianyang. Construction of the interchange bridge and the second ring road, which were
originally setup in contracts MK1 and MK2 in PP, were financed by domestic funds from
Mianyang City commencing in 2010.

Construction of the section of the Second Ring Road from the interchange with Yingbin Avenue
to the boundary of Pioneer Park (Part A.1 (b) in Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement) was
cancelled from the project, as these were financed through domestic funds. As a result, , the NPV
of 2RR was not calculated at project completion. Only 2.97 km Xingning Road from Suining-
Mianyang express highway to Suining Railway Station area has been built, and the rest of
originally proposed Xining road from Xining District area to Sui-Mian Express Highway has
been combined with Suining outer ring-road and constructed using local funds.

Wastewater Component

Wastewater Component was implemented in Panzhihua as planned. The objective of this
component, i.e. development of comprehensive wastewater collection systems in three
catchments areas, was achieved.

Since the benefits of this component are difficult to quantify, no EIRR was calculated at project
appraisal. Least-cost analysis was undertaken. The timing of construction, location, and
capacity of WWTPs which were planned to build in the areas that would not require pumping
station construction and use gravity for sewage flow in order to economize both investment and
operation costs determined the construction of the wastewater collection systems.

At project appraisal, three contracts were proposed to build sewers. The total contract value
estimated was about RMB58.99 million. Due to the optimization of wastewater plan during the
implementation of the project, only RMB51.42 million was spent on achieving the objective of
this component. However, one contract was completed with 4.5-year delay and one contract was
finished about 6 months behind the schedule. These delays should have negative impact on the
value of achieving component objective.

A financial projection of wastewater system in Panzhihua was carried out at project appraisal.
The results of this projection showed that Panzhihua had to increase its wastewater tariff in 2007
in order to achieve full cost recovery. The wastewater tariff in Panzhihua at project appraisal,
the projected tariff in 2009, and current tariff at ICR are presented in the following table:

Table 3.6. Summary of Wastewater Tariff in Panzhihua (RMB per m3)
                      At Appraisal    Projected for 2009       At ICR
 Domestic                 0.30               0.80                0.55
 Industrial               0.40               0.90                0.90
 Commercial                                                      0.90
 Special                                                         1.35

Although the current wastewater tariff in Panzhihua for domestic users is lower than the
projected one, the financial situation of the wastewater system in Panzhihua is encouraging. In
both 2011 and 2012, the wastewater system in Panzhihua was running profitably. The following
table demonstrates the financial income and expenditure of Panzhihua wastewater system.

1. Assessment of Development Objective, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Development Objectives

Original Objective. Full details of objectives have been provided in the Project Appraisal
Document（Report No: 34134 – CN） of August 11, 2006 – Section B, Project Description, and
Annex 4: Project Description. The same objectives are cited in the Loan Agreement Number
4838 CHA and the Project Agreement, which were signed on October 27, 2006. The specific
project development objective (PDO) is to improve core urban functions in an equitable and
resource efficient manner by removing identified infrastructure bottlenecks hampering land
development, transport, and environmental conditions in four second-tier cities in Sichuan
Province.

Revised Objective. There has been no change in the main Project objectives during
implementation.

Project Components

Component 1: Urban Infrastructure Investment. This component supports spatial planning
priorities in four cities of Mianyang, Suining, Yibin and Panzhihua.
    a) Mianyang: The proposed project funds the construction of trunk and secondary
         infrastructure, including drainage and environmental improvements, in two new major
         urban development areas adjacent to Mianyang city;
    b) Suining: The project subcomponents in Suining are secondary infrastructure, sewerage
         and roads in the newly developed Xining District Area to the west of the city, including
         an associated link road to the city railway station area.
    c) Yibin: The project subcomponent funds two-riverbank roads designed to improve
         accessibility within the city and to enhance the degraded riverbank environment;
    d) Panzhihua: The project subcomponent supports four infrastructural projects to
         accommodate the growth of the city, i.e., (a) Bing-Ren Road; (b) Bin Jiang Road; (c)
         Sewerage; and (d) River Embankment and Landscape Improvement.

Component 2: Institutional Development and Capacity Building. The Institutional
Development and Capacity Building Component (IDCB) consisted of:
   4. TA for Institutional Development and Capacity Building for the project municipalities,
      including the management information system (MIS) and geographical information
      system (GIS) to be used as major instruments for municipal institutional development and
      capacity building and
   5. TA for Project Implementation and Management, including project management and
      construction supervisions, EMP/RAP implementation monitoring.




                                               45
Changes in SUDP

There has been no change in the project components. However, there were several changes in
scopes of some of the components during implementation. The changes were proposed and
approved through the SUDP Mid-Term Review. There were also other changes in the design of
some of the project components in order to optimize the project outputs without change in
Project objectives. The major changes are described below.

Amendment to Loan Agreement

The Wenchuan Earthquake on May 12, 2008 and the subsequent Panzhihua Earthquake on
August 30, 2008 have affected Mianyang, Suining and Panzhihua components in SUDP. The
Loan Agreement was amended accordingly on December 9, 2008 and has become effective on
December 18, 2008, and the amendment states that the percentage of expenditure for the works
(Category 1) by the loan in Mianyang, Suining and Panzhihua under SUDP has been changed
from 70% to 100%.

After the May 12 Wenchuan Earthquake, Mianyang decided to make the restructure on this
project sub-component. The remaining World bank fund for Mianyang sub-component totaling
USD 11.80 million, which was mainly due to the contract cancellations as the master plan
changed after the earthquake as well as the “living room” project as funded by the government.
The remaining fund had been reallocated to the infrastructure investments in the Xinlong area-a
new development area within Pioneer Park. The Loan Agreement was amended on August 18,
2011.

Changes in Project Scope

Due to the limitation of additional counterpart funding, increased marketing price on
construction materials as well as adjustment of city/regional master plans during the
implementation, some of the project scope was changed.

The works on the section of Route B road in Yibin have been shortened from 3.5 Km to 2.5Km
due to the decreased amount of the loan in RMB equivalent as a result of US dollar devaluation,
and Yibin will use its own fund to complete the remaining work in Route B.

Due to the improvement of Panzhihua Sewerage Plan, approximately 24.2Km interceptor sewers
were built under SUDP, and most of branch sewers were fully financed by local funding, which
were constructed simultaneously with the regional development.

Suining Economic Development Zone restructured the Suining sub-component due to the
regional master plan changed. Section B of Xining road and No. 7 road in Xining area had been
covered in the municipal road network (Xining road) and Suining Jinjia Wuliu (Logistics) Park,
which were re-planned and were built by its own local fund; Roads No. 5, 16, 17, 19 and 20 in
Xining area were re-planed by Suining Economic Development Zone for Chuanzhong Mining
District, which were built through local funding only.



                                              46
Because the entrance of Sui-Zi-Mei Express Highway to Suining is located at the 10# road in
Xining Area as well as the road 10# will connect to the outside ring road of Suining, the area
being originally setup in Suining has been re-planned, and the cancelation of construction of
roads 3# Section B, 11#, 12# and 21# from SUDP Suining Sub-component had been made.

Institutional Development and Capacity Improvement Component

No change was made in the TA services, however, the schedule of TA services had been
extended because the implementation of SUDP was progressed slower than the original schedule
even though it did not affect the closing date of the loan.

Quality at Entry

Project preparation at appraisal can be evaluated as satisfactory when compared with SUDP
actual outcome. The overall project design (as stated in PAD as well as Loan Agreement) proved
to be in line with the government and WB development strategy in China and it is in line with
the plans of enlarging urban area to reduce the high pressure of the transportation and population
density in city center. The scope of the project and the primary project design proved to be
appropriate. The feasibility studies and engineering design for each project component (as well
as for the overall project) proved to be generally appropriate. Most of the technical designs
employed the advanced and yet commercially available technologies.

2.     Achievement of Objective and Outputs

Outcome / Achievement of Objective

Sichuan Urban Development Project (SUDP) has supported an important element of Sichuan’s
growth strategy, which is to accelerate infrastructure investment in strategic “second tier cities”
and to attract international and national investments to stimulate development and growth.
Sichuan’s second-tier cities, like other secondary cities in China, must adapt to new sources of
growth and changing industrial structures. Labor- and land-intensive industries are leaving city
centers for suburban locations, and being replaced by high technology industries and
information-based service industries.

Four “second-tier” cities are targeted for Bank assistance under SUDP: Mianyang, Suining,
Yibin and Panzhihua. These cities are among the fastest growing urban centers in Sichuan
province, and have considerable growth potential. At SUDP completion, the achievement and
outcome are gradually and obviously revealed.

After the infrastructure in the Pioneer Park has been established under SUDP, the centers in the
Pioneer Park has occupied 17.66 ha, and the total investment will be RMB1500 million and total
architecture area will be approximately 340,000 m2. At present, some of enterprises with high-
tech technology have entered into the Park, and the estimated gross output value will be over
RMB 20,000 million, and increased industrial output value will be over RMB 5,000 million in
the upcoming five years.



                                                47
By completing SUDP Mianyang SEDZ component, the Mianyang SEDZ has become the
National Level of Economic Development Zone since October 2012. After the land development,
the Total foreign investment has been RMB 365 million since 2008, and local investment has
been RMB 25,785 million from 2008 through 2012. The annual fiscal revenue in Mianyang
SEDZ has been increased rapidly.

Significant changes have been made after the implementation of SUDP Suining Component.
From 2007 to now, the area of Suining EDZ has been increased from 10.96Km2 to 66.02Km2, in
which the 10.93Km2 has been developed. Suining EDZ has been designated as national level on
the Economic Development Zones in China since June 2012, which is the fourth national level
EDZ in Sichuan Province. Suining EDZ has been created as Electronic Industry Zone in Sichuan.
There were more than 150 electronic enterprises entered into Suining EDZ by end of 2013.

Along with the implementation of SUDP Yibin Component, Yibin Lingang Economic
Development Zone (LEDZ) was setup in 2009 and developed rapidly since then. The route A
road under SUDP is an important access to LEDZ. By completing SUDP Yibin Component, the
congestion, poor overall mobility, and inefficient urban transportation systems along the Yangtze
River have been obviously changed.

By completing the SUDP Panzhihua Component, Panzhihua urban area has been developed
significantly: (1) Bingren road completed has reduced the traffic communication time for at least
30 min from Renhe District to the downtown or airport. The Bingren road has become the truck
road along the recent planned Ganbatang district area as the high-level residential living area; (2)
the completed Bin-Jiang road relieves congestion in the downtown area and provides additional
capacity for longer distance cross-town traffic. The travel time in the area have been reduced at
least 20 min.; (3) the wastewater treatment efficiency in Panzhihua has been increased from 45%
to 86%; and (4) after improvement of the river embankment and landscape, the circumstance and
living standards along the Jinsha river have been promoted significantly and satisfied to the
residents living in the area.

Panzhihua (US$ 126.78 million PAD; US$ 116.56 million; December 2012). The component
had been satisfactorily implemented between 2007 and 2012. The component includes: (a) Bing-
Ren Road, the road serves a link between the existing central business district (CBD) and the
expanding residential district of Renhe, which comprises a 6.7 km section of a road linking the
recently completed Airport Access Road to Duren Road (West) in Renhe; (b) Bin Jiang Road,
the road improvement work (2.54 km) relieves congestion in the downtown area and provides
additional capacity for longer distance cross-town traffic; (c) Sewerage: The sewerage

and Dadukou WWTP; and (d) River Embankment and Landscape Improvement, the project had
provided a series of measures along the Jinsha River: cleaning up debris; constructing an
embankment to prevent slope and soil erosion; and improving landscapes at two scenic spots,
including planting trees and bushes along the 15 km of river from Xinzhuang Bridge to Jinsha
railway station.

Institutional Development and Capacity Improvement Component (US$ 7.0 million PAD;
US$ 7.66 million; December 2013)

The component has been satisfactorily implemented between 2007 and 2013. The component
includes the Project Management and Construction Supervision (TA1), RAP Monitoring (TA2),
EMP Monitoring (TA3), Geographical Information System (GIS) and Management Information
System (MIS), including training for SPPMO, City PMOs, all the PIAs, and other relevant
government agencies as well as contractors. The implementation of the component has
substantially improved government capacity in executing the project, ensuring the project quality,
and improving the efficiency of the execution, and helped the municipalities on urban planning



                                               49
and management capacities related to spatial planning, land management, transport planning, and
utility and asset management

Net Present Value / Economic Rate of Return

The economic rate of return and Net Present Value for each subproject as well as for the overall
project was not calculated at appraisal.

Financial Rate of Return

A financial rate of return was not prepared at appraisal.
Performance of Panzhihua Waste Water Component

The Qingxiangping BOT wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), of which the interceptor under
SUDP is connected, began its operation in April 2009; the Dadukou WWTP under the JBIC loan
project was operated in 2010, to which the interceptor under the SUDP has been connected; and
also part of sewer interceptor built under SUDP is connected to Bingcaogang WWTP in 2011.
Being audited, the cost recovery rate of the wastewater operation under the Panzhihua Water
Affairs Company (PWAC) is gradually increased to 1.15 by end of 2012.

Institutional Development Impact

There are 5 subproject entities within the overall project. Among the 5 entities, only Suining PIA
(SEDZMC) is a government own institution, and others are the company structures. At the
project completion, their institutional improvements have been achieved through their internal
improvements and their reforms from the existing entity structures.

The project management and construction supervision tasks were substantially enhanced by the
deeper involvement of international consultants. The enhanced involvement proved highly
effective service in speeding-up the project implementation and in safeguarding the project
quality. The project implementation related training was carefully designed and conducted. The
training has served as technology transfer to the PMOs and the PIAs on accepting of new
concepts in project management, construction supervision and financial systems improvements.

RAP/EMP monitoring programs have ensured the SUDP implementation safety with the WB
guidelines, project objectives, and the entire project progress. The programs maintained policies
and procedures adequate to enable the Government to monitor and evaluate the implementation
in accordance with guidelines of the Land Acquisition & Resettlement Action Plans and
Environment Management Plans, and the achievement of the objectives of said plans and
frameworks.

GIS/MIS systems, including hardware and software, have been setup in Mianyang, Suining,
Yibin and Panzhihua in SUDP, and the training provided had ensured that the systems being
used efficiently. It comprehensively utilizes the geographic information systems (GIS) and
network/communication technology to identify and develop an advanced infrastructure of city
information and digital framework in order to help the cities realize their goals.

                                                 50
Social Improvements

Whilst the objectives of the Project were essentially urban development in nature there have been
important social benefits. In the project area, over 10 million people are now benefiting from the
environmental and transportation improvements resulting from enlarging of urban area and
improving of residential living standards. These improvements have been especially beneficial
for the poorer people in the local communities.

Urbanization is now the national strategy in China. SUDP is a pilot project of infrastructure
improvement for the land development in Mianyang and Suining, and improvement of local
transportation in the urban area in Yibin and Panzhihua. For the urbanization target, the easing of
congestion on population and transportation in central city is an important objective. As
completion of SUDP, the values of land as well as the population in the development areas have
been increased, and the population in the downtown area has been decreased gradually.

In addition, through the implementation of the project, the public attitudes towards
channelization of transportation, land development and resettlements, environmental awareness
and participation have been significantly improved. On the other side, Government has gained
useful inputs and comments from the public, which is beneficial for the future planning and
policy making for potential projects on land development.

3.     Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

Factors Outside the Control of Government or Implementing Agency

The events of 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake and 8.30 Panzhihua Earthquake in 2008 had affected
the progress of SUDP during the implementation. Three of the four project cities had been
designated as the heavy disaster areas except Yibin. Since 2008, the work of the earthquake
recovery and reconstruction has been the priority task in Sichuan and the government had made
more efforts on the priority task.

In 2007 and 2008, the international fiscal crises had affected the investment of SUDP. During the
fiscal crises, the domestic construction market in China was fluctuating violently, and the price
for most construction-material and the costs for labor were gone up, which resulted in a slow
progress of ongoing contracts of civil works.

Value of RMB currency has being steadily increased since the SUDP loan agreement was in
effective in 2007 and the exchange rate between US dollar and Renminbi Yuan has changed
from 1:8.1 at the SUDP appraisal to 1:6.20 at the end of SUDP implementation. Due to the
limitation of additional counterpart funding, increased marketing price on construction materials
as well as adjustment of city/regional master plans during the implementation, some of the
project scope had to be changed.




                                                51
Factors Generally Subject to Government Control

Due to the changes of city/regional master plans, some of the subcomponents had to be changed
accordingly. For instance, some of changes on the scope of works in Mianyang, Suining and
Yibin were caused by the master plan changed. As resulted, the early preparation efforts were
wasted a lot, and the time of implementation of the entire project was delayed.

The changes in institutions and leaderships in Mianyang had affected the progress of SUDP
Mianyang components. Mianyang Science and Education Pioneer Investment Co., Ltd.
(MSEPIC) and Mianyang Sanjiang Construction Investment Co., Ltd. (MSCIC) were under
separate jurisdictions. However, MSEPIC and MSCIC changed their leaderships in 2008 and
2009, and both of them were then became service companies under Mianyang Kefa Investment
Group, which belongs to Mianyang municipality. Due to the institutional changes, the leading
positions were also changed. The changes consumed a lot of valuable project time and resulted in
a slow progress of SUDP for these subcomponents.

Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control

After 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake and 8.30 Panzhihua Earthquake, the amendment of Loan
Agreement states that the percentage of expenditure for the works (Category 1) by the loan in
Mianyang, Suining and Panzhihua under SUDP has been changed from 70% to 100%. It is
understandable that the recovery and reconstruction in Sichuan needed huge investment, and the
amendment of the SUDP loan agreement had been relieved the pressure of shortage counterpart
funding during the earthquake recovery period. However, shortage of local counterpart funding
as well as the increase of compensation in land acquisition and resettlement had also resulted in
the scope changes of the works in the project cities even though the regional master plans’
changes were the main reason.

The capacity and efficiency of PIAs in managing the subprojects had been varied, which had
caused difficulties for SPPMO and PIAs to coordinate and communicate among the relevant
agencies for such large-scale and comprehensive project. In addition, due to the longer time
period of implementation, project management teams and key personnel had been changed
substantially. All these factors had increased the difficultness in implementation.

Slow executions of the land acquisition and resettlement components under SUDP had delayed
the completion of SUDP. The works involved temporary or permanent occupation of large pieces
of land, which should be acquired before construction. The land acquisition & resettlement
should follow the policy as setup by the government, which took the time on the action. The
executions took longer than the original schedule and results in the project delay.

The less inputs caused the poor quality of geological survey during the preparation of design,
which had increased the contract price for the civil works. The works in Panzhihua and Yibin are
located in the Panzhihua hills and along Yibin Yangzi River, and the geological survey had not
been made in sufficient detail, which caused the changes of design drawings during the
construction and increased the actual completion cost of the civil works.

                                               52
Costs and Financing

Costs. Total project cost, including interest during construction, is currently estimated at USD
367.39 million (refer to the Table), which is close to the estimated project cost (USD 399.86
million) in PAD at appraisal. However, the amount cost in Chinese currency is still lower than
that at Appraisal. The main reasons that had caused the project cost variation are: (1) Chinese
currency value had been increased; (2) Competitive bidding procedure and good contract
management were carried out during SUDP implementation, which saved the project budget; and
(3) Some of sub-components in SUDP had been dropped due to the changes of regional master
plans as well as lack of local counterpart funds, which were caused by the earthquake, fiscal
crises, increased exchange value of RMB currency.

Financing. The utilization of WB loan and counterpart fund, and information on sources of
counterpart fund are provided in SUDP Cost Summary at the Table. The required counterpart
funds were provided through a mixture of central government bonds and grants, provincial
municipal grants, and local borrowings from the government and from the commercial banks.
The financing split at the project completion is Loan fund 49% and Government 51% as
compared to the appraisal split of Loan 45% and Government 55%.

4.     Sustainability

In overall terms the project can be considered sustainable although there are, and will continue to
be, some taking-over issues after the completion of the works, O&M cost recovery and further
investment for public services. Each project city in SUDP has already made Long Term Plan and
Annual Plan for Investment and Public Services, and the plans have been realized step by step.
Such as, Mianyang SEDZ will be built as industrial development zone, Mianyang PP will be
built as High-tech Development Zone, Suining EDZ will become the center of national electronic
industrial zone, SUDP Yibin component will help Yibin Lingang Economic Development Zone,
and SUDP Panzhihua component will support the development of high - level residential area
along the Bingren road.

Sustainability needs to be viewed in terms of (i) the ability to operate and maintain the assets, (ii)
the land development arrangements put in schedule, and (iii) adequate and further investment
arrangements for development sustainability.


5.     Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank

The WB’s performance during the phases of project identification, preparation, appraisal and
implementation for the project is considered to be satisfactory. The diligence of WB managers
and staff was appreciated by all the implementing agencies. The work of the WB Beijing Office
was highly appreciated in terms of timely instructions to SUDP on WB procedures; review,
comment, and approval of bid documents; and instructions on management and social
dimensions.

Borrower

The national and provincial government’s commitment to the project remained strong and
supportive during all phases of the project. The SPPMO, City PMOs and PIAs resumed active
management functions throughout the project. Each subproject entity had designated necessary
resources to execute the subproject. The government had assisted all the subproject entities to
gather sufficient counterpart funding.

Municipal governments in the project region had given utmost support for the construction at all
the subproject sites. Most of the construction sites had required strong coordination for land
acquisition and resettlement, and Government support had been remained strong. Government
support was also related to the successful implementation of the project in respect to land
acquisition and resettlement.

Provincial and municipal governments have made great efforts towards the initiation and
provision of the O & M costs for the project assets. Provincial and municipal governments are
also committed for further investment to public services. For those investments that may have



                                                 54
notable impacts to the local social and economical situations, the governments and PIAs have
formed long-term and annual plans.


6      Lessons Learned

The SUDP has been an important project for Sichuan Province to improve core urban functions
in an equitable and resource efficient manner by removing identified infrastructure bottlenecks
hampering land development, transport, and environmental conditions in four second-tier cities
(Mianyang, Suining, Yibin and Panzhihua). The implementation process had been a successful
and valuable experience for all the agencies involved. Lessons have been learned in respect to
implementation management, institutional and financial reforms, promotion of environmental
protection, and raise of public awareness and participation. Some of the main points can be
summarized in the following paragraphs.

Experience have gained in the development of a large scale urban-development project, which
comprehensively considering feasibility, alternatives, least-cost approach, institutional
development, policy support, and the impacts to the environment, society, economy, poverty
reduction, urbanization and long-term sustainability. The good experience has been adopted in
preparation of further WB projects in Sichuan.

Significant institutional capacity had been achieved by the adoption of modern project
management method, international practice of bidding and contracting, project supervision,
performance measurement, and completion evaluation. Through the project development and
implementation, trained people from this project can be a valuable resource for the management
of future projects not being financed by WB.

WB project implementation rules and procedures on procurement, contracts management, and
construction supervision had been broadly recognized as advanced management procedures.
Good experience has been gained by practicing these rules and procedures. The procedures have
been replicated on similar projects not being financed by WB.

The good construction supervision and contract management system similar to the international
practice had been adopted in the SUDP implementation and the successes had been achieved on
the aspects of contact management, cost control, quality control, etc. However, there are still
several issues influenced the practice of contract management:
     In China, the qualification of construction supervision service is needed for during the
        construction. SUDP adopted a foreign engineering consulting firm to assume the role of
        the project management and construction supervision, and it is a good international
        practice on the contract management and the PIAs benefited a lot on the project
        management. However, the government authorities have a problem to accept a foreign
        firm to perform as the engineer of construction supervision. Therefore, more explanation
        had to be made to the municipal construction bureaus that need to review the
        qualification of construction supervision firm at commence of construction. At the
        completion, there is a government authority, namely the Quality Supervision Station, who
        needs to review and accept all of construction files as well as qualification of construction

                                                 55
    supervision firms. Its issue could be a problem if the construction had been reviewed by
    the Chinese regulation. The good method of the project management and construction
    supervision in this WB project in Sichuan has been adopted by the SPPMO with the Joint
    venture team consisting of both international consulting firm and qualified Chinese
    supervision firm.
   The PIAs designated as the Employer (client) in the contracts of civil works, however,
    the PIA, except Suining, is a company that is associated with the government, which
    usually does not have enough power to address the issues during the implementation,
    particularly in land acquisition and resettlement, because the policy had been setup by the
    government, and any blocks and bottlenecks had to be solved by the relevant government
    agencies, which took a time.
   It is really a good practice that the project management and construction supervision in
    SUDP had been executed by the consulting team. In this arrangement, SPPMO and the
    Consultant can manage the contracts of civil works efficiently on aspects of quality,
    schedule, cost and safety. In addition, it was also easier for the Consultant to conduct the
    skill transfer of international construction management practices. This methodology
    could be adopted for those future projects in China either being financed by the
    multilateral Banks financed or being financed by the domestic banks.
   Under SUDP, most of the disbursements under WB loan took place in 2010-2011 when
    the exchange rate was changing a lot, therefore, the local currency based withdrew of the
    WB loan had lost a lot on Chinese currency. That amount of investment in RMB currency
    had been reduced because the slow progress of SUDP during the implementation at that
    time, although the 512 Wenchuan Earthquake event slowed down the progress. The
    contingencies on the variable exchange rate if it may have a risk on the local investment
    should be considered during the preparation of the World Bank loan project.
   Though the project preparation/implementation capacities have been built at provincial
    level and for the SUDP involved agencies, however, many other government agencies
    and potential future subproject entities still do not have the capacity. For the future WB
    projects, the WB and the Government should initiate the trainings early enough for those
    agencies that may later be involved in project development and implementation.
   In the project preparation stage, feasibility studies must be conducted in enough details
    for all aspects of technical, geological survey, financial, economical, institutional,
    environmental and social topics, following WB rules and guidelines, so as to pave a
    sound base for the WB project appraisal, and for the timely and successful
    implementation of the project.
   In the project preparation stage, both WB and the Government should avoid setting
    unduly optimistic goals and objectives for the project to achieve. This includes the targets,
    indicators of outputs and outcomes, environmental improvement and financial
    improvement. Setting realistic targets, indicators and using stepped approach (with a
    workable action plan) may be more practical.
   Both WB and the Government should make careful selection on the project components
    to be financed by WB loan and pay great attention to predict risks that might occur during
    the implementation. The municipal/regional master plan should not be changed during
    the implementation. Potential changes, as they might be envisaged, should be predicted
    and analyzed during the preparation. The major changes and components cancellation



                                             56
    will cause the delay of the implementation and the waste of preparation inputs. It will
    also affect the achievement of the project objective.
   The project asset management should be efficiently considered during the preparation
    and prepared during the implementation and the action plan of the operation,
    maintenance and management should be approved by the municipal government before
    the asset built.

Annex 10: Resettlement and Land Acquisition Implementation and Results

Social Safeguards. All four participating municipalities had subprojects involving resettlement
activities, so RAPs were developed for each one. Although the subprojects were completed at
different times in the project cycle, all resettlement was completed by closing at the end of 2013.
The total completed resettlement activities included 4591.4 mu of land acquisition and
276,515.18 m2 of housing demolition of which 239,798.39 m2 took place in rural areas and
36,716.79 m2 in urban areas. A total of 10,788 people were directly affected by resettlement.

The SUDP resettlement components were designed, prepared and implemented by the four
project municipal authorities and PIUs, and were overseen by the provincial PMO and the Bank.
Resettlement implementation was regularly monitored by an independent resettlement external
monitoring agency, the Southwest China Communication University, which provided nine
consecutive semi-annual monitoring reports and the final resettlement completion reports for the
four project municipalities. During implementation, the municipal subprojects’ contents and
resettlement activities were altered to a certain extent due to changes in local economic growth
patterns and following changes necessistated by the May 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake. Yet the
resettlement components still met the needs of the PAPs whose livelihoods were rehabilitated in
a satisfactory manner. Overall, SUDP resettlement proved to be a success: it was processed in
compliance with the Bank’s social safeguard requirements and the project’s legal covenants,
while proceeding with local land development in the economic zones on a pilot basis. Minor
challenges were associated with resettling households from two locations in Suining and a small
factory in Yibin, complicating completion of the roads.

Resettlement

The SUDP supported urban construction (mainly roads, some bridges and pipelines) in
Panzhihua, Suining, Mianyang and Yibin. Works in the four cities caused land acquisition and
population relocation and hence triggered OP4.12. Because the four municipalities implemented
their subprojects individually, each developed a RAP for its own resettlement activities. RAP
implementation in Panzhihua municipality was started in February 2008 and completed in year
end of 2012. Suining resettlement was implemented in the same period of time, while Yibin
implemented resettlement from March 2007 to June 2012, and Mianyang from December 2007
to June 2013.Although there were delays, resettlement was wholly completed when SUDP
closed on December 31, 2013.

During project implementation, an expert team from the Southwest China Communication
University, the independent resettlement external monitoring agency, conducted regular semi-
annual monitoring of RAP implementation in each of the four project municipalities, and
produced nine consecutive external monitoring reports to review and ensure resettlement quality.
Alongside project closing, the monitoring agency also developed the SUDP Resettlement ICRs
for the four municipalities in accordance with the OP4.12 requirement.




                                                60
Resettlement Impacts

SUDP resettlement statistics were recorded in detail at municipal level and consolidated roughly
at provincial level for the project as a whole. At closing, the total resettlement impacts comprised
4591.40 mu11 of land acquisition and 276,515.18 m2 of housing demolition in which 239,798.39
m2 took place in rural areas and 36,716.79 m2 in urban. About 10,788 people in 3,262
households were affected by the resettlement (either by land acquisition, house demolition, or
both). In addition, more than 3,000 people were also indirectly affected by enterprise relocation.
Table x-1 below shows the overall resettlement statistics of the project.

* Because the resettlement in Mianyang and Suining took place in the economic development zones, the people
affected by housing demolition were already included in the numbers of the people affected by land acquisition.

Each of the municipal resettlement ICRs presents detailed resettlement impact inventories.
Because some municipalities adjusted their city development master plans and local economic
growth speeds, some subproject items were taken out or added in which altered the associated
resettlement activities both in size and timing. Moreover, the Wenchuan Earthquake which
happened on May 12, 2008, near Mianyang Municipality, interrupted all local processes. Table
x-2 presents the changes in actual resettlement implementation compared with the RAPs.
Although changed in size and timing, all resettlement was implemented in conformity with the
RAP instructions, and, furthermore, all the compensation rates were raised by a large margin so
as to ensure that PAPs were resettled properly in the changing situations. Table 4.2 compares
actual vs. planned resettlement implementation.

 Resettlement Costs and Fund Distribution

 Although resettlement costs varied within municipalities, all resettlement was budgeted for
 compensation based on replacement costs as the guiding principle indicated in the RAPs. In
 actuality, when the local situations changed and economy grew, resettlement was actually
 implemented with substantially higher investment costs and at higher compensation rates in all
 four municipalities. For instance, compensation rates for land were enhanced by three to four
 times and housing by 25% on average in Panzhihua; housing compensation was increased
 between 59-71% in Yibin; the life-time monthly subsidies for PAP were increased by around 39-
 43% in the economic development zones of Suining and Mianyang. Detailed consultations with
 PAPs and advances in the national/local social policies contributed to increasing the resettlement
 investments. The table below summarizes SUDP resettlement costs.12

    These two groups represent different resettlement approaches. Resettlement in Mianyang and Suining received the lifetime
 allowance as the basis for their livelihood restoration. The resettlement costs increased here mainly contingent upon CPI changes
 chronically. In Panzhihua and Yibin, project affected people gained compensation for land requisition or/and assets’ demolition
 by which they rehabilitated their livelihoods individually with the local authorities ’ assistance. The resettlement budget increased
 here due to enhancement of compensation rates for land and assets — but one shot normally.



                                                                   62
All compensation payments were allocated to individual PAPs on time and in full as stipulated in
the RAPs. Municipal resettlement authorities and PIUs assured the smooth flow of funds from
the land users, through the municipal financial departments and PIUs, to PAP households’
accounts in local banks. PAPs participated in the resettlement processes with two-way
communication on land compensation distribution, new site selection, replacement housing,
livelihood earnings, and complaint handling. PAPs report being overwhelming satisfied with the
process and the results of resettlement under SUDP.

PAP Livelihood Rehabilitation

Housing in different compensation forms: resettled people had a choice of three types of
replacement housing: self-establishment, official arrangement, and exchange of house property
rights. With self-establishment, housing plots were provided in accordance with the regulations
for private construction use of rural land. Most resettled people moved into the officially
arranged urban apartment buildings paid for under special preferable policies, or exchanged the
property rights of their original houses. Either way, the resettled people received larger spaces
and higher quality housing, resulting in overall improved living circumstances.

Incomes with various sources and generation patterns: Most PAPs changed their occupation
from agricultural production to non-agricultural, and their Hukou status was converted from rural
to urban. After resettlement, their economic incomes came from major three sources: 1)
contracted employment after job training, 2) remunerative work in urban areas, and 3) lifetime
monthly allowances or pensions.

In the economic development zones of Mianyang and Suining, the lifetime allowances for
individuals helped offset the loss of agricultural income. For farmers who lost land in other
municipalities, compensation for land acquisition was allocated to them even though they held
no land titles, but who held use-rights only (their home villages held the land ownership but
agreed that the household losing the land could receive compensation). Farmers used these funds
from land for either to start their own businesses or to invest it as appropriate. Moreover, as
everywhere in rural China, migrating to urban areas in search of remunerative work became
another major source in PAP livelihood generation.

In all cases, the incomes of PAP were at least restored and in some cases higher than before
resettlement. Table x-4 summarizes PAP incomes based on the sample surveys of the households
tracked in all the four municipalities (the figures in this table are on averages summarized from
individually sampled households. None of the households tracked saw a decrease in incomes).

PAP satisfaction: Period surveys were undertaken to gauge the extent of resettled people’s
satisfaction with SUDP’s resettlement implementation and results. In the earlier stages, some
non-satisfaction with living conditions was registered; however when resettlement was
approaching the end, satisfaction rates were high, and eventually an overwhelming number of
resettled people expressed satisfaction with the resettlement results. Table 4-6 summarizes the
random survey results of resettled people’s satisfaction in the four project municipalities as of the
project end.

Applicability of the Resettlement Policy Framework in Mianyang and Suining

Because SUDP was implemented in the economic development zones in Mianyang and Suining,
the project developed Resettlement Policy Frameworks (RPF) to guide the overall resettlement
work entailed by land development in the whole development zones. As a result, the project
RAPs as resettlement instruments were implemented not only under the Bank-supported
subprojects but also by local authorities for all land development. All resettled people and PAPs
thus enjoyed equal levels of compensation and treatment to enable their livelihoods to be
rehabilitated and their living standards enhanced. They benefited from local economic growth as
well. SUDP RAP implementation became more influential and fruitful in its interaction with
local experiences and expertise, promoting a concerted effort to maintain such good practice in
resettlement in the years to come.
