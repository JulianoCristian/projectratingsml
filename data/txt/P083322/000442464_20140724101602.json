           substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: there is need to be candid about the\n            capacity of the client and ability to implement projects\n            with due regard to the full range of Bank requirements. The\n            design of a clear and measurable results framework is\n            critical. Increased attention should be given to safeguard\n            issues and the risks posed on the timely completion of\n            infrastructure investments. The project also highlighted the\n            importance of considering a strategic environmental\n            assessment (SEA) for these types of projects. The challenges\n            associated with operations and maintenance (O and M) were\n            anticipated during project design and included in a\n            covenant; however the project should have provided greater\n            support to cities on capital investment planning and asset\n            management. The development of economic development zone\n            (EDZ) has to be accompanied by significant technical\n            assistance and capacity building to understand the local\n            competitiveness and design effective policies and incentives\n            to attract private investments. Project designs should\n            consider the risk of changes to city and regional master\n            plans. Attention to disaster risk management and climate\n            risks must be given due regarded in infrastructure projects."}, "docdt": "2014-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
