                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress toward removing identified infrastructure bottlenecks in the four second-tier cities (Mianyang, Suining, Yibin, Panzhihua) is well underway and construction of most
                         investments can be completed in early 2012. In Suining, three contracts for the construction of various roads, bridges and drainage works have been completed and two more should
                         be completed within the next few months. These works will support development of Xining District, as well as a related link road to a city station. In Yibin, most road works, including
                         pipelines and embankments for Route A are completed but a few resettlement delays are hampering final completion of the works. For Route B, due to a change in the city master
                         plan and other factors, the portion of road funded by the project was shortened and the rest was built using domestic funds. In Panzhihua, the Bing-ren Road is practically complete
                         and parts have been opened to traffic. Related bridge construction is nearly completed. The works under the sewerage component experienced some technically challenging
                         construction but are now well underway. These works together will encourage the growth of the city towards planned areas towards the souths of the city.

                         Of the four cities, Mianyang suffered the most damage from the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and the city was forced to make significant adjustments to its land use plans to
                         accommodate its population and economic activities. With the extensive financial support it received from the central government, Mianyang proceeded with road and land use
                         projects that were originally part of this project. Following the restructuring signed in November 2011, Mianyang will use IBRD loan savings of $11.8 million for road, sewage and
                         storm drainage pipes and slope protection works in Xinglong Area in Pioneer Park. These works are in line with the PDO and will enhance the environmental conditions and
                         economic development of the city, while managing further expansion of the urban area.

                         Despite the above progress, the completion of few works are being held up by punctual resettlement issues. There area also some maintenance problems at a few roads that where
                         completed with counterpart funding, which could compromise the sustainability if not properly addressed by respective cities.
