TO THE alPIRE OF EHI-OPIA
FOR A SECOND EDUC,TI0N PROJECT
1.        I submit thle following report and recomnendaticn on a pro-
posed development credit in an amount in various currencies equiva-
lent toUSS$9.5 million to the Empire of Ethiopia for an education pro-
ject.
P-IT I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Increasing thle pace of development in Ethiopia encounters
constraints at every turn from the lack of suitably qualified and
trained men and women. Despite a major effort to increase enrollments
over the last decade, the proportion of children in primary and secon-
dary schools is still far below that in many other African countries.
The rapid pace of expansion has itself created problems.   Enrollments,
particularly at secondary level, have far outrun physical capacity and
there is severe overcrowding. There has been a growing shortage of
qualified Ethiopian teachers and a consequent heavy de,)endence on ex-
patriate assistance. While the economy remains critically short of
both skilled 1-bor and of men and women educated for administrative
and managerial positionE, shortages thflat are manifest in a number of
B .nk 'roup pruject; children leaving secondary schools do not easily
find employment. In an economy that is predominantly rural, there is
little education or training, that is directly relevant to the agri-
cultural Dorker, and schools have generally been concentrated in major
urban centers. These problems cannot be resolved (uick:l_y. Indeed,
basic studies are required before the appropriate solutions can be
defined and plans drawn up to implement them. In the meantime, a large
new investment in secondary education cannot be justified. Moreover,
the prospective growth in education expenditures calls for a most
careful scrutiny of priorities.
3.        The proposed project, tne second in education in Ethiopia,
is in some respects an interim project pending the establishment of
firmly based plans for the future. It combines a concerted effort to
increase the number of qualified teachers, about the necessity for
which there is no doubt, wvrith what is essentially a holding operation
in secondary education, limited to reducing the most serious over-
crowding and improving the regional distribution of secondary schools.
Agricultural institutes and training centers, again a clear priority,
will be expanded. Looking to the future, the project seeks to provide
experience in possible solutions to rural education and will assist in
a tlhorough replanning of education and training through an educational
study and assistance in completing manpower studies.



4.         A UNESCO mission visited Ethiopia in December 1968 to prepare
the project. A pre-appraisal mission visited Ethiopia in October 1969,
and in February-March 1970 the project was appraised. There followed
extensive consultations with the Government in arriving at the project
in its present form.
5.         Formal negotiations took place in Washington in January 1971.
The borrower was represented by H.E. Ato Seifu Mahteme Selassie, Min-
ister of Education; Ato Bekele Gayid, Assistant Minister, Mlinistry of
Education; Dr. Tsagga Amlak, Acting Director General of Education and
Training, Ministry of Agriculture; Ato Assefa Bersoufekad, Director of
Manpower, Ministry of Community Development and Social Affairs; Ato Kassa
Gabre, Chief Construction and Maintenance Division, Ministry of Education;
Y&. I.J. Muthusami, Program Officer, Ministry of Education; and Ato Asfaw
Damte, Financial and Economic Attache, Embassy of Ethiopia, Washington, D.C.
PART II - HISTORICAL
6.         The proposed credit would be the sixth credit to Ethiopia
and would increase the total IDA lending to Ethiopia to US$44.5 million.
Ethiopia has also received eleven Bank loans tota,ling US$97.8 million.
The first two loans were made in 1950 and the th,rd in 1251.  The final
maturities on these three loans were paid ab the beginning of March 1971.
Eight loans are fully disbursed. The following is a sum.rxary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits to Ethiopia as at February 28, 1971:

7.         The IFC has committed US$3.1 million to the Cotton Company of
Ethiopia, US$1.0 million to the Ethiopian Pulp and Paper Company and
US$9.0 million to the HVA-Metahara sugar-growing and milling project.
After deducting amounts taken up by sub-underwriters, sales from portfolio
and principal repayments, IFC now holds $10.3 million for its own account.
8.         There are no particular disbursement problems, except for the
1963 credit and the 1968 loan and credit for highways. The 1963 credit
cannot be fully disbursed until the government and contractors have con-
cluded arbitration proceedings arising out of claims concerning completed
road construction. Arrangements for arbitration appear to be proceeding
in an orderly manner. The delay in disbursement of the 1968 highway loan
resulted from slow progress in preparation of acceptable tender documents
and contractor prequalification, The small number of responses to the
first tender required a second tender with some changed conditions. Con-
tracts were finally signed in July and August, 1969 and work is now pro-
ceeding normally.
9.         Three other lending proposals for Ethiopia are expected to be
ready for presentation to the Executive Directors in this fiscal year;
namely, a credit for approximately US$4.4 million for a dairy develop-
ment project, for which negotiations have been substantially completed;
a loan of approximately US$6.5 million for a coffee processing project,
for which negotiations are planned to begin shortly; and a loan of
approximately US$9.3 million for a water and sewerage project in Addis
Ababa, the appraisal of which is close to completion.
PART III - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
10.   Borrower:            Empire of Ethiopia
Amount:              US$9.5 million equivalent in various currencies.
Purpose:             Construction of new and extension of exist-
ing teacher training institutes, secondary
schools, agricultural training centers and
agricultural institutes; establishment of three
rural education institutes; and provision of
technical assistance for an education sector
survey, manpower studies, technical education
and project implementation.
Amortization:        In 50 years including a 10-year period of
grace, through semi-annual installments of
1/2 of 1% from April 15, 1981 through
October 15, 1990 and of 1-1/2% from
April 15, 1991 through October 15, 2020.
Service Charge:       3/4 of 1% per annum.



PA'ClT IV - THF PROJECT
11.       A report on the project, 'Appraisal of a Second Zducation
Project in 2thiopia' (PE-22a) is attached.
12.       Enrollments in Ethiopia's school system have increased rapidly
during the last decade but the proportion of school age children who
attend school is still very low.  In primary education the participation
rate is only 12.,% of the relevant age group compared to about 65% in
Kenya and 35/' in Tanzania. At the secondary level, less than 4,% of the
relevant age group attend school, compared to about 8o in Kenya and 2.4,
in Tanzania. There is a severe shortage of qualified teachers at all
levels. Hloreover, the curriculum at both primary and secondary levels
requires improvement.
13.       The Association's first education credit (84-'T) addressed
itself to some of these problems by assisting -the expansion of general
and technical secondary education; the introouction of diversified
curriculum including practical subjects at the secondary level; and an
increase in teacher training facilities. However, it became apparent
during the appraisal of the second project that further changes were still
required in order to make Ethiopia's education syrstem more suitable and
responsive to developmental needs.
1.       The present project, which will be completed by June, 1976,
includes the construction and equipping of new, and extensions to,
existing teacher training institutes and secondary schools and the con-
struction and equipping of t.hree new agriculturaltr-inAng cnrters xrd three
new rural education institutes. The teacher training component will
promote reforms in primary and secondary education; the agricultural
component will expand the supply of extension workers and agricultural
technicians. The extensions to existing secondary schools will allow
double shift working and permit a wider implementation of the diversified
curriculum introduced with the first IDA project (Credit 84-r7P). Hlost of
the new secondary schools will be in developing rural areas and will give
emphasis to agricultural training and home economics. The urban schools
will include practical courses in industrial arts and commerce. The
three rural education institutes will be established in areas with
different ecological and agricultural condit4ions  as pilot projects in
practical agricultural training. This is in line with the overall Bank/IDk
strategy, shared by 3thiopia, to reform the Ethiopian educational system so
as to place more emphasis on agricultural education than has been done in
the past.



15.       Important .-i-istance in thie reform of the education system will
also be gi-ven through the financing of a comprehensive education sector
review and of manpower studies on (i) changes in the level of employment,
(ii) the educational profile of employed manpower and (iii) the
functioning of the labor market.
16.       The estimated total cost of the project, including consultant
fees and allowances for contingencie-, is UST13.4 million.  The proposed
credit of Ua{39.5 million wiould cover all the estimated forei;n exchange
costs ($7.3 million) and approximately 36% of the local expenditures,
with the result that the Association would finance 71%C' of the total pro-ect
cost and the Government the remainder. The Justification for local
expenditure financing is discussed in paragraph 22 below.
17.       For the purpose of administering and supervising the execution
of the project and to assure coordination with other agencies, the Govern-
ment will maintain within its Ministry of Education a Project Imple-
mentation Unit under the direction of a Project iiaTnager and includingr a
Project Coordinator and a Project Architect, all of whom shall be mutually
acceptable to the Government and the Association, as well as a group of
education specialists to be responsible for the development of agricultural
and technical education programs.  The appointment of the Project Manager,
the Project Coordinator and the Project Architect wiould be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit.
18.       Civil works contracts would be awarded and equipment and
furniture procured on the basis of international competitive bidding. For
ci-vil works, bids would be invited for groups of schools or for single
units to allow bidding by both international and Ethiopian contractor; on
one single unit or several units within the group of schools in each bid
invitation. It is expected that local contractors will obtain a substan-
tial share of the con-tracts.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRU1\NTS 1A1D A UTHO -ITY
19.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Empire ol'
Ethiopia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for under Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
20.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms generally to tile
pattern of recent agreements for education projects.
PART VI - TEE ECONO0MY
21.       A report "Economic Growvth and Prospects in Ethiopia': (hE-9) in
five volumes waas circulated on September 22, 1970. a basic data sheet is
attached.



22.        The principal cmnclusions of the economic report are that after
several yeaxs of fairly modest growth, the recent increase in coffee prices
should make it possible to raise the growth rate to over 5.4h per year
over the next five years. This would require a steady increase in private
investment and a rise in public investment by 505. Even given a consider-
able increase in domestic resources through higher taxes and the strict
control of expenditures, Ethiopia will be able to finance only about one-
half of the public investment that is desirable and will have to luok to
external finance for the other half. The needed capital inflow will ex-
ceed the import content of public investment and not all of the program
will be able to attract foreign assistance. It follows that if external
finance is to make an adequate contribution, some financing of local ex-
penditures will be necessary. For foreign aid to finance half of the
total program, it means that, on the average, external aid should cover
significantly more than half of the total cost of the projects financed.
Ethiopia is, moreover, a poor country, will need to import capital for
many years and external assistance should, therefore, be predominantly
on concessionary terms.
PART VII - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMNT
23.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VIII - RECOMNEDATION
24.        I recormend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
