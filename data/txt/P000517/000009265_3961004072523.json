support its implementation between 1994\n            and 1998.  The central project objective is to improve the\n            access, quality and efficiency of primary education,\n            primarily in rural areas and nationwide for girls.  To this\n            end, the project will support a national development program\n            for primary education designed to achieve the following\n            targets for 1998:  raising overall primary enrollment ratio\n            from 59% in 1990 to 65% and the share of female enrollment\n            from 31% to 36%, and reducing the average repetition rate\n            from 30% to 20%.  Secondary objectives are to promote a more\n            efficient resource use in the education sector.  To achieve\n            these objectives and to help finance recurrent costs\n            entailed by project investments, the project will support\n            policy measures to:  (a) increase public expenditures on\n            primary education; (b) increase efficiency in the use of\n            primary school teachers and classrooms; (c) promote\n            girls' participation in primary education; and (d)\n            encourage private initiatives in the provision of education.\n            Within the framework of the policy measures, the project\n            will finance investments designed to:  (i) improve the\n            access and quality of primary education nationwide; (ii)\n            support a pilot school improvement program for primary\n            education in three regions; and (iii) strengthen critical\n            sectoral institutions."}, "docdt": "1993-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
