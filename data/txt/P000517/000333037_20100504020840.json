The central project objective is to improve the\n            access, quality and efficiency of primary education,\n            primarily in rural areas and nationwide for girls.  To this\n            end, the project will support a national development program\n            for primary education designed to achieve the following\n            targets for 1998:  raising overall primary enrollment ratio\n            from 59% in 1990 to 65% and the share of female enrollment\n            from 31% to 36%, and reducing the average repetition rate\n            from 30% to 20%.  Secondary objectives are to promote a more\n            efficient resource use in the education sector.  To achieve\n            these objectives and to help finance recurrent costs\n            entailed by project investments, the project will support\n            policy measures to:  (a) increase public expenditures on\n            primary education; (b) increase efficiency in the use of\n            primary school teachers and classrooms; (c) promote\n            girls' participation in primary education; and (d)\n            encourage private initiatives in the provision of education.\n            Within the framework of the policy measures, the project\n            will finance investments designed to:  (i) improve the\n            access and quality of primary education nationwide; (ii)\n            support a pilot school improvement program for primary\n            education in three regions; and (iii) strengthen critical\n            sectoral institutions."}, "docdt": "1993-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
