   outcomes, likely sustainability, and modest institutional\n            development impacts. Project design and management lessons\n            suggest it would have been preferable to include an\n            institutional assessment, which would have helped in\n            determining the dimensions of the project. Similarly,\n            implementation of all components should be the\n            responsibility of national agencies, to be supported only by\n            need-base external technical assistance, rather than\n            directly entrusting to external technical aid. It is\n            recommended that a partnership between the State and the\n            communities be implemented, to ensure that community\n            teachers evolve professionally, but such partnership be\n            based on the principle that the State would provide a\n            supplemental compensation, to maintain strong\n            accountability. Sector technical lessons point at the\n            absence of structures within line ministries, responsible\n            for the analysis/assessment of textbooks' content, a\n            factor that led to an erroneous procurement of textbooks,\n            whose content did not correspond to student levels, nor\n            reflect the country's realities. Regarding the quality\n            of teacher training, there is a strong need for better\n            structured training programs, based on improved coordination\n            between pre-service, and in-service training. Finally, it is\n            reinforced that children beginning their education in their\n            native language, have a higher success rate, however, the\n            success of this experiment failed to impact a policy definition."}, "docdt": "2002-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
