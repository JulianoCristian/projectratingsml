INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Niger for the equivalent of Special
Drawing Rights 14 million (US$16 million) on standard IDA terms to help
finance a proposed industrial development project. US$12.0 million of the
proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Banque de Developpement de
la Republique du Niger for 18 years, including three years of grace, with
interest at the central bank rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Memorandum:  Niger" (RN 1109a-NIR) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on May 13, 1976. An economic updating
mission visited Niger in February 1981, and the main findings of the mission
are incorporated in the following paragraphs. Annex I contains country data.
Background
3.        Until recently, Niger was a resource-poor country.  Consumption as
a proportion of GDP was high and sometimes in excess of domestic production.
Accordingly, gross domestic savings were very low or negative, and most
investment, modest at 12 percent of GDP, was financed by foreign savings.
However, the situation changed in the 1975-80 period, reflecting rapidly
growing uranium revenues: in 1979, at the peak of the uranium boom, uranium
mining accounted for 16 percent of GDP, about 80 percent of total export
earnings, and 39 percent of government revenue. As a result, gross domestic
savings, which represented 9 percent of GDP in 1975 grew to 14 percent of GDP
in 1979, while the country's resource gap decreased substantially from 14
percent in 1975 to less than 8.5 percent of GDP in 1979. However, with the
sharp drop in uranium prices in late 1980, which heralded a depression in the
uranium market that is expected to last into the latter part of the decade,
uranium revenues declined to less than 10 percent of total budget receipts in
1981. With a per capita GDP of about US$330 in 1980, Niger remains among the
29 least developed countries of the United Nations.
4.        Despite the somewhat brighter outlook offered by uranium, Niger
continues to face a number of formidable natural, economic, and human con-
straints to development which will have to be overcome or alleviated to
ensure self-sustained economic growth in the long-run. First, many Govern-
ment institutions are still in an embryonic state of development. Second,



-2-
four fifths of the country is desert or semi-desert and in the rest, which
supports about 80 percent of the population, soil fertility is low and pro-
bably declining. In addition, rainfall is often irregular or inadequate and
the costs of irrigation schemes are unusually high. Third, the country's
land-locked position induces high transport costs and sometimes serious delays
in the delivery of imports. Finally, Niger has a primary school enrollment
rate of only about 17 percent, which is one of the lowest rates in the world
and has led to acute shortages of literate and qualified personnel at all
levels and in many fields in the economy. These problems are now being
compounded by the sharply declining uranium revenues. With an ambitious
investment program predicated on maintenance of the real prices and increasing
production, the five-fold drop in uranium revenues to less than 10 percent of
total budget receipts in 1981 is already being felt in increasing budgetary
stringency.
Economic Growth
5.        Real GDP grew at 3 percent per year during the six-year period
1972-78, while population grew at 2.7 percent. Between 1972 and 1975, real GDP
recorded negative growth, mainly as a result of severe drought-induced setbacks
in agriculture and livestock production, compounded by the resulting recession
in agro-industries. In the subsequent three years (1976-78), the economy
picked up considerably to achieve an annual growth rate of over 9 percent;
however, 1979 and 1980 show some decline, moving to 7.5 percent in 1979 and
6 percent in 1980. This reflects the impact of uranium mining and related
activities such as transport and construction, on the economy. Production of
uranium concentrates increased rapidly from some 400 tons to about 2,000 tons
between 1971 and 1978, while its export prices almost quintupled from US$20/kg
to US$98/kg. However, with prices falling to about US$62/kg in 1981 after
remaining virtually constant in 1978-80, the constraining effects are likely
to limit GDP growth to 4 percent or less. Despite the vicissitudes in the
uranium sector, growth in traditional sectors, in particular agriculture and
agro-industry, has been modest.
Public Finance
6.        Over the last seven years, sound fiscal management, with the help
of rapidly rising revenues from uranium mining, had enabled the Government
to generate substantial current budgetary surplus. This amounted to about
CFAF 9.6 and 16.1 billion in FY76/77 and FY77/78 respectively. Results for
1978/79 show a further improvement to about CFAF 24 billion. These surpluses
permitted rapid growth of capital expenditures in absolute as well as in
relative terms from CFAF 2.6 billion in FY75/76 (about 10 percent of total
budgetary expenditures) to CFAF 13.6 billion in FY77/78 (32 percent) and CFAF
17.6 billion in 1978/79. As a result, the contribution of budgetary savings
to total public investment increased from 10 percent in FY70/71 to more than
28 percent in FY78/79. As a result of the drop in prices, however, the
budgetary savings ratio is likely once again to drop below 10 percent. On the
other hand, the tax base has been undergoing significant changes in recent



- 3 -
years. First, Government revenue relies heavily upon uranium mining, revenues
from which have declined five-fold since 1979/80. Second, in an attempt to
ease the tax burden of low-income groups, a number of measures were introduced:
livestock head taxes were abolished in FY74/75 following the 1973 drought, the
head tax levied on the population aged 14 years and over was completely
abolished in FY77/78, and income taxes on monthly salaries below CFAF 15,000
were eliminated beginning FY77/78. The foregone revenues from those sources
are estimated at about CFAF 4 billion. These fiscal measures reflect Govern-
ment's increasing concern with the problems of social equity and particularly
the fate of the rural poor. However, at a time of considerable budgetary
stringency imposed by the drop in uranium prices, the results in question are
making the Government's overall budgetary situation even more difficult.
7.        The annual rate of inflation averaged 8 percent over the period
1972-75, but rose to over 20 percent in 1976 and 1977. Due to the normal
harvests in 1977/78, inflation as measured by the implicit GDP deflator
levelled off somewhat in 1978 at an annual rate of 12 percent, where it has
remained since. Three major factors contributing to recent inflation include
the supply constraint in basic commodities, especially in food, rising prices
for imported goods, and rapid monetary expansion.
Balance of Payments
8.        In spite of the rapid increase in export earnings from uranium,
Niger's balance of payments continues to be characterized by a trade deficit:
the imports required for operating the economy as well as for new capital
formation including development of new uranium mining still exceed foreign
exchange earnings. This trade deficit was, however, more than compensated
for by the inflow of foreign private and public capital so that the overall
balance of payments showed a substantial surplus until 1978. However, esti-
mates indicate an overall deficit of about US$2.5 million in 1979, the first
in some years. The fall in uranium prices is likely to bring about a con-
siderable reduction in total earnings in 1981 and beyond.
Development Planning
9.        The Five-Year Development Plan, 1979-1983, was only recently pub-
lished and identifies Niger's basic objectives as: (a) the modernization
of agriculture and livestock production; (b) a high rate of economic growth
spurred by investments in mining, industry, transportation and communica-
tions; (c) human resources development; and (d) a gradual reduction of
regional disparities in income. On an annual basis, the public investment
target implies an increase of 220 percent over the 1976-78 Plan. About 30
percent of public investments over the Plan period will be allocated to rural
development, 30 percent to mining, energy and industry, 22 percent to educa-
tion and health, and 18 percent to transportation and communications. The
total investment target of the Plan is US$3.5 billion in 1979 prices with
US$1.8 billion for public investment. Implementation of 1976-78 Plan fell
far short of its targets, largely due to a limited absorptive capacity and
difficulties in project preparation, caused primarily by manpower constraints.



- 4 -
These are likely to continue being a major barrier to the implementation of
the new Plan. In addition, the downward trend in uranium prices can be
expected to set further limitations on plan implementation; 42 percent of
public investments in the Plan are set out for Government financing.
Foreign Aid
10.       Between 1971 and 1977 Niger's total recorded net in-flow of re-
sources from DAC countries and multilateral agencies averaged about US$80
million annually, of which 95 percent was on concessionary terms. The Euro-
pean Development Fund (FED), France, Germany and Canada remain Niger's major
aid donors, although recently Arab oil-producing countries have increased
their lending programs to Niger. However, in the two year period between
1978 and 1980 external public debt more than doubled, rising from about
US$400 billion to US$855 million at end 1980, although indications are that
the pace of commercial borrowing dropped substantially in 1981. About 25
percent of new commitments originated from private banks and suppliers. Given
the short grace periods and high interest rates now prevailing, debt-servicing
obligations of the government doubled over the previous year in FY1980/81, and
now account for 14 percent of budget revenues.
11.       Total debt outstanding increased by US$332 million to US$885 million
during '980; only US$355 million of that total had been disbursed by the end
of 1980. Bilateral loans (disbursed and undisbursed), 53 percent of which
were received from France, were only US$290 million of the 1980 total.
Multilateral loans amounted to US$312 billion, US$138.1 million of which
represented IDA credits (16 percent of overall indebtedness). The remainder
US$283 billion, was divided almost equally between suppliers' credits and
banks, and given the heavy interest rates prevailing on these loans, overall
debt service, now only US$21 million, will rise nearly five-fold to US$98.8
million in 1983, which, if uranium prices fail to rise, will exceed 20 percent
of exports as compared with 3.3 percent in 1979.
12.       Perhaps the major issue which Niger faces is how to scale down its
ambitious 1979-83 Plan to expenditure levels which are consistent with the
sharply reduced revenue offtake from the uranium sector. In light of this
situation, the Bank is discussing with the Government the need to tailor its
investment plan to a level consistent with its future resources and debt
service capacity. Whatever the evolution of these discussions, it is abundantly
clear that Niger continues to face substantial physical and human constraints,
particularly with a literacy rate of 8 percent, near the lowest in the world.
Given a resource situation with little promise for the next five to ten years,
the extremely low level of development and the largely unmet basic needs of
the population, Niger will continue to require concessionary, as well as local
cost, financing for some time to come.

PART II - WORLD BANK OPERATIONS IN NIGER
13.       Nineteen IDA credits, including two supplementary credits, have
so far been approved for Niger totalling US$158.2 million. Annex II contains
a summary statement of these credits as of January 31, 1982 and notes on
the execution of on-going projects. Past Bank Group lending was heavily
concentrated on transport, communications and rural development. Of the
seventeen projects approved to date, five aimed at expanding and upgrading the
domestic road network, one provided for improvement and extension of existing
facilities at Niamey international airport, one for the installation of a more
reliable telecommunications system, and one for educational planning. The
Association's lending to date for the rural sector includes eight projects
for drought relief, rural development, forestry, irrigation and livestock.
Disbursement performance is similar to the average for other countries in the
region.
14.       In keeping with Niger's overall development strategy, future Bank
Group lending will continue efforts in the rural and transport sectors, but
also increasingly support Government efforts to diversify the economic
structure, expand modern sector employment, and meet manpower requirements.
We will also continue to advise Government on policy issues and options
through our economic and sector work.
15.       In agriculture, Bank Group lending supports Government's generally
sound strategy, namely regional projects aimed at increasing production,
gradual development of the country's irrigation potential, provision of
services to pastoralists, and crop-livestock integration. Due to the severity
of the natural constraints and the present state of technical knowledge,
agricultural and livestock development in Niger will be slow and difficult.
However, experience with ongoing projects has demonstrated that potential
does exist, and can be realized with the provision of appropriate inputs and
extension services. In transport, we plan to place emphasis on assistance
for the construction of a network of secondary and access roads to support
the Government's agricultural program while continuing our support for the
maintenance of the existing infrastructure; a feeder roads project approved
in FY79 marks a first step towards this objective. The Bank is also evalu-
ating a technical assistance project which would consist of feasibility
studies for priority projects, followed by the coordination and monitoring
of project activities by line ministries, strengthening Niger's external
debt management system.
PART III - THE SECTOR
16.       Although uranium mining and agriculture are the key sectors in
Niger's development effort -- the former to generate necessary revenues
and the latter for self-sufficiency in food -- increasing emphasis is given



to the development of other sectors to provide employment for a growing
population and to broaden the economic base. These sectors include manu-
facturing, construction and services, and they account for one third of
Niger's GDP.
17.       The modern manufacturing sector in Niger is still modest.  Some
forty enterprises employ a total of 3,500 workers and contribute roughly
one percent to GDP. The sector is geared towards import substitution, agro-
processing and construction materials. Although it offers reasonable prospects
for development, balanced expansion of the sector will depend on overcoming
some important obstacles--operational difficulties including input shortages,
high transport costs, lack of competent middle management and skilled labor;
burdensome regulations, including rigid price controls that poorly respond to
changes in production costs and overhead, and a deficient incentive system
that discourage dynamic management, ignore small and artisan enterprises and
paralyze export-oriented manufacturing; and the challenge of the Nigerian
market with fierce competition from Nigerian colleagues, but also with the
potential to offer attractive prospects for the Nigerien entrepreneur. The
proposed project will help address these issues through continued support
to the local entrepreneurial promotion agency, Office de Promotion de l'Entre-
prise Nigerienne, OPEN (paras. 27, 28 and 35), established under the Industrial
and Artisan Sector Employment Creation Project (Credit 809-NIR), and by
supporting improvements in the regulatory and incentive system. A Government
commission has been established to review the whole structure of policies and
incentives with the objective of making existing regulations more responsive
to entrepeneurial needs. It has been inactive but would be revived under the
project. Proposed changes would be discussed with IDA in the course of
project supervision, and a timetable for their implementation would then be
agreed on before end June 1984 (Section 4.05, draft Credit Agreement).
18.       The artisan subsector, which is the dominant component in industry,
employing some 35,000 artisans and contributing roughly five percent to GDP,
also received IDA support under Credit 809-NIR, which helped establish the
Centre des Metiers d'Art du Niger (CMAN) to promote artistic artisan produc-
tion of leather goods, a promising activity with export potential. The
proposed project would continue to support CMAN, but would also bring atten-
tion to artisan production of everyday wares with a survey under the auspicies
of OPEN on ways to assist artisan clusters (para. 35).
19.       Niger's burgeoning construction sector is three times as large
as the modern manufacturing sector. However, the market share of Nigerien
enterprises is less than 30 percent and, among them, two firms account for
the bulk of the Nigerien share, leaving only 6 percent of the total market
(roughly CFAF 3 billion) to the other 30 indigenous firms. Bottlenecks to its
development include inadequate bidding procedures, acute shortage of technical
and managerial personnel and of skilled labor, lack of machinery and equipment
and inadequate financial structure and reporting systems of most firms. The
proposed project will attempt to alleviate some of the constraints by helping
to revise bidding procedures and by providing technical assistance and train-
ing to construction firms through a Technical Assistance Unit to be estab-
lished in OPEN (para. 35).



20.       The service sector, which includes transport, commerce, hotels
and non-government services, accounts for about 19 percent of GDP. Its
development has been rapid, reflecting the needs of the growing uranium
industry, the communication requirements related to N ger's landlocked
position and the buoyant border trade with northern Nigeria.
21.       The Financial Sector.  As a member of the West African Monetary
Union (UMOA), Niger shares a common currency (CFAF), a regional central bank
(BCEAO) and credit and monetary policies with Benin, Ivory Coast, Senegal,
Togo and Upper Volta. BCEAO applies a preferential interest rate of 8 to 11
percent on loans to Government, small-scale enterprises, for crop financing
and housing; these are discounted at eight percent. Other loans bear rates
of 10.5 to 15.5 percent and may be discounted at 10.5 percent. The annual
rate of inflation is estimated at 12 percent since 1977 and is expected to
continue at that rate. Existing interest rates are therefore likely to stay
marginally positive. To carry out BCEAO policy, each country is given an
annual indicative target for credit expansion and a ceiling for central bank
refinancing. Within those limits, banks may refinance up to 35 percent of
their loan portfolio. To control credit expansion, all bank loan applications
above CFAF 30 million require prior central bank approval.
Project Institutions
22.       The Banque de Developpement de la Republique du Niger (BDRN), Office
de Promotion de l'Entreprise du Niger (OPEN) and Centre des Metiers d'Art du
Niger (CMAN) would be primary intermediaries for this project.
Banque de Developpement de la Republique du Niger (BDRN)
23.       BDRN was established in 1961 as a commercial and development bank
with majority public ownership. It is one of the strongest development
institutions in the Region, highly profitable and with a sound financial base.
All powers to authorize credit rest with a credit committee headed by the
Minister of Finance, who is also chairman of BDRN's board, and with the
General Manager in the case of small loans. The present General Manager, who
was appointed in 1976, has shown an impressive grasp of his job. Professional
staff, which number 75 out of a total staff of 555, is of good caliber,
although thinly spread. Support is provided by five expatriates, but comple-
mentary staff training is needed and the project will help establish an
in-house training unit that would focus on upgrading support staff and middle
management. BDRN's accounts are audited annually by an independent firm
acceptable to IDA. Its accounting system is, however, overburdened and the
bank is considering the acquisition of a more powerful data processing system.
Under this project, a qualified systems engineer will help BDRN review alter-
native proposals (para. 34).
24.       Development Operations.  With the support of its commercial opera-
tions, which represent 70 percent of its assets and which have proven an
important asset in building up development financing and promotional activites,
BDRN's development department has been remarkably active in project promotion
and appraisal. Staffed with six professionals and assisted by two IDA-financed
advisers (that will continue to be financed under the proposed project), the



- 8 -
department has almost doubled BDRN's outstanding medium- and long-term devel-
opment portfolio between 1978 and 1980, which now totals more than 12 billion
CFAF; outstanding equity investments total 287 million CFAF. Mining and
energy have been the main beneficiaries (41 percent); the share of manufac-
turing is only 10 percent, but its share in equity portfolio is 36 percent.
In financing its developing banking operations, BDRN to some extent taps
foreign lines of credit in addition to IDA--notably CCCE, KfW, USAID, AfDB
and BOAD. We shall continue to encourage this effort to diversify funding
sources.
25.       State Operations.  In addition to its regular development and
commercial banking operations, BDRN also finances projects on behalf of the
Government. It intervenes for the state by prefinancing Government projects,
granting medium-term loans to finance Government sponsored development projects
and by borrowing on the international market on behalf, and with the guarantee
of, the Government. Since 1977, the volume of outstanding state operations
has increased by some 60 percent, and now represent 30 percent of BDRN's total
operations. As a result, BDRN is at present reviewing ways to limit the
growth of these operations in particular medium-term lending to, and inter-
national borrowing for, Government. (It has already started to reduce its
prefinancing of Government projects.)
26.       Financial Position and Prospects.  Total assets have increased from
CFAF 32.2 billion in 1977 to 58.6 billion in 1980. In volume, most of this
growth represents expanded commercial operations, but the development and
state portfolios have increased at a faster pace. Total net worth has gone
from CFAF 3.2 to 7.3 billion. BDRN's debt/equity ratio of 2.4:1 as of
SeptemDer 30, i980 remains well below the 4:1 ratio required by IDA under
Credit 807-NIR. The same requirement will be maintained under the proposed
project (Section 3.03, draft Project Agreement). Despite growing administra-
tive expenses and substantial provisions against arrears (CFAF 5.9 billion or
10 percent of total portfolio of CFAF 2.8 billion or 5 percent of total
portfolio), BDRN's earnings before taxes of CFAF 2 billion in 1980 represent
26 percent of its net worth. One of the strongest financial institutions in
the region, BDRN will, nevertheless, have to adjust to a less favorable
environment in the future--declining uranium revenue, higher public debt
service obligations, lower level of public deposits, and keener competition
from newly established banks. BDRN's management has therefore adopted a
medium-term strategy which aims at reinforcing BDRN's development operations,
reducing its dependence on public deposits by relying increasingly on foreign
lines of credit and upgrading its administrative capabilities.
Office de Promotion de l'Enterprise Nigerienne (OPEN)
27.       OPEN was established in November 1978 with UNDP/UNIDO and IDA
assistance (Credit 809-NIR) to (i) promote new enterprises and investments;
(ii) provide technical assistance to Nigerien enterprises; (iii) study and
prepare projects for bank financing; and (iv) provide training in management
and basic business skills. In addition OPEN was to be responsible for
administering a guarantee and equity participation fund.



- 9 -
28.       In only two years of operations, OPEN has received more than 250
requests for assistance, prepared 20 project files (of which four have been
financed), assisted 107 small metal and woodworking firms and held seminars
throughout the country. While performance to date has been good, OPEN
is still in a formative stage and strengthening will have to focus on the
following: (a) with a staff of just eight Nigerien professionals and five
expatriate advisors, the agency is undermanned; (b) OPEN's pipeline shows a
bias in favor of larger, capital intensive projects; a comprehensive strategy
will have to be developed that takes into account the general business environ-
ment and its overall needs; (c) training activities have only just begun, and
a coherent training strategy based on a thorough assessment of training needs
still needs to be articulated; (d) the guarantee and equity participation
fund still has to be established. These needs would be addressed under the
proposed project (para. 35); and Government will be asked to (i) second three
professionals to OPEN, and (ii) adopt statutes for the funds by June 30, 1983
(Sections 4.01(b) and 4.06, draft Credit Agreement).
Centre des Metiers d'Art du Niger (CMAN)
29.       CMAN was established in early 1980 under Credit 809-NIR to support
the leather artisan subsector and in particular to improve product design
and production techniques and develop exports of artisan leather products.
CMAN now employs 80 people and operates a workshop and two boutiques in Niamey;
an artisan cooperative has been established in Zinder and another workshop in
Maradi. However, as a result of start-up difficulties related to management
and technical assistance, CMAN has not yet been able to develop its export
potential nor has it reached financial self-sufficiency; it lacks bylaws and
financial reporting is still inadequate. Satisfactory solutions are being
implemented, including an audit of CMAN's accounts, appointment of a new
technical assistance team, design of a commercial accounting system and
establishment of an interim management committee. Export sales have recently
begun and production standards have greatly improved. Disbursement of the
OMAN component for the proposed project would be subject to satisfactory
implementation of corrective actions (para. 36).
Bank Group Role in the Sector
30.       IDA's "Industrial and Artisan Sector Employment Creation Project"
of US$5 million was approved in May 1978 and became effective in February
1979. Its primary purpose was to promote employment creation in Niger's
industrial and artisan sector while strengthening institutions through the
provision of technical and financial assistance. To date, project perfor-
mance has been generally satisfactory. The project is well underway and, as
of September 30, disbursements had reached 75 percent of the credit. The
project's institution building impact has been positive on BDRN, OPEN and
CMAN. A line of credit to BDRN was supposed to benefit some 40 enterprises
and generate employment for some 500 people. However, it proved difficult to
reach very small enterprises, and sub-project costs proved to be higher than
estimated at appraisal. The amount of the line of credit was therefore
reduced with pro rata adjustment of targets, i.e. to some 330 jobs. The
number of jobs created out of sub-projects was 230 or 70 percent of the
adjusted target, which is satisfactory in the Nigerien context, given the
fact that this was the initial project.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       The project was identified in November/December 1980 and appraised
in May/June 1981. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington
from February 16 to February 18, 1982. The Niger delegation was led by the
Minister of Plan. Annex III contains supplementary project data. The Staff
Appraisal Report "Niger - Industrial Development Project" No. 3658-NIR is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Objectives and Project Description
32.       The proposed project is a follow-up operation to the Industrial
and Artisan Sector Employment Creation Project (Credit 809-NIR) and would
continue efforts to strengthen institutional infrastructure relating to
sectors outside agriculture and mining through the provision of technical and
financial assistance and improvements in sectoral policies and procedures. It
would include the following:
(a) a line of credit of US$12 million to BDRN over a four-year commit-
ment period to finance investment projects in sectors outside
agriculture and mining; and
(b) technical assistance to BDRN, OPEN and CMAN, and modest capital
assistance to OPEN, to help strengthen internal efficiency and
improve their services to Nigerien entrepreneurs.
BDRN: Line of Credit and Technical Assistance
33.       A line of credit of US$12 million would be on-lent to BDRN by
Government to provide medium- and long-term financing for fixed investment
and permanent working capital in sound projects in sectors outside agriculture
and mining. US$2.5 million would be earmarked as a minimum share for small
scale enterprises (fixed assets of CFAF 50 million or less) and labor-intensive
projects (cost per job of CFAF 3.5 million or less). For these, BDRN would be
authorized to finance up to 90 percent of sub-project costs. For other
projects, BDRN would finance up to 70 percent of sub-project costs, their
estimated foreign exchange component. The line of credit would be on-lent by
Government to BDRN for 18 years including 3 years of grace. The on-lending
from government to BDRN would be at Central Bank conditions prevailing at
time of negotiations, i.e. 10.5 percent for most loans (including a foreign
exchange risk fee of 0.5 percent). The portion of the line of credit ear-
marked for small-scale enterprises and labor intensive subloans would be
passed on to BDRN at BCEAO's preferential rate of 8 percent (including a
foreign exchange risk fee of 0.5 percent). A commitment fee of 0.5 percent on
the undisbursed balance would apply to BDRN (Section 3.01 (b) - (e) draft
Credit Agreement and Schedule to Project Agreement). The terms of BDRN-s
subloans would range from three to 15 years with an average of nine years for
larger projects and six years for smaller projects. Grace periods would range



- 11 -
from one to three years. While complying with BCEAO's interest rate structure,
BDRN would charge a minimum of three percentage points above the relevant
re-discount rate, that is not less than 11 percent and 13.5 percent, respec-
tively (including the foreign exchange risk fee of 0.5 percent). Final
borrowers would also be charged a commitment fee of 0.5 percent. The in-
dividual free limit would be set at US$200,000 and the aggregate free limit at
US$4 million. Subproject appraisals would emphasize economic justification
including capital-labor balance, technology choices, value added and foreign
exchange savings or gains. All subprojects above the free limit would require
an economic rate of return analysis. For subprojects below the free limit,
BDRN would calculate the economic rate of return for the first subproject in
each branch of activity and thereafter only when there is significant change
in the conditions affecting that particular branch.
34.       A total of nine man-years of technical assistance would be provided
to BDRN: four man-years of advisers to the development department to consoli-
date earlier progress and complete training of the newly appointed development
manager and his staff; three man-years of a training and staff development
specialist and twelve man-months of short-term consultants for the organization
and equipment of BDRN's in-house training unit; and twelve man-months of a
financial systems specialist to advise BDRN on new procedures and computerized
data processing.
OPEN
35.       US$1.88 million would be passed on to OPEN as a grant to finance
operational improvements, the establishment of a technical assistance unit
to help local contractors and the construction of a new office building. --
The operational improvements would help OPEN assist entrepreneurs more effec-
tively and would include (a) two man-years of a senior adviser to the general
manager, specialized in strategy, organization and assistance to artisans;
(b) strategy and investment-related studies to (i) identify viable subsectors,
import substitution opportunities and export-oriented investments with par-
ticular focus on the potential of the Nigerian market, and (ii) determine
appropriate assistance to productive artisan groups; (c) the development
of training programs in bookkeeping, metal and woodworking, plumbing etc.
carried out in liaison with existing training institutions (approval of
individual agreements by IDA would be a condition of disbursement for this
item--Schedule 1, para. 4(c), draft Credit Agreement); and (d) limited
financing (US$100,000) for the acquisition of goods and services required to
enhance OPEN's operational efficiency. -- The proposed technical assistance
unit would help small contractors upgrade their operations and gain access to
markets through the provision of extension services, training and marketing
advice. Its design and budget would be submitted to IDA for review, and
approval would be a condition of disbursement for this component (Section
3.05, draft Credit Agreement). The project would support (i) professional
staffing needs during start-up (three years), (ii) basic furnishings and
supplies and (iii) the initial stock of rental equipment. -- OPEN has for
some time been operating in barely adequate quarters, and with its expected



- 12 -
expansion, the facilities will soon become completely inappropriate. The
project would therefore finance a new building. Drawings and estimates for a
simple structure (CFAF 175 million) to be constructed by small local contrac-
tors are being prepared by OPEN. They would be reviewed by IDA prior to con-
struction (Section 3.05, and Schedule 1, para. 4(b), draft Credit Agreement).
CMAN
36.       The proposed project would consolidate CMAN's experience, improve
its production and marketing activities and strengthen its management.
It would help establish separate training facilities and provide equipment,
necessary supplies and trainee scholarships. Drawings, estimates and proposed
equipment for a training center have been reviewed and are acceptable to
IDA. It would assist in the development of support services for in-house and
independent leather artisans including initial working capital, skins and
materials purchases, promotional and marketing activities, and start-up loans
for independent artisans. Finally, it would provide a technical assistance
team for the period 1982-1985 (seven man-years) consisting of a senior advisor
and two leather technicians/trainers. Acceptable by-laws for CMAN would have
to be adopted by end-December 1982, and CMAN would be asked to provide audited
financial statements for fiscal year 1981, establish an adequate accounting
system, and to submit to IDA a three-year action plan and budget for the
1982-85 period. These would be conditions of disbursement for this item
(Section 3.06 and Schedule 1, para 4(d), draft Credit Agreement).
Technical Assi½tance
37.       The IDA credit would finance a total of 22 man-years of technical
assistance at a total cost of US$236,800 and at an estimated net-of-tax cost
of US$6,900 per man-month, including salaries, allowances and overhead, plus
local expenditures and subsistence of US$2,500 per man-month in the case of
short-term consultants.
Project Execution
38.       Although each component would be implemented by BDRN, OPEN and
CMAN respectively, BDRN will coordinate overall project implementation and
centralize withdrawal applications for submission to IDA. In addition to
its audited statements, BDRN would submit semi-annual progress reports to
IDA, including financial and economic information on approved projects, lists
of term borrowings as well as implementation of the staff development program.
OPEN would submit its accounts, annual report and budget plus a semi-annual
progress report on project implementation. IDA would approve (i) the terms of
reference, resumes and proposals for strategy studies; (ii) OPEN's proposal
for the technical assistance unit for contractors; (iii) the drawings and
estimates for OPEN's office building; and (iv) the training programs carried
out jointly by OPEN and other training institutions. CMAN would submit its
audited accounts and quarterly reports on project implementation (Section 3.04
and 3.05, draft Credit Agreement).



- 13 -
Project Cost and Financing
39.       Total project costs are estimated at US$21.3 million equivalent,
including taxes of US$1.8 million. Foreign exchange costs would be US$15.5
million (73 percent of total project cost). The proposed IDA credit of SDR
14 million (US$16 million equivalent) would cover the foreign exchange costs
of the project and US$0.5 million of local expenditures for small scale
subprojects and some technical assistance expenditures. Project costs and the
proposed financing plan are set out in the Credit and Project Summary. As
indicated in Part I, current economic circumstances--in particular the sharp
and unexpected drop in uranium revenues--justify the financing of local costs.
Procurement and Disbursement
40.       BDRN would follow its usual procurement procedures for development
loans which have been reviewed by IDA and are satisfactory. The purchase of
equipment and goods under the OPEN and CMAN components will be in small lots
not suitable for international competitive bidding; however, OPEN and CMAN
will follow local procurement procedures acceptable to IDA. The proceeds from
the IDA credit would be disbursed as follows:
(i) For the line of credit: 100 percent of foreign expenditures
and 85 percent of local expenditures up to the amount of
BDRN's subloan as authorized by the Bank;
(ii) For the experts and the training program in BDRN: 100 percent
of the foreign exchange cost;
(iii) For goods and services to OPEN and CMAN: 100 percent of the
total cost (net of taxes); and
(iv) For OPEN's building: 70 percent of the total cost.
Disbursements would be fully documented.
Benefits and Justification
41.       The proposed project will continue and deepen the effort initiated
under the Industrial and Artisan Sector Employment Creation Project to
diversify the economic base of Niger. The support to BDRN will continue to
improve the ability of this institution to help generate more viable projects
outside the agriculture and mining sectors. Through continued improvement of
OPEN, the project will assist in the promotion and improved performance of
Nigerien entrepreneurs. The continued commitment to CMAN will help upgrade
the skills of potentially viable artisan groups, providing them with stable
employment as a result of the marketing, training and administrative services
it will provide. Finally, the attempt to promote the indigenous construction
industry through a technical assistance unit in OPEN will contribute to
lowering the costs and improving the quality of construction, and will provide
employment opportunities for semi-skilled labor, and develop viable indigenous
enterprises in a sector where foreign enterprises are still dominant. From



- 14 -
the first project we learned that employment creation targets were difficult
to achieve in the artisan sector. Therefore the objective of this second
project concerning CMAN will be primarily to upgrade the skills of assisted
artisans. On the other hand, the investment creation effort would generate
about 300 jobs in small and labor-intensive enterprises.
Risks
42.       There are no significant risks.  Project-specific risks are mainly
of a managerial nature, especially for CMAN and OPEN. For that reason,
particular attention will be paid to institutional strategy (OPEN), management
capabilities (CMAN) and adequate monitoring. Being a follow-up operation, the
project will draw on the experience acquired and the rapport built up during
the last project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Niger
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
the Banque de Developpement du Niger and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
44.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement and Project Agreement
of special interest are listed in Section III of Annex III. A special condi-
tion of effectiveness of the IDA Credit is the signing of a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Borrower and BDRN.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF March 1, 1982 1/
Credit 612 - Third Highway Project; US$15.6 Million; Credit of March 5,
1976; Effectiveness Date: January 31, 1977; Closing
Date: December 30, 1981 extended to June 30, 1983
This project includes: (a) a four-year program of periodic mainten-
ance, including procurement of equipment and training of specialized public
work staff, (b) construction and improvement of the Zinder-Nigerian border
road (113 km) and of the Maradi-Nigerian border road (40 km) and (c) con-
sulting services for supervision of road construction and a survey of the
domestic construction industry. Construction of the Maradi-Nigerian border
road was completed ahead of schedule and the Zinder-Nigerian border road is
expected to be completed shortly. A study of the domestic construction
industry is currently underway, as are studies to prepare a proposed fourth
project.
Credit 800 - Forestry Project; US$4.5 million; Credit of June 7, 1978;
Effectiveness Date: February 7, 1979; Closing Date:
December 30, 1981 extended to June 30, 1982
This project will assist Government in its efforts to establish 400
ha of pilot irrigated plantations and 700 ha of pilot rainfed tree plantations;
improve the rural forestry activities of the Forestry Department; finance a
training program in extension services; provide assistance to research and
a workshop maintenance unit. The Project Management Unit created within the
Forestry Department to assist with coordinating and monitoring project activi-
ties is fully operational and project implementation is almost completed.
Credit 809 - Industrial and Artisan Sector Employment Creation Project;
US$5.0 million; Credit of June 7, 1978; Effectiveness Date:
February 7, 1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
This project aims at assisting Government in the promotion of more
labor intensive employment creation in Niger's industrial and artisan sectors
while strengthening the sector's institutional infrastructure, by providing
a line of credit, training and technical assistance to BDRN, including the
development of a bank management training program of the Ecole Nationale
d'Administration, financial and technical assistance for creation of OPEN, the
new agency created under the project to provide technical assistance and
training for local enterpreneurs, and by assisting the Artisans Center to
improve the productivity and employment of artisans affiliated with the
Center. Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report problems
which are being encountered, and the action taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Credit 851 - Irrigation Project; US$15.0 Million; Credit of February 15,
1979; Effectiveness Date: October 12, 1979; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
The project aims to assist the Government in expanding cereal and
vegetable production along the Niger River through development of a 1,550 ha
polder; providing agricultural development services on neighbouring irrigation
schemes (1,215 ha) and dryland farming plots (9,000 ha); and in creating the
necessary institutional framework for the implementation of its irrigation
development program through establishment of a national agency (ONAHA) which
would integrate and strengthen the activities of construction and management
of the irrigation schemes. The project will also finance the preparation of a
feasibility study for a nearby polder, as well as the services of a financial
coordinator to be attached to the Ministry of Rural Development to assist in
accounting and financial management of the various IDA-financed agricultural
projects in Niger. Due to initial delays in credit signing and in the award
of contracts for equipment and engineering services, construction of the
irrigation works started in March 1980. The construction of the first 230 ha
was completed in August 1981 and they are presently under irrigation. The
completion of an additional 900 ha is foreseen by July. Completion of
project beyond that will depend on a survey of recently detected salinity
problems.
Credit 885 - Livestock Project; US$12.0 Million; Credit of April 27,
1979; Effectiveness Date: October 12, 1979; Closing
Date: March 31, 1985
A combination of health and productivity services is being made
available to herd owners in the pastoral and cropping zones. An innovative
approach is being launched by establishing Associations of Pastoralists,
legally recognized cooperative entities based on existing social groups.
Members of these Associations will have access to a greater range of health
services, new forms of credit for backgrounding and breeding, improvements to
existing wells and extension of watering points and advice on range management.
The project is also providing assistance to the Livestock Department to
improve competence in delivery of productivity services. Project implementa-
tion proceeds satisfactorily, particularly in drug distribution for which a
self-financing network of 190 paraveterinary works has been set up.
Credit 886 - Feeder Road Project; US$10 Million; Credit of April 27,
1979; Effectiveness Date: December 10, 1979; Closing
Date: June 30, 1984
The project will improve 1,000 km of feeder roads which support
Government-s agricultural program and create an appropriate structure for the
execution of comprehensive feeder road programs. The project will finance
highway construction equipment and spare parts; labor, materials and supplies
for the improvement program; offices for and technical assistance to the newly
created Feeder Road Technical Section to aid in implementing and monitoring
the improvement program and in training technicians, mechanics, equipment
operators and training officers. Equipment procurement is complete. Follow-
ing an intervention by the President of Niger construction standards have been
raised, and the construction target lowered from 1,000 kms to about 800 kms.

Credit 967 - Dosso Agricultural Development Project;
US$20.0 Million; Credit of June 12, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: February 25, 1981;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985
The project comprises a five-year program intended to increase
farm incomes and improve the welfare and standard of living of the rural
population of Dosso Province and to build up an extension service through:
the introduction of improved farming practices for rainfed cereals, cowpeas
and groundnuts; the improvement of vaccination coverage, delivery of drugs
and feed supplements and animal husbandry practices for beef cattle and
work oxen; the construction of small-scale irrigation schemes for 200 ha of
bottomlands; the introduction of a Training and Visit extension system; the
strengthening of the farm input and implement supply system; and applied
research. Training, extension, input supply and credit services would be made
accessible to about 80,000 farm families, of whom 25,000 are expected to adopt
the recommended improved practices. In spite of one year delay in start up
period input distribution targets have been met both in agriculture and
livestock. Organizational conflicts between project management and executing
agencies may still frustrate these results for the next campaign.
Credit 1026 - Second Maradi Rural Development Project; US$16.7 Million;
Credit of June 6, 1980; Effectiveness Date:
February 26, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1985
The project follows up on the First Maradi Project. It includes
the expansion of improved agricultural practices in rainfed farming areas;
training of extension staff, young farmers and blacksmiths; agricultural
credit; development of irrigation potential in Maradi; applied agricultural
research; seed multiplication; functional literacy and health proposals.
Some cost overruns are anticipated on the land development component as a
result of omissions and underestimations.
Credit 1151 - Education Project; SDR 17.3 Million; Credit of June 19,
1981; Effectiveness Date: June 30, 1982;
Closing Date: December 31, 1987
The project comprises a five-year program to improve educational
planning and the preparation of education projects, planning for civil service
upgrading and the training of rural development workers. It includes (a) tech-
nical assistance and fellowships to assist in educational planning and project
preparation; (b) technical assistance to the Ministry of Civil Service and
Labor to establish a training directorate, review the needs for upgrading and
formulate pilot upgrading programs for the public administration; (c) the
final phase of expansion and upgrading of an agricultural technician training
institute at Kolo; (d) the development of a new animal production training
school at Kolo; and (e) technical assistance and operating costs for project
management.
