Both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated\n            unsatisfactory, given that not enough attention was paid by\n            the Bank, to the manner in which the Government was\n            implementing its 1994 Private Power Policy. Lessons apply\n            likewise as those drawn from the first operation, among\n            which it is suggested that once independent power producers\n            (IPPs) start operations in a power system, it would be\n            advantageous that an integrated utility sector be unbundled,\n            in order to introduce competition; additionally, an\n            automatic indexation formulae should be set, to protect the\n            utility's purchasing power from fuel costs, currency\n            devaluation, and the cost of purchased power. The support to\n            privatized power infrastructure boards, and organizations,\n            may have had the unintended effect of enabling vested\n            interest in the sector to \"capture and stall\"\n            structural changes envisaged in the 1992 Strategic Plan for\n            privatization, i.e., the single buyer model had risks in\n            terms of preserving the role of the sector ministry in\n            investment decisions, shielding financiers from market\n            risks, and government interference in electricity wholesale\n            trading. Other issues address international competitive\n            bidding, which should increase transparency, and reduce\n            corruption, and allow flexibility for Bank financing, which\n            would in turn, enable the inclusion of a capital markets, or\n            finance specialist to ensure that financing issues\n            associated with creating an infrastructure fund, are\n            properly addressed."}, "docdt": "2001-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
