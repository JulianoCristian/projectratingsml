 Alleviation Project are to increase income earning\n            opportunities among the poor and to improve the nutrition\n            status of children under three years of age and pregnant and\n            lactating mothers. The project will assist the newly created\n            Janasaviya Trust Fund (the Trust). The Trust will manage\n            four funds: (a) a Credit Fund to lend to partner\n            organizations (POs) which will on-lend to the poor in a\n            manner prescribed by the trust at interest rates which will\n            make the credit fund operations self-supporting: (b) a Human\n            Resources Development Fund for promoting the productive use\n            of credit and for developing the lending capacity of POs;\n            (c) a Rural Works Fund for building economically viable\n            infrastructure and creating wage employment; and (d) a\n            Nutrition Fund for reducing the proportion of wasting and\n            stunting in children and reducing the incidence of low birth\n            weight and the prevalence of maternal malnutrition. In\n            addition, the project will support an Employment and Poverty\n            Policy Unit in the Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation."}, "docdt": "1991-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
