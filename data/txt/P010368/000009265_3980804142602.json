Project for Sri Lanka was unsatisfactory. The project only\n            partially achieved its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was partially successful,\n            sustainability is unlikely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was deficient.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            implementing poverty alleviation activities through NGOs\n            operating under an apex semi-government organization is an\n            extremely complex and demanding task. Second, the economic\n            rationale and technical feasibility of project components\n            needs to be analyzed and developed with care. Third, pilot\n            projects, as a basis for testing strategies and approaches,\n            can play a central role in facilitating overall project\n            success. Fourth, a high quality and effective MIS, including\n            regular beneficiary surveys, is essential to ensure\n            efficient project implementation and achievement of\n            objectives. Fifth, it is important to exploit synergy\n            effects. Sixth, it is important to provide training to NGOs\n            and POs in poverty alleviation activities. Finally, the\n            Government's broad strategy for poverty alleviation in\n            Sri Lanka underwent a major shift in emphasis mid-way\n            through the project's lifespan."}, "docdt": "1998-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
