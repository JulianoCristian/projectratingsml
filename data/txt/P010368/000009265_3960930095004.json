The project will assist the newly created\n            Janasaviya Trust Fund (the Trust). The Trust will manage\n            four funds: (a) a Credit Fund to lend to partner\n            organizations (POs) which will on-lend to the poor in a\n            manner prescribed by the trust at interest rates which will\n            make the credit fund operations self-supporting: (b) a Human\n            Resources Development Fund for promoting the productive use\n            of credit and for developing the lending capacity of POs;\n            (c) a Rural Works Fund for building economically viable\n            infrastructure and creating wage employment; and (d) a\n            Nutrition Fund for reducing the proportion of wasting and\n            stunting in children and reducing the incidence of low birth\n            weight and the prevalence of maternal malnutrition.
