The first request was submitted by\n            representatives of the indigenous community of the Pueblo\n            Naso, several individual members of the community and\n            representatives of some community organizations (the\n            \"first Requesters\"). The second request (the\n            \"second request\") was submitted by leaders of the\n            \"Congreso de area anexa de la provincia de Bocas del\n            Toro\" on behalf of the communities that live in the\n            so-called \"beas anexas\"' to the Comarca\n            Ngobe-Bugle in the Bocas del Toro province, Panama (the\n            \"second Requesters\"). The first and second\n            Requesters generally claim that they and the community that\n            they represent have been harmed and are likely to suffer\n            further harm because the Bank has violated its own\n            operational policies and procedures in the design and\n            implementation of the Project. In response to the first\n            Requesters, management states that it supports the creation\n            of a Comarca for the Naso territory. One of the Project\n            objectives provided precisely for the preparation, in\n            consultations with the Naso, of a bill and charter\n            establishing the Naso Tjer Comarca, the highest aspiration\n            of the Naso people for their territory. In response to the\n            second request management states that it agrees with the\n            second Requesters that the annex areas, which are\n            territories of the Comarca Ngobe-Bugle (created in 1997)\n            outside the Comarca's core area, were not delimited and\n            shares their concerns about this problem. Management also\n            agrees that the project \"has not fully demonstrated the\n            principle\" of informed participation and consultation\n            with respect to the delimitation of these annex areas. The\n            panel confirmed that the World Bank was aware of concerns of\n            both the Naso and the Ngobe-Bugle people since long before\n            the submission of the requests for inspection. The panel is\n            therefore satisfied that the request \"does assert that\n            the subject matter has been brought to management's\n            attention and that, in the Requesters' view, management\n            has failed to respond adequately demonstrating that it has\n            followed or is taking steps to follow the Bank's\n            policies and procedures."}, "docdt": "2009-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
