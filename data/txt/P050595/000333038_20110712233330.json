{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Land Administration\n            Project for Panama were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: sequencing of reforms, with initial\n            efforts focusing on the technical reforms and related legal\n            and institutional changes, has shown to be a more effective\n            approach towards modernization and sustainability of land\n            administration systems. Addressing the political and\n            institutional aspects of land tenure issues, particularly as\n            they relate to Indigenous Peoples, is complex. Operations\n            for consolidation of indigenous lands should be embedded in\n            and ideally preceded by a robust policy dialogue related to\n            indigenous peoples' land rights' regularization.\n            The project attempted and to some extent succeeded in\n            opening up such dialogue, but was an insufficient instrument\n            to do so in a comprehensive way. As exemplified in this and\n            other recent land administration projects in the region, the\n            effective integration of the cadastre and registry functions\n            and data into a common technical platform (even without\n            requiring a single agency) is extremely difficult. This\n            institutional rivalry tends to be very entrenched and there\n            is very little external pressure to overcome it. Although\n            land administration projects have the potential to yield\n            considerable benefits to the poor, through more secure land\n            tenure, this Project has not been able to show that these\n            benefits necessarily translate into poverty reduction. This\n            kind of project needs to be evaluated more in terms of its\n            impact on public governance (and possibly decentralization)\n            issues. Land administration projects, even under more\n            simplified designs, require intensive and specialized\n            supervision. This project shows that the range of challenges\n            that emerge during implementation is very broad indeed. For\n            Bank supervision to be effective, land administration\n            project teams must include land policy and technical\n            experts, lawyers, social scientists, institutional\n            specialists, environmental specialists, and possibly others."}, "docdt": "2010-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
