                                       Project Paper


1. IntroductoryStatement

   This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce the
   following changes in the Panama Land Administration Project (Loan 7045-PAN;
   P050595) and any accompanying amendments to the project's legal documents. The
   original loan o f US$47.9 million was approved by the Board o f Executive Directors
   on January 16, 2001. The project became effective on July 19, 2001, with a closing
   date o f September 30, 2006. The project has suffered significant implementation
   delays, resultinginan unsatisfactory rating with respect to the development objectives.
   The delays were largely the result of weak leadership (an interim Coordinator for the
   first 18 months) and limited budgetary allocations. The major modifications being
   proposed include: (i)a narrowing o f project scope (25-30 percent) and cost (about 20
   percent); (ii)the creation of a new component to separate monitoring and evaluation
   activities; (iii)
                  the application o f the new financingparameters for Panama, which were
   approved on December 20, 2004; (iv) an increase o f the authorized allocation o f the
   Special Account; (v) the reallocation o f expenditure categories; and (vi) the use o f a
   financial administrator. The proposed changes would provide the Government o f
   Panama with improved implementation and financing modalities and an appropriate
   timeline to allow for the successful completion of project implementation and full
   attainment ofthe revisedPDO.

2. Backgroundand Reasonsfor Restructuring

  Project design and scope: The Project Development Objectives are to: a) promote
   equitable access to land and improve land tenure security by providing land
   administration services in the project areas, and b) enhance natural resources
  conservation through the consolidation o f SINAP (National Protected Areas System)
  and Indigenous Peoples territories. The original project designhadthree components:
   1) land policy, legal and institutional framework, and project monitoring; 2) land
  regularization activities; and 3) consolidation o f protected areas and indigenous
  territories.

  Performance to date: During its first four years, the project has suffered significant
  implementationdelays resultingmainly from:

  a) Fiscal space constraints and limited availability o f counterpart funds. These
      constraints affected the disbursement o f the loan and the ability o f the executing
      agencies to execute the project at the expected rate. Initially, it was expected that
      the project would disburse between US$8 million and US$10 million per year,
      while inpractice it has only disbursedon average US$3 million per year over the
      last three years;



                                                                                         1

 b) Weak operational leadership, largely due to the failure to appoint a permanent
    Project Coordinator (the project operated with an interim Technical Coordinator
    from July 2001 until early 2003, and another interimCoordinator from September
    2004 until mid-January 2006);
 c) Inability to approve key legal reforms that would significantly simplify land
    regularization procedures and allow for massive landtitling; and
 d) Ineffectiveinter-institutionalcoordination.

 The project has been rated unsatisfactory with respect to implementation for two
 years and with respect to the development objectives for almost a year. Many o f the
 output targets (especially inComponent 2 - Land regularization -which i s the core o f
the project) are lagging behind. As o f March 15, 2006, loan disbursements stood at
US$13.3 million (25 percent o f the total loan amount), with a balance o f US$34.6
million undisbursed. While important measures to address the problem o f slow
implementation, contracting, and management have been recently taken, such as
larger budgetary allocation and appointment o f a permanent Project Coordinator, the
PDO and output targets will not be achieved in the remaining six months o f project
implementation. A restructuring o f the project, making financing arrangements more
flexible, and an extension o f the closing date are needed. The Government o f Panama
and the Bank are faced with two alternatives to the proposed restructuring: (i)        to
significantly reduce the scope o f the project within the current time frame, or (ii)  to
cancel the loan.

During the most recent project supervision mission (November 14-19, 2005), the
government proposed a restructuring o f the project, summarized below, which would
allow it to overcome the difficulties encounteredinterms o f financing and operational
modalities, and to continue to support improvements in the quality o f land
administration services. The action plan agreed during this mission provides a solid
framework for achieving the (slightly revised) PDO and reduced (by about 25-30
percent) output targets.

The proposed restructuring aims to accomplish two main outcomes: (i) narroweda
but more realistic project size and scope and (ii)     putting in place more effective
financing and operational modalities. This restructuring was requested by the
Government o f Panama which has demonstrated a renewed commitment to the
project, indicated by (a) a significantly higher budgetary allocationfor the project, (b)
appointment o f a permanent Project Coordinator, and (c) political commitment to
enact substantive legal and regulatory reforms. The proposed restructuring, described
below, reduces the bottlenecks that were constraining the project in the past and
capitalizes on the Government's renewedcommitment to land administration reforms.
Without such a restructuring, however, some o f the output indicators (e.g., titling o f
rural areas) could likely not be attained fully and the achievement o f the revisedPDO
would be at risk, though still possible.




                                                                                       2

3. ProposedChanges

     Project design and scope: The restructuring proposes a narrowing o f the project's
      scope, while simplifying the two PDOs into a single objective'. Other significant
      modifications beingproposed include the revision of targets to better reflect the PDO,
      the creation of a new component to separate quality control and monitoring activities,
      andthe application o fthe new financing parameters for Panama, which were approved
     by the Board on December 20, 2004. Specifically, land regularization targets in rural
      areas would be reduced by 30 percent, while inurban areas they would be reduced by
      25 percent. Project Administration and M&E (which was previously included under
      Component 1) would now be a separatecomponent.

     As a result of the narrowed scope of the project, the total costs would be reduced by
      about 20 percent (for a total project cost o f US$58.57 million - see Annex 1 for
     detailed cost structure by component). The total loan amount would remain
     unchanged as it would be accompanied by a reduction o f the amount o f required
     government counterpart funding.

     Implementation arrangements: To improve the operational modalities o f the project,
     the following changes are being proposed: a) strengthening the permanent Project
     Coordinator's decision-making power; b) making the Superior Council and the
     Technical Operating Committee more effective in coordinating the various co-
     executing agencies; c) improving resource allocation for institutional strengthening
     among the agencies involved, especially at the local level; and d) strengthening the
     provincial Technical OperationUnits' participation inthe technical decisions that affect
     project implementation at the local level. Inaddition, the Ministry o f Housing (MIVI)
     would be included as co-executing agency because o f its role in approving the urban
     cadastralplansbefore they are registered.

     New expenditure categories and financing parameters: To facilitate disbursements
     and expedite project implementation, the new financing parameters approved for
     Panama on December 20, 2004 would be adopted. All categories would be financed
     up to 100 percent by loan proceeds, except operating costs which would be at 90
     percent after countersignature o fthe amended LoanAgreement.

     The proposed changes to expenditure categories reflect the lessons learned over the
     last four years o fproject implementation. Specifically:
     0   The civil works category would be increased by US$0.83 million (from US$l.50
         million to US2.331 million) to finance small additional renovation works in
         central government facilities (in the national Directorate o f Agrarian Reform and

'The   project development objectives, as formulated inthe PAD, are to: a) promote equitable access to land
and improve land tenure security by providing land administration services in the project areas, and b)
enhance natural resources conservation through the consolidation of SINAP (National Protected Areas
System) and Indigenous Peoples territories. The reformulated project development objective is to:
modernize the land administration system, including priority protected areas and Indigenous Peoples
Territories.



                                                                                                         3

    the Cadastre Office) and municipal offices to allow for the installation o f the
    Integrated Cadastre-Registry System (SIICAR);
0   The goods category would be increased by US$0.72 million (from US$8 million
    to US$8.72 million) for the purchase o f additional equipment for the installation
    o f the SIICAR and a new camera for the National Geographic Institute (IGN);
0   The consultants' services category would be increased by about US$2.6 million
    (from US$15.85 million to US$18.42 million) to reflect the shift in the nature o f
    services from land regularization services (Category 3, which would be decreased
    by an equivalent amount-from          US$14.75 million to US$12.18 million) to
    consultants'    services (Category 4),      because recent experience with land
    regularization showed the need for more consultations, ex ante land tenure
    studies, andpublic dissemination activities;
0   The training category would be decreased by about US$0.5 million (from
    US$1.90 million to US$1.41 million) as a result o f savings inthe implementation
    o f these activities; and
0   The operating costs category would be increased by US$1.16 million (from
    US$3.20 million to US$4.36 million) to reflect the three-year extension o f the
    closing date.

As a result, the unallocated funds (US$2.221 million) would be usedto revise upward
the works, goods, and operating costs categories. The proposed changes to
expenditure categories and financial percentages are shown inAnnex 2.

The new financing parameters would significantly reduce the government's
counterpart contribution. Similarly,      the proposed reallocation o f expenditure
categories better reflects the revised scope o f the project. Inlight o f the government's
overall fiscal constraints, the reallocation o f expenditure categories and the change in
financing parameters increase effectiveness o f project implementation. Inaddition, to
facilitate implementation, the size of the Authorized Allocation o f the Special
Account would be increased to US$4.79 million (equivalent to 10percent o f the total
loan amount). Neither Panama nor this project i s subject to an ongoing suspension o f
disbursements, and no audit reports are outstanding for the project. The Financial
Management rating for this project i s Satisfactory.

Financial administrator: The government has been using UNDP as a financial
administrator for the project, financed entirely with counterpart funds. As i s the
practice with other similar projects, the revised Loan Agreement specifies that the
Borrower may enter into an agreement with a financial administrator, under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank.

Procurement: At the government's request, the Bank's 2004 Procurement Guidelines
would apply after countersignature o f the amended Loan Agreement, and new
procurement methods would be incorporated inthe Procurement Schedule.

Extension of the closing date: The new implementation schedule requires a three-year
extension, until December 31, 2009. Based on our assessment o f the action plan



                                                                                        4

    submitted by the government for restructuring the project, we are satisfied that all
    criteria for extension have been met. These are:

    (a) This is thej r s t extension soughtfor theproject. The option o f a shorter extension
   with possible hrther extension was considered and rejected because it would be
    disruptive to project implementation and have undue transaction costs. Based on the
    findings o f the last supervision mission (November 14-19, 2005), a three-year
    extension i s justified inthis case.

   (b) Theproject objectives continue to be achievable. The budget and action plan for
   the remainder o f the project are consistent with the revised PDO and output indicators
   (Annex 3-Project Design Summary).

   (c) Theperformance of the Borrower and the other project implementation agencies
   has improved. During the past two years, implementation performance has been
   unsatisfactory. Important measures to address the problem have recently been taken,
   in particular the appointment of a permanent Project Coordinator in January 2006,
   and signs o f improvement are already noticeable, such as the clear acceleration in
   project implementation. However, these efforts are not sufficient, and a restructuring
   o f the project i s needed. The restructuring includes clear actions to ensure improved
   effectiveness o f the current operational and implementation arrangements. These
   include: a) strengthening the permanent Project Coordinator's decision-making power;
   b) making the Superior Council and the Technical Operating Committee more
   effective in coordinating the various co-executing agencies; c) improving resource
   allocation for institutional strengthening among the agencies involved, especially at the
   local level; and d) strengthening the provincial Technical OperationUnits' participation
   inthetechnical decisions that affect project implementationat the local level.

   (d) The action plan is satisfactory to the Bank. During the November 2005
   supervision mission, the Bank and the government discussed the action plan for
   completion o f the project over the extendedperiod.

   The changes described in this section would require an amendment to the Loan
   Agreement, which has beenprepared.

4. Analysis

   The proposed changes would not have any major effect on the original economic,
   financial, technical, institutional, environmental, or social aspects o f the project as
  appraised, because the design o f the operation would essentially be maintained. The
  proposed restructuring makes the project's scope and size, and corresponding PDO,
  more realistic and attainable. In light o f this, the project's overall impact would be
  less than that originally anticipated. It is estimated that the expectedbenefits would be
  reduced by an amount comparable to the narrowed project scope (about 25-30
  percent lower). The expected Economic Rate o f Return (ERR) would not be altered
  by much, since at appraisal it was estimated using only landregularization activities.
  The reduction in scope and the application o f the new financing parameters would


                                                                                           5

   reduce the project's counterpart funding requirements. The project's technical
   objective (the integration o f the registry and cadastre functions under one common
   framework) remains sound and achievable. Finally, the project would maintain its
   positive social impact through the issuance o f land titles (urban and rural), the
   demarcation and consolidation o f indigenous territories, and the establishment o f
   alternative conflict resolution mechanisms.

   Similarly, the environmental category o f the project would be unchanged (Category
   "By')and no new safeguard policies would be triggered. The restructured project area
   would remain within the original project area.

5. ExpectedOutcomes

   The proposed restructuring, the resulting narrowing in scope, and more effective
   operational arrangements are expected to facilitate achievement o f the revised PDO.
   The reductions in funding for each component would be mirrored by proportional
   reductions in expected outputs. It i s expected that the number o f surveyed parcels to
   be titled would be about 25-30 percent lower than at appraisal, reflecting a more
   realistic target than previously estimated. The land regularization component would
   benefit 50,000 rural parcels (issuance o f 12,000 titles) and approximately 60,000
   urban parcels (issuance o f 15,000 titles), as opposed to 75,000 rural parcels (issuance
   o f 50,000 titles) and about 80,000 urban parcels (issuance o f 54,000 titles) in the
   original estimates.

   Despite a reduction in its size, the project is expected to have a similar impact on the
   PDOoutcome indicators, revised as follows (see Annex 3, Project Design Summary):

   0   24 hours and US$2 per transaction required for titling andregistering a land
       parcel;
   0   70 percent o f users o f SIICAR satisfied;
   0   Existing land occupations infive protected areas regularized;
   0   Shared administration plan implemented inthe Ngobe-Bug16 area

   Inthe original design, broad and un-quantified outcome indicators were mixed with
   output indicators. The revised outcome indicators better measure the efficiency and
   public benefit o f a modernized land administration system in Panama. In terms o f
   component outputs, the indicator related to the establishment o f alternative conflict
   resolution mechanisms has been reclassified as an output indicator o f Component 1.
   Those o f Component 2 have been recalibrated based on the new project scope. And
   those o f Component 3 have been clarified, namely, nine management plans for the
   other protected areas must be completed.

6. Benefitsand Risks

   The risks that couldjeopardize the achievements o f the restructuredproject objectives
  remain essentially the same as the original design. The risk o f inadequate legal and



                                                                                         6

   regulatory reforms to expedite land titling (i.e., a law that would allow massive-ex
   officio2--land    titling, and the executive decree that would significantly simplify the
   regularization procedures) i s substantial, but this would affect project outputs under
   component 2, not overall project outcomes (PDO indicators). In other words, with
   limited legal reforms, the Project Development Objective can still be achieved, but
   the rate o f project implementation under Component 2 would probably be reduced.
   The Government o f Panama has made key legal reforms an important aspect o f its
   national development agenda. The government i s currently considering two parallel
   reform initiatives, namely (i)   a draft bill that would allow massive landtitling (Ley de
   Titulacidn de Ojcio), and (ii)broader reform bill that, in addition to massive land
                                      a
   titling, would also create a new institutional reform framework (Ley del Instituto
  Nacional de Tierras). The government expectation is that significant legal reforms,
   which would in any case include important changes for massive land titling, will be
  presented to the Assembly between April and June 2006. The government expects to
  have broad support inthe Assembly for these reforms.

  Finally, the Government has agreed on a budget allocation for the remainder o f the
  project which matches the proposed restructured counterpart funding requirements
  and would allow for considerably more rapid implementation.

  No additional environmental or social risks deriving from the restructuring o f the
  project have been identified. However, under the restructured project, measures to
  mitigate some o f the risks originally identified - such as difficulties inthe payment o f
  titling services, land conflicts, and weak local participation - would be strengthened
  through support for legal and technical assistance, more effective information
  campaigns,       streamlined regularization procedures, and more efficient inter-
  institutional coordination mechanisms.




The regularization ofparcels would be carried out systematically by area, rather than ondemand on a
case by case basis.
