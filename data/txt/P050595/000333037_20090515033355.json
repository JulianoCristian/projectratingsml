The first request was\n            submitted on February 25, 2009 by representatives of the\n            indigenous community of Pueblo Naso, several individual\n            members of the community, and representatives of some\n            community organizations. The second request was presented to\n            the Panel on March 17, 2009, by leaders of the on behalf of\n            the communities that live in the so-called annex areas to\n            the Comarca Ngobe-Bugle in the Bocas Del Toro province,\n            Panama. The panel registered the requests and notified the\n            Board of Executive Directors respectively on March 11, 2009\n            and March 20, 2009. Management submitted its response to\n            both requests on April 20, 2009. In accordance with the\n            resolution establishing the inspection panel, the\n            panel's eligibility report and recommendation is due on\n            May 19, 2009. However, in light of the general elections\n            held in Panama on May 3, 2009, and after informing the\n            Executive Director representing Panama, the panel is of the\n            view that the interests of all parties concerned would be\n            better served by postponing the customary eligibility visit\n            for a few weeks. In view of the foregoing, the panel\n            requests that the deadline for the preparation of its\n            eligibility report and recommendation on whether the issues\n            raised in the requests warrant an investigation be postponed\n            to June 19, 2009. The panel has consulted with management on\n            this matter."}, "docdt": "2009-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
