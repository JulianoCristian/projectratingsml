                  Panama: Land Administration Project (Loan No. 7045-PAN)

                               Request for Extension for Submission of
                           Inspection Panel Report and Recommendation




     The Inspection Panel has received two Requests for Inspection raising similar issues on non-
     compliance and harm in relation to the Panama: Land Administration Project (in Spanish,
     P~.ogranzaNacional de A~l~~zinistraciot?de Tierras-PRONAT).            The first Request was submitted
     on February 25, 2009 by representatives of the indigenous conllllunity of Pueblo Naso, several
     individual members of the community, and representatives of some community organizations.
     The second Request was presented to the Panel on March 17, 2009, by leaders of the "Congreso
     de Area A/~ex-ade la Provit~ciaDe Bocas Del Toro" on behalf of the con~munitiesthat live in the
     so-called Annex Areas to the Comarca Ngobe-Bugle in the Bocas del Toro Province, Panama.

     The Panel registered the Requests and notified the Board of Execiltive Directors respectively on
     March 1 1, 2009 and March 20, 2009. Management sub~nittedits Response to both Requests on
     April 20, 2009.

     In accordance with the Resolution establishing thc I~~spcctionPancl, the Panel's Eligibility
     Report and Recommendation is due on May 19, 2009. However, in light of the general elections
     held in Panama on May 3, 2009, and after inforllling the Executive Director representing
     Panama, the Panel is of the view that the interests of all parties concerned would be better served

by postponing the customary eligibility visit for a few weeks. In view of the foregoing, the Pancl
requests that the deadline for the preparation of its Eligibility Report and Recommendation on
wlicther the issues raised in the Requests warrant an investigation be postponed to June 19,
2009. Thc Panel has consulted with Management on this matter.

Consistent wit11 prior similar reconiniendations approved by the Board, in the absence of
objection by the Board of Executive Directors, the Panel will so advise the Requesters and
Management.
