Reflecting the reduced scope\n            of the operation, the project's total cost will fall by\n            about 20 percent with a corresponding reduction in\n            counterpart funding. The total loan amount remains\n            unchanged. Other significant modifications include: 1)\n            revising targets to better reflect the project development\n            objectives; 2) creating a new component to separate quality\n            control and monitoring activities; and 3) applying new\n            financing parameters for Panama. With regard to\n            implementation arrangements, the Ministry of Housing will be\n            included as co-executing agency, given its active role in\n            key project activities. Finally, the restructuring aims to:\n            1) in crease the Special Account to 10 percent of the total\n            loan amount; (2) reallocate expenditure categories; and (3)\n            use a financial administrator for the project."}, "docdt": "2006-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
