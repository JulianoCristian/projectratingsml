The first request was submitted by members of the\n            Naso indigenous group and the second by representatives of\n            some Ngobe-Bugle, another indigenous group living in the\n            'annex areas' to the Comarca Ngobe-Bugle in Bocas\n            del Toro Province. Both requests for inspection are related\n            to the consolidation of indigenous peoples' territories\n            and involve OD 4.20 (indigenous peoples) and 13.05 (project\n            supervision) as the relevant Bank policies. Management\n            appreciates the Panel's finding of broad concurrence\n            with Bank policies and procedures applicable to the project\n            and acknowledges the Panel's observations on specific\n            instances of non-compliance during project design and during\n            supervision in the early years, and its observations on\n            systemic issues. To address the instances of non compliance,\n            Management has proposed an action plan including the\n            following: 1) Management has offered its support to the\n            Government to identify key issues that should be addressed\n            in a more comprehensive Indigenous Peoples Development Plan\n            (IPDP), which the Government may update and treat as a model\n            for future programs involving indigenous peoples in Panama;\n            2) Management will ensure that the funds declared ineligible\n            related to inadequate consultations with indigenous peoples\n            identified during project supervision are returned to the\n            Bank before the loan account is closed; 3) management will\n            recommend to the recently-created National Authority of Land\n            Administration (ANATI) that addressing the outstanding land\n            claims of the Naso should be one of its immediate\n            priorities; and 4) finally, management will make use of\n            available opportunities to continue its engagement on\n            Indigenous Peoples' issues in Panama. Drawing upon the\n            lessons learned from the design and implementation of this\n            project, as well as other development projects in Panama,\n            Management will support a multi-stakeholder workshop before\n            June 2011 to discuss good practice approaches and strategies\n            to promote inclusive development of indigenous peoples."}, "docdt": "2010-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
