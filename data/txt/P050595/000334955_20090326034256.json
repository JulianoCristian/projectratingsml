The request was submitted by leaders\n            of the \"congreso de area anexa de la provincia de Bocas\n            del Toro\" on behalf of the communities that live in the\n            so-called \"Areas anexas\" to the Comarca\n            Ngabe-Bulge in the Bocas del Toro province, Panama. The\n            requesters claim that they and the community that they\n            represent have been harmed and are likely to suffer further\n            harm from the Project. On February 25, 2009, the panel\n            received a first request related to this project raising\n            similar issues on non-compliance and harm, and registered it\n            in the inspection panel register on March 11, 2009 as IPN\n            Request RQ01/09. The first request was submitted by\n            representatives of the indigenous community of Pueblo Naso,\n            several individual members of the community and\n            representatives of some community organizations. According\n            to the requesters, not only do the Project's actions\n            violate their human and land occupation rights, but also\n            contravene to the conventions and international treaties to\n            which Panama is a party as well as \"the World\n            Bank's strategies and operational policies on\n            indigenous peoples approved by the Bank's Board on\n            February 22, 2006.\" After receiving the Management\n            response, the panel will determine whether the request meets\n            the eligibility criteria and shall make a recommendation to\n            the Executive Directors as to whether the matter should be\n            investigated. The request has been assigned IPN request\n            number RQ 09/04."}, "docdt": "2009-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
