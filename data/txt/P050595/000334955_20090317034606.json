The request was\n            submitted by representatives of the indigenous community of\n            Pueblo Naso, several individual members of the community and\n            representatives of some community organizations. The\n            requesters claim that they and the community that they\n            represent have been harmed and are likely to suffer further\n            harm from the Project. The loan was approved on January 16,\n            2001, after experiencing some implementation problems, the\n            project was restructured on June 23, 2006 to narrow the\n            project scope and outputs and improve \"implementation\n            and financing modalities.\" The requesters claim that,\n            in violation of its own policy on indigenous peoples, during\n            implementation of the project the Bank did not take into\n            account the rights and interests of the Pueblo Naso\n            communities, inter alia, because project officials are\n            trying to impose a \"Carta Organica\" in their\n            territory that is detrimental to their rights, has not been\n            consulted with the indigenous people and lacks legal basis.\n            After receiving the Management response, the Panel will,\n            determine whether the request meets the eligibility criteria\n            and shall make a recommendation to the Executive Directors\n            as to whether the matter should be investigated.\" The\n            request has been assigned IPN request number RQ 09/01."}, "docdt": "2009-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
