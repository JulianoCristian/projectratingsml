Emergency Drought\n            Recovery Project is to provide the Government of Moldova\n            with urgently needed resources to assist recovery from the\n            drought.  The project will increase the availability of food\n            for the domestic economy and exports, and facilitate the\n            reduction of poverty, through restoring production in the\n            most important sector of the economy.  It will do so by\n            providing inputs that are essential for the coming\n            agricultural season.  At the same time the loan will assist\n            in narrowing the balance of payments gap resulting from\n            substantial incremental food imports and the sharp decline\n            in agricultural exports resulting from the drought.  The\n            project will finance inputs for the 1993 agricultural\n            season, targeted towards those sectors which appear to have\n            a long-term comparative advantage.  It will provide:  (a)\n            US$15.7 million of pesticides essential to the 1993 fruit,\n            vegetable and grain crops; (b) US$6.0 million for poultry\n            feed; (c) US$2 million for seeds and seeding equipment; (d)\n            US$2 million for spare parts for agricultural machinery; and\n            (e) up to US$300,000 for technical assistance for\n            procurement and disbursement."}, "docdt": "1993-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
