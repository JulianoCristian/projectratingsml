MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBD TO THE
EECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBUC OF MOLDOVA
FOR AN IMERGENCY DROUVHT tRECOVERY PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Moldova for the equivalent of US$ 26 million to help finance a project
for Emergency Drought Recovery. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace.
Background
A. Overiew
2.           The Republic of Moldova became independent on August 27, 1991, at a time of severe
economic dislocation as a result of the disintegration of the USSR. This dislocation was exacerbated by
a civil war in the Trans-Diwester region (where the Russian minority Is stongly represented) from March
to July 1992, and a massive terms of trade shock as Russian energy prices rose towards world levels
(Moldova being almost totally dependent on imports for its energy supplies). In the summer of 1992,
the situation was compounded by the worst drought since 1946. Moldova's membership of the Ruble
Area meant that these developmeats took place against the background of considerable macroeconomic
instability. By the end of 1992, IDP was estimated to have declined by over 40 percent since 1990, and
inflation had reached 1500 percent on an anmual basis.
3.           Against this background the Govenment has attempted to address the severe structural
imbalances in the economy through a program of reforms designed to facilitate a progressive transition
to a market economy. A number of key laws have been adopted (e.g. on agrarian reform, privatition,
land reform, privatization, bankruptcy, property, and foreign investment) which envisage a substantial
reduction in the role of government in the economy. However, implementation of the reforms provided
for in those laws has been generally slow due to political factors and to capacity constraints in the
administration. Nevertheless, progress has been made on the liberalization of prices and interest rates,
foieign exchange allocation, and land privatization.
4.           The Government has also attempted to offset the instability emanating from the Ruble
Area by restricting its fiscal deficit (the estimated outturn for 1992 at 7 percent of GDP being better than
for many countries of the former Soviet Union), since continued membership of the Ruble Area
effectively limits macroeconomic stabilization options to the fiswal area. The establishment of a national
currency is under consideration, but due weight will have to be given in this decision to the likely
evolution of trading relationships within the former Soviet Union, and on reaction in the Trans-Dniester
region.
B. The Agricultural Sector in Moldova and the Impact of the 1992 Drought
5.           Moldova is a densely settled rural country in which agriculture and food processing
directly support more than half of the population. Agriculture contributes approximately 40% of GDP,
more than half of the population of 4.4 mi!lion lives in rural areas, and food processing is a major
employer within the industrial sector.



6.           The year 1992 was a pardcularly unwvorable one for agricultur production In Moldova.
A combination of mid and late summer drougt, coupled with much higher than averg tempetures,
and an unusually high Incidence of days wit hot dry whids (sukhovel), inflicted heavy damage on the
long season annu alops, and also on fts and vineyards. In July and August, some of Moldova's
dWicts received less than 20% of their normal monthly rainl; hardest hit were the southem districts,
but also many districts In the center and north were badly affected. Ile men temprtures In August
averaged 4.20 C above normal, with at least one district reporting 5.80 C above normal. At least 8
meteorological stations, out of 15, reported more than 10 days of hot dry winds for the month of
August.'
7.                  As a result of this unfortuate combination of meteorological effects, overall
cereal production declined by 32%, of which maize by 58%. Further serious decreases in yield and
production occurred In sugarbeet, by 14%, tobacco 37%, soybeans 73%; fruits are reportd to have
yielded only some 30-40%, and grapes only half of their normal yields. Valuation of the direct loss in
output in the crop sector at domestc prices prevailing on average in 1992 (approximately third quar
1992 prices) yields a loss of approximately 40 billion rubles or approximately 16% of Moldovan GDP
in 1992. The fall in real G(DP in 1992 is estimatd to have been approximately 30%. In other words,
without the drought the drop in GDP might have been on the order of 15%, or somewhat less than
average for the former Soviet Union.
8.           In the absence of drought, the economic dislocations attendant on the disintegration of
the USSR, would have had a lesser impact on the Moldovan economy than on the rest of the FSU, since
the horticultural products, wine, and tobacco that Moldova produces and traditionally exported to the
Russian market retain a high value in money and barter trades. The loss of physical product associated
with the drought reduced Moldova's ability to purchase agricultur  iputs and inputs for the processing
industry.
9.           The large quantitative loss coming at a time of profiond political and economic change
has had a further impact through a slowing of the momentum of economic reform. Because neifther the
farms nor the govenment has reserves with which to finance commercial imports either in rubles or in
dollars, the state has taxed the farms in kind to procure products to exchange for imports. Agricultural
chemicals, fuel, fertilizer, and spare parts are predominantly imported. Most imports traditionlly came
from the former Soviet Union, but some western imports were transshipped through Moscow. Bilateral
assistance in this year of crisis has taken the form primarily of credits for purchase of grain, or supply
of grain on a grant basis. Little financing is available for import of agricultural inputs needed for the
coming season, but the country cannot aford to risk the large loss likely if vines and orchards already
weakened by last year's drought are expose anprotected to this season's diseases and pests.
1/           Govrment's agroclimatology deptmet reports precipitation/tatur reations in the
form of a "hydrothermic coefficient'; a comfortable coefficient is 1, when the coefficient reahes less than 0.7,
plants suffer from drought. In July 19, only one meteorological station out of 17 reported 0.7, all others
repwrted less (as low as 0.2); and in August only one station dsowed more than 0.7, with all others leas, even as
low as 0.1.

C. ne Sector Framewo4c
10.          Despite apparent difficulties, some progress has been achieved in price policy, and a
program of land reform and farm restuctuing is bing implemented. The land reform is proceeoing in
several stages. The first (from Februay, 1991 to approximately November, 1992) is largely complet,
arid consisted of the enlargement of household plots and transfer of these plots to private ownership.
Approximately 10% of the total Moldovan agricltural area has been so distibuted. Since 200,000
hectares were held In household plots In 1990, the first stage of the land reform has twasferred ownership
of these plots to the households that worked them, and has in addition enlarged the area in plots by about
one half. 7he land reform households received ownership of their land instead of the former use right,
but land camot be sold until 2001.
11.          The second stage of the land reform began in November, 1992. This stage includes both
farm commercialization and additional land reform. Farms may restructure in one or a combination of
three main forms: 1) joint stock holding company, either closed or open; 2) producers' cooperative or
association of producers; and 3) individual private farms and small businesses. Most collective and state
farms are expected to eregister as closed stock holding companies. Shareholders will receive non-
transferable shares both of land and assets. Asset shares will be distributed to workers and pensioners,
usually according to the amount of labor Invested in the farm. After valuation of the assets of the farm
the shares will be denominated and distributed.
12.          Land commissions in each of the forty disicts will supervise the distribution of land
shares. The commissions will draw up lists of people eligible to receive shares of collective and state
farm lands and will inventory the land on each farm. Docments affirming rights to a number of hectares
will be distributed. Tbis relative share of land will in most cases not be divided or even physically
demarcated, but will entitle the owner to a proportionate share of reurns to land manged collectively.
Although the size of land shares varies by farm, most shares in the collective farm sector will be less than
five hectares per person. Shareholders who want to leave the state and collecdve farms can request that
their shares be given in physically demarcated plots. This land can be withdrawn between November and
March of any year. The land reform and farm restructuring is expected to proceed rather slowly. The
current emphasis is on reregistration of farms as joint-sck companies, rather than restructuring.
13.          The government's reform program in agricultuire has been most successful in the area of
price adjustment, and this has paradoxically been in part in response to the drought. The government
does not have enough resources to provide major subsidies for grain imports coming in at world prices,
and the concept of cost recovery is increasingly accepted as a matter of necessity. Grain prices, which
moved up toward 50 rubles per kllo at the end of 1992, are, In tUrn, influencing prces of other crops
and accelerating contraction of the livestock industry. Although many distortions remain and there is
great uncertainty about future prices, the price structure for tradeables not available within the ruble area
is moving toward world levels more rapidly than is the case in Russia, for example, where budgetary
reserves for agricultural subsidies are perceived to be more ample.
14.          Although prices are moving toward world levels at the now unified exchange rate,
Moldovan agricultural producers still face output prices pressured both by depressed domestic demand
and price distortions within the main market areas of the former Soviet Union. In the near term,
therefore, agricultural inputs imported at world prices will require a high physical marginal return in
order to compensate for residual price distortions. The fertle soil of Moldova, responsiveness of many
horticultural products to yield-enhancing inputs, and degree of progress already achieved in moving
3



toward world prices may make Moldova a better candidate for imported Inputs than most of the former
Soviet Union.
15.         In other areas including privatizaon, demonopolization, nterie restructuring off
fms, and flnancial reform, Moldova does not yet have a tblHy developed strategy of agricultural
adjustment. The lack of consistent forward progress in agrculture reflects severad realities. Absence of
an effective domestic stabiization program and the high inflation rate in the ruble area has preduded
advantages that a stable macroeconomic enviroment provides the agricultua sector.  The general
economic downun, due In part to the drought, has drawn antion of sectoral manage  toward short
term crisis management. Lack of political consensus has retarded design of a coherent economic reform
program. While in the medium tem there will need to be further institional and policy refms, In the
short term exena assistauce should be targeted to arresing the deterioration in the agricultural sector,
and restoring productive capacity, without worsening current distortions.
The proposed emergency assistance for drought recovery is such an activity. It addresses
a . A created by an acute meteorological emergenc. It does not Interfere with adjustment and reform
that is underway; e.g., movement toward a price structure more consistent with world prices. Although
assistance is not intended primarily to promote reform, targeting financing away from activities with
negative value added will accelerate the restrutuing process. Financing provided for purchase of inputs
will reduce the need to resort to tax in kind and to barter trade to secure imported inputs.
D. Government's Respone to the Emergency
17.          Moldova is in an area of relatively risky agriculture, and mild drought is relatively
frequent. The country insured against the impact of drougt in the past through participation in inter-
republic trade at interna transfer prices, which incorporated high Implicit subsidies that muted the
financial impact of any decrease in production. In 1992 the drought was unusually severe, and the
traditional approach to insurance (both at the national and farm levels) had broken down. The financial
Impact of the drought is thus of an order of magnitude with which the government did not have to cope
in past years.
18.          The Government's response to the drought has consisted of three main activities;
a.    Efforts to secure fm;acing of co_msatory imports,
primarily of food grain;
b.    Intervention in the livestock industry to cope with
reduced feed supply;
C.    Efforts to secure availability of inputs for the 1993 crop
season.
Project Objectives
19.          The Bank's objective in proposing this loan is to provide the Government of Moldova
with urgently needed resources to assist recovery from the drought. The project will ircrease the
4



availability of food for the domestic economy and exports, and facilitate the reduction of poverty, through
restwring production in the most important sector of the economy. It will do so by providing inputs that
are essendal for the coming agricultural season (beglning in Match 1993). At the same time the
proposed loan would assist in narowing the balance of payments gap resultinp from substantial
incremental food imports and the sharp decline in agricultural exports resulting from the drought.
Project Description
20.          The proposed project would finance inputs for the 1993 agricultural season, targeted
towards those sectors which appear to have a long-term comparative advantage. It would provide (i)
US$15.7 million of pesticides essential to the 1993 fruit, vegetable and grain crops; (ii) US$ 6.0 million
for poultry feed; (iii) US$ 2 million for seeds and seeding equipment; (iv) US$ 2 million for spare parts
for agricultural machinery; and (v) up to US$ 300,000 for technical assistance for procurement and
disbursement (any unused fimds on this portion to be reallocated to another category). A positive list of
goods has been agreed for each of the first four categories. These inputs would be within the framework
of a program of imports of agricultural inputs by the Goverment ad Its agencies. Retroacve finanming
amounting to US$ 5.2 million has been included. The final beneficiaries would be fully responsible for
the local costs of the project, which consist of the costs of storage and distribution, esimated at 20
percent of the value of the Inputs financed by the proposed project, or US$ 5.2 mfllion. Project financing
is summaized in Schedule A. Schedule B shows the amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement. Schedule C gives the dates of key processing events.
Project Impementation
A. Overall Manaement and Administration
21.          The Borrower will be represented by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministy for Foreign
Economic Relations and the Ministy of Finance will be responsible for the implementation of the
operation, and will supevise the functions of the Importing and Distribution Agents (see below). A Vice-
Minister has been put in charge of the operation.
22.          The Miistry for Foreign Economic Relations has appointed MOLDEXIM, one of its
agencies, as the Importi  Agent, responsible for the procement ad importion of all goods procured
under the loan. Tecnical Assistmce will be procured directly by the Miistry for Foreign Economic
Relato
23.          The Imporling Agent will transfer the imported goods to the Distribution Agetas, who
will be responsible for their distribution to the final users;. Te Government has identified the following
Distribution Agents, which are all Government agencies:
FERTILITATEA,         for the agro-chemicals,
ZI           When imported goods are distrbuted to a single final user, as nisy bt the cae for poultry
feed, ar when a single user is tking a large order, condo   ca be given to trnserring direy from the
Importing Agent to the inal user to save t cost of distribon.

CEREALE,        for the seeds, seed equipment and poultry feed,
ARCA MOLDOVA           for the agricultu  spare parts.
B. TechicWal Assistance
24.          Since neither the importdng agent nor the Govermment bave any experience in procurement
and disbursement for World Bank operations, it has been agreed with Government that Technical
Assistance is essentdal to ensure speedy implemenion of the project. A Procurement and Disbursement
Consultant has been identified and recruited under a PPF. Govenment has decided that the Consultant
will report to the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations and will assist MOLDEXIM.
Project Sustainablity
25.          The project aims to restore production in the agricultural sector rapidly by mainly
providing essential inputs rather than capital assets. The sustainabiity of the aicultu  sector depends
in the medium term on progress in policy reform and economic restructuhig. The project contibutes
to sustain "ity in that it reduces the risk that the restucturing process will be retarded or even reversed
(this issue is addressed under the risks section below).
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement
26.          The Republic of Moldova joined the l3ank on August 12, 1992. The proposed loan would
be the first to be made to the county. There have been five Bank missions to Moldova and a Country
Economic M    ndum, based on a Bank mission of October 1992, is currently under preparation. The
missions have worked in very close collaboration with the Moldovan authorities, and a fruitvidi policy
dialogue has developed. The missions have been consisteny impressed by the professionalism of an
overburdened administion, laboring with the herculean task of creating an independent ste.
Radonale for Bank Involvement
27.          The sudden dislocation of the Moldovan economy following the disintegration of the
USSR has left Moldova unable to cope with recovery from the drought without exena assistance. The
breakdown of the interrepublican trade and payments system, combined with political factors relatig to
the status of Moldova within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), have greatly restricted the
country's access to its traditional support mechaoisms in Russia. ' Moldova's relative lack of economic
and political relations with counties outside the former Soviet Union, has made it difficult for the country
to raise  tenal financing. Th1 proposed loan would both help to redress an emergency situation and
act as a catalyst to support by  her donors. It should also help counteract the trend to slow down

reform and restructwring progresses, then the Bank could consider financial support in the form of
rehabilitation, adjustment and Investment loans.
28.          In i related operation, the IMF is providing SDR 13.5 millioi under the cereals
component of its \. mntingency and Compensatory Financing Facility to compensate for the abnormal level
Imports of grais in 1992/93 expected as a result of the drought. In addition, the European Community
and the US Government are providing financial assistance for grain imports.
Agreed Acdons
29.          The Government has agreed to undertake a number of actions within the framework of
the proposed project. Goods financed under the loan would be sold to end users at border prices,
converted at the official exchange rate (prevailing on the Moscow Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange),
plus a margin for fill internal distributlon costs. Any subsidies on bank credit for input purchase will
be kept to a minimum, and will be paid from the Government budget. Receipts from the sale of inputs
will be collected and placed in a fimd to be designated by the Government. Any agrochemicals purchased
under the project will be on the list of approved chemicals of both the Republic of Moldova and the
World Bank, and will be transported, stored and handled according to natonal and World Bank standards.
Technical assistance will be financed under the loan for procurement and disbursement expertise.
En'fronental Aspects
30.          The use of pesticides in Moldova has given rise to major environmental issues. However,
by procuring outside the FSU, the project will provide much safer and more efficient pesticides, requiring
much lower quantites of active ingredient per unit area, than have been available in the past. In addition,
pesticide use is declining due to improvements in pest management, rising prices for agrochemicals as
subsidies have been phased out, an increasingly influential enviromental movement, and shortages of
supply. Moreover, the pesdcide regulations, which are already quite strict by intnational standards,
are being made more rigorous. The certification mechanism appears to be quite effective, and the State
Departe  for the Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources (DPNER) acts as a watchdog
in environmental matters. The project has been placed in Category B for the purposes of Operational
Directive 4.01 on Evironmental Assessment.
Projec Benefits and Risks
31.          The rub benefit of the proposed project would be to resore agricultural production In
an economy highly dependent on its agricultural sector. hbis will help slow the decline in natio
Income, increase the availability of foreign exchange, enhance food secrity, and maintain momenaum
on the resructuing of the economy. The main risk for the proposed loan is that political factors will
retard the reform and restructuring pross, and the recovery of agricultural production may then not be
sustainable beyond 1993. However, the Government is endeavoring, in consultation with the Bank and
the IMP, to pilot a comprehensive economic and legal reform program through Parliament. It is
envisaged at the reform program will be supported by futre Bank loans. An associated risk is that the
project would finance stuctures with no long-term comparative advantage. This risk has been addressed
by either excluding from the project subsectors in need of major restuctring Cn the case of pig
7



production), or by restricting the project's contribution in such subsecors to the maitennce of the
breeding stock (in the case of poultry farming). The third risk is that the inexperience of the Government
and its agencies in international procurement, and the requirements of the Bank, will delay the arrival of
inputs unt;i late in the aicultural season. This risk is being addressed by the inclusion of technical
assistance for procurement and disbursement under the loan, and by intensive supervision by Bank staff.
The fouth risk Is that commodities imported under the project would be reexported to neighboring
countries; however, this risk is minimal given the Government's policy of selling inputs at border prices
plus Internal distribution costs. The fifth risk is that the ma im-term financial viability of the
agricultural and banking systems will be undermined by provision of inputs and credit in a risky
environment. Ibis is being addressed by credit subsidies being granted in a transparent manner from the
Government budget (within the framework of fiscal and monetary policy formulated in consultation with
the IMF and the Bank) rather than being borne by the financial sector, and by the progressive
liberalization of producer prices that commenced in early 1992.
Recommendatlon
32.          I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and recommend hat the Executive Directors approve it.

TECHNCAL ANNEX
1. BadIground and Strategy
A. Nare of the Emergency
33.          Moldova experienced a combination of drought, high temperatures, and high winds in
the summer months of 1992. For much of the month of May, lower than average temperatures combined
with low reserves of moisture in the soil in many districts reduced the quality of the winter grain crops
and noiirrigated lucerne, and caused loss of fruit blossoms. In June precipitation increased, and the
quality of many crops improved. In early July warm and relatively dry weather developed, and by the
last third of July the weather was hot and dry. The average temperature for July was close to the norm
of 20.5-22.5 degrees C. During the month of July the number of days with maximum temperature of
30 degrees or higher was 6-9 in the northern districts (depending on reporting staion), and 10-16 in the
center and south, which is 1.5 times the usual.
34.          Total precipitation in July over most of the territory was 11-45 mm, or 20-70% of normal
precipitation. In some districts precipitation was as little as 5-10 mm, or 8-15% of usual. Relative
humidity during daytime fell to 20-30% in most places. Hot dry winds (makbD.xei) blew for 3-16 days
(depending on reporting station), which is 2-3 times the usual duration. Moisture reserves in the soil at
one meter depth on July 28 constitued 50-100 mm, and in some areas had fallen to 25-40 mm.
35.          Hot and dry weather prevailed throughout August. The average monthly temperature was
23.1-25.4 degrees, or 3.74.6 degrees greater than normal. The maximum temperature was 34-38
degrees, which is 1-3 degrees below the maximum recorded over the 100 years for which records have
been kept. The temperature remained above 30 degrees for 23-26 days, or twice the usual duration. The
number of days with temperature in excess of 35 degrees ranged from 8-14. This temperature regime
has been observed once in 50 years.
36.          The number of days with relative humidity less than 30% in August ranged from 10-16.
Total precipiaion in August over most of Moldova ranged from 5-35 mm, or 10-65% of usual. In
Kameaskom and Bessarabskii districts monthly precipitation was 60-110 mm, or 153-216% of usual
precipitation. Soil moisture reserves fell over much of the country to 15-35 mm at one meter depth, and
in places to 0.
37.          Similarly severe agrometeorological conditions were observed only in August 1946.
38.          A summary index (Selianinov hydrothermic coefficient), according to which 1.0 expresses
adequate moisture, 0.7 indicates dryness, 0.6 drought, and 0.5 severe drought is displayed below in Table
1. In usual years the value of this index in Moldova ranges from 0.7 in the south to 1.2 in the north.
B. Damage Assement and AconomIc Impact
39.          Moldova is a densely settled rural country in which agriculture and food pcsing
directly support more than half of the population. Agriculture contributes approximately 40% of GDP,
although price distorto  and ambiguities in national accounts obscure precise mesurement of

agriculture's contribution. More than half of the population lives in rural areas, and food processing is
a major employer within the industrial sector. A major shock to agricultural output has a deep and broad
impact on levels of living.
40.          Grains and horticultural products, sugar beets, and tobacco are the main products of the
crop sector, and all, with the partial exception of winter grain crops and grapes, were adversely affected
by the drought. The fall in production between 1991 and 1992 is shown in Table 2 below, although it
should be noted that production of fruits, berries and grapes was already below trend in 1991.
41.          A small portion of the shortfall can be attributed to an early frost on October 6, 1992,
and a slightly larger portion to the impact of the war in the Trans-Dniester. Some of the reduced output
in 1992 can be attributed to reduced use of fertilizer and other inputs associated with higher prices and
interruptions in supply. Production of sunflower, potatoes, and grapes, although higher than in 1991,
was substantially less than average for recent years.
42.          Within the grain sector, the corn crop was harder hit than the earlier harvested crop of
winter wheat. In Moldova wheat is the main food grain, supplemented by corn and other grains. Most
of the corn is fed to livestock, and domestic feed is traditionally supplemented by imports. Since the
drought was generalized in incidence across the country and affected horticultural and feed crops more
than the main food grain, the shortfall in pro'uction did not create a geographically concentrated group
of people whose nutition was threatened. Instead the economic impact of the drought is spread
throughout the agricultural sector, and, through the trade accounts, to the economy as a whole.
43.          Valuation of the direct loss in output in the crop sector at domestic prices prevailing on
average in 1992 (approximately third quarter 1992 prices) yields a loss of approximately 40 billion rubles.
An alternative valuation of loss in farm income includes only foregone sales (imstead of lost production),
but also includes indirect effects through reduction in livestock marketing. This second calculation again
yields a loss of approximately 40 billion rubles compared to marketing in 1991 (in constant 1992 prices).
44.          Neither of these calculations purports rigorously to patiton the separate effects of
economic and meteorological shock. The hydrologic data presented above document the incidence of
severe shock. Its impact is heightened by occurrence at a time of economic dislocation. In the absence
of drought, the economic dislocations would have had a much lesser impact on Moldovan agriculture,
and on the economy more generally, since the horticultural products, wine, and tobacco that Moldova
produces and traditionally exported to the Russian market retain a high value in money and barter trades

1992.  'e fall in real GDP in 1992 is
estmated to have been approximately 30%.
These assessments imply that the drought
accounted for approximutely half the fall in
economic activity. In other words, without
the drought the drop in GDP might have been
on the order of 15%, or somewhat less than average for the former Soviet Union. Since the economic
diocation throughout the region is greatest in the defense, heavy industry, and livesunck sectors,
Moldova's advanage in horticulture and food processing might, in the absence of the drought, have
provided an element of relief from the full force of the downturn. Deficiencies in the data make it
difficult to derive a rigorous estmae of the quantitative inpact of the drougbt, but an esdmate of 10%
to 15% of GDP (at 1992 domestic prices) appears to be a reasonable range.

the value is converted at the exchange rate of 300 rubles at mid year or 500 at the end. In either case,
this value is significandy below that derived if the physical loss is valued at world trading prices, since
domestic prices Iagged world prices at the official unified exchange rate. Valuation of the physical loss
in the crop and horticultura setrs alone (excluding indirect effects on the livestock sector) yields
approximately $200 million, $110 million of which is in the grain sector.
C. Agricultural Reform and the Drou
47.          The Irge quattative loss coming at a time of profound political and economic cne
has led the Govenment to take measues that un counter to market-oriented reforms. Because neither
the farms nor the government has reserves with which to fina  comeci imports either in rubles or
in dollars, the state has, in the face of scarcity, retained taxes in kind to pror product for interstate
15



barter in exchange for imports. Moldova's future strength must lie In agricutral exports, and an
institutonal foundation to support private commercial trade must be built. The retention of taxes in kind
tD barter for inputs retards development of such an instItutIonal environment. Even with increased
intermediation of the state, agricultural producers will not have access to amounts of inputs that would
be economially justifiable under the current pricing stucture.
48.          Despite these difficulties, some progress has been achieved in agricultural price policy,
and a program of land reform and farm restrucuring is being Implemented. The reform program in
agculture has been most successful in the area of price adjustment, and this has paradoxically been in
part in response to the drought. The government does not have resources substantially to subsidize grain
imports coming in at world prices, and the concept of cost recovery Is increasingly accepted as a matter
of necessity. Grain prices moving up toward 50 rubles per kilo at the end of 1992 are, in turn,
influencing prices of other crops and accelerating contraction of the livestock industry. Although many
distortions remain and there is great uncertainty about future prices, the price structure for tradeables not
available within the ruble zone is moving toward world levels more rapidly than is the case in Russia,
for example, where budgetary reserves for agricultural subsidies are perceived to be more ample.
49.          Although prices are moving toward world levels at the unified exchange rate, Moldovan
agicult    producers stll face output prices pressured both by depressed domestic demand and F ice
distortions within the main market areas of the former Soviet Union. In the near term, therefore,
agricultural inputs imported at world prices will require a high physical marginal return in order to
compensate for residual price distortions. The fertile soil of Moldova, responsiveness of many
horticultural products to yield enhancing inputs, and degree of progress already achieved in moving
toward world prices makes Moldova a better candidate for imported inputs than is the case in most of
the former Soviet Union.
50.   The land reform is proceeding in several stages. Thefrsti (fom February, 1991 to approximay
November, 1992) is largely complete, and consisted of the enlargement of household plots and transfer
of these plots to private ownership. Approximaty 10% of the total Moldovan agricultural area has been
so distributed. Since 200,000 hectares were held in household plots in 1990, the first stage of the land
reform has transferred ownership of these plots to the households that worked them, and has in addition
enlarged the area in plots by about one balf. The land reform households received ownership of their
land instead of the former use right, but land camnot be sold until 2001, which substantially reduces the
impact of the reform.
51.          Ihe second stage of the land reform began in November, 1992. This stage includes both
farm restructuring and additional land reform. Farms may restructure in one or a corabination of three
main forms: 1) joint stock holding company, either closed or open; 2) producers' cooperative or
association of producers; and 3) individual private fams and small businesses. Most collective and state
farms are expected to reregister as closed (i.e. new members cannot be admitted) stock holding
companies. Shareholders will receive shares both of land and assets. Asset shares will be distributed
to workers .d jensioners, usually accordig to the amount of labor invested in the farm. After valuation
of the asseZat ohe farm the shares will be denominat  and distuted.
52.          Land commissions in each of he forty districts will supervise the distribution of land
ses. Ihe commisions wfll draw up lists of people eligible to receive shares of collecdve and state
farm lands and will inventory the land on each farm. Documents afiming rights to a number of hectares
will be distributed. This relative share of land will in most cases not be divided or even physically
16



demacated, but wil entide the owner to a proportonae sbare of returns to land managed collectively.
Although the size of land shares varies by farm most shares In the collective fm sector will be less than
five hectares per person. Shareholders who want to leave the state and collective fams can request that
their shares be given in physically demactd  plots. This land can be withdrawn between November and
March of any year. lhe land reform and farm restructring Is expected to proceed rather slowly. The
current emphasis is on reregistration of farms, rather than restru;turing.
53.          In other areas Including demonopolization, enterprise restructuring off farms, and
financial reform, Moldova does not yet have a fully developed strategy of agricultural adjustment. The
lack of consistent forward progress in agriculture reflects several realities. Ihe general economic
downturn, due in part to the drought, has drawn attention of sectoral managers toward short term crisis
management. Lack of political consensus has retarded design of a coherent economic reform program.
Absence of a domestic stabilization program and the high inflation in the ruble area has precluded
advantages that a stable macreconomic environment provides the agricultural sector. However,
Moldova's agricultre has a better chance than that of most countries of the FSU to become competitive
at world prices. External assistance should be targeted to arresting the deterioration In the agricultural
sector, and restorng productive capacity, without worsening current distortions.
54.          Drought recovery is such an activity.  It addresses a need created by an acute
meteorological emergency. It does not inerfere with adjustment and reform that is underway; e.g.,
movement toward a price structure more consistent wit world prices. Although assistance is not
intended primarily to enhance reform, targeting away from activities with negative value added will
enhance the adjustment. Financing provided for purchase of inputs will reduce the need to resort to tax
in kind and barter trade to secure imported inputs.
D. Government Rnonse   the Emergncy
55.          Moldova is in an area of relatively rlsky agriculture, and mild drought is relatively
frequent. The country insured against the Impact of drought In the past ftrough participation in inter-
republic trade at internal transfer prices that muted the financial impact of annual variations in production.
In 1992 the drought was unusualy severe, and with the collapse of the FSU, the traditional approach to
insuce (botlh at the national and farm levels) had broken down. The financial impact of the drought
is thus of an order of magnitude with which the government did not have to cope in past years.
56.          The Government's response to the drought has consisted of three main activities:
a. Efforts to secure financing of compensatory imports, primarily of food grain (see
Table 8.);
b. Intervention in the livestock industry to cope witb reduced feed supply;
c. Efforts to secure availability of inputs for thae 1993 crop season.
57.          The drought has exacerbated the contraction in the livestock industry that was already
underway in response to falling demand and new relative prices. The decline in production and numbers
has been more severe than in the rest of the former USSR. Since many livestock are in large complexes
that are state enterprises and supplied with feed through administrative allocation, the nature of the
17



contraction of the livestock industry In part eiects government policy. This policy las bee to favor
hog production over poultry. In consequence the poultry industry is essentially shut down, and bog
numbers are still higher than the level that can be fed efficleady. There are economic and environmental
questions with regard to the advisability of the uarent allocation of scwae feed.
58.          The difficulties of the livestock industry In this year of drought and adjument are great.
Moreover the managerial dhllenges of guiding a contracion to minimize loss and reorient the industry
to new economic realities are new to policy makers and enteprise maagers. Policy with regard to the
livestock sector does not yet reflect a strategic vision of the needed adjustment, nor a program of
Implementation to assure efficient use of current inputs going into the livestock sector.
59.                 The goverament is undertaking intensive efforts to monior availability of
agricultral Inputs for the 1993 crop year, and to inrvene if acute shortage is likely. Shortages are
expected in agricultural chemicals, vetnary mredicines, feed, and spare parts. Fertilizer use is expected
to continue to decline in 1993. Felizer will be purchased within the ruble zone. Use is eeed in
1993 to be 45 thousand tons of active ingredients, compared to 232 thousand tons active ingredients in
1990. The drop in anticipated fertilizer use reflects a decision to rely this year on the natu  fertility of
the soil, which is enhanced somewhat by the reduced crop growth last year. Approximately ten million
tons of organic fertilizer will supplement the reduced application of mineral fertilizer.
60.          Moldova is traditionally an exporter of high quality seed within the ruble zone, especily
corn seed. Because of the drought, domestic production of seed is reduced, and seeds will be imported
in 1993. Fuel use is not expected to decline, and major efforts are underway to secure fuel, all of which
is imported from within the rumble zone. Orders have been placed for quantities considerably in excess
of expected utilization, on the assumption that not all orders will be filled.
61.          Because horticultural products are so important to Moldovan agriculture, plant protection
agents are correspondingly important. Ihe application of pesticides and herbicides in active ingrediens
per hectare has been less  a in horticulunral production in Western Europe, and most plant protection
agents have been Soviet products of comparatively low quality, both with regard to efficiency and
environmental safety. Traditionally agriculturd chemicals were purchased within the Soviet Union,
although some foreign products were purchased through Moscow and allocated inally to Moldova.
Within the portfolio of inputs needed for 1993 that must be imported into Moldova, the difference in
quality between products available within the ruble zone and those available outside is greatest in the plant
protection agents. The higher quality of wes  products gives higher physical yield increments per unit
of active ingredient, and allows application of a lower dose of active ingredient per hectare. The
Government of Moldova is aware of the need for cost recovery of imported inputs, and moreover, in the
longer run, supports the switch to a chemical regime that is ecologically responsible and requires use of
less total active ingredient per hectare.
62.          For both economic and environmental reasons, impd  western plant protection agents
are the best use of dollars available for purchase of agricutural inputs for 1993 recovery from the prior
drought. High quality plant protection agents will moreover protect vines and orchards weakened by last
year's drought. Should the drought continue, proper application of high quality herbicides will reduce
the diversion of scarce moisture to weeds.
18



II. Bank Response and Strategy
63.          The Bank's strategy is described In the Memorandum of the President under "Rationale
for Bank Involvement'. Briefly, the strategy is to provide exteral financing in an emergency situation
and in the absence of other sources of funding. Tbis should also serve to maintain momentum on the
progr of reforms and restructuring, which could eventually be supported by rehabilitation, adjustment
and investment loans from the Bank.
III. Detailed Project Desiption
A. Crop roeo       d Pesticides
64.          World-wide it is estimated that about 35% of all crop production is annually lost to pests;
of this, some 10% are lost due to weed competition, almost 12% are foregone due to diseases, and about
14% are lost to insect pests. Most of the high value crops, notably vegetables, fruits and grapes, are
usually even more susceptible to pests than many other crops, and require a more sophisticated regime
of crop protection. Although precise figures for Moldova are not known, there Is no reason to believe
that losses would be lower than the world average, without a systematic effort for crop protection.
65.          In Moldova there is an additional elemeot which will contribute to the need for a
potentally more efficient crop protection of perennial crops in 1993, and that is the fact that fruit trees
and vines will be going into the coming vegetative period weakened by last year's drought, and in
addition by an inadequate moisture supply in the root zone (depth 40-80 cm), existing in some areas in
Januay 1993. A weakened organism is more susceptible to infection, insect damage and weed
competition than a strong one. It will be equally important, however, to provide adequate protection to
all other crops, to ensure better productivity than was achieved in 1992.
0) Priority on Modern, Safe Pesticides
66.          For these reasons Government is putting a high priority on availability of good pesticides
for the 1993 season. The desire is to make available to agriculture an increased proportion of ecologically
safe pesticides, with high efficiency, low application rate of active ingredient (a.i.), and fast
biodegradability.
01) Amount of Pestlddes Needed
67.          Pesticide use in Moldova declined over the past decade from some 53,000 t used in 1984
to only 20,000 t in 1991, and the preliminary estimate of the amount used In 1992 is 14,000 t. Main
reasons for this development are that: (i) PSU agrochemical fatories started producing by about the mid-
1980s more efficient pesticides; (iH) more attention was paid to elements of integrated pest management
(IPM), such as closer pest monitoring, scouting, and use of biological methods of control; Moldova has
an Institute of Biological Methods of Crop Protection (Institute Biologitcheskich Method Zashchity
Rastenii) which is producing some biological pesticides; (iii) in the latter half of the 1980s government
abolished agrochemical subsidies which led to much more judicious procurement and use; (iv) an
19



increasinly strong environmetal lobby; and (v) parcurly in the pst 2-3 year psicides wero simply
not available In adequ  quantities.
68.          nou tow amout of sicides tlawed  to beoeed fbr 1993 stands at 25,000 t of
physical weight, all of which would need to be Imported. Out of this, about 1,400t would be financed
under the prped project at an estimated cost of $ 15.7 million, and some 22,000 t have been planned
to be procured from the countries of the Ruble Area. Of the latter, to-date some 50% is reported to have
been contracted for.
011) Quaty and Safety of Psiddes, Eninmental Effect
69.          At this stage of pesticide development technology, there is a great qualitative diffeenc
between sicides produced in countries of the FSU, and westen counties. The latter are much safer,
much more efficient, and require much lower quantities of active ingredient (ai.) per unit area. Some
of the best pesticides use only sgveral hundred grams, or even less, of a.i. per ha, while in many of the
FSU pesticides 5-8 kg/ha must be still applied, and In extreme cases even well over 30 kg/ha of a.l., to
achieve the desired pest control effect.
70.          Moldovan crop protection speciaists estimate that if the county could procure the whole
natonal requirement of pesticides in the state-of-the-art class, the total annual quanty needed would
Shink to around 5,300. to 5,600 t of physical weight (ready made fotmulatio) only, Istead of the
curreny required 25,000 t. From the above assessment it is clear that pesticides imported under the
proposed project would have a significantly posive env I Impact, and that the goa of Moldovan
agrochemistry has to be a speedy conversion of the crop protection saegy to modern pesficides with
high safety standards.
(lv) Pesticides to be Supplied Under Project
71.          A tentative list of pesticides to a total value of US$ 15.7 million to be financed under the
proposed project has been prepared, giv  their primary producers, quantes required, main crops In
which pesticides will be used, and estmated cost of the modern, safe pesticides. All the pestcides
proposed have been reviewed by the World Bank for environmental considerations, and have been fond
admissible under the WHO 'Guidelines to Classification of Pesticides" and acceptable for use with respect
to the concentrations proposed.
72.          The great majority of the pesticides will be required for crop protection at the begining
and during the early mouths of the spring planting season Since time for placing ordets and getting the
procurement under way is of the essence, a list has been worked out in cooperation with specalists of
FERTILITATEA (former SELKHOZKHIMIA), the Moldovan agrochemicals supply and distribution
company, giving six different dates at which, from the point of view of the agriculturil calendar, the
various pesticides will be needed in the field.
73.          The Moldovan environmental legislation requires that only tested and registered pesdcides
be used in the country. It is still to be detemined whether this will allow only the purchase of
previously-used brand names in the time available, or whether equivalent formulations can be admitted.
20



If the latter is permissible, procurement will be by internWonal shopping or by limited inteional
bidding.
(v) The Distribution System
74.          The pesticides would be distributed by FERTILfTATEA, aparasttal company responsible
for supply of agrochemicals down to farm level. lhe company's headquarters is in Chisinau and it has
Agrochemical Stations, and Crop Protection Stations In all the 40 districts in the country. Further, it has
16 regional Supply Units, equipped with storage and handling facilities, wbich serve on the average 2 to
3 districts. The company is competent, has a long experience with distribution of agrochemicals, and has
adequate storage and transportation capacity.
(vi) Advisory and Supervison Sevices
75.          The Crop Protection Stations (CPS) at district level have the muldple functions of advice,
suevsion, early warning for pest infestations, and pest monitoring. The CPS consists of two units -
a Pest Control Advisory Serice, and a Pest Forecasting and Monitoring Service. The former consists
on the average of three crop protecton graduates (plant pathologists and entomologists), who advise farms
(kolkhozes, sovkhozes) on crop proteon technology, timing of applications, and supervise safe handling
of pesticides at farm level. The latter service consists usually of two graduate crop protection specialists,
and is responsible for pest phenology, pest idendficadon, and forecasting. All farms are equipped with
approprit sprayers and have operators experienced In their use.
76.          In addition, the CPS organize in all districts -Ecology Commissions" at the local
municipal council, which supervise all aspects of agrochemicals in all farms of the district. The
commissions go so far as to issue 'certificates' to farms, and only those which satisfy the commission
with their safe level of handling pesticides get these Ocertficates". Farms and other facilities are not
isued a *certificate", and hence are not allowed to use pesticides, until they correct any faults found
during the commission's inspection visits. It has been agreed with FERTIL1TATEA that pesticides
procured under the project would be handled only in "certified" facilities and farms, confrming to
national standards.
(vii) Psddd Rrgltons
77.          The FSU used to issue excellent Pesicide Regations, which underwent a major update
for each five-year plan, and were almost anmually updated with smaller publications reflectng newest
pesicide developmen. The last such regulation was issued in Moscw by an independent Agrochemical
Commission (Gosudarstvena Komisia po  lmltchesilm Sredstvam Borby s VredWtieliami, Bolezniami
Rasei I Sorniaami) in 1987 and covers the period 1986-90. Moldova to-date uses this regulation as
its principal guidine In dealing with pesdcides, while it is paing its own sticter guidelines, which
should become available in a few months. Apart from that, Govenm    is preparing an "Environmental
Plan" with a perspective upto the year 2010.
78.          The Pesticide Regulations (Spisok Khimitcheskich i Biologltcheskich Sredstv Borby s
Vrediteliami, Bolezniami RasteDil I Sornakami i Regulatorov Rasta Raste"i, Razreshennykh dlia
21



Primenenia v Selskom Khoziastve na 1986-90 Gody) are to a degree stmctured after the WHO Guidelines
and contain an assessment of about 600 different FSU and western produced pesticides. The FSU
Regulations give for each product:
- the common pesticide name,
- the international name of the a.i.,
- the recommended application rate per ha of the pesticide,
- the recommended application rate per ha of the a.i.,
- the crop(s) on which the pesticide should be used,
- the main pests the pesticide is going to control,
- the recommended time and technology of application,
- the last permitted time of application (in days before harvest), and
- the maximum number of applications per season.
79.          The Regulations give a number of other very important guidelines, which should be, but
are not, available in many other national pesticide regulations. To mention just a few, they give specific
instructions on use of pesticides in medicinal plants, grain and other warehouses, flour mills,
greenhouses; the maximum allowed pesticide levels in foodstuffs, waters (fish farms, reservoirs for
municipal supply), feedstuffs, soil, air; restrictions for use of pesticides near contamination susceptible
areas (human habitats etc.); and last but certainly not least, the earliest permitted entry (in days after
treatment) into pesticide treated areas by humans, separately for those riding in agricultural machines
(tractors, combines) and those entering by foot.
80.          The Regulations do not have the force of a law, however, and serve merely as guidelines.
According to FERTIHATEA, the recommendations of the Reguaions are largely respected in Moldova
because of a strong environmental lobby, and also because of the activities of the "Ecology Commissions"
in the districts.
B. Seeds
81.          Predictably, seed production has been equally badly affected by the 1992 drought, and
with a similar patten, as overall crop production. Total seed shortfall is estimated at about 25%, and with
the exception of spring barley and oats, seed of all other crops is in deficit. Table 3, below, gives an
overview of the seed situation in 1992, as compared to the mean production of the pentade 1986-90.
Maize is not included in the information presened in the table, but generialy the Ministry of Agriculture
plans for an annual production of about 65,000 to 70,000 t, while the 1992 production was only 22,000
t. Much of this goes for export, however, since Moldovan agriculture does not need more than about
17,000 t at the most (calculated at a very high sowing rate of 40 kg/ha).
82.          Some of the seed shortfalls are in reality less threatening tham they look, since in
emergency situations seed stocks of small grain, in pardcular, can be temporarily replaced (at some loss
to productivity, though) with commercial grain. Government carefilly considered the national seed
balance for 1993, and after discounting seed that can be replaced locally and seed that can be procured
in the Ruble Area, requested the BanWk's assistance for procurement of some hybrid sugarbeet seed,
accompanied with some precision seeders, which are an essential element of the complex technology of
modern sugarbeet production, and fiuther for some soybean seed. The total cost of this component is

ustd to the calibration of this
seed. The seed would be used on  _
about 4,100 ha in 13 districts by
about 27 selected farms around Moldova's eight sugarbeet factories, as a large-scale demonstra-!on of
advanced sugarbeet technology. Tbis seed would cost about $ 310,000.
84.          Precision seeding is one of the cornerstones of modern sugarbe Producdon (as well as
maize, soybean and sunflower cltivation), but Moldova has virtly no satactory preciion seeders.
The project would finance about 25 precision seeders plus spare parts, esmaed to cost about $ 430,000,
and 100 seed units only, esdmated to cost $ 260,000. Ihe use of more modem technology than hitherto
available will allow the full benefit of the higher quality seed to be realized. The seed units would be
uWsed for abrication of complete seeders, which would be done by BELTSELMASH, an experienced
agricultura machinery factory in Beltse. Prowrement of the above items is best done through direct
contracting due to the excellent experience with this technology in Moldova, the limited time available,
and the relatively small amount involved.
85.          About 13,350 units, good for about 10,000 ha, of additional sugarbeet seed of as yet
unspecdfied varieties, which would, however, be adjustd to Moldovan conditions, would be impored
as well. At about $ 60/unit, this seed is estlat to cost $ 800,000. About 100 t of soybean seed would
also be proed, at an estimated cost of $ 200,000. This seed should be procured, due to the relatively
small amounts involved and the need to get it quickly, under inteational shopping with quotations from
at least three suppliers in two eligible countries.
86.          Distribution of goods procured under this component would be done by SAKHAPROM,
a company responsible for organizing primy production and processig of sugabeet, icluding upstream
and downstream supply and procurement. All supply stations of SAKHARPROM are on the railway
network, the company is equipped with adequate transport and stoage, and has plenty experience in this
23



kind of operaions. The seed and seeders are ee  to be sold to farms under the prvailing rules, i.e.
at cost plus 20% handling charges.
C. Agricultral Spare Parts
87.         ITe spare parts that are included for project financing consist above all of spares for those
machines which will be required for field work or other necessary support operations at the beginning
or very early in the coming growing season.
88.          This component would include spare parts mainly for sowing machines, liquid fertilizer
distributors, crop protecon sprayers, green forage harvesters, and some other smaller machines and
equipment, and batteries. The cost of the component is esdmated at $ 2 million. Of this, about $ 1.8
million would be for machinery spares (some $ 500,000 for seeders, sprayers, fertilizer distributors and
other smaller machines, and about $ 1,300,000 for forage harvesters), and the esdmated cost of batteries
would be about $ 200,000 and would include in the first istance batteries for field ators, agricultura
trucks, and field and storage loaders. Technical specifications for all the spare parts have been worked
out. The spares for the existing machines would have to be procured from the original producerz since
nobody else is producing them, while the batteries would be procured under interaional shopping. All
the spare parts are intended for supply to kolkhozes and sovkhozes, and would be sold at cost plus 20%
handling charges.
89.          The company responsible for managing this component would be ARCA MOLDOVA
(formerly SELKHOZTEKHNIKA), which has in all the 40 districts agricultural machinery supply
stations, as well as repair and maitenance statons, and has additionally throughout the country 12 highly
specialized repair workshops concentrating on, for example, major repairs of engines, hydraulic systems,
transmissions, fuel injectors, specific more complex makes of tractors and trucks, and other specialized
machines). The company has a lot of experience in all services related to agriculu   m io    is
reasonably well equipped, appears to have good management and seasoned personnel. The company can
handle the supply and distribution of this component with competence.
D. Iuts for the Animal Induty
O) Secto Background
90.          Until the sixties, livestock production in Moldova was concentrated in the collective and
state farms, with some production, mainly for home consumption, in the villages. This changed
considerably when, in the early seventies, the government initated a program to build large scale units
for the production of, mainly, pork and beef. These production units ("complexes"), built in nearly each
rayon, were supposed to be supplied with fodder and feed grains by the surrounding state and collective
farms, and were to export their products to other parts of the former Soviet Union. The feed base in the
country, however, was insufficient to provide iese complexes with feed, focing the country to Import
between 1 and 1.5 mfllion tons of feed grain from other parts of the FSU.
91.          lhis production scheme stared to become more difficult with the breakup of the FSU,
when feed imports became more expensive (becas payment was requwred in hard currency or hard
currency equivalent), and when the external market for animal products contracted. The domestic market

also contracted with the removal of consumer subsidies for most agricultural products, and the sector,
especially the supply from state and collective fars, has been in decline since 1990. The goverment
has bee tying to support the production system, among other means through the provision of credit and
mrough a selective allocation of animal feed. However, the Government has not been able to support
the livestock industry completely and is realizing that it has to be selective. This decision became
especially urgent during 1992 when fodder resources became increasingly scarce. For various reasons7
it was decided hat the inensive swine production should receive priority in the supply of grains, over
the poultry and dairy production systems.
92.          Ihe private sector, mainly household plots, received virtually no government support but
has been inerwoven with the state and collective farms, which either provided some inputs or assisted
in the marketing. The small scale private sector has contnued to expand, albeit slowly; the main
limiaion is the lack of access to land, capital and to a lesser extent markets. Most of the produce from
pnvate farmers was used for home consumption; state procurement from these farms varied between 10
to 35,000 tons/yr.
93.          The overall contribution of the livestock sector to agricultural domestic production is
approximately 38%. Exports, traditionally to other FSU counties, have declined, however. Previous
trading arrangements have been pardy replaced by barter trade of meat or butter for fuel or grain, either
by government trade organizations or by the producing fams themselves. As a result, the import of
grain for animal feed has also declined (see figure 1.). The feed grain supply has become even more
difficult in 1992-93 when local production declined, due to the drought, and imports became increasing
difficult due to the lack of foreign exchange and the declining availability of tradeable agricultural
products (including butter and meat).
7/           As far as could be determined by the mission, this reasoning was based on the fct that (i)
pork was the most prefened meat by dte populaon; (ii) rumnmants could survive on forago; (iii) poultsy
production, with the lower generaton interval of chickens, could conrat and restw more rapidly than swine;
and (iv) the country had, in the previous two decades, invested in intensive pig production.

94.           The feed shortages are complicated by the poor quality of animal feed, especially the
underfeeding of protein and mineral/vitamin supplements. The lack of a balanced dXat forces a ls to
compensate by a higher intake of grain, leading to poor feed conversion rates. The feed conversion in
the intensive swine industry is preseny approximately 4.5-6 kg feed for each kg growth, compared to
3 kg in western Europe; conversions in the poultry industry, which should be below 2 kg feed/kg gain,
are between 2 and 3. Although this may in part be related to inferior genetic stock, it can mainly be
attributed to poorly balanced rations.
95.          The overall quality of the technology used in the livestock sector is mediocre. The
tehology in the itensive pig and poultry industry is fairly new, but is energy inefficient, prone to
equipment breacdowns, and still fairly labor intensive. Moreover the swine production systems present
considerable difficulties in developing an envronmenally acceptable method of waste disposal. In
addition, the large complexes are highly dependent on third parties (suppliers, millers, railways etc.) to
provide feed, and as such vulnerable to breakdowns.
(1i) The Impact of Drought on the Animal Industry
96.           The feed supplies for the livestock sector consist mainly of forage for ruminat  and
grain for swine and poultry. The drought has caused a shortfall in corn, protein feed (sunflower,
soybeans) and in forage crops such as silage corn, alfalfa and fodder-beets (see table 7). This shortage
comes at a vulnerable moment when the livestock sector is tring to adjust to changing conditions in the
FSU.
97.           As such, the effects of the drought in the livestock sector have to be separated from the
overall contraction of the sector due to the changing market conditions in the FSU. The decline in the
production of meat, milk and eggs in the pre-dtought years 1989-1992 was respectively 18.6, 19.1 and
16.5%, or approximately 6% per year. Broiler production was especially affected with a decline of 67.6
% or 22% per year. Livestock inventories declined in a similar fashion. The contraction in animal

rary, if ever, kept in pashues. Privately owned livestock, especially ruminants, are herded on communal

Intended for cattle). The farmers antibipate that
they have to hold out til the following havest will be available (August-Sepembe).
99.          Their poor condton made these animals more vulnerable to diseases, and mortality rates,
which appaed fairly high by Western stadards, incrased (see table 6) during 1992 and early 1993.
100. The feed shortage, however, is in part a result of a still oversized livestock industry. The drought
has exacerbated this situadon. Assessment of available stocks is difficult Most collective farms are trying
to hold on to their stocks to feed their own animals (mainly dairy catde and pigs), but the state farms and
especially the complexes, which do not have their own feed sources, are completely dependent on state
managed feed supplies. It appeas that the severe shortage this year threatens not only the production
system in general but also the breeding stock. Most of the farms visited had empty feed bins and claimed
that their short term supplies were generally enough for only one or two days. Especally in the poultry
industry, where the broiler production has been halted since the fall, the lack of feed not only threatens
the layer population but also the, staegically more important, breeding stock.

(iii) Inputs Required by the Poultry Subsector
103.        Although all branches of the livestock sector were severely affected by the drought, the
poultry industry experienced the greatest contraction especially in the later half of 1992 (see table 4).
Broiler production was terminated in the fail of 1992, and the reduction of the layer population has
resulted in a decline in egg production. The production system would be able to start up again in a
28



relatively short time as long as the breeding stock (both layer and broiler parent and grandparent
population) is maintained. As such it Is important to assure feed supplies for this population till September
1993.
104.         At present the poultry industry is paying full market prices for animal feed (in early
January they paid Rb. 55,000-60,000/ton which, at the exchange rate of late December, would be slightly
below the world market price of USS 160/ton). A brief analysis indicates that, even with the mediocre
conversion rate, production costs were close to world market levels. The charging of market prices and
the potential competiveness combined with the fact that poultry are the most efficient users of feed grain
all constitute a strong basis to support feed supply for the breeding stock. In addition,
I.   the industry has contracted considerably (50% in animal inventory and respectively 40%
and 68% in output of eggs and meat in the stecollective sector), and is mainly
producing for the domesdc market;
2.    the breeding stock is essential for a rapid start-up when feed shortages are eased after the
1993 harvest;
3.    eggs produced by the breeding stock can either be sold for domestic consumption or, to
a limuted extent, exported; and
4.    the breeding stock is providing eggs which will be incubated in the spring of 1993 to
provide 30-50 million day-old chicks to be sold to the public (e.g. private house-plot
owners).
105.         Preservation of the 600,000 breeding stock from April till September, 1993 would,
according to government officials, require approximately 180 tons of feed/day or a total of 27,000 tons.
The feed could be procred in components (grain and concentrate) or whole feed. At present world
market prices, the grain would cost approximately US$ 140/ton (excl. shipment); the cost of concentrate
depends on the quality (protein ontent) but is expected to be around S250-275/ton. The price of whole
feed, as quoted by local poultry specialists, would be USS 180-200/ton.
106.         An estmate of total costs of the component would be:
Feed  appr. 27,000 tons    0 195       US$ Million  5.25
Transport (Europe delivery = approx. 14%)           0.75
Total                                               6.00
107.         The feed would be procured th     iternational competitive bidding, imported by
MOLDEXIM and mflled and disributed by the grain milling and distrbuting parastal company
CEREALE, in cooperton with the parastal responsible for poultry production AVICOLA.

V. niumdal and Economic Justificadon
120.         The intent of the current project is to provide inputs necessary to assist in recovery of
Moldova's agriculture from the drought of 1992. As with other emergency operations, the returns are
expected to be larger than with investment projects, but not as rigorously quantifiable. The more
quatifiable returns are finacial, and can be roughly e. . '-d by epected marginal increments in output
realized through application of lnputs financed undef * iject. The less quantifiable retums relate to
slowing the downturn of the economy so that substantl progress on economic reform and restmctuing
can be made.
121.         Moldova's economic decline in 1992, at approximately 30%, is very steep. The schedule
according to which policy based lending will begin in Moldova's case is not yet clear. An emergency
operation carefully targeted to assist recovery in a key sector by building toward the future strength of
the sector offers the highest economic return to exteral assistance available at the current time. A
secondary benefit wfll be its material contribution to an environment more conducive to reform.
Developments in the fall of 1992 suggested that lack of financing for purchase of agricultural inputs
constrained removal of the tax in kind and other hindrances to commercial marketing. The project
contributes toward easing that constraint
122.          Moldovas comparative advantage lies maWinly in hotivcultural products and annual field
crops. Resources under the project are targeted exclusively to products for which value added is positive
and substatia under a range of normal weather conditions. Of the crop products included in the project,
only sugar beets and pota  raise questions with regard to long term competitiveness. In the short term
each of these has ready marets withi Moldova and more generally in the FSU. Tobacco has been
excluded from the project, even though its contribution to Moldovan agricultural GNP is substaial.
123.         The financial return to the actvities financed under the operation is likely to be high
under most cimstances. The plant protection agents impofd under the operation will be applied to
approximately 15% to 20% of Moldovas agricultural area, and a higher proportion of the land
intensively used in perennial and row creps. Ihe crps include sugar beet, maize, peas, soybeans,
onions, winer wheat, winer barley, tomatoes, potoes, apples and pears, and wine grapes. Yield
increases on treaed areas on the order of 30% to 50% are expected. Ihese are large increases, but not
unreasonable, given recent yield levels under normal weather conditions, and field trials. Essentially all
of the additional producdton can be attributed to the plant protectio agent, since no additional expenses
32



ar Incurred In switching from a lower qualiy to a higher quality product. lbere may be some savings
In fiel ad labor If fewer applications are needed.
124.         Plant protecdon agen  for maize and grapes wil be the major plant protection agents
financed under the operatio. Yield Inreases of 30% for maize, or one ton per hecae under normal
local conditions may be expected. This would yild approximately a $100 ret  to a $30 additional cost
per hectare, over a base of approximatly 200,000 hectares. It is likely th  maize will sell for
approximately world pries within Moldova, or could be exported elsewhee within the CIS for $100 per
ton, or its ruble equivalent at the market exchange rate. lTus even a lower physical marginal increase
in yield would repay the initial investment for maize.
125.        lTe rern to protection of grWes would be a combination of higher yields and prevention
of loss on the vine. Additional production of three tODns of grapes per bectare is estianed to derive from
proper plant protecn practices. The average purchase price for grapes in 1992 was approximately
17,000 rubles per ton, and processors reported in October paying 25,000 rubles per ton, or approximately
$60 per ton. If this domestic price stays consut  in dollar terms, with physical marginal retuns
somewhat below the esthnated three tons per hectare, the plant protection agents for graes would be
likely to yield three times their value in additional output. Increased quantities and improved qualities
of grapes would have important secondary effects on rural employment Although rigorous cost benefit
ratios need not be estimated for the purposes of this operation, It Is likely that the plant protection
component will yield financial rers approximately three times the size of the inidal purchase.
126.         Other items included In the project are important, and have been included because in the
assessments of the Government and staff they yield an economic return exceeding their cost. Returns to
these components are difficult to quantify, such as maintining the productive core of the poultry industry,
and purchasing seeds to replace those lost through drought. As long as the plant protection items
constitute more than half of the value of the project, the retun to these items should bring an adequate
financial return to the entire project.
