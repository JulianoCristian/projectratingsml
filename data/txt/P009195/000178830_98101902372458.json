of the railway\n            network in Kosovo, the weakest part of the Yugoslav system.\n            The principal components are: (a) the reconstruction of\n            Kosovo Junction; (b) the installation of modern signaling\n            and telecommunications on the Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic main\n            line; (c) the procurement of rolling stock and integrated\n            transport equipment; and (d) training and technical\n            assistance to improve management, planning and freight\n            operations. The main project objectives are to improve RTO\n            Pristina's management and operational capabilities in\n            order: (a) to improve the capacity and efficiency of the\n            Kosovo rail network; and (b) to facilitate the development\n            and exploitation of Kosovo's abundant mineral resources\n            which generate long distance bulk traffic, thereby\n            accelerating the economic growth of the less developed\n            Kosovo region."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
