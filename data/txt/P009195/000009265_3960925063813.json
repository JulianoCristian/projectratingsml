On the management side, improvements were\n            successfully implemented in freight operations. The\n            management reorganization was completed at the end of the\n            project period so it is too early to evaluate its impact.\n            Most of the operational and financial targets set under the\n            loan were not achieved due mainly to: (i) delays in project\n            implementation; (ii) a fall in freight traffic; and (iii)\n            Government failure to authorize adequate tariff increases\n            during a period of high inflation. The overall evaluation of\n            the project is that it was marginally successful and that\n            the benefits will be sustained in the future. As in many\n            other railway projects, the Bank's expectations on the\n            financial performance were too optimistic. One of the main\n            causes of the poor financial performance has been the\n            Government's reluctance to raise railway tariffs to\n            compensate for rising costs at a time of rapid domestic\n            inflation. The PCR confirms the lessons drawn from previous\n            railway projects in Yugoslavia which demonstrated the need\n            for allowing sufficient time for implementation. Like\n            previous projects, this too illustrates the difficulties in\n            securing compliance with covenants to improve operating\n            efficiency and financial objectives and in recruitment of\n            qualified staff. Finally, it shows that institutional\n            development ought to be undertaken during a time frame much\n            longer than that of one Bank-financed project."}, "docdt": "1990-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
