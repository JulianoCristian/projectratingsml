Railway Project in Yugo lavia, for which Loan 1977-YU in the amount of
US$34.0 million was approved on Nay 15, 1981. The loan was closed in
December 1986, after three extensions of the Closing Date, and a total
amount of US$4.03 million was cancelled on October 28, 1985 and July
23, 1987.
The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office and is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower;
and internal Bank memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department

YUGOSIAVIA
KOSOVO RAILWAY PRWOECT
(LOAN 1977-YU)
Em=LATIN SUMMAY
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.          The socio-economic setting against which the project was
identified and prepared is discussed in paras. 3-18 of the April 7, 1981
President's Reoort (PR). Paras. 3.01-3.09 of the March 30, 1981 Staff
fDpraisal Renort (SAR) describe the status and prospects of the Yugoslav
Railways, and oaras. 2.01-2.09 describe the transport sector in Kosovo.
OBJECTIVES
2.          Intgnded:  RTO Pristina's Investment Plan was part of Kosovo's
Provincial Development Plan for 1981-1985 and its principal objective was to
modernize railway facilities in Kosovo so as to improve efficiency, capacity
and the competitive position of the railway, and to provide for the
substantial increase in traffic which would arise from the planned development
of Kosovo's mineral and industrial potential (PR, paras. 55-56).  Achieve:
The project works, originally planned to be completed in three years, took
over seven years (PCR para. 5.05). Operational targets were not achieved and
staff increased slightly, contrary to targets agreed at negotiations (PCR
paras. 4.01 and 4.03). In addition, financial performance fell far short of
the targets set at appraisal (PCR para. 5.02). Nevertheless, the project
achieved its basic physical objectives (PCR 8.08) albeit at a higher cost and
long delays leading, in combination with reduced benefits, to a marginal ERR
(PCR, para. 7.05).
IMPtEENTATION EXPERIEN
3.          The appraised project (SAR, para. 3.03) consistefd of the following
components:
(a) Reconstruction of Kosovo Junction:
(b) Procurement of traction. rolling stock and integrated transport
euui?ment;
(c) Procurement of signalling and telecommunications systems; and
(d) Technical Assistance.



v 
4.          At the Borrower's request, the Loan Agreement was amended by
letters of June 28, 1982, October 5, 1982, and January 3, 1983 (PCR, para.
2,09). Comparison between the appraLsed project and the project which emerged
after these amendments is not easy to astablish because the latter consisted
of the following Bank-financed components:
(a)   Siaalling and telecommunications eauiument on the Lesak-Kosovo
PolJo-Dieneral Jankovic line and at Kosovo Polie Jtinction.
Completion delayed over four years because of problems witn
bidding qualification, choice of contractor, and system redAsign
(PCR, para. 3.04);
(b)   Freight wagpns. diesel motor trains and shunters. snare parts and
equinment for diesel depot. Delivered after delays of up to two
years (PCR, paras. 3.13, 3.14, and 3.15).
(c)   Technical assistance.  Contract signature delayed until April
1984. Two studies completed satisfactorily (PCR, paras. 3.16-
3.18).
RESULTS
5.          The estimated project cost was US$67..5 million, with about US$34.3
million representing foreign costs (SAR, para. 5.07). Actual nrolect cost is
US$77.4 million (PCR, para. 3.19). Comparison of the two figures is not
meaningful because of project scope modifications during implementation (PCR,
para. 3.02). Estimated project gompletion (as well as the estimated Closing
Date) was December 31, 1984 (SAR, Annex I, Table 5). Actualpxaias
csj=jtion took place in May 1989 (PCR, para. 3.03), two and a half years
after the Closing Date which, after three extensions, had been set at December
31, 1986. Thus, the project registered a delay of over four years whose
principal causes were an optimistic implementation schedule, procurement
problems and difficulties with land acquisition. Financial Rerformance fell
short of the targets set at appraisal (PCI, paras. 5.02 - 5.04). As
appraised, the project had an eseimted E    of 22X (SAR, paras. 4.09).  The
amended project has a re-estiated ERR of 10.11 (PCR, rara. 7.05). Ieehndcal
Assistance In freight operations was successfully implemented while management
reorganization was not implemented until 1988 (PCR, paras. 6.03 and 6.04).
6.          The physical equipment provided under the project is expected to
be suitable for RTO Pristina's requirement for the next 15 to 20 years. The
newly established Planning Department and organization structure should
provide a firm base for future development (PCR, para. 8.09). The ex-post
economic evaluation of the ERR is based on conservative assumptions which
should be achieved (PCR, para. 7.03).

FIDINGS An  L&SSMI
7.          The PCR confirms the lessons drawn from previous railway projects
in Yugoslavia (ORD Reports no. 563, 3638, 5654, arnd 616$) which demonstrated
the need for allowing sufficient time for implementation. Like previous
projects, this too illustrates the difficulties in securing compliance with
covenants to improve operating efficiency and financial objectives and in
recruitment of qualified staff. Finally, it shows that institutional
development ought to be undertaken during a time frame much longer than that
of one Bank-financed project.

PROJEcT COMLETION REPORT
YUGOSlAVIA
KOSOVO RAIUAAY PROJECT
(LOAM 1977-yM)
1. INTODUC-TIQE
1.01        Yugoslavia is located at a strategic crossroad between
eastern and western Europe, bounded by seven other countries and the Adriatic
Sea. As a rasult, Yugoslavia's transport system provides access to the sea
for a number of central European countries, as well as connections for
international traffic between Western Europe, Greece and the Middle East. The
transport system comprises 9,245 km of railways, 130,000 km of roads of which
about 48,000 km are primary and regional roads, a sizeable network of inland
and costal waterways, 5 major ports on the Adriatic Sea and 15 airports. The
main trunk railway route, as well as the Trais-Yugoslav Highway, run northwest
to southeast in the Sava and Danube valleys where most of the centers of
population and economic activity are located, while the regions to the south,
with difficult terrain, have remained underdeveloped in their transport
network.
1.02        The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo (SAP Kosovo) is
surrounded by mountainous ridges rising to about 2,500 meters. Partly due to
the isolation caused by the difficult terrain, and partly due to economic
factors, the SAP Kosovo remains the poorest and least developed region in
Yugoslavia. It has the lowest per capita income which is only about one-third
of the national average, making it part of the officially designated Less
Developed Regions (LDRs), which receive special attention in channeling
national and external assistance.
1.03        The transport network of the SAP Kosovo consists of 333 kms of
single-track railway lines which form only about 3.5X of the national network,
about 3,800 km of roads and one airport. Kosovo's railways were operated by
the Railway Transport Organization Belgrade (RTO Belgrade) until the beginning
of 1978, when the Railway Transport Organization Pristina (RTO Pristina) was
formed.
1.04        A major policy objective in Yugoslavia's economic planning has
been to transfer income from the richer regions, through the Federal budget
and special funds, to the LDRs to accelerate their development to achieve a
more balanced regional growth in the country. Other objectives of the
post-war transport policy were: (i) to provide better access to the lesser
developed regions in the south; (ii) to increase the capacity of the existing
system; and (iii) to improve the quality of services. In an effort to help
the Government achieve some of these sector objectives, the Bank has financed
24 transport projects in the last 25 years.  These include eight loans for the



-2-
railway sub-sector, thirteen loans for the highway sub-sector, one loan for
che Port of Bar, and a multi-modal loan for earthquaske rehabilitation.
1.05        RTO Belgrade had benefited from four Bank railway loans made to
Yugoslavia but only in the Fifth Railway Project (Loan 1534-YU) was a portion
(US$9.0 million) of a US$100 d illion loan alloceated to Kosovo. The Kosovo
Pailway Project aimed at strengthening the newly formed RTO Pristin8, by
improving the capacity and efficiency of its railway network to facilitate
exploitation of the mineral resources which were anticipated to generate long
distance bulk traffic.
1.06        This Project Completion Report is based on a report provided by
the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR), information collected during a
mission, supervision reports and a review of Bank files.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01        Proposals for the Kosovo Railway Project were first made by RTO
Pristina through the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) in 1978 during
negotiations of the Fifth Railway Project. It was the Provincial Government's
opinion that RTO Pristins had, in the past, recelved a low share of
investments despite growing demand for railvay transport. Obsolete railway
facilities not only lacked the capacity needed to carry existing and new
traffic, but the newly formed RTO Pristina needed also support for
institutional improvement in planning and operations. During negotiations for
the Fifth Railway Project, an understanding was reached that the Bank would
make every effort to respond to Kosovo's needs and, with Federal and
Provincial authorities' cooperation, would ensure that projects which
addressed the critical development constraints faced by the Province and which
met the test of economic, financial and technical viability, were brought
forward and financed.'1  In this context, the Kosovo Railway Project was
born.
Prenaration and A&praisal
2.02        The preparation work addressing the major capacity bottlenecks in
Kosovo's railway system was undertaken by RTO Pristina. The RTO proposed an
Investment Plan based on the 1981-85 Provincial Developme&lt Plan and on
Feasibility Studies for the reconstruction of the Kosovo Polje Jinction and
for modernization of signalling and telecommunications (SS & TT) equipment on
the lines Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic and Kosovo Polje-Pec-Prizren, and an
Operational Plan to serve as a basis for designing the scope cf the project.
M Iemorandum of Understanding dated January 20, 1978.

2.03        An appraisal mission visited Yugoslavia in February 1980 and
recommended that:
-    the construction of the proposed passenger station building of the
Kosovo Polje Junction be postponed beyond 1985 because other
investments were regarded as higher priority;
-     the design for the diesel depot which appeared unduly costly be
revised and construction of the depot in stages match the size of
the fleet oE locomotives and multiple units;
-     the studies on SS & TT address the question of surplus staff who
would be made redundant by modernization of signalling and
telecommunications.
2.04        At the requast of the Bank, representatives from CYR and RTO
Pristina visited tbe Bank in August 1980 and brought revised Investment and
Financing Plans, Operational Plans, Traffic Forecasts and Feasibility Studies
for SS & TT on the lines Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic and Kosovo Polje-Pec-Prizren.
The visit was necessary because of the need to revise cost and financial data
following the June devaluation of the Yugoslav dinar and because of
conflicting and incomplete data which had been supplied during the appraisal
mission. The revised documents were discussed at length with the delegation.
As a result of Bank advice during preparation and appraisal, the Investment
Plan was reduced substantially by postponing to the period of the next
investment plan the construction of a new station building in Kosovo Polje and
acquisition of a motor train and seven coaches. Modernization of signalling
and telecommunications on the line Kosovo Polje-Pec-Prizren was postponed by
two years to be carried out after the proposed SS & TT investments on the main
line Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic. These changes contributed to a more balanced
Investment Plan. All major components for the project were selected on the
basis of their economic and financial viability (paras. 2.07 and 7.05).
2.05        Difficulties in obtaining adequate and consistent data during the
appraisal led to the proposal for a study to be undertaken, with the help of
consultants, for the improvement of the RTO's management structure. The study
was proposed to include relationships with other organizations which provided
services to the RTO on a regular basis. Consultancy assistance was also
proposed for assistance in planning and controlling freight operations.
2.06        The Kosovo Railway Project was negotiated in Washington in
February 1981. The project was again slighl1y redesigned by postponing some
elements to be carried out later than scheduled, however, this revaluation
resulted in an increase of foreign costs from US$32.5 million to US$34.4
million due to the necessity to provide higher price contingencies. The
Yugoslav delegation requested and the Bank agreed that the proposed loan be
increased from US$30.0 million to US$34.0 million, to meet estimated project
cost. During negotiations agreement was also reached on the text of a letter
under which CYR would provide the Bank with proposals on appropriate levelp of
tariff increases and compensation payments for RTO Pristina. *The loan was

approved by the Board on April 30, 1981 and the Loan Agreement signed on May
15, 1981. The loan became effective on November 10, 1981 after a two month
delay caused by the late formation of the necessary Community of Interest
(COI) as a provider of compensation payments. A COI is required in each
Republic/Province and comprises the RTO and its principal users. The COI's
responsibilities cover the development and implementation of railway policies
in addition to the provision of compensation payments.
Proiect Descriotion
2.07        The project comprised the 1981-83 slice of the 1981-85 Investment
Plan of RTO Pristina. The principal components of the project vere:
a)    reconstru2tion of the Kosovo Junction which included a
freight yard, a diesel locomotive depot, a passenger station,
diesel shunters and SS & TT and lightir.g;
b)    installation of modern SS & TT on the line Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic
(140 km) and the preparation of a system for SS & TT on the line
Kosovo Polje-Pec-Prizren linie (110 km);
c)    procurement of 4 diesel motor trains and 40 freight wagons; and
d)    technical assistance aimed at improving management planning and
freight operations.

2.09        Originally the Bank loan was to finance: (i) 95X of the foreign
costs (US$31.3 million) of signalling and telecommunications equipment and
installation on the line Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic and for the Kosovo Polje
Junction; (ii) 801 of foreign cost (US$2.0 million) of 40 freight wagons; and
(iii) 1001 of foreign costs (US$0.7 million) of technical assistance and
training. Upon the Borrower's requests the Loan Agreement was amended by
letters of June 28, 1982, October 5, 1982 and January 4, 1983, and the Bank
financed eventually the following items:

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
Start-mp
3.01        There was a two-year start-up delay due to: (i) procurement
problems with the supply of SS & TT equipment on the line Lesak-Djeneral
Jankovic; and (ii) extraordinary difficulties in acquisition of land earmarked
for the freight yard. These delays affected the construction of the yard,
installations of signalling and telecommunications equipment on the line
Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic and subsequent reconstruction of track facilities in
the Kosovo Polle passenger station.
Revisions
3.02        When the Railway Transport Enterprise Belgrade was reorganized
into four separate RTOs in 1978, and its assets divided between the four, RTO
Pristina was allocated traction and rolling stock which was among the ol& dst
on the network. Due to lack of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts, RTO
Pristina suffered from a permanent shortage of traction and rolling stock. In
June 1982, at the request of the CYR and RTO Pristina, additional priorlty
items, most of which had been deleted from the initial Investment Plan due to
lack of funds, were re-introduced as a result of a later appreciation of the
US dollar and advantageous prices obtained on the main contract for
signalling. These items were: (i) traction and rolling stock including 3
passenger coaches, 2 diesel shunters, 6 diesel locomotives, 141 freight
wagons, track maintenance machines and spare parts; (ii) points heating
equipment on the line Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic; and (iii) supervision of the
signalling and telecommunications installations. The purchase of this
additional equipment was justified on technical and economic grounds and was
mainly for replacement purposes. Despite these revisions, the total estimated
project costs remained virtually unchanged (US$65.7 million), but the
estimated foreign costs component increased by US$1.7 million.
Imolementation Schedule
3.03        General:  The Project Implementation Schedule is shown in Table I.
Only 55Z of the project was completed by the original Closing Date. It was
recognized at appraisal that previous projects suffered from lengthy delays
and that the newly established RTO Pristina was the weakest in facilities,
operational capability and management. However, the Government of Yugoslavia
had given high priority to assisting Kosovo to developing its infrastructure.
To promote this development, it had secured financial and other assistance
from all Republics to develop a project and requested the Bank during
negotiations of the Fifth Railway Project to provide additional loan funds for
this purpose. In this climate it was felt that with the technical assistance
to be provided under that project, the Implementation Schedule was reasonable.



- 7 -
This was overly optimistic. The institutional improvements took much longer
than anticipated and the delay in bringing ahotv this strengthening
contributed to a great extent to the delay ia project implementation (paras.
6.01-6.02). This situation was exacerbated by regional political problems
which made it very difficult to recruit and retain experienced staff. Other
major causes for the delay which are discussed below, would have resulted,
however, in a substantial time overrun even of a reasonable Implementation
Schedule. The project was finally completed in May 1989, four and a half
years later than planned.
Bank% Fianced Items
3.04        SS & TT: The installation of SS & TT on the line Lesak-Djeneral
Jankovic experienced a delay of over four ),ars and was completed in 1988
while works on connecting the outdoor and indoor signalling equipment in the
Junction was estimated to be completed by end-March 1989 and trial operations
carried out by end-May 1989. The major reasons for the delay in the SS & TT
installations were:
(i)  job qualification of a local bidder proved to be very time
consuming, because the post qualification criteria of the bidding
documents had been drafted in anticipation that only established
signalling companies would bid.
(ii)  choice of the contractor on the basis of station track layouts
instead of complete design documents.
(iii) redesigning of the SS & TT.
a)    in the preparation phase, buildings were not precisely
located and some were placed on difficult locations with
respect to supply facilities and required new building
permits due to alterations;
b)    change in quantities due to actual topography;
c)    new industrial sidings were built after the planning phase
in Obilic, Vucitrn and Titova Mitrovica requiring
alterations of the signalling design and provision of
additional equipment;
d)    higher protection than planned had to be provided for level
crossings on existing roads due to higher than expected road
traffic;
e)    after field inspections, the commission in charge of
approving new railway installations requested additional
signalling; and
f)   when the designs for SS & TT installations in the Kosovo
Polje passenger station and the freight yard were sent to



the Traffic Institute, Belgrade, for official approval at
the end of 1985, the Institute recommended a change in the
technique of the indoor equipment from free wiring to a
stat.dard relay system in order to improve the safety levels.
The requests (d, e and f) were made after the design which was part of the
contract had been completed.
(iv)  the main contractor encountered problems with one of its own
subcontracting units which had run into financial difficulties and
stopped carrying out works.
(v)   the main contractor did not adhere to his detailed Implementation
Schedule with regard to the time needed to assemble the signalling
equ4pment on his premises.
3.05        Freight  Yard:  Implementation of works on the freight yard
suffered an eighteen-month delay because of extraordinary difficulties in land
acquisition. In 1979 the Assembly of the City of Pristina pronounced that the
land planned for location of the freight yard and diesel depot was of general
interest and expropriated the land.  When plans for the new freight yard
became known, local inhabitants built dwellings overnight on the land on which
the yard was to be situated. The farmers did not allow the contractor to
commence construction until several months later when they received land in
exchange for that needed by the RT0 instead of a financial compensation as
earlier planned. The revised implementation schedules as agreed with the
contractor provided the completion of the freight yard by May 1984. Works
started in July 1983. The freight yard was opened for traffic in November 1984
with an auxiliary signalling but a long and severe winter interrupted work on
the new signalling system and the yard's combined station and signalling
building. The freight yard was finally completed in 1987.
3.06        Diesel Depot: Two exceptionally long winters impeded general
ground works with extensive water supply and drainage as well as the
canalization of a small river. In addition, procurement for the depot
machinery was quite slow and its installation took an unusually long time.
Therefore, the depot came into full operation as late as 1987.
3.07        Passenfer Station:  Noving freight operations to the new yard in
November 1984 enabled the reconstruction of the Kosovo Polje passenger station
which was partially taken into operation in 1985 and completed in 1987. The
passenger station building, which was postponed at appraisal and, therefore,
not part of the project, was built from late 1984 to 1987 with grants from the
Province of Kosovo.
Other Items
3.08        SS & TT installation on the line Kosovo Polje-Pec-Prizren was not
carried out because feasibility studies presented by the RTO were not
satisfactory to the Bank with regard to the economic and financial viability
of the planned investments.



-9-
3.09        Clgaing Date Extensions:   The initial Project Completion Date was
December 1984 but due to the above mentioned delays, the RTO through CYR
requested the Bank and the Bank agreed to three Closing Date extensions in
June 1985, December 1985 and December 1986. The major part of the project
consisted of the installation of the signalling system. By mid-1985 about 55Z
of this work was completed. Due to the nature of signalling works and to the
necessity to maintain compatibility of equipment, the only option available to
RTO Pristina was to continue pressure on the contractor to complete the work
as soon as possible. This also precluded the Bank from taking remedial
actions. The contractor, however, a reputable firm, failed to adhere to a
series of agreed time-tables. The financial situation of the RTO had also
deteriorated so that granting the extensions was vital to assist the
completion of the project and to gain, even if delayed, the benefits from the
investments. At the end of the third extension, some contract work still
remained to be completed. At this stage the undisbursed loan funds were
cancelled (para. 3.21) and the RTO continued completion of the project with
the financial assistance of the Province.
Reporting
3.10        Audit reports, submission of certificates of expenditure and
progress reports were constantly delayed. Tne latter were mostly rather poor
in quality. The intended role of CYR in providing technical assistance in
reporting did not show any results.
Procuremene
3.11        Procurement of all Bank financed items was carried out under
International Competitive Bidding. Domestic firms were permitted to
participate in the bidding and accorded a preference of 151, or the customs
duties, whichever was lower.
3.12        SS & TT Equipment for Lesak-Dieteral Jankovic Line including
Kosovo Polle Junction. The Loan Agreement provided US$31.0 million for
designing, supply of equipment and its installation. Bids were opened on
August 20, 1981. Only two Yugoslav covpanies made a bid. However, as both
bids were not responsive and in agretment with the Bank's procurement
guidelines, both bids were rejected and the firms were invited to resubmit
their bids on the basis of revised technical specifications and conditions.
Both bidders resubmitted their bids and the bid opening was again held
publicly on November 2, 1981. The evaluation report for the second round at
bidding was submitted for Bank's approval by the end of November 1981 and the
Bank agreed to the proposed award of contract to the lowest evaluated bidder
by telex of March 18, 1982. The contract amount was US$22.4 million
equivalent. Prices were fixed for one year and then were to be adjusted for
inflation. Repeated requests of the RTO to finance additional equipment
(para. 3.02) were accepted by the Bank on the ground that they were
unforeseeable and inevitable adjustments to the basic contract.



- 10 -
3.13       Er,2igt agg.M.  The Bank financed 100l   foreign costs and 80X
local costs for procurement of the freight wagons estimated to cost US$2.2
million. The contract to purchase 40 wagons was awarded in June 1982 to a
Yugoslav firm, which offered better delivery and which, according to the RTO,
had a sound record of similar supplies. The price offered was so low that 90
wagons could be purchased for the planned expenditure, which the RTO
requested. In July 1982, the Bank aZreed to finance the additional 50 freight
wagons which would cover most of the planned purchases for 1984. In October
1983, at a time of substantial freight traffic increase and suffering from
permanent shortage of wagons, the RTO requested and the Bank agreed to finance
additional 150 freight wagons. The need was well justified on operational
grounds and continuing traffic increase. Loan funds were available due to a
very advantageous price obtained for the SS & TT contract and the depreciation
in the value of the dinar. Contracts for a total of 150 wagons were awarded
to one foreign and three Yugoslav bidders in December 1984. All 240 freight
wagons were delivered by the end of 1985.
3.14       Diesel Shunters. Equipment for Diesel Denot and Snare Parts.  In
October 1983, RTO Pristina also requested Bank financing of 2 diesel shunters,
equipment for the diesel depot and spare parts for locomotives. All of these
items, with the exception of the spare parts, were included in the project
description. The Bank agreed to the proposal in its telex of April 25, 1984.
International competitive bids were called for all items except for spare
parts. Bid evaluations, awards of contracts and deliveries were carried out
without any problems. Bid opening for procurement of 2 diesel shunters was
held in August 1984 and contract with a value of US$1.3 million awarded to a
foreign bidder, in January 1985, despite applying domestic preference to local
bidders. The shunters were delivered in August 1985. With regard to the
provision of spars parts at a total value of US$400,000, the RTO requested and
the Bank agreed by telex of August 13, 1984, to purchase the parts as far as
possible directly from those firms, which were awarded contracts under ICB
carried out as part of the Sixth Railway Project (Loan 2336-YU) provided that
the firms were willing to sell under unchanged conditions and price. The
small amount of the part not covered by this arrangement was purchased after a
direct call for bids from all bidders who had participated in the previous
ICB. The spare parts were delivered in 1985. Bids for the supply of diesel
depot equipment were opened in November, 1984. Contracts were awarded to one
Yugoslav and four foreign firms in February 1985 for a total value of US$1.4
million. Delivery of equipment was completed by December 1986.
3.15        Diesel Wult2le Units.  Because of the favorable price
received on the SS & TT contract and the lower dollar/dinar rate, US$10.9
million remained unallocated in the Loan Agreement under the signalling
category. For this reason, the RTO requested in June 1982 that the Bank
allocate US$5.0 million to a new category for diesel multiple units (DMUs) to
which the Bank agreed. Bids to supply 4 three-unit diesel multiple units were
opened on February 7, 1983. The Bank agreed to the proposed award of contract
to a local bidder by telex of May 12, 1983. The value of the contract was
US$4.3 million. In September 1984, the RTO made proposals for the use of the
loan balance, one of which was to purchase passenger coaches. In December
1984 the Bank suggested to purchase instead diesel multiple units because the



- U1 -
Bank had doubts that procurement of coaches under ICB could be accomplished
within the time available, while bidding documents for the diesel multiple
units were available. In June 1985, the bid evaluation commission of the RTO
proposed award of contract for 4 two-unit sets to a local bidder. After
review of the bid evaluation report, the Bank reached the conclusion that the
local bidder was not the lowest evaluated bidder and that none of the bids
received met all technical conditions. The RTO decided, with the Bank's
agreement to invite re-bid with modified technical specifications for 3 four-
unit sets instead of the three-unit sets. Conditions about delivery and speed
of 120 km/h were the main issues that required clarification. The contract
was awarded to a local bidder on August 18, 1986. Covered by a bank
guarantee, the Bank disbursed fully against this contract by June 30, 1987,
with the remaining two sets of DMUs to be delivered after that date. The cost
of these units was US$3.8 willion, including spare parts up to about 10% of
the value of the 3 sets.
Tecbnical Assistance
3.16       At negotiations, it was agreed to appoint consultants by January
1982, to carry out two studies to improve management and organization of the
RTO and to assist in better planning and controlling freight operations.
Inadequate staff in numbers and capability (para. 6.02) delayed conclusion of
a contract for both studies with a Yugoslav university institute in
collaboration with a foreign consultancy firm, until April 1984 (para. 6.03).
3.17        StWdy on Manajementand Organization of the RTO.  Recommendations
were presented in autunm 1985. Their major thrust followed organizational
changes introduced in a few other RTOs and provided the basis for a
substantial restructuring. When the new organization became effective after
intensive consultation with staff on January 1, 1988, an organization
consisting of 6 Basic Organizations of Associated Labour (BOALs) each with its
own workers' council that enjoyed yrime sources of authority and a large
measure of autonomy, was transformed into one working organization without
BOALs. One major effect of the reorganization is a reduction of the number of
managers. This and specific recommendations to streamline the internal flow
of information is expected to improve over time management's ability in
decision making, and lead to higher productivity and operational efficiency
and better communications with CYR and other RTOs.
3.18        Study on Freiaht ODerations.  The study, completed in February
1986 provided a detailed review of actual freight operations in the RTO and
proposed quite drastic measures for increasing their efficiency. They were
related to reduction of waiting time for freight wagons and increase in speed
of train, increase in traffic safety, up-grading of lines for higher axle-
loads, increase in line capacity, improvement of quality services and hence
increase in traffic volume. The Bank reviewed the recommendations made in the
study and agreed with the recommendations but cautioned on investments and
urged the RTO to reconsider them in the light of the present low traffic and
expected moderate growth. Most of the study recommendations on operations
have been implemented by the RTO quickly (paras. 4.02 - 4;04).

Costs
3.19 Total investments for the five year period (1981-85) were estimated at
Din 2633.8 million (US$ 96.3 million equivalent). The appraisal project cost
estimate for the 1981-83 three-year slice was Din 1845.9 million (US$67.5
million equivalent), with a foreign component of Din 938.3 million (US$34.3
million equivalent) or 511 of total project costs. Of this amount Din 19.2
million (US$0.7 million equivalent) was on technical assistance and training.
Comparison of estimated and actual project costs is shown in Table 2 and
summarized below. The actual costs were Din 19,378.3 million (US$77.44
million equivalent) with a foreign component of Din 7,481.7 (US$29.98 million
equivalent) or 401 of total project cost.

3.20 With an underrun of US$13.44 million for infrastructure investments and
an overrun of US$23.51 million for rolling stock purchases, together with
other minor items the :roject costs increased by about 151 (US$9.9 million)
over appraisal estimate. Costs were influenced by the delay in project
implementation and an increase of local inflation, especially in later years
during which a decrease in inflation had been estimated. In addition there
was a moderate increase in quantities in relation to the total volume.
Expressed in US dollar however, unit costs were substantially lower than
estimated because of the depreciation of the Yugoslav dinar. In addition,
actual costs for infrastructure were affected by a SS and TT contract value
much lower than estimated at appraisal. Expenditures for rolling stock, on
the other hand, were high because quantities more than doubled being stock
required for a 7-year period while the appraisal estimate covered the
quantities for only 3 years (Table 1).
Disbursements
3.21       Due to delays in completing the project, disbursements lagged
behind the appraisal estimate. At the end of the three-year project period,
only 471 of the loan proceeds was disbursed. However, by the December 1986
closing date, 751 of the loan proceeds had been disbursed. To allow for
disbursements for eligible expenditures incurred uneer existing commitments,
the loan account was kept open until July 1987 when the last disbursement was
made. The undiabursed amount of US$2.9 million was cancelled, making the

total amount cancelled under the project US$4.03 million. Planned and actual
disbursements are shown below:

IV. OPERATING PEQBORMANCE
4.01       RTO Pristina's selected operating statistics for 1981-87 are shown
in Table 3 and summarized below. In general, operational targets as set out
in the Loan Agreement (Annex 1 of Schedule 5) were not achieved. This failure
is attributable to delay in completing the project and decline in freight
traffic (paras. 3.03-3.07 and 7.01-7.03).

4.02       The availability of diesel locomotives was better than planned in
1981 and 1983, but the trend declined from 1984 onwards.  The diesel depot was
completed in 1987 compared to appraisal estimate of 1983, but machinery was
not installed until 1988 (para. 3.06). The RTO was also short of foreign
exchange needed to purchase spare parts for the locomotives, especially since
1984. Net ton-km per ton in 1981-84 was better than planned, but declined
thereafter. Although 240 freight wagons were delivered by the end of 1985,
and old wagons scrapped in substantial numbers, the planned utilization of
freight wagons was not achieved. Freight traffic had increased up until 1984,
and then declined to about 45X of appraisal estimate by 1988, mainly due to a
general decline of the economy (para. 7.03). One of the reascons for the



- 14 -
anticipated freight increase was the intended shift of trains from the line
Belgrade-Nis-Skopje to the line via Kosovo Polje. When traffic declined frrli
1985 onwards, the RTOs' Belgrade and Skopje reaction was to protect their
revenue by keeping traffic on their lines (para. 7.01 and 7.02). Although
wagon turnaround targets were not achieved, delays in freight trains have -
improved due to completion of the freight yard, reducing the wagon turnaround
time from 4.4 days in 1981 to 3.2 days in 1987. The productivity targets were
by far not achieved despice increasing traffic until 1984. Traffic was lower
than expected (paras. 7.01 - 7.02) and staff numbers increased (para. 4.03).
4.03        The RTO's staff increased slightly contrary to targets agreed at
negotiations. Although staff reduction was expected to be realized,
especially in the signalling and telecommunications component of the project,
the number increased from 2,528 in 1981 to 2,597 employees in 1987. Although
composition of staff improved slightly by 1986, levels of qualification and
especially experience were not raised sufficiently to make a significant
impact on management's performance. Delay in completing the passenger
station. freight yard and SS & TT installations on the Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic
line forced the RTO to recruit more experienced staff and retain the number
and structure of SS & TT employees. The targets set at appraisal appear, in
restrospect, unrealistic in that there had been a high unemployment rate in
the province and that management's ability to take decisive actions had been
over-estimated. Government regulations were introduced which required the RTO
to employ one school leaver for every 50 railway employees. A new regulation
which became effective in 1985 requiring everyone with 40 years of service to
retire irrespective of age was not enacted early enough to have a positive
effect on staff reduction. The RTO is retraining workers to fill in positions
of about 135 workers who were due for retirement in 1987 and 1988.
Productivit.y measured in traffic units'/ per employee improved from 165,000 in
1981 to 205,000 in 1986 or by 241 mainly due to an increase in passenger-km
but fell in 1987, in parallel with all other RTOs in Yugoslavia, to the low
level of 179,000 units.
4.04        At the 1987/88 timetable change, the RTO implemented most of the
recommendations made in the study in order to improve freight operations. New
intermediate stations with shunting locomotives were introduced with pick-up
trains stopping only on basic intermediate stations. The concept of circular
trains in the Kosovo Polje Junction has been fully implemented. As a result,
commercial speed of pick-up trains increased from 10 km/h to 13-14 km/h during
the 1987/88 timetable. However, the recommendation to close 30X of wagon-load
service stations because of low traffic volume which did not justify their
existence, has not been implemented but is under consideration.

V. FINZACIAL..ZUEQ3MICE
FEinan¢cial bi ectives
5.01        The major finan¢ial objective of the project was to improve RTO
Pristina's financial viability and to reduce its dependence on Government
subsidies. To achieve this objective Section 5.04 of the Loan Agreement
provided that: (i) the operating ratio (operating expenditure expressed as a
percentage of operating revenue including subsidies) would be r'ddvtted from
1151 in 1979 to 901 in 1981 and 89% from 1983 onwards. In addirion,
subsidies as a percentage of revenue were to be reduced from 351 in 1979 to
301 in 1981, 22.51 in 1983 and 101 in 1985.
Income Statement
5.02        Comparison of actual and forecast Income Accounts, Cash Flow
Statements and Balance Sheets for RTO Pristina from 1979 (first year of
operation) through 1987 are shown in Tables 6, 7 and 8. Summarized Income

While progress was made in improving RTO Pristina's financial performance
during the period 1981 through 1985, it fell far short of the targets set
under the Loan Agreement. The Operating Ratio was 1501 in 1981 compared to
the target of 901 but improved to 111 in 1985 compared to the target of 89X.
Compensation as a percentage of revenue in 1981 at 271 was less than the
target of 301 but the position deteriorated afterwards and in 1985
compensation was 231 of revenue compared to the target of 10X. In addition,
the RTO incurred substantial annual net deficits during the period compared to
the break-even position forecast. After 1985, the financial position



- 16 -
continued to deteriorate with the operating r4tio reaching 144X in 1987 and
compensation 28X, resulting in a deficit of )iu 9.0 million or 621 of
operating revenue.
5.03        The major reason for the poor financial performance was that
tariff adjustments did not keep in line with inflation which eccelerated from
401 in 1981 to 1591 in 1987. Railway tariffs for freight and passenger
traffic in Yugoslavia are applied and adjusted uniformly. Tariff adjustments
were governed by the provisions of the Sixth Railway Project (Loan 2336-YU)
which provided for tariffs to be adjusted annually in line with inflation plus
61 in real terms. The tariffs were increased in line with inflation plus the
61 as required. These adjustments, however, lagged behind in their impact as
the increases were made about twice a year with the major adjustment coming
late in the year. With inflation increasing to triple figures in 1987, this
delay in tariff adjustments had a major impact on the RTOs financial
performance. Under the Seventh Railway Project (Loan 3068-YU) a revised
tariff covenant to eliminate this delay in tariff adjustments has been agreed.
5.04        Two other factors contributed to the woor financial performance:
Mi) traffic did not increase as forecast; and (i.) projected staff reductions
were was not achieved. Freight traffic handleu by RTO Pristina in 1988 was
only 451 of the level forecast (para. 7.01). Staff was projected to decrease
by about 101 during the project period but actually increased slightly (para.
4.03).
cash Flow
5.05        Due to delays in construction, the original project works which
were planned to be completed in 3 years took over 7 years to complete. A
summary of the original Financing Plan for the period 1981-83 as compared to
the actual Financing Plan for the period 1981-87 is shown below. The figures
should be treated with caution as the conversion from dinars to US dollars
were made at annual average rates during a period of high domestic inflation.

The overall investment cost increased by US$9.9 million or about 15%.
Internal cash provided about 25S or double the original estimate of 12X. As
the project took twice as long to construct, the annual percentage level of
internal cash generation was about in line with the original projection.
Grants and Suppliers Credits combined provided about 36X of cost compared to
appraisal estimate of 381. The Bank loan percentage contribution was reduced
from 501 to 39X due to a combination if increased costs and cancellation of
part of the loan (US$4.03 million).

It was estimated at appraisal that the debt/equity ratio would be 38/62 by
1985. The actual results show a debt/equity ratio of 49/51 in 1985 due to the
reduced level of Grants received and the increased use of Suppliers Credits
(para. 5.05).
Audit
5.07        There were considerable difficulties in instituting an annual
audit, due to a reluctance on the part of RTO Pristina to engage an
independent auditor. Eventually in 1984, a contract was made with Social
Accounting Service (SDK). There were recurrent delays in submitting the audit
reports as the RTO did not provide the necessary staff to assist the auditors.
The first audit report received was for fiscal year 1984 and the auditor
expressed serious reservations mainly due to lack of accounting expertise in
the RTO and failure to apply Yugoslav rules regarding valuation of fixed
assets and foreign loans. The auditor issued a disclaimer on the Income
Statement of the 1985 accounts and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet for
1986. The main reason for the disclaimer on the Income Accounts was the



- 18 -
inability of the auditors to verify the fairness of the distribution by CYR of
the commonly generated income. To resolve this problem, agreement was reached
under the Seventh Railway Project that the CYR accounts would be audited by
SDK to the extent necessary to satisfy SDK as to the accuracy of revenue
allocated to the RTOs. A major management reorganization of the RTO was
implemented in 1988 (para. 3.17). As part of this reorganization, the
accounting function, which was formally undertaken by each of the six BOALs
within RTO Pristina, was centralized with a view to achieving maximum
utilization of the limited accounting expertise available. Training was also
provided under the Bank loan. It is expected that this reorganization and
training will over time result in the establishment of an acceptable
accounting system.
VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PEROME AND DVLPM
6.01        Management strength and capability of the newly created RTO
Pristina was limited at the time of appraisal. This was recognized and led to
specific recommendations by the Bank team such as to strengthen the Planning
Department by two additional professional posts, and to study, with the help
of consultants, the top level organization and the planning and controlling of
freight operations.
6.02        The RTO was unable to attract qualified professionals until 1986,
when the post of an engineer in the Planning Department could be filled. Tha
major reasons were unattractive pay conditions, housing problems, and,
therefore, the unwillingness of professionals from other republics to move
into this region. This was later exacerbated by political developments. In
addition, there were no young professionals from within the region who had
gained some experience elsewhere. As a result, management had to cope with
the staff present at the formation of the RTO, whose capabilities were barely
adequate for the complex processes of operating a railway system under own
responsibility. In addition, management was faced with the planning and
execution of large and technically complex investments. Project management
was not organized in a separate unit as agreed at negotiations because the RTO
could not find the necessary additional staff. Therefore, project tasks
including the follow-up of obligar.ions laid down in the Loan Agreement and
reporting were performed by several departments. The submission of audit
reports was recurrently delayed due to management's attitude (para. 5.07).
Consequently, while management's overall performance was quite good, given the
adverse circumstances, the results were less satisfactory than expected at
appraisal, especially after 1984 when problems were exacerbated by a
deteriorating economy.
6.03        The studies (paras. 3.16 and 6.01) were intended to assist
management in better conducting its affairs. However, being challenged by the
task of getting the investments underway, management found that it did not
have the capacity to also deal with these studies, which required substantial
cooperation and staff time, until 1984. Once the studies were carried out,
most of their recommendations (paras. 3.16 and 4.02-4.03) were quickly adopted
and produced, in the case of freight operations, remarkable results. The



- 19 -
reorganization of RTO became effective on January 1, 1988, and, therefore, the
expected benefits including staff reductions through attrition could not yet
be assessed.
6.04        The consultants' performance was very good.  They provided with
their recommendations a good organizational basis on which management can
conduct its affairs and operate the railways more efficiently.
VII. ECONOMIC EYALUATION
7.01        At appraisal, freight traffic in RTO Pristina amounted to 2.9
million tons and 248 million ton-kilometers (tkm) in 1979, comprising mostly
bulk commodities generated by mining, metallurgical and chemical activities
(Table 5). Passenger traffic totaled 2.0 million passengers and 363 million
passenger-kilometers (pkm) in the same year, including a significant amount of
commuter traffic. The appraisal anticipated that freight traffic would grow
to 559 million tkm by 1990 due to the completion of several heavy industry
projects that were planned at that time, and thtat passenger traffic would grow
to 198 million pkm. It was also intended to shift freight trains from the
congested main trunk line Belgrade-Nis-Skopje to the line vis Kosovo Polje,
which would have sufficient capacity after the construction of the new freight
yard and the modernization of the SS & TT installations on the line Lesak-
Djeneral Jankovic. Freight traffic initially increased to 304 million tkm in
1984, but then declined to 237 million tkm in 1988, which amounted to 451 of
the appraisal estimate (Table 4). Passenger traffic, on the other hand,
increased fairly steadily to 219 million pkm in 1988, or 113X of the appraisal
estimate.
7.02        The principal reason for the lower than expected growth of freight
traffic was the decline in economic activity which began in the 1980's, and
which contrasted with the economic expansion which took place in the 1970's.
The volume of rril freight traffic is highly correlated with economic
activity, with rail freight traffic throughout Yugoslavia growing at about 55X
of the rate of growth of gross domestic product (GDP) during 1963-85.
Yugoslavia followed an inward oriented development strategy at the time of
appraisal, and planned a number of investments in Kosovo in intermediate input
and extractive industries. These investments were not carried out due to a
shortage of investment funds after about 1983, and more recently due to a
shift towards an outward oriented development strategy which places less
emphasis on these industries. In particular, iron ore traffic stagnated
because the planned expansion of the 0Trepca" mines did not take place. A
major expansion of local coal production, planned in conjunction with the high
crude oil prices of the late 1970's did not materialize due inter alia to the
gradual reduction of oil prices during the 1980's. Non-metals traffic
stagnated due to the permanent loss of lime traffic caused by a shift in
technology at a local ferro-nickel smelter. Cement traffic declined due to
increasing road competition, and petroleum traffic patterns changed when the
Port of Bar opened in 1981. In addition, when freight traffic began declining
from 1985 onwards, the RTOs' Belgrade and Skopje reaction was to protect their



- 20 -
revenue by keeping traffic on their lines. Passenger traffic grew close to
appraisal expectations, due in part to low passenger tariffs.
7.03        It is now particularly difficult to forecast future rail traffic
in Kosovo because of uncertainty about the timing of Yugoslavia's economic
recovery and probable changes in the structure of the economy and trade.
Yugoslavia is a transport intensive country at present, generating about three
times the volume of both freight and passenger traffic relative to GDP as
Western European countries. Yugoslavia is embarking on a reform program to
increase the market orientation of the economy, which if successful is likely
to result in a relative decline in rail traffic, as the economy deemphasizes
some extractive and heavy industries which are important in Kosovo at present,
in favor of activities in which it has a comparative advantage. However, this
will be partly offset by faster economic growtih, aaid by an increase in
international traffic for which railways have a comparative advantage.
Freight traffic in Kosovo is therefore forecast to grow at a modest 0.5X p.a.
during 1989-91 and 1.71 p.a. during 1992-96, the average rate of traffic
growth anticipated for four other RTOs under the recently prepared Seventh
Railway Project. Passenger traffic in Kosovo is similarly forecast to grow
0.5s p.a. during 1989-91 and 2.21 p.a. during 1992-96.
Ex-Post Economic Evaluation
7.04        The internal economic rate of return for the project was
reestimated by updating the evaluation carried out at the time of appraisal.
The following changes were made in the parameters estimated for the appraisal:
(1)   Actual project costs, expressed in Yugoslav Dinars, were adjusted
to 1988 price levels, on the basis of changes in the Yugoslavia
Producer Price Index, and expressed in US dollars at the average
1988 exchange rate. US$ 1.5 million was added to the cost of the
Ko-s0vo Junction improvements reported through 1987, to allow for
completion of the signalling installation in 1988.
(2)   All costs and benefits were estimated net of tax, in 1988 prices.
(3)   The Kosovo Junction was assumed to be open to traffic in 1985, the
year after the freight yard was taken into operation. Other
signalling improvements and the diesel depot were assumed to be
available for use in 1988. Rolling stock was assumed to be
available in 1985, the mid-point of its procurement.
(4)   Benefiz and operations/maintenance cost streams were initially
adjusted to 1988 price levels in the same manner as investment
costs, and shifted to correspond to the revised project opening
dates. The appraisal estimate of project benefits which did not
vary significantly with traffic levels were not adjusted further
(avoided maintenance/rehabilitation of the Kosovo Junction, diesel
depot, and signalling systems; staff savings from signalling
improvements). Other infrastructure benefits were reduced 25% due
to the actual and expected shortfall in traffic. In particular,



- 21 -
the appraisal estimates were that traffic would increase from 605
to 757 million traffic units (tkm + pkm, TUs) during the first
seven years of project operation (1983-90), whereas it is now
anticipated that traffic will decline from 533 to 482 million TUs
during the first seven years of operation (say 1986-93). This
corresponds to a 25X reduction in average traffic levels during
the period of analysis. Benefit and cost streams were generally
held constant after 10 years (no further traffic growih assumed)
(5)  More traction and rolling stock was procured under the project
then anticipated at appraisal. Since traction and rolling stock
was procured primarily for replacement purposes, the appraisal
analysis of the benefits of traction and rolling stock procurement
was retained. Benefit streams were adjusted in proportion to the
volume purchased.
7.05        The economic rate of return for the project is reestimated to be
14.7X for traction and rolling stock investments and 5.01 for infrastructure
investments, or an average of 10.11 for the project (Table 9). This compares
with an appraisal estimate of 221 for rolling stock investments and 17-40X for
infrastructure investments, or an average of 221 for the project. The
principal reason for the lower than expected economic return for the project
is the shortfall in freight traffic (para. 7.02). The economic rate of return
was also lower than expected due to the delay in project implementation.
7.06        In aggregate, the project is estimated to remain marginally
justified.  If it had been possible at the time of appraisal to anticipate the
extent and duration of the economic recession which took place in the 1980s,
and the corresponding decline in rail freight traffic which began after 1984,
it would have been more economic to carry out a lower level program of
rehabilitation and improvements to relieve the capacity constraints and
improve the flow of traffic in the Kosovo Junction.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01        The project was prepared at a time of optimism with regard to the
development of the Province of Kosovo, rapid growth of its economy, and of
rail traffic. The newly created RTO had inherited an obsolete infrastructure
and old traction and rolling stock, and this contributed to a certain
enthusiasm of management in seeking to achieve substantial changes within one
5-year development plan.
8.02        The project emphasized investments in replacing and expanding the
RTO's Infrastructure. The Bank had a major impact in reducing the originally
proposed investment plan. Traffic, which at that time increased sharply from
year to year, was forecast to grow at quite high rates. While it was probably
reasonable to assume that coal mining and coal transport would grow rapidly
due to continued high oil prices, other assumptions were too optimistic,
leading to an overly ambitious program.

8.03        Too much reliance was placed on the RTO's ability to appoint
additional qualified staff. It appears that the conditions to attract
professionals were not explored in the necessary detail. Limited management
capability, which was known at the time of appraisal, continued to show its
effect throughout the whole project implementation because additional and well
qualified staff could not be hired. This, in turn, was one of the major
reasons for delays in project implementation and for not achieving some of the
agreed project targets. Political problems in the region exacerbate the
problem of recruiting qualified staff.
8.04        The investment plan of the RTO was carefully reviewed at
appraisal, and appropriate adjustments were made. Accordingly, the size of
the project per se was not unreasonable but its Implementation Schedule
clearly was. Based on experience with earlier projects, substantial delays
should have been anticipated, especially in the absence of proven experience
of the management of a new organizational entity (para. 3.03). The RTO was
barely three years old at negotiations, and, therefore, had no time to build
up institutional knowledge sufficient for carrying out such large investments
in a relatively short time.
8.05        Technical assistance, which was to improve conditions at an early
stage of the project, came too late (para. 6.03). Therefore, project
administration suffered; auditing was carried out reluctantly and mostly late
(para. 5.07) and reporting was mostly inadequate (3.10). Frequent Bank
supervision had to be used to gain full information. They regularly pointed
at deficiencies but, in the end, could only monitor the events (para. 3.09).
8.06        Traffic forecasts for passenger traffic were well achieved, but
those for freight traffic were severely affected by a general decline in the
whole country's economic activity. The project's economic justification,
unfortunately, depanded on achieving the forecast freight traffic growth with
the result that the project did not yield the expected economic returns but
remains nevertheless marginally justified.
8.07        As in many other railway projects, the Bank's expectations on the
financial performance were too optimistic. One of the main causes of the poo.
financial performance has been the Government's reluctance to raise railway
tariffs to compensate for rising costs at a time of rapid domestic inflation
(para. 5.03). As a result, financial covenants for the Seventh Railway
Project (Loan 3068-YU) have been made very specific to ensure timely tariff
adjustments.
8.08        The project results may be summarized as follow.: The project
achieved its basic objectives of modernizing the railway facilities of Kosovo,
however, the time taken to complete the project was over seven years compared
to the original timetable of three years. On the management side,
improvements were successfully implemented in freight operations. The
management reorganization was completed at the end of the project period so it
is too early to evaluate its impact. Most of the operational and financial
targets set under the loan were not achieved due mainly to: (i) delays in
project implementation; (ii) a fall in freight traffic; and (iii) Government



- 23 -
failure to authorize adequate tariff increases during a period ot high
inflation. Lower than expected traffic resulted In reducing the economic rate
of return to 10% compared to the appraisal estimate of 22%. The disappointing
performance under the project compared to appraisal estimates is due to both
unrealistic tarEets and poor project implementation.
8.09        The signalling, traction and rolling stock equipment provided
under the project are expected to be suitable for RTO Pristina's requirements
for the next 15 to 20 years. The newly established Planning Department and
the reorganization of management provides a firm base for the future
development of RTO Pristina. Financial performance is expected to improve as
tariff agreement with Yugoslav railways under the Seventh Railway Project
(Loan 3068-YU) are being implemented.
8.10        Our overall evaluation of the project is that it was marginally
successful and that the benefits will be sustained in the future.
