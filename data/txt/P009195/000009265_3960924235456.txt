FOURTH RLWY PROJECT (Loan 1026-lu)
FI    RAILY PROJECT (Loan 1534-YD)
ROSOVO RAILWAY PROJECT (Loan 1977-IU)
PREFACE -
1.        This is the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on the
Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026-YU of 1974), on the Fifth Railway Project
(Loan 1534-YU of 1978), and on the Kosovo Railway Project (Loan 1977-YU of
1981), respectively financed with Bank loans of US$93.0 million, US$100.0
million, and US$34.0 million. The Closing Date for the Fourth Project was
extended from Decembar 31, 1977, to June 31, 1981, and the amount of
US$335,793 was cancelled. The Closing Date for the Fifth Project was
extended from June 30, 1982, to September 10, 1984, and the amount of
US$473,344 was cancelled. The Closing Date of the Kosovo Project was
extended from December 31, 1984 to December 31, 1986, and the amount of
US$4.03 million was cancelled.
2.        The Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) prepared the
PlAR by reviewing the full set of files on the three projects; the Project
Completion Rei ¶rts (PCRs) prepared by the Bank's Europe, Middle East and
North Africa (EMENA) Regional Office; transcripts of the Executive
Directors' meeting which considered the projects; and published material on
the economy and the country. After discussing the project with Bank staff
in Washington during September and October 1989, ORD conducted a field
mission to Yugoslavia in November 1989 to visit project sites, and to
secure the views of the Borrower on project inception and implementation,
and on Borrower-Bank collaboration. The hospitality and assistance
extended by the Yugoslav autborities to the OED mission, as well as the
frank discussion of delicate aspects, is gratefully acknowledged. In most
respects, the audit review has confirmed the findings in the PCRs,
published in 1985, 1986 and 1990 for the three projects respectively.
3.        Between 1963 and 1989, the Board approved eight railway projects
for Yugoslavia, representing total lending of US$630 million. Research for
auditing the Fourth, Fifth and Kosovo Railway Projects was enlarged to
encompass the entire period so that experience from three lending
operations could be placed against a wider setting that would permit
exploration of the Bank's role in the Yugoslav railway subsector. Did the
Bank identify the correct issues? Did it adequately discuss its views with
the Borrower? Were Bank interventions appropriate? What would railway
performance be like without Bank assistance? The length of the period, the
importance of the issues, and the complex relationship between the Borrower
and the Bank, have encouraged the formulation of some suggestions which
might be useful when further collaboration is contemplated in the future.
4.        According to standard procedure, OED sent copies of the draft
PPAR to the Borrower for comments, however no replylwas received.

The-proJeqt wa to cov r th  1077-t8 pertod. Delays tn preparing tfsbi  ilty studies nd
differences of opinion bbwee  the Governmnt and Bank on subsidies an  tariffs slowed down
the appralsl proess until end 1970. Differonces persisted, cousing a second appraisel In
May 1977. Differences  til persisted and a third appraisal, In October 1977, reformulated
th  project for the 1018-8  period.  The Bank suggested, an  Govenmt agred, that the
prepration of 'Action Programel by RtOo would facilitate Implementation. Even" proved that
the solution wa not fully satifactory.
PROJCT SSPLMENATIAN
The  nam  ni! traffic ought to genrate most of the revenue, and the Governmnt
agreed In principlo. tn practice, Government coeld not, In a period of high Inflation
approe  adequate tariff lncrease. Th  Implementation schedule suemed too short a period for

Introduction
1.       The Yugoslav transport system comprises railways, roads, rivers,
ports and airports (para 1). Bank assistance to Yugoslav transport began in
1963 and, by 1989, had been expressed in total lending of US$1679.6
million, for eight railway projects, thirteen highway projects, one port
project, three earthquake rehabilitation projects, and two pipeline
projects (para 2). Completion of the Kosovo Railway Project led to a
clustered audit of the Fourth, Fifth and Kosovo Railway Projects. The
research done for the clustered audit allowed, in turn, a review of Bank
assistance to Yugoslav Railways (YR) between 1963 and 1990 (paras 3-4).
Bank assistance to Yumoslav Railways: 1963-1972
2.        Constitution, administration and status of YR in the early 1960s
(paras 5-6). The first three (1963-1968) Bank-financed Railway Projects
(par"s 7-10). Insufficient attention to technical aspects of preparation
and resulting implementation problems (paras 11-12). Macroeconomic
difficulties impacting upon YR (paras 13-17); status of YR in 1970 and
conclusions of a consultancy study (paras 18-20). Conditions for Bank
assistance to YR after 1972 (paras 21-22).
The Fourth. Fifth and Kosovo Rait.,v Projects
3.        Financial and operational difficulties of YR in 1972; growing
importance of road transport; erosion of the railway monopoly position.
The central objective of the three projects was institutional
strengthening: competitiveness was to be improved through increased
efficiency, quality of service and carrying capacity so that YR would no
longer depend on subsidies (para 23). Over the years, sight was lost of the
central objective, and conditions agreed in May 1972 for Bank assistance
were gradually compromised (para 24).

1972 but was incomplete and further appraisals became necessary in 1973.

The Bank's refusal to approve retroactive financing for certain items
included in the original scope complicated preparation. Negotiations were
in March/April 1974, Board approval in July 1974, but the project became
effective in February 1975 because of shortages of local funds (paras 25-
31).
5.        The project had the following obiectives -- (a) Physical:
Support the completion of the 1964 Modernization Program by financing
priority items in the 1974-76 slice of the Railway's 1973-77 Investment
Plan; (b) Operational: Increase efficiency, quality of service and carrying
capacity; (c) Institutional: Strengthen railway competitiveness by
reducing dependence on subsidies. The PPAR and the PCR agree that
implementation was not smooth (paras 56-67).
6.        Physical progress wss slower than anticipated.  Some investments
proved to be difficult to implement; lack of interim finance seriously
interrupted work through 1974 and part of 1975; goverment funds were not
made available on time due to the country's economic difficulties and
inflation (PCR, paras 3.05-3.09). The principal financial objective was to
reduce reliance on subsidies by increasing tariff revenues; this was not
achieved. The project enabled YR to improve operational efficiency,
quality of service, and ability to carry higher traffic volumes from 1977
onwards (PCR. paras 4.02, 5.01-5.03, and 6.01). The re-evaluated economic
return is 192 compared to 161 at appraisal (PCR, para 7.03).
Rallwayv V
7.        Preparation began in August 1974.  Appraisal took place in late
1976 but was incomplete and further appraisals became necessary in 1977.
Preparation was complicated by exchanges between the Bank and the Borrower
on tariffs and subsidies. Negotiations were in January 1978, Board
approval in March 1978 and the project became effective in September 1978
(paras 32-43).
8.          The project had the following obiectives -- (a) Physical:
Support the completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and finance
priority items in the 1978-80 time slice of the 1976-80 Investment Plan;
(b) Operational: Increase efficiency, quality of service and carrying
capacity; (c) Institutionait Strengthen railway competitiveness by reducing
dependence on subsidies. The PPAR and the PCR agree that implementation
was not smooth (paras 68-78). The project was originally intended to cover
the years 1977-1978 but delay in preparing feasibility studies and debates
on subsidies and tariffs slowed down the appraisal process until October
1977, when the proje-t was reformulated to cover the years 1978-80 (PCR,
para 2.05).
9.        Physical progress was slow because of delays in procurement of
track renewal materials, and shortage of local funds (PCR, paras 3.04-
3.05, 3.07). The financial objective was to reduce reliance on non-tariff
revenue. aCompensation" payments brought relief to the railway's liquidity
position but after 1979 tariff revenues were not able to keep pace with
costs. Tariff increases were inadequate in the second half of the project
period (PCR, pares 5,03, 5.05, 5.09-5.11). The project enabled YR to



xii
improve operational efficiency, quality of service, and carrying capacity.
Availability of locomotives was not what it should have been, largely
because of the country's foreign exchange position which limited funds for
spare parts (PCR, paras 4.02, 4.04). Re-evaluated economic rate of return
is about 18S compared to 152 at appraisal (PCR, para 7.03). YR
overestimated their ability to finance a larger investment program (PCR,
para 9.02). Procurement under ICB led to some problems because YR staff
were not familiar with Bank guidelines. The Borrower's tendency to favor
domestic bidders delayed Implementation. A realistic procurement schedule
would have taken into account the time needed to establish Letters of
Credit (PCR, pare 9.04). Technical assistance by foreign consultants
encountered difficulties in obtaining data from some RTOs but, as the
capability of Yugoslav consultancy firms increased over the years, such
problems have been reduced.
Rosovo Railvay
10.       Preiaration began in September 1977 and was plagued by delays in
Yugoslavia and debates within the Bank on whether the project should
proceed, given the limited compliance with Loan covenants under Railways V.
Appraisal took place in February 1980 but further discussions on covenant
compliance delayed negotiations until February 1981. The project was
approved in April 1981 and became effective in November 1981 (paras 44-
55).
iI.         The project had the following obiectives --  (a) Physical:
Support the implementation of RTO Pristina's 1981-1985 Investment Plan with
a view to modernize railway facilities in Kosovo; (b) Operational: Improve
the capacity, efficiency, and competitive position of the railway; (c)
Lnstitutional: Improve management and financial position of RTO Pristiza.
The PPAR and the PCR agree that imolementation was not smooth (paras 79-
87). The loan agreement was signed in May 1981 but did not become
effective until November 1981 because formation was delayed of the COI
which would provide compensation payments. There was a further two-year
delay attributable to procurement problems and to difficulties with land
acquisition.
12.       Operational targets were not achieved (PCRI, para 4.01). Staff
increased slightly, contrary to targets agreed at negotiations (PCR, para
4.03). Financial performance fell far short of targets (PCR, para 5.02).
The original project works, planned to be completed in 3 years, took nearly
7 (PCR, para 5.05). Reporting was inadequate and Bank supervision
missions, though regularly pointing at deficiencies could only monitor the
events (PCR, para 8.05). The appraised project (SAR, para 3.03) consisted
of the following components: (a) Reconstruction of Kosovo Junction; (b)
Procurement of traction, rolling stock and integrated transport equipment;
(c) Procurement of signalling and telecommunications systems; and (d)
Training and technical assistance. At the Borrower's request, the Loan
Agreement was amended (PCRI, pars 2.09). Correspondence between the
appraised project and the project which emerged after amendment is not easy
to establish.

13.       The estimated project cost was US$67.5 millUon (SAR, pars 5.07).
Actual project cost is US$77.4 million (PCR, para 3.19). Comparison of the
two figures is not meaningful because of project scope modifications during
Implementation (PCRI, para 3.02). Estimated project completion (as well as
the estimated Closing Date) wss December 31, 1984 (SAR, Annex I, Table 5).
Actual project completion took place In May 1989 because of procurement
problems, and difficulties with land acquisition (PCR, para 3.03).
Financial performance fell short of targets (PCR, pares 5.02-5.04). As
appraised, the project had an estimated ERR was 222 (SM, paras 4.09). The
amnded project has a re-estimated ERR of 10.12 (PCR, para 7.95).
Institutional strengthening had mixed results (PCR, paras,6.01-6.04).
14.       For all three projects, inception was fast and preparation
problematic. Differences of opinion between the Bank and the Borrovwer
regarding objectives complicated both the preparation and implemencation
phases, and led to non-achievement of financial targets (paras 90-91).
Lesson-learning was not what it should have been because neither the RAnk
nor the Borrower offered any incentives to their staff to learn from the
record before embarking upon a new project (psra 92).
Sustainabilitv of Project benefits
15.      0terational efficiency and quality of sorvice were Improved,
carrvina capacity was increased, and orranisational practices Were
strengthened. Financial results were not so encouraging although, without
the Bank's insistence for tariff Increases, they would have been much
worse. Regarding operational 10enefits, streams will continue to flow
during the rest of the economic life of the Improvements financed by the
Bank. Regarding financial benefits, unsettled conditions In early 1990,
allow no answers (pars 93). A third category, of longer-term benefits, is
certain to be sustainable: thanks to the Bank's insistence on feasibility
studies and careful estimates, cost-benefit analysis is now viewed in YR as
the proper procedure for choosing among investment alternatives. This
attitudinal change may be the most Important, and most sustainable,
contribution that the Bank has made to the strengtheniag of YR (pars 94).
Bank Assistance to YR In the 1980
16.       The Sixth Railway Project of 1983, which followvwd Kosovo, was
prepared and approved under the assumption that, though beset with
problems, the May 1972 agreement on conditions for further Bank lending to
YR, remained valid. This was not a sound assumption and deterioration of
the macroeconomic situation in the 1980s created further problems for YR
(paras 95-96). The Bank remained circumspect in its dealings with the
Borrower even though Bank staff had clear ideas as to what the Bank"s
strategy ought to encompass (parap 97-102). Circumspection was possibly
due to the complexity presented by the Yugoslav environment In the 1980.
(pars 103). In contrast to all previous operations, the Seventh Railway



xiv
Project of 1989 displa)Ps thoughtful caution and more realistic targets. The
changed attitude is a step forward in Bank-Borrower relations (pars 104).
Conclusions and recomendations
17.       The Bank identified the fundamental issue as early as 1972: YR
was no longer a monopoly, trucking was increasing its market share, but YR
could still play a significant role in trassport. To do so, YR would have
to become competitive, more responsive to market signals, less dependent on
subsidies. The Bank elaborated in detail on how these changes could come
about, the Borrower concurred with most suggestions but was not convinced
about the soundness of the central hypothesis -- that subsidies distort
resource allocation, and that a railway that counts on subsidies will not
be competitive (pare 105). The Borrower agreed to loan covenants designed
to reduce YR reliance on subsidies but when the covenants were not
observed, the Bank took no action to demonstrate the importance it attached
to the transformation of YR into a financially viable enterprise. In the
audit's opinion, this lack of firmness has reduced the Borrower's esteem
for the Bank (para 106).
18.       For the Bank, three lessons may contribute to the design of more
effective assistance (para 107).
*** The role of YR goes beyond transport pure and simple. Consequently,
and regardless of how advantageous -- from the economic and financial
viewpoint -- road transport may be, Government will not allow the
railway to wither away.
A -   Lacking an overall transport plan, the Bank cannot determine whether
specific investments in a given railway loan represent optimal use of
scarce resources. This suggests it will be unrealistic to hope that
any Bank loan will ever command sufficient leverage to influence
network-wide investment allocations. It also suggests that the Bank
ought to limit itself to ensuring that railway lnvestments included
in its loans are independently viable, that they have adequate
financing, and that they represent the least cost solution.
***  Despite some recent Improvements, Bank-Borrower relations have not
been either smooth or particularly cordial.   The socio-political
system may well constrain Yugoslav staff performance and the Bank
ought to have helped those who felt the need for change. There is no
evidence that any efforts were made in this difficult direction.
Bank insistence upon politically sensitive measures, plus insistence
that YR retain expatriate assistance, discouraged YR staff from
exerting themselves. In the future, much can be hoped if the Link
adopts a lems didactic attitude.
19.       It mid-1990, Yugoslavia is engaged in political and economic
transformations and the Bank should stand ready to provide massive support
to transport in general and to YR in particular. For such support to be
effective both the Bank and the Borrower would have to reconsider the bases
of their collaboration (para 108).



xv
***  Before any further assistance is contemplated, the Bank's sectoral
knowledge must be improved beyond its present rudimentary stage. The
Borrower ought to review his belief that participation by Bank staff
in transport sector planning would lead to political complications.
Yugoslav willingness to be more transparent is a precondition for
better collaboration.
*** Bank lending to transport does not seem to have been properly
balanced among the different modes. Rail-road competition,
integration of port-road-railway services, and tariff policies remain
unresolved and hinder the operation of the entire sector. The Bank
may consider postponing any further assistance until Yugoslav
authorities have worked out a sector-wide strategy that satisfies the
Bank's concern for economy and efficiency.
*** In mid-1990, political factors preserve YR in a state of flux. RTO
Pristina has again been incorporated into RTO Belgrade, and further
rearrangements are conceivable. Experience has shomn that direct
lending to RTOs does not produce lasting results, and that lending to
YR while RTOs are designated as Executing Agencies, though
politically desirable, is operationally onerous. Regarding future
Bank lending to railways, the audit has the following suggestions:
(a) Yugoslavia is one country, and can afford one railway. For Bank
loans, YR should be both the Borrower and the Executing Agoncy.
(b) No covenants or conditions that the Bank is not determined to
enforce should be attached to any Bank loan.
(c) The one covenant which should accompany all future Bank loans,
and which ought to be rigorously enforced, will have to be tied
to a progressive reduction of subsidies. Over the past twenty
years, no convincing evidence has been forthcoming that a
railway which can count on subsidies will ever be competitive.
18.       A general finding, which escapes the ambit of this report, has
to do with the unsatisfactory state of the Bank's records. File documents
must be numbered sequentially for the record to be secure and complete. As
matters stand, any document can be removed and, without systematic filing,
the removal may pass unnoticed (par"s 28, 29, 33, 35, 37, 40, 42, 49, 50,
39, 63).

- I INTRODUCTION
1.        In few other countries has transport been so affected by
geopolitics as in Yugoslavia. For centuries, kingdoms and empires fought
on its soil over control of transit corridors between Europe and the Middle
East, and over access to the Adriatic from landlocked European territories.
Until the railroad came in the late 1800s, transport was mostly by sea and
river, and only secondarily by roads which were frequently made impassable
by rain or snow and, at ani event, were deliberately kept in poor condition
to discourage thoughts of invasion. In more recent times, two World Wars
contributed mightily to the expansion of railroads, a mode of transport
favored by General Staffs worldwide. From the 1950s, road transport has
been growing, but although it has now replaced railroads as the dominant
carrier, 11 it has not eliminated any of the competing modes. Thus, in the
late 1980s, the country's transport network reflects legacies of the past,
and comprises railways, 21 roads, 31 rivers, 41 ports, and airports.
lt  In 1965, the railway carried 18.0 billion ton-km of freight, and the
road network carried 7.0 billion. In 1987, the corresponding figures
were 26.1 and 45.4. In 1965, the railway carried 12.1 billion
passenger-km, and the road network carried 17.0 billion.  In 1987,
the corresponding figures were 11.8 and 140.0.
2~I  Total length of the railway networks 9,245 km.
/1   Total length of the road networks 130,000 km, of which about 67,000
km have been paved by 1989.  Total road vehicle fleet in 1987: 3,3
million vehicles, excluding motorcycles and asgricultural tractors.
The fleet includes about 260,000 trucks and 29,000 buses. About 40S
of the trucks are own-account vehicles operated r:ainLy by large
enterprises. Another 19S belongs to some 300 social sector transport
enterprises, and-about 401 are small trucks operated by,private
individurals.
Al ITotal length of the inland wateway network: 2,200 km. Total fleets
300 tugs and 600 barges.

In round figures, eight railway projects accounted for US$630-million;
thirteen highway projects for US$812 million; one port project for US$44
million; three earthquak  rehabilitatioa projects for US$85 millions and    -
two pipeline projects for US$109 million, tend$ng of this magnitude over
three decades would allow useful insights into the effectivnss of Bank
assistance to the transport sector. Since 1987, ORD has been consid.ring a
study on this topic but resource and time constraints preclude that a
review encompassing all sub-sectors.might be undertaken in the Imuediate
future. The second-best solution is to deal with each sub-sector --
separately.

3.        In June 1989, the EMENA Regional Office submitted to O0D a draft
PCR on the Kosovo R4ilway Project (Loan 1977-YU).  PCRs on the Fourth
Railway Project (Loan 1026-YU) and on the Fifth Railway Project (Loan 1534-
YU) were respectively published In 1985 and 1986 but neither project had
been audited. Completion of Kosovo led to a combined audit of all three
projects, which, in turn, led to an examination of BMak Assistane to
Yugoslav Railways (YR) that began with the First Railway Project of 1963
and continueS with the Seventh Railway Project of 1989. The objective was
to explore such questions ass Did the Bank identify the correct issues? Did
It adequately discuss its views with the Borrower? Were Bank interventions
appropriate? What would railway performance be like without the assistance
extended by the Bank? Which lessons from the past may Improve the
effectiveness of Bank assistance in the future?
4.        The rest of this combined PPAR contains three sections.  The
first discusses Bank assistance during the 1963-1972 period. The second
examines the Fourth, Fifth, and Kosovo Railway Projects. The third
discusses Bank assistance in the 1980s and offers some recommendations that
might be taken into account when further assistance is contemplated in the
future.
1I. BANK ASSISTA1ICE TO 1UCGSLAV RAILWAYS: 1963-1972
Backaround
5.        Yugoslav Railways is the amalgamation of several systems built
by different states in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth century.
After the Second World War, YR was reorganized on the principle of worker's
self-management, under which employees of different railway enterprises
take part in management and profit distribution. In the mid-1960s, there
were 22 such regional enterprises, grouped under four 'Commnnities of
Railway Enterprises", which coordinated day-to-day operations and made
investment decisions affecting their imediate jurisdictions. Above the
four regional Communities, the "Community of Yugoslav Railways' (COYR),
coordinated operations and investments at the national level.
6.        Until 1965, the railway was a protected monopoly. Annual rates
of freight traffic growth dropped from 6.42 in 1956-60 to 4.72 in 1960-64,
and road transport grew at about 25% every year, but Government continued



4
to rely on the railway for the bulk of the country's transport needs. Al
Thus sheltered, YR did not Invest much and continued to use an ad valorem
tariff, two practices that would have been impossible in a competitive
environment. As a result, most of the railway equipment was antiquated in
the middle 19608, 61 and this inspired the launching of the 1964-70
Modernization Plan which aimed to improve services, and to provide better
connections between the interior and coastal areas by building new and
upgrading existing transversal lines. This Plan was to be the major
channel for Bank assistance to the railway sub-sector.
The First Three Railway Pro1ects
7.        Bank assistance began In 1963 with the First Railway Project,
whose physical objective was to upgrade the Sarajevo-Ploce line, and which
was completed in 1970, with a delay of four years. The Second Railway
Project (1964) Included modernization of three main-line sections and
improvment of six marshalling yards. Implementation was delayed, the
project was refinanced under Railways IV, and was finally completed in
1981, at more than twice the original cost estimate. The Third Railway
Project (1968), which built the remaining 372 km of new line of the 476 km
railway between Belgrade and Bar, also had significant overruns in time
(852) and cost (871).
8.        In the late 1960s, Bank-Government dialogue had become dissonant
during long debates on whether rail-way revenues ought to be primarily
derived from traffic or from subsidies. Disagreements over financial and
managerial questions were symptomatic of the unacknowledged clash between
ideologies.
S/   Table 1.2 of the Staff Appraisal Report on the Seventh RailwaX
Proiect (April 26, 1989), makes the point that, over the past thirty
years, and notwithstanding reduction of output share, Government
allocations for transport investment, when they did not outright
favor the railway, were evenly distributed between railways and
roads.

and, of these, about 1,500 were more than 35 years old. More than
two-thirds of the rolling stock was over-age, the signalling system
was in poor condition, and stations and marshalling-yards had rot
been modernized for 40 years.

9.        For the Government, railway upgrading, expansion, and
modernization did have important dimensions related to transport pure and
simple. At the same time, large allocations of foreign funds to provinces
and republics promised benefits far more significant than any increase of
transport efficiency. At the international level, all Yugoslavs are united
in their desire for independence but, at the domestic level, federal
authorities must accommodate five nationalities, four languages, three
religions and two alphabets. 7/ Under the circumstances, the use of large
volumes of external funds to improve a railway covering the whole of the
national territory, seemed like a good instrument for promoting community
relations. It promised better transport, fuller political integration,
and, perhaps most important, the channeling of financial and technical
resources to increasingly vocal regions.
10.       The distinction between 'economic  asnd 'other' benefits is
crucial because the Bank finances development projects whose implementation
ought to be carried out with due regard to economy and efficiency. The
Borrower's socio-political environment is a major parameter but not major
enough to compromise technical aspects of project preparation, which, for
railways, requires observation of conditions such as the following:
A A detailed review of a railway system has to be done before
identifying a specific project within the investment
requirements of the entire system.
*** Attempts to strengthen railway operations ought to give priority
to institutional and managerial aspects.
*^* The impact of railway projects on other modes has to be studied
in detail, especially when rail transport at the time of
appraisal accounts for much of the country's transport output.
A** Analyses of sector policy, and of the potentially conflicting
effects of Bank-financed highway and railway projects, have to
be included in the appraisal of a railway loan.
* ^Output forecasts for the transport sector as a whole have to be
the basis for railway traffic projections, especially in cases
where dramatic increases of road traffic invalidate forecasts
based on past trends.
11.       If these are reasonable conditions, preparation of the first
three railway projects was insufficient. All three were approved before
any detailed review of YR had taken place; institutional and mahagerial
Issues were not studied in depth; sector-wide issues did not benefit from
systematic attention; the potentially conflicting effects of Bank-financed
railway and highway projects did not receive the attention they deserved.
12.       The three projects soon displayed implementation delays and cost
overruns, which the Bank did not regard as evidence of insuperable
problems, since the first few projects in any country always have teething
71   The country consists of 6 Republics and 2 Autonomous Provinces.
Relations among the eight units are so intricate that the 1974
Constitution comprises more than 400 articles. This makes it
the longest such document in the world, with the exception of
the Indian Constitution.

troubles. Real difficulties emerged when the prospect for good project
results began to be scrutinized during supervision missions. Given that
the loans had been justified on "economic" and "policy' grounds, results
had to be measured according to 'economic' and 'policy' yardsticks
established at the appraisal stage. The stumbling-block was that progress
was limited because the stated targets were unattainable in a setting where
job security was prized above staff productivity, and communal peace took
precedence over better maintenance of electric locomotives.
13.       In 1970, the gap between the positions of the Government and the
Bank beeame so wide that, if the Bank were to adhere to its declared
principle of financing only economically justified projects, it would have
had to suspend further lending to YR. The reasons why this did not happen
will emerge in the course of the discussion on the Fourth, Fifth and Kosovo
Railway Projects.  In fact, railway lending kept growing and, eventually,
new loans were made so that ongoing projects would achieve their targets.
One illustration of this vicious circle is in a March 6, 1972 internal Bank
note on 'Yugoslavia -- Railwayst Proposed Bank Action' which notes that the
Bank should play a role in a program designed to put Yugoslav Railways back
on a sound basis to ensure that our ongoing projects achieve their
objectives; because of the Importance which the railways have for the
Yugoslav economy; and because without Bank involvement the necessary
improvement in policies and country-wide coordination would be less likely
to materialize. Therefore, the note went on, the Bank should be prepared
to consider further lending based on an agreed-upon program of action. The
basic point is revealing: in 1972, the Bank was no longer there to upgrade
and modernize YR but to help put them back on a sound basis. But what was
it that caused YR, a transport monopoly in a centrally-planned economy, to
find themselves on an unsound basis? And would it be possible to identify
the turning-point in an environment as intricate as that of Yugoslavia?
14.       Even In the 1960s, the Federal Government had become aware of
the complexity, rigidities, and costs of the Yugoslav system which, in
early 1990, Is experiencing major dislocations. Hoping to increase
efficiency and, simultaneously, to reduce ethnic friction, the Government
lsunched a decentralization drive. The Economic Reforms of 1965
decentralized YR by creating five "Railway Transport Enterprises" (RTEs),
roughly corresponding to each of the Republics. The principle was laudable
but its application backfired. Within YR, decentralization was difficult
to Implement because responsibilities could not be defined among Federal,
Republic, and local governments. At the sector level, it induced & `-ster
than expected growth of road transport, which eliminated the monopoly
previously enjoyed by YR. Thus, the 1965 Reforms were the central, though
not the only, reason why, seven years later, YR found themselves on an
unsound basis.
15.       A second reason was nation-wide inflation which, aside from
increasirg prices, made fiscal and credit policies more restrictive.
Adequate tariff increases were seldom allowed, and it became hard for YR to
obtain funds from Republic Governments, or from the credit system.
Meanwhile, YR were to implement the ambitious, and costly, investment
program outlined in the 1964-70 Modernization Plan. Since Internally-
jenerated resources were expected to finance a large portion of the
proposed investments, poor financial performance made it impossible to



adhere to the original targets. Long delays were registered during the
implementation of Bank-assisted projects because the Federal Government,
squeezed by liqutdity problems, could not always make available the
necessary local funds. Decentralization and inflation created a chain-
reaction whichs, in turn, revealed several of YR's internal shortcomingsi
lack of a commercial policy, difficulties in fighting road competition,
inadequate planning and engineering.
16.       The impact of these shortcomings was neither sudden :ior
unexpected. For years, both the Government and the Bank observed the
troubles of a railway whose financial position and liquidity had been
deteriorating. Costs rose partly because of inflation, and partly because
of devaluation of the Dinar whose exchange rate to the US dollar went from
7.5 to 17 between 1966 and 1972. Payments for railway freight services
were held back. It was hard to improve YR commercial and accounting
practices because, under the decentralization policy, railway management
Was vested in five self-accounting RTEs, each associated with one of the
Yugoslav Republics (except Belgrade which served Serbia and Montenegro) and
loosely coordinated by the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR).
17.       Reunification of the five RTEs into one system would reduce
costs, lmprove management, and simplify operations, but the politics of
decentralization dictated othewise. Matters were complicated further
because Federal Government obligations to meet railway deficits had been
transferred to Republic Governments, which were unwilling to assum this
responsibility in full. Workers' self-management was known to increase
costs but nothing could be done about it. Government regulation restricted
UR ability to respond to market conditions, and this led to loss of traffic
to road transport, which could be expected to grow further thanks to the
substantial new road investments being planned. YR management, fragmented
between CYR and RTEs, had difficulty in adapting to a commercial
eavironment and they needed information, planning, marketing, and public
relations services.
18.       By 1970, the status of the railway sub-sector could have been
summarized as follows:
Role of the Railways
Crucial for international transit traffic. Crucial for bulk and
long-distance domestic freight traffic. Increasing competition from
road for all traffic categories, and especially for passengers.
Government Authority and Railway Ortanization
Five autonomous RTEs loosely coordinated by CYR, which was so weak It
could not perform its duties as laid out in the 1966 Railway Law. CYR
needed to be strengthened. There was lack of disciplIne in the
organization and staff were not motivated to do their work. Surplus
labor decreased railway competitiveness: about 10,000 surplus workers
presented an extremely diffictlt problem.
Traffic. Marketing and Pricine
No traffic data available. Difficult to assess the quality of
service. Freight rates could not be raised much because of road
competition. Pricing policy ought to be reviewed in relation to the



8
offered quality of service. Lack of knowledge regarding operational
costs made it difficult to estimate the profitability of different
services. YR made very limited marketing efforts.
Plannina and Investment
General planning weak and without clear objectives. Planning should
be done by CYR but, under the decentralization policy, the most t-xt
could be hoped for would be to have the CYR set the methodology a A
perform a coordinating function. The 1971-75 Modernization Plan was
a shopptag list containing what was desirable, with minimum concern
about what was economically justified.
Financina
Lack of funds for investments obliged YR to get equipment from
abroad, financed by supplier's credit, for much higher prices than
they could have achieved domestically, where, however, no financing
was available. The accounting system needed revision. New
procedures were needed for financial and cash control. Depreciation
needed attention because YR did not secure enough funds for
replacement of worn-out assets.
19.       In the late 1960s, the Bank knew that, judged in terms of time
overrunst cost overruns, and efforts to improve YR's competitive position,
the railway projects it financed were not successful. In 1970 the Second
Project was extended by three years in the hope that, with the help of
annual  action programs", it would be completed by March 1973.  All the
same, it was feared that the new deadline would not be met and that unless
drastic action were taken, problems would worsen. In 1970, the Bank
insisted that the time had come for a systematic look at the railway system
as a whole and, in 1971, consultants were retained to carry out a
comprehensive review. Their report, which was examined at length in the
Bank in January-February 1972, made the following points:
YR were trying to follow conflicting commercial and social
objectives;
*** they had too many staff and too many freight stations;
***  they were strong in the loyalties of their operating and
engineering staff, and weak on the commercial side of marketing
and customer relations;
*** they were short of both investment funds and good investment
planning;
**-* their tariffs were published and Government controlled, while
those of their competitors were not;
***  there was increasing traffic diversion to road and other modes,
but, with a sufficiently flexible tariff poli. -, traffic might
come back to the railway.
The study's overall conclusion was that YR could play a strong role in tho
Yugoslav economy provided that management and performance were improved,
and that a realistic investment program could be prepared.
20.       None of the above findings was new either to YR or to the Bank,
but a good summary of, hat everyone knows often serves to dramatize the
need for solutions whicht otherwise, tend to be constantly postponed.



9
After a ten-year and $155 ti2.lion association with YR, the Bank implicitly
acknowledged that the impact of its assistance had been modest and that
project preparation would have to be much tighter in the future. In late
1971, the Bank was contemplating a Fourth Railway Project and the feeling
was that the composition and terms of the new loan would have to take into
serious account the major conclusions of the consultancy study.
Conditions for Bank Assistance after 1972
21.       By March 1972, the Bank had decided on its course of action.  A
mission would go to Yugoslavia to emphasize that any further financing of
YR would be conditional on a realistic economic and financial approach to
problems. Particular attention would be devoted to the followingSt
*** Government responsibility for YR should be made explicit, and
firm financial commitments ought to made by the Federal and
Republic Govetm=ents;
*** Planning and coordinating functions of CYR should be
strengthened to make them more effective; and
*** Plans of action should be prepared for YR as a whole and for
each RTE separately.
22.       A mission did visit Yugoslavia in May 1972 and it recommended
that, following comprehensive discussions with the Yugoslav authorities,
the Bank ought to assist in the solution of the problems faced by YR
subject to being satisfied on three conditionst
(a) The preparation of a new Investment Plan, including all items
planned by YR up to the completion of the Modernization Program,
whether these would be financed by the Bank or other sources
(b) The preparation of a Financing Plan, including a demonstration
of the YR ability to service loans
(c) The joint preparation by YR and Government of an Action Plan
responding to the consultant's management-related
recommendations.
These three conditions implied formidable modifications in the relationship
between the Bank and Yugoslavia on the one hand, and between the Federal
Government and YR on the other. The first condition said that the Bank
would have a decisive say over all investments in the railway network,
regardless of whether it financed them in whole, in part, or not at all.
The second condition said that YR would, in effect, operate as a commercial
enterprise. The third condition said that YR and Government would adopt
managerial principles which were not fully in accord with the Yugoslav
socio-political system. Time would show that conditions of this nature are
far from easy to implement.

III.  THE FOURTH. FIFTH AND KDSOVO RaWAY ROJECTS
A.   PREPARATION
23.       In 1972, the railway was no longer a monopoly.  Competition from
road transport was reducing railway traffic and revenues. Decentralization
led to duplication of expensive facilities (such as workshops), to
underutilization of expensive assets (such as locomotives), and to
productivity losses (because the large staff were given few incentives).
The railway was generating 'ess income at a time when investments and
operation coSts were imposing a heavy burden on public coffers, be they
Federal# Republican, or Provincial. This was how things stood when
preparation began for the Fourth Railway Project and, after the 1970171
consultancy study and the May 1972 meeting, the Bank's position was
explicit: assistance to the railway had to be such that, over time, the
system would become competitive. The Fourth, Fifth and Kosovo Railway
Projects did contribute to infrastructural $mprovements, track
rehabilitation, and motive and rolling stock acquisition. However, their
central objective was institutional strengthening: competitiveness was to
be improved through increased efficiency, quality of service, and carrying
capacity, so that YR would no longer impose upon public funds by depending
on subsidies.
24.       In the years that followed, sight was gradually lost of the
central objective. Unfortunately, the long and complicated story cannot be
told in epigrams, and to grasp how the conditions agreed in May 1972
regarding further Bank assistance to YR were compromised, it is necessary
to go into intricate detail, and to follow each step carefully during
preparation and implementation. Throughout, what must not be overlooked is
the speed with which the next project was identified, even though the
previous one was hardly underway. Phase overlap of the three projects is
shown below:

Ralways IV
From Pre_sration to Effectiveness: June 1972 - February 1975
25.       Preparation of the Fourth Project began in June 1972.  Bank
reports on 'Pre-appraisal Preparation' and two separate 'Pre-appraisals'
suggest that the work carried out by YR with consultant assistance was not
what it should have been. Nevertheless, it was decided that appraisal
ought to go ahead.
26.       Appraisal took place in NovemberlDecember 1972.  The January 4,
1973 Issues Paper (IP), hinted that pressure was being brought to bear so
that processing be accelerated, negotiations be conducted in April 1973,
and the project be kept in the lending program of FY1973. The IP revealed
that, in the interest of speed, the Appraisal Mission had been flexible
with regard to financial aspects, Action Plans, Uneconomic Lines and
Services, jI and pricing policies 91
27.       Agreed conditions for further Bank lending were not being
observed, and this was pointed out by the Bank's Central Projects Staff
(CPS), who, in numerous internal notes, comented unfavorably on the
January 4 IP. A January 8, 1973 note, questioned the IP assumption that
continued heavy investment in the railways was justified. Another note
said that the IP dealt with a large number of 'issues' in detail$, but did
not integrate them to emphasise the major policy matters on which final
decisions have to be taken. It was apparent (the note went on), that
appraisal was not in fact complete. For example, essential information
would not be available for appraisal until February, when another mission
was to visit Yugoslavia. For these and other reasons, final decisions
could not be taken but the I? nevertheless recommended (mediate actions
which would anticipate a further loan. However, the real issue was whether
the Bank accepted right away that a further loan would be made, and whether
it would make the necessary commitments.
28.       After such criticism, a January 17, 1973 telex informed the
Government that appraisal was not complete and that further work would be
needed. File documents are missing between February and July 1973, which
makes it hard to say exactly how subsequent processing was conducted,
though available documents give the impression that verbal instructions
were issued on aspects as critical as project composition. What the record
does contain are two different Decision Memoranda (dated January 17 and
8/ The IP notes that YR were expected to produce action plans for the
elimination of about 2,700 km of uneconomic lines, and for payments
of compensation by end 1972. Neither had been done and the Appraisal
Mission requested that they be completed by January 1973.
9I   Here, the issue was to secure rate increases for 1973 at least equal
to those proposed by the eonsultancy study (i.e., in comparison with
1972, a 4 percent real increase for freight and 10 percent for
passengers). Once again, decisions had been delayed.



12
August 1973), although the IP for the latter is not in the file. In the
meantime, another problem was about to surface.
29.       In September 1973, Bank management informed the Government it
did not agree to the retroactive financing which the leader of the May 1972
mission had recommended for approval. For more than a year the Yugoslav
authorities had taken it for granted that this financing would be
forthcoming and their disappointment was intense. On the Bank's side, a
'Further Appraisal" became necessary because new items had to be identified
to make up the shortfall created in the loan amount by the removal of items
for which retroactive financing had been expected. A November 16, 1973 BOR
states that the loan amount should be US$75 million because of inflation,
depreclation, etc., and goes into enormous detail on everything even
remotely associated with the project except ona question: whether the Bank
should continue financing railway projects. This was taken for granted.
The record contains no Decision Memorandum (DM) on the 'Further Appraisal'.
30.       Negotiations took 18 days in March/April 1974, exactly one year
after the date forecast In the January 1973 IP. The June 20, 1974
President's Report (PR) contains three sections of great significance for
this and all subsequent railway projects. The first says that its lending
volume gave the Bank enough leverage to promote policy change. The second
says that project design took serious account of the lessons from previous
lending operations, and that conclusions and recommendations of the 1972
Consultancy Study constituted an integral part of project objectives. The
third says that the project was to Improve YR competitiveness, which it
proposed to assist through measures that would reduce costs and increase
efficiency. Time would show that little use was made of leverage, that
lessons of the past were seldom incorporated into future operations, and
that competitiveness remained an elusive goal.
31.       Railways IV was approved by the Bank's Board of Executive
Directors in July 1974. One month later, the record contains a Project
Brief (PB) for the Fifth Railway Project. Six months later, in January
1975, a Supervision Report (SR) states that Railways IV was still not
effective because conditions had not been met due to severe shortages of
local funds.  Nevertheless, the Supervision Mission (SM) recommended that
it be declared effective because "the conditions for effectiveness have
been satisfied in substance", and that the size of the proposed Railways V
ought to be large "to retain leverage". Railways IV was declared effective
on February 15, 1975.
Railways V
From Prenaration to Effectivenesst Auaust 1974 - September 1978
32.       The August 30, 1974 PB states that the Fifth Railway Project,
though not yet identified, would support priority investments by YR during
the final stage of the 1973-77 plan period and beyond.  The project's
estimated cost was unknown, but the PB felt that a Bank Loan of about US$60
million would be appropriate. On Status and Problems the PB notes that the
project would be identified during a SM of Railways IV in early 1974, and
that "No urgent issues had been identified". This ls a surprising
statement because tariff, organization, management, and financing issues



13
had been extremely urgent a mere two months before, and Railways IV, which
was to confront them, had not yet been declared effective because of severe
shortages of local funds. Nevertheless, and despite experience with
Railways I-IV regarding time needed to prepare projects in Yugoslavia, the
Tentative Timetable in the PB for Railways V gives the following target
dates: Identifications end 1974 -- Preappraisals Spring 1975 -- Appraisal:
mid-1975 -- Negotiations: early 1976 -- Board presentations April 1976. In
actual fact, and as will be shown below, Board presentation took place two
years later than foreseent in March 1978.
33.       Once again, there are gaps in the record after August 1974.
Discussions with the Yugoslav authorities did continue between September
1974 and September 1975 but there is scant evidence of what was actually
said or done. Between May and September 1975, Railways IV got underway and
imediately ran into difficulties over selection of technical assistance
staff, Import restrictions, etc. Still, a July 25, 1975, SR on Railways
IV, after acknowledging the problems plaguing the ongoing project, went on
to recomend a Bank loan of US$125 million for Railways V on the grounds
that this would help with leverage.
34.       The Bank's Operations Policy Staff (OPS) noted that adequate
progress under the ongoing project in regard to investments, action plaos
and other institutional changes, as well as progress in relevant studies,
would be needed before a new project could be appraised. They went on to
discuss road-rail competition, to stress that the next project ought to
start with a sound appreciation of conditions in each RTE, and to emphasize
that study of these problems should not be postponed for the Fifth Project.
They then returnedl to the "total program approach", which had been
neglected during negotiations of Railways IV, and said that whatever Items
might be found suitable for financing under the Fifth Project, the Bank
should be involved in the total investment program of the RTEs, in the
definition of the total program, and in considering the major works
included in the program. OPS concluded by noting that aspects deserving
careful monitoring were YR's financial situation, and the fact that tariff
adjustments to meet inflationary cost increases continued to be lagging.
35.       The record does not show how the above observations were taken
into account during subsequent preparation of Railways V but a December 18,
1975 document entitled "Supervision of Preparations for Appraisal of
Proposed Fifth Railway Project* reveals that a five-man mission discovered
that the work done so far was unsatisfactory and that the appraisal
scheduled for November 1975 would have to be postponed until March 1976.
On the same day, the mission wrote a memorandum ("Yugoslavia: Amount and
Allocation of Proposed Fifth Railway Loan") urging an increase in the
proposed loan amount for the sake of leverage.
36.       In February/March 1976, three problems bogged down processing of
Railways V: tariffs, investment plans, and financing plans. Tariffs was
the most troublesome and since this one topic would dominate Bank-
Government exchanges for years, it deserves some elaboration.
YR had financial difficulties with deficits and shortages of working
and investment capital. It had been receiving specific subsidies
from the Republics and Provinces for tariff increases withheld and



14
for losses on uneconomic lines, as well as general subsidies for any
remaining deficits. In addition, certain railway investments had
been financed by grants. An important objective of Railways IV was
to render YR financially viable by increasing tariffs sufficiently to
eliminat, deficits and enable YR to finance about 30 percent of the
cost of capital investments over the 1974-76 period. A 'Social
Agreement" was signed in 1974 enabling YR tariffs to rise in
proportion to inflation. YR estimated they needed a 30 percent
tariff increase from January 1, 1975, but only 22 percent was granted
them. Further inflation in 1975 suggested that a 20 percent tariff
increase would be needed as from January 1976, but only 8 percent was
granted. Thus, certain operating costs, as well as the RTE's
contributions to YR investments, had to be financed from subsidies.
In 1975, when YR realized they would not be granted tariff increases,
they introduced the concept of 'compensation": since road users are
subsidized by not having to pay for the full cost of road facilities,
Government should subsidize part of the railway infrastructure. YR
accordingly included in their financial forecasts an infrastructure
subsidy which, depending on the RTE, replaced wholly or in part the
subsidy for tariff increases withheld. These forecasts showed
subsidies (excluding investment grants) averaging about US$300
million equivalent per year over the 1976-80 period. On February 26,
1976, YR submitted in writing to the Bank this proposal to increase
subsidies, which were now presented as 'compensation". The proposal
was contrary to the spirit of Railways IV, and would have required
the Bank's agreement under Section 5.05 of the Subsidiary Agreement.
Given the total lack of precedent, this would not be an easy matter.
The Bank had never agreed to an increase of subsidies over a long
period and if it agreed to the YR proposal it would tacitly invite
similar demands from other Borrowers.
37.       Once again, gaps in the record make it hard to say how
preparatory work proceeded. Thus, a June 25, 1976 SR on Railways IV, after
giving the ongoing project a 3 rating (i.e., "Major Problems"), says the
following with respect to "Financial Results", a topic with direct bearing
on whether or not Railways V preparation ought to continue: tariff
increases had been restricted and had been replaced by subsidies; while
these decisions ran counter to the spirit of Agreements, a technical breach
of these Agreements did not appear to exist, except in so far as the
Federal Government's anti-inflationary measures may constitute a breach of
the Guarantee Agreement by affecting adversely the railways' performance.
38.       Starting in August 1976, the Bank softened its position.  The
August 18, 1976 TOR for a "Review of Preparation for Appraisal", was
followed on September 1, 1976 by a report on "Review of Preparation for
Railways V", which noted that Government was committed to subsidies and
that any consideration of Railways V ought take account of the
unsatisfactory progress of Railways IV. All the same, the mission
recommended that subsidies be accepted as a fact of life and urged that
project preparation of Railways V be speeded up. The file contains a
document on "Lending Program FY77 and PY78: Relative Position of Yugoslavia
Railways V and Turkey Railways II Projects", which supports subsidies,
because the necessary funds would be provided by "Communities of Interest"



15
(COI) consisting of railway users. COIs were expected to exert pressure
for cost reductions, and this would enable them to decrease their
contribution.   Even so, the document advised cautionu  the mission
scheduled for September 27 ought to be called an "Identification Mission"
rather than a "Preappraisal Mission' because " ... We are so far away from
an.acceptab.e project that there Is no prospect to tailor it to reasonable
limits which can be agreed with Government of the Railways in tlime to
process a project to the Board by June 1977 ..." This note was followed on
September 16, 1976 by a telex softening the Bank's position on tariffs and
subsidies, and on October 13, 1976 by "TOR for Appraisal".
39.       The October/November 1976 appraisal led, on December 8, 1976, to
an IP which identified three issues: Tariffs and Subsidies; Project
Financing; ar.d Loan Size.  The Appraisal Mission recommendations on tariffs
and subsidies were incompatible with the objectives of Railways IV but the
IP suggested that the loan allocation for Railways V be increased to US$100
million. Fortunately, quality control within the Bank once again
prevailed: the January 17, 1977, DM records that the appraisal was judged
to be incomplete, and that outstanding issues would have to be looked into
again. This took one more year.
40.       Preparation continued and the file contains an April 19, 1977
document, entitled 'Proposed Fifth Railway Project-- Completion of
Appraisal', which asserts that "... within the constraints imposed upon
them by their political system of extensive decentralization, the Yugoslav
authorities have in general been responsive to the Bank's recommendations
... agreement will be reached on a project which will consolidate and
extend the Bank's institution-building action. Bank involvement is
particulrly valuable at this time when Yugoslavia's railway policy is
being determined..."  These sentiments led to the May 2, 1977 TOR for
'Second Stage Appraisal of Railways V". According to the TOR, the mission
would review the key issue for both Railways IV and Railways Vt government
policy on tariffs and subsidies. The TOR did not suggest the possibility
that Railways V be dropped if the key issue were not resolved to the Bank's
satisfaction. There is no report in the file on this "Second Stage
Appraisal" but the (second version) of the IP (dated June 10, 1977), noted
that significant progress has been made and repeated the December 1976
suggestion that the loan amount be increased to US$100 million. The
(second version) of the DM (dated July 1, 1977) st -id that no outstanding
issues remained. This was a premature conclusion.
41.       One week later, on July 8, 1977, the leader of the "Second Stage
Appraisal Mission' noted he had just discovered that the appraisal material
was incomplete and that he might need still another mission. Meanwhile,
project processing continued and the covering note on the September 29,
1977 draft Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), states that to meet the Bankt's
requirements, the Yugoslav authorities had undertaken (a) that general
government subsidies would be el$minated by 1980 through annual tariff
increases to cover inflation, as well as through levies on COI members, and
(b) that between 1976 and 1980 non-tariff revenues (all government
subsidies and COI payments) would be reduced from 22Z to 15Z of total
revenue.



16
42.       The 'Appraisal Update Mission" was not fully successful because,
according to the November 4, 1977 BOR, the Yugoslav authorities declined to
agree with Bank proposals ons (a) replacement of subsidies by COI payments;
(b) tariff increases; and (e) the assessment methodology for uneconomic
lines. Nevertheless, the 'Appraisal Update Mission' was of the opinion
that all three issues could be resolved at negotiations and, in a November
8, 1977 note, recommended that the proposed loan be increased to US$115
million. On November 23, 1977 the draft 'Loan Package" (consisting of the
PR, the SAR, and the Loan Agreement) was submitted to the Bank's Regional
Vice President for Europe, Middle East and North Africa (EMEMA), with a
note stating that 'with the introduction of COIs and traffic and
efficiency-related compensation payments, the question of subsidies is no
longer a major issue". Coements on the draft Loan Package by Bank staff,
including the Bank's Railway Adviser, were made on December 5, 1977 but the
actual documents are missing from the file.
43.       Negotiations were held from January 5 through January 20, 1978,
and Railways V was approved by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors on
March 22, 1978. Careful reading of the PR text reveals that Bank staff
were not unaware either of the complicated Yugoslav setting, or of the
difficulties likely to be encountered by any attempt to introduce policy
changes. The PR concluded on a positive note in para 87: "... In light of
what was stated regarding the performance under the previous railway
projects ... it is recognized and accepted that the continuing aim of
ensuring the financial viability of the railways might again prove
difficult to attain. We do however, have considerable grounds for
optimism....' Railways V became effective on September 29, 1978.
Ks80"o Railway
From Preparation to Effectivenesst  September 1977 - November 1981
44.       In January/February 1990, tragic events in Kosovo were reported
daily in the international press.  Thirteen years earlier, the Bank and the
Government were aware of the potential dangers in that Province and
resolved to do whatever they could to calm things down, This included a
railway project which the Province wanted, though it did not perhaps need.
45.       Kosovo was recognized as the least developed region of
Yugoslavia, its poverty was perceived as a major blemish on the country's
aspirations, all the Republics agreed, for a variety of reasons, on major
resource transfers to the undeveloped Province, and the Federal Government
decided that, out of the available resources from the Bank, almost a
quarter should be channelled into Kosovo over the next five years. The
Provincial Development Plan concentrated on sectors leading to fast growth
in incomes and employment.
46.       Having established that Federal and Republic Governments in
Yugoslavia, as well as the Bank, were keen to help Kosovo, Bank staff noted
that the Provincial administration stood out in stark contrast to the
administration even of the neighboring Republics of Macedonia and
Montenegro. For example, the Secretariats for Finance and Agriculture
lacked sufficient experienced staff to provide guidance, continuity and



17
overview and, hence, recruitment and training of personnel, perhaps with
the help of the Federal Secretariat of Finance, would be essential.
47.       The message was clear: if the Bank were to assist Kosovo it
would have to devote large quantities of staff time and effort. Before
doing so, it would have to get a clearer idea of the socio-political
situation in the Province.
48.       The Bank officer who had led the Appraisal Missions for both
Railways IV and V, visited Kosovo between January 22 and 27, 1978 to seek
information on the project that RTO Pristina had proposed for Bank
financing. His Jawnary 31, 1979 BOR was as positive as the Issues Papers
he had prepared for the previous two railway projects and noted that
Kosovo's railways haLdbeen operated by RTE Belgrade until the beginning of
1978 when RTO Pristina was formed. It was a small RTO, with a route length
of only 330 km, and much of its assets were worn out and obsolete. Railway
modernization was needed to increase capacity and security of operations.
As its qualified staff did not suffice for all its needs, it was relying on
assistance, sometimes provided on an informal basis, by CYR, RTO Belgrade,
and universities. By participating in the proposed project, the Bank could
assist RTO Pristina in devising and implementing optimal staffing and
technical assistance arrangements. The BOR was followed by a February 14,
1979 PB which took it for granted that the project was on, recommended a
US$25 million loan, and neglected to note that RTO Pristina traffic
represented about 12 of total railway traffic in Yugoslavia, and that
questions might be raised as to whether the Bank ought to allocate its
scarce staff resources to an opeiation of such limited scope. These
questions were indeed asked, but later, when the project kad acquired too
much momentum.
49.       Preparation continued between February and November 1979
although gaps in the record do not allow precise tracing of developments,
which seem to have been not smooth. Two letters from the Bank to CYR
(dated March 8 and June 21, 1979), asking for technical, economic and
financial analyses in extraordinary detail, betray concern that this would
not be an easy project and that all contentious issues ought to be looked
into as thoroughly as possible. A mission, which visited Yugoslavia
between October 4 and 20, reported that progress was not what it should
have been, and a November 20, 1979 meeting in the Bank concluded that the
state of project preparation would not permit the drafting of an appraisal
report. Even if the requested traffic and financial information were
received in December, more engineering analysis would be necessary and it
was likely that specialized assistance would be required for this purpose.
Meanwhile a letter should be sent to CYR stressing the poor state of
project preparation, the need for a review of the data yet to be received,
and the need for a further study by a Bank specialist of the Kosovo
Junction problem and its proposed solution. On December 5, 1979, a letter
from the Bank informed CYR that the Kosovo project would be put in
abeyance, pending receipt at, and study in, the Bank of the detailed
information to far requested.
50.       Although the file is incomplete, there are indications that the
Bank's attitude began to change in early 1980. Initially, the thought
prevailed that the project could become part of Railways VI. However,



18
there were difficulties with the preparation of Railways VI and a March 12,
1"30 UBOR on Proposed Railway Project to Kosovo" reported that after a
February 14-21 visit to Yugoslavia, Bank staff concluded that a good
project for Kosovo could be prepared after all. This conclusion was
rapidly lolloved by an April 9, 1980 IP, and by an April 11, 1980 Briefing
Paper. Significantly, the April 29, 1980 DM records that there was little
consensus within the Bank on the quality of the proposed operation. The
EMENA Projects Director and OPS voiced serious reservations about the
economic merits of the project: Did it represent the best use of Bank
resources? Was it a priority even for Kosovo, let alone Yugoslavia? Staff
supporting the project strongly advanced the poverty and backwardness
arguments, and pointed out that, since preparation of Railways VI was being
delayed, the Bank might as well go ahead with Kosovo. The "Conclusions' of
the DM, illustrate the intricacies of project processing in the late 19709:
The meeting recognized the strength of views put forward, particularly by
OPS, on the financial issues outstanding in respect of Railways V; it
acknowledged that continuing action must be sought from Yugoslavia to
resolve these difficulties and that the Bank's strategy and conditions of
lending should be evaluated in the light of changing circumstances. On the
other hand, the meeting recommended further processing of the proposed
project. It also decided that efforts to arrive at a satisfactory solution
of the financial issues under Railways V should be given greater emphasis.
In an effort to expedite a solution and also to examine thoroughly the
issues involved, the Projects Department agreed to prepare a paper by end
June 1980, presenting the status of compliance with financial covenants,
the Yugoslav government's evaluation of the situation, and staff
recommendations for action. Appropriate action to be taken would be
decided upon after review of such a paper. Except OPS (who dissented), it
was the sense of the meeting that the presentation to the Board of the
proposed Kosovo Railway Project should not he made contingent on a
resolution of-the difficult financial issues arising from Railways V, and
that Railways VI would by its national scope and leverage be a more
suitable candidate for "linkage". OPS held for a resolution of the
outstanding financial issues as a condition of Board presentation for the
Kosovo Railway loan.
51.       OPS was responsible for quality control of project preparation
and its insistence that resolution of outstanding financial issues ought to
be a condition for Board presentation slowed project processing. The
problem was resolved by the Bank's Senior Vice President for Operationa
uho, according to a June 2, 1980 note on the DM, "... did not consider it
appropriate that Board presentation of Kosovo Railways be made contingent
on a full resolution of the difficult financial issues arising under the
Fifth Railway Loan..."   At the same time, the Senior Vice President "...
requested a memorandum explaining the difficulties and suggesting action
required on the part of the Borrower to avoid consideration being given to
possible suspension of disbursements..." And the note concludess "...A
mission currently in the field is discussing this problem with the Borrower
and a preliminary report indicates that in the case of Kosovo Railways,
tariffs have been increased substantially more than previously reported.
The memorandum requested ... will be prepared as soon as possible after the
return of the mission..."



19
52.       The memorandum requested by the Senior Vice President was
submitted to him by the Vice President for EMENA on August 8, 1980. It
acknowledged that the loan documents for Railways V stipulated that tariffs
should be increased annually to offset inflation and to reduce compensation
to all RTEs from 22 percent of total revenues in 1976 to 15 percent in
1980. On the other hand, it noted that inflation rates exceeded the 10
percent forecast at the time when Railways V was negotiated and, in mid-
1980, were running at about 26 percent per annum. It also noted that
although tariff increases were put into effect, they were limited. As a
result, additional revenues did not offset inflation, and 'compensation'
-- which is to say, subsidies -- instead of being reduced, rose to 26
percent In 1979. For the following reasons, the EMENA Vice President
did not consider non-compliance with the "compensation" covenants as an
adequate basis for serious action such as suspension of disbursements or
cessation of further lending to railways: (a) funds for 'compensation"
wete raised mainly from railway users as a specific levy and to this extent
were equivalent to a tariff increase; (b) in some respects the financial
situation of YR had shown considerable improvement; (c) substantial tariff
increases were put into effect, but were offset by much higher than
expected inflation. In view of the above, the EMENA Vice President
recoummeded a revision of "compensation' targets, which would provide for
reduction over a longer period than originally planned. As a condition of
the Bank's agreement to modify the covenants, the Bank and the Government
would agree on a specific program of action to increase tariffs to cover
inflation and reduce "compensation".
53.       The draft SAR was circulated for comments within the Bank on
December 5, 1980. On December 16, OPS raised a number of questions on both
the engineering and the economics of the project, which were not adequately
answered by EMEMA. On January 26, 1981, OPS submitted their full comments
on 'Proposed Kosovo Railway Project -- Yellow Cover SAR dated November 5,
1980", making detailed observations on Project Composition; Staff Training;
Action Plans; COI; Social Agreement on Economic Measures; Financial
targets; Staff Wage Levels; and Traffic forecasting. Although stopping
short of declaring this a poorly prepared project, the OPS comments left no
doubt that it was not an excellent one.
54.       One week later, on February 3, 1981, the EMENA Programs  Director
submitted the draft "Loan Package" to the EMENA Vice President. The
covering note suggested that this was a good project, and disposed of the
tariff problem by stating that a continuing dialogue was conducted with the
Yugoslav authorities concerning levels of "compensation" in a national
context. Given the complexity of the issues involved, the Programs
Department concluded that a study should be carried out by consultants with
a view to establishing reasonable levels. Consultations on the study
results would be held and agreemeat on satisfactory levels would be reached
by end of September 1981. OPS reservations on the efficacy of such a
study were acknowledged, and then discounted, on the grounds that the
principal objective of the proposed project was to strengthen the
management and operating efficiency of RTO Pristina; the loan would not be
effective before the study results were known, and the Bank would have
financial targets for Pristina during negotiations.



20
55.       Negotiations took place from February 18 to 25, 1981, and no
substantive changes were made to the project description in the draft SAR.
The US$34 million loan was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors od
April 30, 1981. The Kosovo Railway Project became effective on November
10, 1981.
B.    PIEbAL2T
Railways 'V  -- Imilementation and Results
56.       The Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026, US$93.0 million, of
1974), had the following objectivesi Asset Creation -- Support the
completion of the 1964 Modernization Program by financing priority items in
the 1974-76,slice of the Railway's 1973-77 Investment Plan; Operational
Imrovements -- Increase efficiency, quality of service and carrying
capacity; Institution-buildina -- Strengthen railway competitiveness by
reducing dependence on subsidies.
57.       The project was approved in July 1974 but shortages of local
funds delayed effectiveness until February 1975. With five Executing
Agencies (the RTEs) communicating with the Bank through one Borrower (CYR),
project management was not straightforward, and required that reporting
deadlines and formats had to be agreed among the different parties. Design
of monitoring procedures had been neglected during project preparation and,
between Februyry and May 1975, generated much correspondence, with the Bank
asking for entailed reports and short intervals, ana the Yugoslav
authorities preferring summary reports and longer intervals. Similarly, no
earlier agreement had been reached on consultant selection procedures, and
no investigation was done of the possibility that import restrictions might
be placed on Bank-financed procurement. These two topics emerged between
May and July 1975, and generated more correspondence.
58.       The July 25, 1975 SR elaborates at length on financial and other
difficulties of Railways IV while, at the same time, urting that
preparation of Railways V be accelerated. On September 16, 1975, the
Bank's Railways Adviser comuented on this SR by saying that cost increases
and availability of funds for the investment program were affecting the
pace of works execution. Careful assessment of works progress would be
needed in the forthcoming mission to check that critical works were
receiving appropriate priority, to determine when the present project would
be completed, and to consider which investments should be considered in the
further period.
59.       The December 12, 1975 SR revealed that scant improvement had
taken place, gave the project a 2 Rating ("Moderate Problems") and noted
that all indicators were down. Physical progress was below target (because
of shortage of local finance, suppliers' delays, poor planning by RTEs, and
procurement delays); tariffs were not increased as had been agreed;
disbursements were delayed; cost overruns averaged 29S; feasibility studies
by consultants were delayed because of difficultieis in obtaining data;



21
traffic was below appraisal forecasts; YR 1974 deficits were about US$105
mAllion equivalent; auditing was delayed; there were disruptive staff
changes in CYR which, furthenmore, suffered from a shortage of 'suitable
economists'. The Bank felt that unless YR moved quickly towards financial
autonomy, managerial and operational problems would continue to expand.
Increase of tariffs was an indispensable step towards better financial
health, and Government failure to allow suceh increases provoked repeated
protests by the Bank, but to no avail.
60.       By February 1976, the Bank's concern over the tariff issue had
mounted. The $93 million loan to CYR was on-lent to the Belgrade, Zagreb,
Ljubljana, Sarajevo and Skopje RTEs through Subsidiary Agreements with CYR.
Under the terms of these Agreements, the RTEs were required to maintain
rates and fares sufficient to finance an average of 30 percent of capital
investment costs during 1974-76. Notwithstanding a tariff increase on
January 1, 1975, Government subsidies for 1975 were expected to be about
$111 million, and a further substantial increase in tariffs would be
Immediately required if the RTEs were to Aeet their commitments under the
agreements. Anxious to stabilize prices? Government proposed an 8 percent
increase effective January 1, 1976 but, as of early February, it had not
been put into effect "pending further review". At any event, such an
increase would have been inadequate, and would have implied subsidies of
over $220 million for 1976.
61.       While supporting Government's anti-inflationary effor_.s, the
Bank felt that anything less than a 20 percent increase would be a
retrograde step in the implementation of the objectives of the Loan
Agreement. Meanwhile, the latest cost estimates indicated substantial
increases as a result of inflation, compounded by delays in execution and
significant increases in quantities. This meant that contingencies would
soon be exhausted and the Bank was already corresponding with the Borrower
proposing a reduction in disbursement percentages. The Bank did anticipate
that the Yugoslav authorities would continue to point out that most
European railways were heavily subsidized, and proposed to continue
reminding YR of the deplorable financial state of these railways. It was
precisely because of the poor financial showing of other railway networks
that the Bank had u'-ged that Yugoslav tariffs be increased in the first
place, and that further investments be restricted to those likely to yield
a high rate of return.
62.       Implications for the proposed Railways V were clear.  While non-
achievement of the objectives under Railways IV might have been
understandable, further deterioration of YR finances made it hard to
proceed with Railways V. A March 8, 1976 note on "Yugoslav Railways',
after reviewing progress made under Railways IV, says the following about
the tariff and finance issuess Appraisal of a Fifth Railway Project cannot
proceed until the above issues are resolved (i.e., railway tariffs and
Investment & Financing Plans). There has been no progress towards their
solution despite repeated discussions since June 1975. The Yugoslav
authorities should be advised that if these issues could not be resolvod by
June 1976, an appraisal would be scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1976;
otherwise appraisal would have to be suspended by at least one year. The
question of subsidies affected the whole transport sector and should bo
brought into the open; an agreement on its resolution should be reached



22
between the Government and the Bank before further transport loans are
made, starting with the Eighth Highway Loan. The 1977-81 loan allocation to
the transport sector is $375 million, and ahould provide substantial
leverage.
63.       According to SRs in the file, implementation of Railways IV did
not drastically Improve between June 1976 and July 1978. The record
contains an April 5, 1977 note ("Fourth Railway Project -- Loan 1026-YU:
Compliance with Requirements of Loan, Subsidiary and Guarantee
Agreements"', whose purpose is not quite transparent, but the record does
not indicate what action was taken after the note demonstrated that
compliance amounted to virtually nil.
64.       A December 21, 1979 letter from the Bank to CYR notes that "once
more it is naacessary to comment upon the slow process which is being made
towards completing the Fourth Project... ", but it is difficult to identify
precisely the reasons for specific delays because, beginning in 1980, SRs
become almost perfunctory. On September 3, 1983, the Bank wrote a letter
urging CYR to employ consultants for the compilation of the Railways IV and
V PCRs and included "Outline of Terms of Reference for Consultancy
Assistance in the Preparation of the Project Completion Reports ..."  On
October 21, 1983 CYR telexed the Bank that the PCRs would be done by the
Transport Institute of Sarajevo. It wae on the basis of the document
prepared by the Sarajevo Institute that EMENA prepared the PCR on Railways
IV that was published in May 1986.
65.       The May 1986 PCR is a matter-of-fact document about whose
conclusions the November 1989 OED mission to Yugoslavia found no grounds
for disagreement. It notes that Railways IV covered the 1974-76 time-slice
of the 1973-77 Investment Plan, and that the loan was to be disbursed
against expenditures for the completion of the 1964-70 Modernization
Program, related investments, technical assistance and staff training.
Physical progress was slower than anticipated. Some investments proved to
be difficult to Implement; lack of interim finance seriously interrupted
the works through 1974 and -. t of 1975; and government funds were not made
available on tine and as aga, d due to the country's economic difficulties
and inflation (PCR, paras 3.t0-3.09).
66.       The PCI acknowledges that the principal financial objeetive wa
to reduce the reliance of the railways on subsidies by increasing tariff
revenues, and that this was not achieved because Government approved tariff
increases were inadequate. The PCR notes that the project was successful
in achievinX its other objectives, by enabling YR to improve operationol
efficlency, quality of service, and ability to carry higher traffic volumes
from 1977 onwards (PCR, paras 4.02, 5.01-5.03, and 6.01). The re-evaluated
economic returns range from a minimum of 102 for electrifiection,
signalling and telecommunication equipment, 13Z for track overhaul, to 302
for traction and rolling stock replacement; with an overall figure of 19S
compared to 162 at appraisal (PCR, para 7.03).
67.       The PCR notes that financial covenants, designed to reduce
railway subsidies and to restore financial viability to YR through tariff
revenues, were quite appropriate, and that the principle had been agreed
with the Yugoslav authorities. However, Yugoslav coriitment to tariff



23
increases weakened in the face of an economic slowdown and high inflation
rates following the oil cr'sis of 1973. And the PCR concludest "... The
impact of this course of action on the railways' development and
performance is now better understood and financial covenants for the Sixth
Railway Project have been made more specific, while adequate tariff
increases were made a condition of loan effectiveness...' (PCR, para 9.02).
Railways V -- IMlementation sad Results
68.       The Fifth Railway Project (Loan 1534, US$100.0 million, of
1978), had the following objectives: Asset Creation -- Support the
completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and finance priority items in
the 1978-80 time slice of the 1976-80 Investment Plan; Operational
Imvrovements -- Increase efficiency, quality of service and carrying
capacity; Institution-buildint -- Strengthen railway competitiveness by
reducing dependence on subsidies.
69.       Project implementation spanned the 1978-1984 period, a time of
deteriorating macroeconomic performance, and Railways V was affected by
difficulties about which YR could do but little. Furthermore, In April and
May 1979, barely six months after Railways V became effective, a major
earthquake devastated the Adriatic coast. Physical consequences of the
earthquake were most evident along the total length of the Montenegrin
coastline in a belt 10 to 12 km wide. In this area over 100 people were
killed and about 500 injured. Heavy damage was sustained by the Titograd-
Bar railroad, the Port of Bar, and about 560 km of the Montenegro highway
network. Both the Government and the Bank had to devote considerable
resources to rehabilitation works, and although it is not possible to give
quantitative valuations, there is little doubt that both CYR and Bank
attention was diverted, at least for a while.
70.       SRs reported that between November 1978 and December 1979,
Railways V was trouble-free. The December 7, 1979 SR gave the project a 2
Rating (Moderate Problems) and grouped the major difficulties under
'staffing', 'investment proposals for electrification", and "finance". The
Bank's Railway Adviser comuented on this SR on January 1', 1980, expressing
concern about the increasing proportion of subsidies -- directly counter to
the loan covenants. If tariff increase  had been slightly above general
inflation and traffic had been better than forecast, how did this situation
arise? Had costs (e.g. staff wages) been allowed to rise faster, in teal
terms? What was being done to reduce costs and/or increase tariffs?...
What were the prospects that the Borrower would abide by the agreement to
scale down subsidies? Shouldn't the matter be taken up at higher levels
before discussing a new project? Concerning surplus staff, he said that
their precise number was to be identified, that the relevant costs were to
be shown separately, and that a program was to be drawn up for such costs
to be progressively reduced; why was none of this being followed up?
Finally, concerning the lack of statistics for 1978, the Railway Adviser
felt that this was strange after so many months, and he wondered whether
there was a problem.
71.       For the Bank, the 1compensation" problem became progressively
entangled during 1980, and two extracts from the record illustrate the



24
different attitudes of staff and management. On June 11, 1980, the Acting
Director for the EMENA Programs Department sent the following telex to the
Federal Committee for Transportation and Communication in Belgrade:
1... During the recent meeting in Belgrade ... we discussed the
financial performance of YR as it relates to the financial covenants
of Loan 1534 -- Fifth Railway Project. The objective of the
financial provisions was to improve the financial condition of the
railways and initially reduce compensation payments from 22 percent
of total revenues of all railway enterprises in 1976 to 15 percent in
1980. Although annual tariff increases have been put into effect
they have not been sufficient to offset the increasing rate of
inflation. According to preliminary information received from our
recent supervision mission, compensation payments for railways as a
whole rose to 26 percent of revenues in 1979 although the figure for
individual enterprises varies considerably. Given the recent and
current inflation rate it appears doubtful that any overall
improvement can be expected for 1980 since tariff increases earlier
this year were below the rate of inflation. As I already explained,
this failure to meet the financial covenant was causing some
difficulties within the Bank which could well delay if not preclude
future lending for YR. We understand consideration is being given to
semi-annual tariff increases and/or larger increases for enterprises
facing more acute deficits. We would be grateful if you would take
all possible action in this matter in order to avoid potential
difficulties... a
However, one month later, on July 15, 1980, the Acting Vice President for
EMENA wrote a briefing note to the Bank's President, in which he said that
the Bank received a letter that morning (from Yugoslavia) requesting that
higher priority be given to the preparation of the Sixth Railway Project,
so that project appraisal be completed in time to make the loan effective
in 1981. The letter stated that the Yugoslav authorities had been informed
that the Bank's decision to delay the project effectiveness date from 1981
to the first half of 1982 was due to non-compliance with the financial
conditions under the Fifth Railway Project. Due to continuing high
inflation, "compensation" was not expected to decrease in 1980 despite
substantial tariff increases that had been announced. The Acting Vice
President went on to say that EMENA was in the process of preparing
regional proposals on how to approach the 'compensation' issue. Since this
matter was still under discussion within the Bank, EMEMA recommended that
the Bank's President indicate continued willingness to find a mutually
satisfactory solution with the Government, including the possibility of
revising the financial covenants for 1980, if circumstances warranted. The
Acting Vice President concluded by saying that if a mutually acceptable
solution could be quickly found on the 'compensation' issue and project
preparation could be expedited, the Sixth Railway Project could be
appraised sometime in the middle of 1981.
72.       Quick, mutually acceptable solutions remained elusive.  On
September 8, 1980 the Bank asked the Borrower for a comprehensive study of
"compensation" and its effects, so that the targets set for "compensation"
levels under Railways V might perhaps be revised. The Borrower responded



25
with a December 2, 1980 letter which the Bank regarded as an unsatisfactory
reply and for the next three years, compensation continued to be debated.
73.       Meanwhile, project implementation was approaching completion. In
October 1983, a contract for the drafting of the PCR was awarded to the
Sarajevo Institute of Transport; an extension of the Closing Date from June
30, 1983 to May 31, 1984 was approved so that PCR drafting might take
place; and CYR sent the draft PCR to the Bank on April 5, 1984. On
December 26, 1984 the Bank wrote to CYR confirming that the consultants had
produced a satisfactory PCR and that no more data would be required. On
May 31, 1985 the Bank wrote to CYR that more data would, after all, be
needed, especially on the Skopje-Gevgelija line, and CYR complied with this
new request. It was on the basis of the document prepared by the Sarajevo
Institute that EMENA prepared the PCR on Railways V that was published in
May 1986.
74.       Like the May 1985 PCR on Railways IV, the May 1986 PCR on
Railways V is a matter-of-fact document. Again, the November 1989 OED
mission to Yugoslavia found no grounds to disagree with the PCR which notes
that the project covered the 1978-80 time-slice of the YR 1976-80
Investment Plan, and that the loan was to be disbursed against expenditures
for track overhaul, electrification, technical assistance and staff
training. The project was originally intended to cover the years 1977-
1978 but delay in preparing feasibility studies and debates on subsidies
and tariffs slowed down the appraisal process until October 1977, when the
project was reformulated to cover the years 1978-80 (PCR, para 2.05).
75.       Physical progress was slow because of delays in procurement of
track renewal materials, and shortage of local funds (PCR, paras 3.04-
3.05, 3.07). The project's financial objective was to reduce reliance on
non-tariff revenue. User 'compensationu payments brought relief to the
railway's liquidity position but after 197St tariff revenues were not able
to keep pace with costs. In the face of inflationary pressures and
economic difficulties, tariff increases were inadequate in the second half
of the project period (PCR, paras 5.03, 5.05, 5.09-5.11). The project
enabled YR to improve operational efficiency, quality of service, and
carrying capacity. Availability of locomotives was not what it should have
been, largely because of the country's foreign exchange position which
limited funds for spare parts (PCR, paras 4.02, 4.04). Re-evaluated
economic rates of return ranged from 15 to 302 for track overhauls, around
15S fcr electrification and about 25Z for traction and rolling stock
replacement. The overall ER was about 181 compared to 15X at appraisal
(PCR, para 7.03).
76.       Despite that the YR Investment Plans had been reduced by about a
third during appraisal, it had still been necessary to divide the plans
into two parts; Part A consisting of investments which were to proceed as
scheduled, and Part B, whose execution would depend on adequate financial
and physical resources, and on additional evidence of economic viability.
Hardly any investment under Part B was realized, mainly due to lack of
local funding, and demonstrated that YR overestimated their ability to
finance a larger investment progrem (PCR, para 9.02). Procurement under
ICB led to some problems because YR staff were not totally familiar with
Bank guidelines. The clear tendency in the Borrower's origi"nl



26
recommendations to favor domestic bidders resulted in delay at the
beginning of implementation which could have been avoided. A more
realistic procurement schedule would have taken into account the
substantial time needed to establish Letters of Credit (PCR, para 9.04).
77.       Technical assistance by foreign consultants twice encountered
difficulties in obtaining data from some RTOs. In one case, due to
resistance against an in-depth review, access to sites was denied.
However, as the capability of Yugoslav consultancy firms increased over the
years, the tendency to employ local firms rather than foreign ones began to
emerge and sensitive problems were diminished. At the same time, the PCR
felt that some participation of foreign consultants seemed necessary to
ensure that YR continue to have access to the best and most suitable
technology (PCR, para 9.05).
78.       The project's financial covenants, designed to eliminate all
general subsidies, to reduce "compensation", and to increase YR financial
viability through tariff revenues, were appropriate. However, Governmont
coimitment to adequate tariff increases weakened in the face of rising
inflation. Reduction of YR reliance on non-tariff revenue was not achieved
and in this respect the project failed to reach an important objective. As
a result, financial covenants for the Sixth Railway Project were made more
specific, while adequate tariff increases were made a condition in the Loan
Agreement (PCR, para 9.06).
Kosovo Railway Pro-lct -- Iulemetation and Results
79.       The Kosovo Railway Project (Loan 1977, US$34.0 million, of
1981), had the following objectives: Asset Creation -- Support the
implementation of RTO Pristina's 1981-1985 Investment Plan with a view to
modernize railway facilities in Kosovo; Operational Imirovements -- Improve
the capacity, efficiency, and competitive position of the railway;
Institution-building -- Improve management and financial position of RTO
Pristina.
80.       Implementation was slow to start.  The loan agreement was signed
in May 1981 but did not become effective until November 1981 because
formation was delayed of the COI which would provide *compensation". There
was a further two-year delay attributable to procurement problems with the
signalling and telecommunications equipment, and to difficulties of land
acquisition for the freight yard. The April 13, 1983 SR gave the project a
2 Rating (Moderate Problems) and noted that slow progress in preparation
caused a 7-month delay; that traffic was below forecasts; that the
financial situation was unsatisfactory; and that 1981 tariff revenues
covered only 49S of operating expenses.
81.       Conditions did not drastically improve in subsequent years, and
it was obvious that the loan proceeds would not be spent. In November 1983,
RTO Pristina proposed a reallocation of loan funds, and certain changes in
the project scope. These proposals were discussed in the Bank which noted
that about US$14 million out of the US$34 million loan total would likely
not be utilized because of a favorable signalling contract and because of
lower diuarldollar rate. Flially, on April 25, 1984, the Bank agreed in



27
substance with the RTO proposals, and Schedules 1 and 2 of the Loan
Agreement were duly amended. At the same time, the first extension of the
Closing Date was approved (from June 1984 to June 1985).
82.       In the fall of 1984, concern was voiced in the Bank about the
viability of some railway projects in Yugoslavia, and Kosovo was one of
them. On December 12, 1984 there was a second request for extension of the
closing date to December 1985, accompanied by assurances it would be the
last. However, once again, the situation did not improve. The April 15,
1985 SR (Ratings 2) notes that freight traffic was 332 below the appraisal
forecast; that management organization was inadequate; that, although
Section 5.02 of the Loan Agreement called for annual audits, RTO had been
reluctant to have accounts audited.
83.       The November 5, 1985 SR reveals that the project was beset by
major problems and that RTO Pristina was requesting a third extension of
the Closing Date.  Particularly striking are the SR coments on "Finacial
Results', which note that the results for January/June 1985 presented a
dismal picture. Summary figures are shown in Annex 8, Table 4 and compared
with those of the corresponding period in 1984. They show a deficit which
is increasing, attributable, in part only, to a fall in traffic occasioned
by a severe winter. The basic problem was the size of the RTO which was
unlikely ever to be viable. It carried approximately 1X of the total rail
traffic, and existed only as a result of a political, not economic
decision. It shared the same problems as many other enterprises in the
Province. Given the nature of the organization, financial support by COla
was both inevitable and essential. Regrettably, the figures showed a
continued shortfall in 'compensation' from the COIs. Earlier Bank missions
had taken up this point with the Provincial Government and the latest
Mission urged RTO Management to press the Government on the point. Whether
the present management has grasped the realities of the financial situation
was open to question, for the latest investment and financing plan dated
June 1985 assumed a rate of inflation of 20S for the whole year 1985. By
the time the plan was issued inflation had already, in the first six
months, surpassed 301. Nevertheless, despite the downward trend of the
financial situation, the forecast for the year showed a break-even position
after payment of interest for 1985. The SR wondered how a deficit of
Dinars 373 million in the first six months was to be turned into a break-
even situation by the end of the year. The Mission pointed out that they
were not impressed with the quality of financial forecasting which, if
believed, served to mislead RTO management in making decisions. The
Mission urged that a little realism be introduced into the process. Given
the above, (the SR went on), it may be asked how any case for extension of
the loan closing date and further capital expenditure can be made. The sole
reason from the financial side was that extension of the closing date would
enable the project's signalling and telecommunications component to be
completed and start earning its keep. Failure to complete will add another
financial burden with no corresponding benefit.
84.       The third extension of the Closing Date (to December 31, 1986)
was granted on December 31, 1985. The July 29, 1986 SR (Rating: 2) notes
that dramatic improvements were still elusive, but that the project was
nearing completion. On August 12, 1987 the loan was closed and the unspent
balance of $1,126,322 was cancelled. The PCR had been contracted out by



28
CYR to the Institute of the Transport Faculty of the University of Belgrade
and the document prepared by the consultants served as the basis for the
draft PCR submitted by EMENA to OED on June 29, 1989. OED made extensive
caments on the draft, which was returned to EMENA on September 12, 1989. A
revised draft was prepared by EMENA, which prepared an extensively revised
version.
85.       The February 1990 PCR, with whose conclusions the November 1989
OED mission to Yugoslavia does not disagree, states that the fundamental
purpose of the project was to support the development of Kosovo. Rewarding
conclusions emerge from the comparison between intended and achieved
objectives, as respectively described in the April 1981 PR and in the
December 1989 draft PCR.
Intended Obiectives: RTO Pristina's Investment Plan was part of
Kosovo's Provincial Development Plan for 1981-1985 and its principal
objective was to moderniz railway facilities in Kosovo so as to
improve efficiency, capacity and the competitive position of the
railway, and to provide for the substantial increase in traffic which
would arise from the planned development of Kosovo's mineral and
industrial potential (PR, paras 55-56).
Achieved Objectives: The PCR does not contain a specific section
comparing intended and achieved objectives. Operational targets were
not achieved (PCR, para 4.01). Staff increased slightly, contrary to
targets agreed at negotiations (PCR, para 4.03). Financial
performance fell far short of the targets set at appraisal (PCR, para
5.02). The original project works which were planned to be completed
in 3 years took nearly 7 years to complete (PCR, para 5.05).
Reporting was mostly inadequate and Bank supervision missions, though
regularly pointing at deficiencies could only monitor the events
(PCR, pars 8.05).
86.       The appraised project (SAR, para 3.03) consisted of the
following components: (a) Reconstruction of Kosovo Junction; (b)
Procurement of traction, rolling stock and integrated transport equipment;
(c) Procurement of signalling and telecommunications systems; and (d)
Training and technical assistance.   At the Borrower's request, the Loan
Agreement was amended by letters of June 28, 1982, October 5, 1982, and
January 3, 1983 (PCR, para 2.09). Correspondence between the appraised
project and the project which emerged after these amendments is not easy to
establish.
87.       The estimated project cost was US$67.5 million, with about
US$34.3 million representing foreign costs (SAR, para 5.07). Actual project
cost is US$77.4 million (PCR, para 3.19). Comparison of the two figures is
not meaningful because of project scope modifications during implementation
(PCR, pars 3.02). Estimated project completion (as well as the estimated
Closing Date) was December 31, 1984 (SAR, Annex I, Table 5). Actual project
completion took place in May 1989 (PCR, para 3.03). Thus, the project
registered a five-year delay, whose principal causes were an optimistic
implementation schedule, procrnrement problems, and difficulties with land
acquisition. Fianmcial performance fell short of the appraisal targets
(PCR, paras 5.02-5.04). As appraised, the project had an estimated ERR was



29
22S (SAR, paras 4.09). The amended project has a re-estimated ERR of
10.11 (PCR, para 7.05). Institutional strengthening had mixed results
(PCR, paras 6.01-6.04).
C.  SUNAR
InceitIoa and iretaration
88.       In all three projects, undue haste was injected during the
inception phase. This led to problematic preparation and to heated
exchanges within the Bank, where CPS persistently pointed out the costs of
speed and optimism. Subsequent difficulties and delays were largely due to
hasty inception. Also, they arose from incompatibility of what the Bank and
the Borrower considered primary objectives. The Bank, which saw the market
increasingly dominated by road transporters, wanted to strengthen YR so
that a former monopoly could compete in a progressively freer environment.
The Government wanted to strengthen YR so that a rejuvenated monopoly could
pursue a variety of ends, some of them not directly related to transport
(fostering of national cohesion; preservation of job security for YR staff;
domestic procurement of goods and services to be financed through Bank
loans; employment generation, etc.).
89.      Given the divergence of objectives, and the impact of political
realities, Yugoslavia was in no position to satisfy the Bask's conditions
for further assistance to YR. As noted in paras 21 and 22 above, the Bank
requested the following in May 1972t (a) Preparation of a new Investment
Plan, Including all items planned by YR, whether these would be financed by
the Bank or other sources; (b) Preparation of a Financing Plan, including
demonstration of YR ability to service loans; and (c) Joint preparatf an by
YR and Government of an Action Plan for management improvements. All three
sounded like reasonable requests, but were impossible to meet. Government
responsibility for YR couid not have been made explicit; firm financial
comitments could not have been expected from Federal and Republic
authorities; planning and coordination by CYR could not have been
strengthened because the spirit of decentralization was to weaken them.
The Borrower, anxious to secure financing, agreed to prepare the requisite
documents, even though questions might have been entertained as to whether
or not the spirit behind the Bank's conditions could be observed. The
Bank's subsequent insistence that agreements be honored did not enhance the
quality of the dialogue with the Borrower and his agencies.
Imlementation
90.      The PCRs on the three projects give a fair account of the
implementation experience and only some main points need to be touched upon
here. For all three projects, physical targets (track improvements,
station building and marshalling yard construction, motive and rolling



30
stock procurement, improvement of signalling and telecommunications) were
eventually met. Operational improvements did materialize, the quality of
service was Improved, and carrying capacity was increased. All three
projects suffered from local fund shortages, which led to implementation
delays, which led to cost overruns. However, shortage of local funds was a
symptom of macroeconomic deterioration, and there was nothing that the Bank
or YR could do about it. Upon completion, the re-estimated ERRs
established that works financed by the Bank were economically justified.
91.       Financial targets were not achieved because, given the
difference of opinion between the Government and the Bank on the Otariff-
subsidies-compensation' problem, they could not possibly have been met.
Still, whether the targets were realistic or not, they were expressed as
Loan Agreement conditions, and they were not complied with, and the Bank
would 1t-ve been justified to suspend disbursements and to curtail further
assistance to YR. The Bank chose to do neither, and this helped YR during
a period when it would have been difficult for them to find alternative
sources of financing. There is not sufficient evidence to establish
whether the Bank was flexible in order to help, or whether flexibility was
adopted so as not to jeopardize relations with a Borrower who absorbed a
significant percentage of the Bank's lending program.
Lesson-learninu
92.      None of the three projects benefitted from the experience of
preceding ones partly because haste to proceed with the next lending
operation did not allow time for reflection, and partly because neither the
Bank nor the Borrower were convinced that study of the past is useful in
planning the future. Neither side offered any incentives to its staff to
learn from the record before embarking upon a new project. Little
Importance was attached to in-house review and, indeed, it was the Bank who
advised CYR, and CYR took the advice, that preparation of PCRs ought to be
done by outside consultants. As prepared by the Sarajevo Institute of
Transport and by the Institute of the Transport Faculty of the University
of Belgrade, the draft PCRs are adequate. The fact remains that PCR
preparation is an educational experience for those who prepare them and
this experience was lost to CYR and to the RTEs. By the sasie token, the
leisurely, and somewhat too generous, 10/ editing in EEMA of the
Borrower's draft PCRs, demonstrates the limited significance attached to
lesson-learnin from past mistakes.
10/ The PCR prepared by DENA on Railways IV is of the opinion that much
was learned, both by the Bank and YR, from the projects institution
building was effective and planning capabilities were improved.
Preparation of Railways V was made easier by the improved planning
capability and by the feasibility studies prepared with technical
assistance under Railways IV. According to the PCR, Railways V wa
simpler and less ambitious and both preparation and implementation
were accomplished with much less difficulty (PCR, para 9.01). All
these opinions are contrary to the facts in the record.

Sustatnabilitv of yroject benefits
93.       The three projects generated benefit streams falling into two
familiar categoriess operational and financial. Operational efficiency and
quality of service were improved, carrying capacity was increased, and
organizational practices were strengthened. Financial results were not so
encouraging, partly because YR function not as a commercial enterprise but
as a Government department. All the saame, there is no doubt that, without
the Bank's insistence for tariff increases (which Government may not have
approved to the levels required but, still, did approve to a certain
extent), financial results would have been much worse and, in this sense,
financial benefits have also been generated. The question is: do current
conditions suggest that the benefit streams will continue to flow during
the rest of the economic life of the improvements financed by the Bank?
Regarding operational benefits, the answer is yes. Regarding financial
benefits, unsettled conditions in early 1990, allow no answers.
94.       There is a third category, of longer-term benefits, far more
important than any short-term consideration. In the 1960s, the notion was
alien in YR that Investments ought to be analyzed through comparisons of
costs and benefits: YR staff knew that decisions depended on the political
dimensions behind each proposed investment. YR officials say that the
Bank's insistence on feasibility studies, careful estimates and benefit-
cost comparisons, was initially regarded as the peculiarity of a financial
Institution, and that cost-benefit analyses were done on an exceptional
basis, as a ritual, whenever funds were to be sought from the Bank. In
1989, according to the same YR offlcials, cost-benefit analysis is viewed
as the proper procedure, as the sensible method for choosing among
investment alternatives. Results of benefit-cost analyses may still be
disregarded because other considerations might take precedence;
nevertheless, such disregard is viewed as an unhealthy departure from sound
practices. It took more than twenty years, but this attitudinal change may
well be the most important, and most sustainable, contribution that the
Bank has made to the strengthening of YR.
IV. BANK ASSIS5ANCE TO XR IN TME1980s
95.       Experience from the implementation of the first three projects
from the middle to the late 1960s led the Bank to conclude that the terms
of its assistance to YR ought to be rethought. This realization inspired
the May 1972 agreement on conditions for further Bank lending which, in
turn, led to the Fourth, Fifth and Kosovo Projects. The Sixth Railway
Project, which followed Kosovo, was prepared, and approved, under the
assumption that the May 1972 agreement, though beset with the problems
revealed during implementation of Railways IV, Railways V and Kosovo, was,
nevertheless, quite alive. The Sixth Railway Project (Loan 2336, US$110.0
million, of 1983) was approved at a time when the domestic situation had
become so intractable that, even with the best will in the world, YR and
the Government would not have been at liberty to make drastic modifications



32
in sensitive areas such as pricing, investments and personnel. Still, the
principal objectives of Railways VI were explicitly focused on major policy
changes
(a) To strengthen the four participating RTOs to enable them to
compete effectively by improving productivity and quality of
service
(b)  To further strengthen project management and the preparation and
implementation of sound operational and action plans, and
(c) To put the railways on the path towards financial viability
through tariff revenues.
96.       The Bank did know that macroeconomic reasons aggravated by
regional politics would not make it easy for any one of these objectives to
be achieved. Economic growth had slowed since 1979; inflation was
increasing; employment generation remained a major problem; there was a
substantial decline in foreign exchange reserves during 1982. Still, the
Railways VI PR made no reference to relationships between politics and
macroeconomic performance. Also, and although the PR did state that "...
the World Bank is the principal source of non-coumercial long-term credit
to Yugoslavia...", no inferences were drawn about the leverage embedded in
quality lending of this magnitude. Furthermore, and although this was the
Sixth Railway Project -- whose basic oljective was identical to that of
Railways IV and V: reduction of dependence on subsidies -- the Bank did
not insist upon a time schedule that would release loan funds in tranches,
depending on achievement of agreed targets. Finally, echoing the optimism
of PR8 and SARe for earlier projects, the PR of Railways VI stated that the
project wa free from any significant risks, and that it would be completed
by end 1986.
97.       The record shows that, despite the deterioration of general
economic performance, despite problems encountered during planning and
execution of all six railway projects, the Bank demonstrated remarkable
circumspection in its dealings with Yugoslavia.  I/ Why was circumspection
il/ Two examples may illustrate this assertion. The first is a July 10,
1987 two-volume Bank report entitled Yu£oslavia: The Challenge of
Adiustment which, being totally concerned with traditional
macroeconomics, did not touch upon transport issues, and avoided any
reference to domestic politics. The report deals with Yuaoslav
responses to the shocics of the late 1970s and to the ineft.%ciencies
that had crept in during the seventies. It points out that external
adjustment in the early 1980s was achieved at a cost of increasing
internal disequilibrium. This translated into slow growth and
accelerating inflation. The legal framework behind the Long Term
Program of Economic Stabilization included positive steps towards
liberalization. At the same time, it embodied administrative (i.e.,
party) interventionism that emerged from the compromises in reaching
consensus. Net results were been indifferent. The report assessed
the economy's grewth potential for the 1986-1990 Development Plan
period and conc4-Aded that without genuine policy reform (i.e.,
genuine liberali-.ation, with all the political complications this



33
necessary? Did the Bank really believe that plain language would endanger
the dialogue"? But then, what about leverage? The Bank was, after all,
the 'principal source of non-tommercial long-term credit" and, as such,
could expect some careful attention. Or, did the Bank believe there was no
need to point at macroeconomic indicators because the problems and
prospects of YR could be confronted independently of the sociopolitical
environment? But if it did believe this, how did it arrive at the
conclusion? More specifically: how did the Bank decide upon its lending
strategy for a particular sector, and, especially, for a complex one, like
that of transport in Yugoslavia?
98.       Until the mid-1980s, the Bank periodically prepared papers which
outlined the rationale for its lending program in different sectors of the
Borrower's economy, and summarised the investment and policy objectives to
be pursued through its lending operations. These 'Sector Papersw, or
'Sector Memoranda", helped crystallize the Bank's posture vis-a-vis a
particular Borrower. Also, they facilitated policy discussion by offering
an agenda and proposing what, in the Bank's view, were good solutions. The
debate helped pinpoint issues on which the Borrower either did not endorse
the Bank's solutions, or, if he did endorse them, he could not, for
political reasons, admit it openly. In the fonmer case, the two sides
identified the limits of their agreement. In the latter case, the Bank was
in a position to serve the Borrower by assuming the guise of the strict
physician. The Borrower could tell his constituents that disagreeable
remedies were being imposed by the Bank and that, regrettably, since the
country needed Bank financing, the remedies had to be taken. Whether or
not this last device was actually employed to promote policy change, Sector
Papers remained basic documents describing the Bank's lending strategy.
With two provisos: that they were clear and forceful; and that they wero
regularly updated.
99.       Although the Bank lent US$1.7 billion to Yugoslav transport
(with US$630 million going to YR), only one attempt wa made between 1963
and 1989 to draft a Sector Paper, and it never vent beyond the draft stage.
The paper does not suggest that transport and regional politics are
would entail), the economy could muddle through provided two
conditions were met: a 'favorable" external environment; and a
willingness of foreign creditors to refinance part of the maturing
debt. The Report noted that vulnerability to shocks would increasa
and that It was not at all certain that the necs"sary foreign finance
would be available.
The second example is a November 30, 1989 two-volume report entitled
Yuosulavia -- Financial Sector Restructuring: Policies and
Priorities, based on the findings of two Bank missions that visited
Yugoslavia in May/June and OctoberlNovember 1988. The tone of the
text is set by the first three sentences of the 'Overviewa: "The
Yugoslav economy has been plagued by instability and accelorating
inflation since the beginning of this decade. Inflation was 40-45
percent a month in the third quarter of 1989.The root of this
instability lies in the substantial losses incurred by enteEgrigses
and the National Bank of Yugoslavia (Emphasis added).

connected; does not explain why the Bank had not carried out a nation-vide
transport survey; does not hint that, in the case of railways at least,
there might be correlations between financial results and decentralization.
In sum, the Transport Sector Strategy Paper of 1984 is as formally
circumspect as the 1983 PR of Railways VI.
100.      There is a striking difference between published documents and
the personal views, gathered from interviews and notes in the file, of Bank
staff working on Yugoslav transport in the mid-1980s.  Bank staff felt
there was lack of sectoral coordination; that a port authority complained
of having underutilized facilities due to railway capacity constraints;
that road authorities complained of a national policy which favored
railways; that while integrated cargo centers was the catch phrase of the
moment, it was n-it clear what would move from where, by whom, or what use
would be made of containers; that ships passed by a relatively new port
(financed by the Bank) and traveled further in favor of an older port with
better commercial and freight forwarding institutions; that geographical,
historical and ethnic differences had resulted in costly parochial
approaches to transport planning, and that the planning process as a whole
had to be Improved.
101.      Bank staff were concerned about proper sectoral strategies but
felt that the Federal Government did not wish to have the Bank play a wider
role in the sector. At the same time, they wondered whether the Bank's
sector knowledge was deep enough to permit the Bank to play a wider role,
and they were not sure whether the Government would agree to the Bank's
undertaking a Sector Review that would improve this knowledge. Bank staff
felt that the Federal Government was sensitive to the Bank becoming more
deeply involved in policy issues and that, by the very nature of a
political system whereby policy decisions were based on consensus among the
Republics, it was difficult to judge what Impact an Intensified Bank staff
dialogue with Federal officials on nationwide sector issues would have on
the Republic authorities. On the whole, Bank staff felt that, considering
the combination of historical and cultural differences between republics,
together with the intricacies of the political system, it was unlikely
that, in the near future, the Bank's efforts could bring about true
nationwide sector planning.
102.      The status and prospects of the railway subsector led Bank staff
to feel that the Federal Government clearly favored development of railway
transport over other modes, particularly roads. Not only was this a policy
laid down in the Social Plan (and replicated in the Social Plans of the
Republics and Provinces) but also, with its control over the fuel tax,
which was the major source of income for road maintenance and investment,
Government deliberately underfunded road Infrastructure requirements.
Consequently, Bank staff felt that the Bank's role ought to go beyond the
determination of the viability and availability of financing for railway
schemess it also ought to determine whether railway investment plans
represented optimal use of resources to achieve an efficient transport
system. However, in the absence of an overall transport plan, Bank staff
felt that this would be difficult to determine.
103.      This is but a brief summary of evidence in the file that Bank
assistance to YR, channeled through the Kosovo and the Sixth Railway



35
Projects between 1983 and 1989, was not constrained by ignorance of
Yugoslav conditions. It is therefore permissible to wonder, although no
unassailable answers would be forthcoming, why Bank management did not
choose to confront the Yugoslav authorities with the issues raised by the
Bank's own staff. One possible explanation seems to be that, by the late
1980s, domestic politics had become even more entangled, thereby
strengthening the imperative need for consensus amd, in turn, delaying
decision-making even more than in the past. Faced with a deteriorating
economy and a political mosaic, Bank management may have decided, like so
many other observers of the Yugoslav scene, that continued eircumspection
was, after all, the most sensible posture.
104.      In the meantime, Railways VII was being prepared, and road
transport was cutting deeply into the freight market. In 1987, YR had
Increased its freight traffic volume to 26.1 billion ton-km (from 18
billion in 1965) -- but, over the same period, road transport had gone from
7.0 to 45.4 billion ton-km. Road gains in passenger transport were even
more impressives YR dropped from 12.1 billion passenger-km in 1965 to 11.8
billion in 1987, while road tras4port went from 17 to 140 billion. The
organizational, management, and financial difficulties of YR were spelled
out in the April 29, 1989 SAR of Railways VII (US$138.0 million of 1989),
and were reflected in the project objectivess
(a)  Supporting of a new momentum for reform within the railways
(b)  Reducing operating costs and increasing operating efficiency by
phasing out low volume freight stations, and reducing the number
of staff, and introducing or enlarging an information system for
train, w.gon, and locomotive control
(c) Assisting the Yugoslav Railways to compete more effectively with
other transport modes, particularly for international traffic
where they are losing market share, by improving the condition
of the main trunk link
(d)  Increasing locomotive availability through adequate provision of
spare parts, and
(e) Improving the Yugoslav Railways financial position in an
environment of high inflation through timely tariff Increases,
reduced operating costs and better investment planning.
The problems implied in the listing of these objectives are similar to
those faced by YR twenty years earlier.  However, comparison of the Jun  7,
1974 Railways IV SAR with the April 29, 1989 Railways VII SAR reveals that
the former document's unbridled optimism had now been replaced by
thoughtful caution. In 1989, the Bank was no longer willing to suggest
that one railway project, fortified by no matter how many covenants and
action plans, could be expected to resolve difficulties accumulated over
generations. 121  The Railways VII SAR shows that the lessons drawn from
121  The Railways VII SAR noted under 'RisksUs "... While Government and
railways management are committed to reforming Yugoslav railways,
Implementation may prove difficult. In particular there are three
project risks which are significanet (a) The GovernmentICommittees
of Interest might delay railway tariff increases or fail to provide
counterpart funds or compensation in a period of rapid inflation



36
the earlier projects have been internalized and that the need has been
understood for thorough preparation, simple design, sufficient time for
Implementation, and systematic supervision. The design of Railways VII
indicates that due account is now being taken of difficulties in the
pursuit of financial objectives, and In recruitment of qualified staff.
Also, It concedes that institutional development ought to be undertaken
during a time period such longer than that of one, or even two ox three,
Bank-financed projects. The change of attitude reflected in the inception
and design of Railways VII represents a step forward in Bank-Borrower
relations.
Conclusions and recommendations
105.      Before extending assistance to YR, did the Bank identify the
really important problems, and did it discuss its views with the Borrower?
The Bank identified the fundamental issue as early as 1972: YR was no
longer a monopoly, trucking was increasing its market share, but YR could
still play a significant role in transport. To do so, YR would have to
become competitive, more responsive to market signals, less dependent on
subsidies. The Bank elaborated in detail on how these changes could come
about: improve productivity; reduce surplus staff; review pricing policies;
determine profitability of different services; strengthen marketing;
strengthen investment planning; revise the accounting system; review
methods for calculating depreciation. The Borrower concurred with most of
these suggestions but was not convinced about the soundness of the central
hypothesis -- that subs idies distort resource allocation, and that a
railway that counts on subsidies will not be competitive.
106.      The objective of the Fourth, Fifth and Kosovo Railway Projects
was institutional strengthening: competitiveness had to be Improved through
increased efficiency, quality of service and carrying capacity so that,
eventually, YR would be financially self-sufficient. The Borrower agreed
to loan covenants designed to reduce YR reliance on subsidies but when the
covenants were not observed, the Bank took no decisi-e action, such as
which would result in operating losses and a shortage of local funds
for investments. (b) Traffic demand might stagnate or decrease rather
than slowly increase as forecast if the Yugoslav economy deteriorates
due to lack of appropriate adjustment policies. (c) Operating costs
may remain high if railways do not implement their action plans
satisfactorily, in particular if they do not reduce their staff by 22
p.a. In spite of significant risks, we feel it Is reasonable to
propose these loans because of the Government's commitment to
economic reform as demonstrated by recent constitutional and ordinary
law changes, and Yugoslav railways preparation of and commitment to a
'Business Plan' which is a de facto reform program for railways...."
Events have shown that the caution and prudence reflected in the
April 1989 SAR were justified. The November 21, 1989 SR notes that,
six months after being approved, the Railways VII loan had not yet
been signed. In June 1990, political and financial factors continue
to prevent loan signature.



37
susponsion of disbursements, that would have demonstrated the importance it
attached to the transformation of YR into a financially viable enterprise.
In the audit's opinion, this lack of firmness has reduced the Borrower's
esteem for the Bank.
107.      For the Bank, recollection of three lessons from the past may
contribute to the design of more effective assistance in the future.
*** The role of YR goes beyond transport pure and simple. Besides
performing the familiar task of domestic and international movement
of goods and passengers, YR are an instrument for the promotion of
national cohesion, for rapid movement of troops when the necessity
arises, for distribution of investments and jobs among different
Provinces and Republics. Consequently, and regardless of how
advantageous -- from the economic and financial viewpoint -- road
transport may be, Govtrnment will not allow the railway to wither
away.
Bank-financed railway projects were plagued by implementation
difficulties, cost overruns, and long delays. Still, they did assist
in the modernization of YR which, otherwise, would have been in even
greater difficulties than they actually are. Lacking an overall
transport plan, the Bank cannot determine whether specific
investments in a railway loan represent optimal use of scarce
resources. This has two implications. First, it will be unrealistic
to hope that any Bank loan will ever embody sufficient leverage to
influence the full set of investment decisions throughout the YR
network. Second, and consequently, the Bank ought to limit itself to
ensuring that railway investmnts included In its loans are
independently viable, that they have adequate financing, and that
they represent the least cost solution.
*** Despite some recent improvements, Bank-Borrower relations have not,
on the whole, been either smooth or particularly cordial. They might
have been more productive if the Bank was willing to place greater
faith in Yugoslav professionals. The socio-political system may well
constrain staff performance but, in that case, the Bank's
contribution would be to help those who felt the need for change.
There is no evidence that any special efforts were made in this
admittedly difficult direction. On the contrary, it seems that Bank
insistence upon measures that would be politically difficult to
implement (personnel reductions, tariff increases), plus insistence
that YR retain expatriate assistance, discouraged YR staff from
exerting themselves. In the future, much can be hoped if the Bank
adopts a less didactic attitude.
108.      In mid-1990, Yugoslavia, like other countries in Eastern Europe,
is engaged in major political and economic transformations. The audit
feels that, more than ever before, the Bank should stand ready to provide
massive support to Yugoslav transport in general and to YR in particular.
For such support to be efftctive however, both the Bank and the Borrower
would have to reconsider the bases of their collaboration.



38
***  Before any further assistance is contemplated, the Bank's sectoral
knowledge must be improved beyond its present, rather rudimentary,
stage. The Bank ought to be allowed to conduct its own studies, so
that its leuding strategy can be more responsive to actual needs. The
Borrower ought to review his belief that substantive participation by
Bank staff in transport sector planning would lead to political
complications between the Federal and the Republican Governments.
Yugoslav willingness to be more transparent is a precondition for
better collaboration.
*** Primarily because the Borrower resisted Bank involvement in sector-
wide planning, Bank lending to transport does not seem to have been
properly balanced among the different modes. In the absence of a
sector-wide strategy, rail-road competition, integration of port-
road-railway services, and tariff policies remain unresolved and
hinder the operation of the entire sector. The Bank ought to
consider postponing any further assistance until the Yugoslav
authorities have worked out a sector-wide strategy that satisfies the
Bank's concern for economy and efficiency.
*** In mid-1990, political factors preserve YR in a state of flux. RTO
Pristina has again been incorporated into RTO Belgrade, and further
rearrangements are quite conceivable. Experience has shown that
direct lending to RTOs does not produce lasting results, and that
lending to YR while RTOs are designated as Executing Agencies, though
politically desirable, is operationally onerous. Regarding future
Bank lending to railways, the audit has the following suggestions:
(a) Yugoslavia is one country, and can afford one railway. For Bank
loans, YR should be both the Borrower and the Executing Agency.
(b) No covenants or conditions that the Bank Is not determined to
enforce should be attached to any loan.
(c) The one covenant which should accompany all future loans, and
which ought to be rigorously enforced, will have to be tied to a
progressive reduction of subsidies. Over the past twenty. years,
no convincing evidence has been forthcoming that a railway which
can count on subsidies will ever be competitive.
