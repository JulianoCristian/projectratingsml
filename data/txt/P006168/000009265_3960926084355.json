Second, the project would facilitate\n            railway and road transport operations that provide essential\n            support to the production sectors. Finally, public and\n            private investment programming and management would be\n            strengthened. This would also include improving the\n            definition of appropriate policy response to the social\n            problems linked to the period of hyperinflation and\n            subsequent adjustment. In support of these cited objectives\n            the project would finance priority equipment, spare parts\n            and other imported inputs in the energy and agriculture\n            sectors. It would also provide foreign exchange for imports\n            for producers in agriculture and assist with private\n            manufacturing and agro-based entities. Technical assistance\n            would be provided to facilitate the restructuring of the\n            railway sector."}, "docdt": "1987-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
