"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Financial Sector\n            Development Policy Loan Project for Egypt were as follows:\n            outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: reforms have\n            been undertaken after a process of close and continuous\n            consultation with all stakeholders. This participative\n            process with wider involvement not only encouraged a more\n            informed evaluation of underlying content of policies but\n            also enhanced the credibility of policies and generated\n            expectations that the reform process will be sustained. One\n            of the reasons advanced for the inability to fully implement\n            the financial sector reform measures in the past was the\n            lack of public support for the measures. It responded\n            effectively to the needs of the authorities by providing\n            them timely support based on clearly established prior\n            actions. It provides quicker feedback and momentum to the\n            reforms that enables follow up and making early adjustments\n            if necessary. It allows continuity in the dialogue with the\n            authorities. Single tranche operations define benchmarks\n            based on information available at the time of implementation\n            and not on some future developments which might not materialize."}, "docdt": "2010-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
