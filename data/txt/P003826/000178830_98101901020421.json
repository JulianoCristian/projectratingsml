on the Java grid from 1984 onwards. The project\n            comprises: (a) construction of a storage dam, 125 m high, at\n            Cirata on the Citarum river; a 1 km water conductor system\n            comprising tunnels, surgetanks, and penstock tunnels; and a\n            500 MW power station (with four generating sets each rated\n            at 125 MW), with an associated 500 kV step-up substation and\n            a 25 km transmission line to nearby Saguling; (b)\n            construction machinery for a PLN task force; and (c) support\n            of the GOI's energy sector program by providing\n            technical assistance, studies and related equipment."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
