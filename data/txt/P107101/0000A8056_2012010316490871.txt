                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall physical progress as of August 31, 2011 was 94%, compared with 56% on October 31, 2010 (last mission). All road sections are substantially completed, lighting and
                         minor pedestrian lane works are remaining to be completed in December 2011. Similarly the cumulative disbursement by end August reached 56% compared to 45% in the last
                         mission. The disbursement lag behind physical progress is mainly attributed to the delayed payment to the contractor, while KM and MoF have been in a long process of
                         reconciliation the SY1389 budget expenditures; which delayed the allocation of budget and eventual payments of contractor's and consultants invoices.
