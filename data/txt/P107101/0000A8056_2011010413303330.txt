                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall physical progress on October 31, 2010 was 56%, compared with 29% on July 31, 2010 (last mission). Similarly the cumulative disbursement by end October reached
                         45% compared with 30% in the last mission. The mission considers this to be a commendable improvement. 6km. equivalent road section, about 23 km. of side drainage ditches and
                         an equivalent 15 km of pedestrian footpath (3-4 m wide) are completed. It is expected that the balance of the road and related works will be completed by April 2011.

                         On the completed sections previously characterized by heavy traffic congestion, the mission during the field visited noted a significant improvement in traffic movement, and the
                         feedback from the road users has been very positive.
