      AFGHANISTAN: KABUL URBAN ROADS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
                            (P107101)

                                 Restructuring Paper


1.     The proposed project restructuring is for an extension of the closing date of the
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund Grant TF93632 from December 31, 2010 to
December 31, 2011, to enable completion of ongoing civil works contracts financed by
the Grant.

2.      Background: The Management Committee of the Afghanistan Reconstruction
Trust Fund (ARTF) approved on December 19, 2008, the Grant 93632-AF in an amount
of US$18 million to finance the Kabul Urban Roads Improvement Project (KURIP). The
Grant Agreement was signed and became effective on February 25, 2009. The project's
development objective is to improve traffic flow on priority corridors or segments of the
main urban roads in Kabul, which is to be achieved through the following components:
   (i) Rehabilitation of about 12 km of existing roads; construction and rehabilitation of
        road side drains and walkways; roundabouts at key intersections; installation of
        street lights;
   (ii) Provision of support to Kabul Municipality (KM) for the preparation, design,
        implementation and supervision of the Project; and establishment of a Project
        Management Unit (PMU) within KM to strengthen the institutional capacity of
        KM.

3.      Project performance: Initially, project implementation had been very slow.
Payment-related disputes between the KM and the project Implementation Consultant
(IC) led to the IC's decision to terminate its contract with KM in August 2009. KM's
inaction to make payments due to the Contractor had seriously affected the Contractor's
cash flow and its ability to execute the four contracts simultaneously. After the new
mayor for KM assumed office in November 2009, the dispute with the IC was resolved
and the IC remobilized in end May 2010. The Bank's October 2010 supervision mission
noted a significant improvement in progress and project management. Physical progress
of project works reached 56 % at the end of October 2010, from 29% in July 2010; Kabul
Municipality has cleared all outstanding payments due to the contractor and the
Implementation Consultant; and the quality of road works has started to show
improvement. Both the Project's Development Objectives and Implementation
Performance have been rated Moderately Satisfactory.

4.      Reasons for Closing Date Extension: The proposed one year extension is based
on (i) the project implementation status; (ii) KM's improved project management,
including making timely project payments; and its action plan formulated to complete the
project activities by the revised closing date; (iii) the Contractor's improved contract
execution progress and quality of works, and (iv) the IC's strengthened on-site
supervision and quality control effort. The proposed extension is necessary to enable

                                            2
completion of project works and cover the defects liability period, thereby achieving the
project objectives.

Recommendation: Based on the above, we would recommend that you approve the
proposed extension of the closing date of TF93632 from December 31, 2010 to
December 31, 2011.
