public-private partnerships that are\n            best suited for integrated and sustainable development of\n            coastal sites in the Moroccan context. The components\n            include: 1) preparation of indicative development plans, and\n            pre-feasibility studies for three new coastal tourism\n            development sites. A conceptual plan for the whole tourism\n            development site will be produced, in addition to indicative\n            development plans, and pre-feasibility studies for the\n            selected tourism development unit, and for the selection of\n            private master developers; 2) technical assistance (TA) to\n            the Department of Development and Investment of the Ministry\n            of Tourism, namely for the supervision, and management of\n            the three new coastal tourism development sites, in addition\n            to three on-going development sites. TA will help prepare\n            indicative development plans, evaluate the private\n            developers proposals, and prepare preliminary contract\n            agreements; and 3) technical assistance to implement the new\n            institutional framework for tourism sites development."}, "docdt": "2000-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
