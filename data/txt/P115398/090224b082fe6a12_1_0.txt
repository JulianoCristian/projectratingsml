1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background

1.              Côte d’Ivoire experienced two decades of rapid development in the post-
independence period, and the country benefited from one of the most dynamic private sectors
that served an engine of growth and jobs in West Africa. However, a prolonged political and
economic crisis weakened the private sector and related institutions, and impeded the
Government’s economic recovery and social stability efforts. The global financial crisis and
economic difficulties in the 1980s further depressed the economy. Economic reforms initiated
in the 1990s—including devaluation of the CFAF, reforms of public enterprise, reduced
government role in markets, and private investments in infrastructure—helped to stimulate the
economy. The difficult economic situation was compounded by political and governance issues,
which became more important at that time. Growing unemployment in the 1990s contributed
to the social and political tensions that eventually led to military coups, armed rebellion, and
regional disparities that split the country into two.

2.             The political crisis and the security governance situation had significant impact
on investments, private sector activity, and jobs because investors and donors lost confidence
and withdrew from the country. Under these conditions the informal sector expanded, tax
evasion and fraud increased, and government revenues declined. Private industry and the
tourism sector were significantly hampered, and by 2006 the contribution to real gross domestic
product (GDP) was 35 percent lower than the pre-crisis level. Average real GDP growth was
negative and below the rest of Union économique et monétaire ouest-africaine and Sub-Saharan
Africa, and real GDP per capita fell by approximately 15 percent cumulatively.

3.              The private sector, dominated by SMEs, has traditionally had an important role
in the Ivorian economy. The main issues and constraints the SMEs faced included racketeering;1
dysfunctional institutions, laws, and regulations concerning businesses, lack of financing,
government accumulation of arrears to SMEs coupled with erosion of private working capital,
weak SME skills and competitiveness, and inadequate provision of public infrastructure and
social services. SMEs and other private enterprises also faced a depressed investment climate,
and a difficult business environment characterized by cumbersome regulations governing the
creation and operation of enterprises.

   According to the Project Appraisal Document, racketeering in this context consists of harassment, extortion,
bribery and, in some cases, physical and sexual assault at roadside checkpoints manned by police and military
personnel. These checkpoints were set up to control traffic during the conflict.
Rationale for Bank Assistance

4.              The proposed project supported the joint Government-World Bank strategy
aimed at helping the country achieve its potential through private sector regeneration and growth.
The Bank supported the Government’s emergency economic and social recovery agenda that is
part of the Ouagadougou Peace Accords first signed in March 2007. Bank support focused on
efforts to improve private sector confidence since it enhances transparency and capacity of state
institutions through sector investment operations, including an International Development
Association (IDA) Economic Governance and Recovery Grant.

5.              The Government of Côte d’Ivoire requested World Bank assistance to support
the revival of the private sector, especially small and medium enterprises, which are essential
for job creation and jumpstarting the local economy. In November 2008 a Bank mission
responded to the request and discussed short- and long-term priorities for economic recovery
with the Government and the main stakeholders. After these consultations, the emergency Small
and Medium Enterprise Revitalization and Governance Project (Projet d'Appui à la
Revitalisation et à la Gouvernance des Entreprises, or PARE-PME) was designed to pave the
way for longer-term actions that would be the basis of an IDA operation to support growth in
Côte d’Ivoire.

Higher-Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes

6.              The project responds to the PRSP objective of promoting shared growth and
alleviating the root cause of the conflict. It aims at improving the investment climate in Côte
d’Ivoire so that the SME sector can better contribute to growth and employment creation. The
project would thus not only help SMEs, but also support all private sector activities. A
successful project outcome will also contribute to the country’s emergence from conflict, and
to improved economic governance. Finally, the project will help prepare policy reforms that
would be pursued in the context of the Government’s broad poverty alleviation program.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.            The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to help improve the performance
of the SME sector in Côte d’Ivoire and the investment climate that affects it.

8.       Key Results Indicators linked to the PDO were:
        Number of new SMEs registered
        Number of new jobs generated

9.              Intermediate results indicators relating to the project components were:

Component A: Direct support to SMEs

        Increase in loans extended by MFC-PME to SME members
        Investments made by SMEs to improve worker performance

                                                 2
Component B: Investment Climate and Governance Reform

         Number of days needed to establish a new business
         Number of days required to settle a commercial dispute
         Percentage of court decisions published on the web site
         Decrease in additional transportation cost caused by racketeering

Component C: Institutional Support and Project Implementation

         Timely production of project reports

10.             These indicators were to be measured by regular project monitoring, survey of
firm satisfaction, and other sources identified in the results framework and monitoring provided
in annex 10.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

11.              The PDO and key indicators were not revised during the life of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.             The main beneficiaries of the project were targeted SME firms and associations
with access to nonfinancial business development services and access to financial services; the
business consulting sector with an improvement of availability and efficiency of business
services; and the private sector, which were to benefit from an improved investment climate.

13.             Improvements in the business climate and the development of institutions that
facilitated private sector development had important spillovers and sector linkages that would
create jobs, income, and trade opportunities that would promote social stability, benefit the
general public in Côte d’Ivoire, and promote regional integration and growth in West Africa.

1.5 Original Components

14.              The Project had three components:

Component 1: Direct support to SMEs (US$11.3 million, of which IDA US$8.1 million, private
sector US$3.2 million)

15.              The objective of Component 1 was to strengthen SMEs by: (i) providing
technical advice and training through a matching grant program to help SMEs improve
productivity and competitiveness, and acquire needed know-how through the Enterprise
Revitalization Support Fund (Fonds d’Appui à la Revitalisation des Entreprises, FARE); and
(ii) contribute to reducing the financial constraints faced by SMEs that are members of FIPME
(Fédération Ivoirienne des Petites et Moyennes Entreprises) through the purchase of audited
debts that the Government owed SME members of FIPME. The proceeds of this purchase were
to be used to capitalize the SME mutual fund MFC-PME (Mutuelle de Financement et de Crédit
                                                  3
des PME) created by FIPME, whose mandate was to provide working capital to its SME
members. The project was to also finance technical assistance (TA) to the Fund.

Component 2: Investment Climate and Governance Reforms (US$5.0 million of which IDA
US$4.6 million; Borrower 0.4 million)

16.             This component supported the introduction of reforms which could be easy to
implement and have a quick impact on the business environment and thus assist the government
in meeting its objective of promoting competitiveness and encouraging private investments.
Activities included:

          The establishment of a pilot Commercial Court in Abidjan and its business registry and
           finalizing, in consultation with all stakeholders, a draft legislation and action plan
           prepared by the Ministry of Justice in 2008.

          Improvements in the regulatory framework for business including the establishment of
           a one-stop shop for business creation (guichet unique), assistance to the formulation of
           investment climate reforms and support to the public-private dialogue

          The implementation of a program to curb racketeering, based on the recommendation of
           the World Bank–funded study on the subject. 2 The CTCFR (Comité Technique de
           Contrôle de la Fluidité Routière) was to be established to implement the
           recommendations under a pilot phase in the Abidjan district, while other technical and
           financial partners agreed to finance subsequent phases of the program.

Component 3: Institutional Support and Project Implementation (IDA: US$2.3 million).

17.            The objective of this Component was to: (i) finance studies to assist in the
formulation of a private sector strategy; to improve competitiveness, and help define modalities
to implement the Public Private Partnership; and (ii) provide support for project implementation.

1.6 Revised Components

18.            The project restructuring in November 2011 did not result in any significant
change to the original PDO and the three components.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.           Significant changes were made to fine tune the institutional, governance, and
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements in response to slow execution of the first two

phases of the project, and the need to improve implementation following formal resumption of
World Bank operations after the 2010–2011 political crisis. In the second year of operation
(2011–2012), the team re-engaged with project stakeholders, confirming the relevance of the
project and its structure, ensuring that the conditions for its effective implementation were
present in the post-crisis context, and funds that were not used by the matching grant (CFAF
240 million) were reallocated to other activities. The project implementation unit (PIU)
recruited a full-time project manager, as recommended by a June 2012 World Bank supervision
mission, and the steering committee was revamped to ensure stronger private sector
representation with the inclusion of the Investment Promotion Agency CEPICI (Centre de
Promotion des Investissements en Côte d’Ivoire), the presidency, and the Ministry of SME. A
dedicated M&E specialist, recruited by the PIU, updated the M&E framework and oversight
arrangements.

20.             A level II restructuring was approved on November 8, 2011 to formalize
recommended changes to the project steering committee and beneficiaries, modification to the
M&E framework, and reallocation of funds across project components. The Government
requested, and the Bank approved, a nine-month extension of the project from an end date of
January 31, 2014 to October 31, 2014 to consolidate the completion of project activities and
achievement of the PDOs. These project restructurings did not result in any changes to the PDO
and indicators.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

21.             The use of the rapid response process facilitated project processing in direct
response to the Government’s urgent needs to address unemployment created by the disruption
of economic activity, worsening security conditions, and racketeering—all of which were
underlying the cause and effect of the crisis. The Fund for the Revitalization of SMEs,
FARE/PME (Fonds d’Appui à la Revitalisation des PME) project was designed as a pilot re-
engagement instrument to support investment climate reform and improve private sector
performance after the prolonged crisis. But project implementation was challenging, particularly
in the early phases.

23.            The three important phases of the project were the launching phase in 2009, the
interruption phase due to the political crisis from mid-2010 to mid-2011, and the re-launching
and implementation phase after the crisis, from mid-2011 to the project closing date.

24.            At the launching phase, the critical challenge was to meet all effectiveness
conditions necessary for project activities to start. The effectiveness conditions included the
signing of a Subsidiary Agreement between the Government and the Export Promotion Agency
APEX-CI (Association pour la Promotion des Exportations de Côte d’Ivoire) that was
acceptable to IDA; the effectiveness of the steering committee (Comité de Pilotage); updating
the Financial and Accounting Procedures Manual; and recruiting an internal auditor and a
procurement specialist. The delays in meeting these conditions meant that project activities
started in May 2010.

25.             The second phase of the project was highly challenging, marked by the
interruption of activities due to the political crisis. From December 2010 to September 2011, all
project activities and public and private administration stopped, and project activities came to a
                                                        6
complete standstill.

26.             The third phase saw a turnaround in implementation of project activities and was
the most dynamic and productive phase. The project team re-engaged with all stakeholders––
public, private, and World Bank––and project activities were put back on track. The project
management was particularly proactive, disbursement increased, and project execution
intensified.

27.              The three phases of implementation show how project performance varied over
the life of the project. Achievement of the project outcomes was below expectations in the first
two phases, but this turned around in phase 3. There was strong commitment from the
Government, private sector and donors in phase 3, and the overall performance of project
outcomes is due mainly to progress made in delivering outputs in this phase. Improvements in
the political climate and project-induced change in the business environment also had positive
effects on investor confidence and private sector engagement during project implementation.

28.            The development of recommendations, time bound action plans and road maps,
and close supervision to follow up on the implementation of action plans during Bank
supervision missions and reviews led to a number of mid-term course corrections that helped
improve performance during project implementation. Key changes in the project implementing
agency, steering committee, and M&E arrangements enhanced project implementation and
achievements. Also, close World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC)
collaboration ensured strong technical support and enhanced project supervision that
contributed to notable progress across the project components.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis

29.             A survey of small, medium, and large enterprises was conducted in Côte d’Ivoire
in 2008 as part of an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA). The survey identified the main
constraints to private sector development and other constraints that affected enterprise
development and growth. The ICA highlighted the depressed state of doing business in Côte
d’Ivoire: the country ranking was 161 out of 181 countries in the overall business environment
indicator in the World Bank report Doing Business 2009 (DB), and 167 out of 181 in the
business creation indicator. A joint World Bank-IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) provided additional insights on SMEs limited access to credit banks, a problem that was
worsened by losses incurred during the crisis. The Bank-supported study on racketeering,
completed in January 2009, estimated that the additional cost of transport caused by roadblocks
and informal levies was as high as CFAF 34 per metric ton per kilometer across the country.

30.            The SME and ICA survey data, the FSAP, and the racketeering study, as along
with consultations with stakeholders and strategic diagnostics undertaken in the context of the
operation and preparation of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), underpinned the objectives
and design of the project.


                                                7
Inclusion of lessons learned

31.              Lessons learned from operations in fragile and post-conflict situations and from
private sector operations—including the Côte d’Ivoire Private Sector Capacity Building Project
(Cr. 3104)—were used in the project preparation. The Government-Private Sector Consultation
Committee, revived in 2008, was another mechanism for PPD that was used as an important
pillar for the project’s design.

Overall project design

32.              The project was prepared by an experienced, multisectoral team drawn from the
World Bank and IFC. The operation benefited from the diverse team’s expertise in key areas
such as private sector and SME development, and financial sector and investment climate
reforms. The project team considered the Government’s priorities for SMEs and consulted with
public and private stakeholders, including a number of multilateral and bilateral donors. The
preferred Bank lending instrument was a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) because of its
flexibility in supporting private sector activities, such as providing direct support to SMEs, and
financing TA, equipment, and minor civil works. The SIL was also expected to support TA for
Government to facilitate implementation of its private sector reform agenda, including job
creation through promotion of SMEs.

 Assessment of risks

33.            Overall project risk was assessed as Substantial, with three elements assessed as
high. The three elements are as follows:

      The political situation would not normalize, or conflict resumes because of lack of
       progress on elections and security. The mitigation measure was to sustain international
       community support for implementation of the Ouagadougou Accords to ensure elections
       were held. This risk did not materialize because elections were held and the political
       situation continued to improve.

      There were two risks to the macroeconomic framework at appraisal: the unstable world
       economy that could adversely affect foreign direct investment and other capital flow,
       and the Government’s significant arrears and debt servicing pressures while it sought to
       finance the country’s recovery and stability. The mitigation measure to the risk included
       government implementation of a number of programs approved by the International
       Monetary Fund (IMF), and commitment to rapid attainment of the heavily indebted poor
       country decision and completion points, and the commitment of the Government to
       adjust its macroeconomic program to address possible exogenous shocks. Donor budget
       support also helped offset debt servicing and reconstruction programs crucial for social
       stability and economic recovery. The risks in the macroeconomic framework were
       largely mitigated. Data from the IMF and the Economic Intelligence Unit showed that
       Côte d’Ivoire made significant improvements in the transition from post-crisis recovery
       to a more sustainable growth path, although with periodic setbacks), and performance
       on IMF programs was strong. Continued support from multilateral and bilateral donors

                                                 8
          also increased fiscal performance, which facilitated establishment of the mutual fund
          and the purchase of SME’s debts.

         The post-conflict environment and persistent volatile sociopolitical situation would not
          guarantee effective procurement system functioning. This risk was expected to be
          mitigated by project supervision missions, and post-procurement and Statement of
          Expenses reviews and audits. This risk was also largely mitigated.

34.            As previously noted, the country continued to make progress on political stability,
and all scheduled Bank supervisions were conducted. Procurement arrangements were well
managed by the project, although some equipment valued at about US$169,000 was not
delivered on time at project closing.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation arrangement

35.             The project was designed and implemented to be a cornerstone of the
Government’s post-crisis, private sector–led strategy, with a strong focus on promoting SMEs
and improving the investment climate. To accelerate project implementation and fiduciary risk
supervision, the project preparation team set up a disbursement mechanism through an existing
private institution, APEX-CI, which had successfully implemented the IDA-financed Private
Sector Development Project. APEX-CI was responsible for all procurement, disbursement,
accounting, financial reporting, and M&E, and for ensuring the auditing of project accounts.
APEX-CI was also responsible for management of the matching grant component and
coordination of all project activities.

36.             A Subsidiary Agreement was signed between the Government and APEX-CI to
formalize the role of APEX-CI as an executing agency. A steering committee made up of
representatives of all stakeholders involved in the project implementation was established to
provide guidance to APEX-CI. Also, specific private agencies or public administration were
identified to implement other project subcomponents.

37.              The first two years of the project were particularly challenging, including a
virtual halt in project implementation because of the political conflict in the country. The project
was restructured in November 2011 to accelerate its implementation, and all activities were
implemented from late 2011 to October 2014. After project activities resumed in June 2011,
overall implementation remained limited. Given the slow mobilization and little progress across
components, the Bank rated the Small and Medium Enterprise Revitalization and Governance
Project PARE-PME (Projet d'Appui a la Revitalisation et a la Gouvernance des Entreprises) as
moderately unsatisfactory and noted it as a problem project in the Region’s portfolio, thus
requiring close supervision and proactive measures.

Project Restructuring During Implementation

38.              The November 2011 restructuring focused on two adjustments. First, a budget

                                                  9
reallocation provided more resources to the unit in charge of fighting racketeering. The budget
for this activity was initially US$1,100,000, but the Ivoirian government asked the Bank to
increase the allocation for this subcomponent by US$1,200,000 because of the magnitude of the
effort and the need to thoroughly address this phenomenon.

39.            The second adjustment was made to address the June 2012 supervision mission’s
recommendation to recruit a full time project manager. After the political crisis, when project
activities were put back on track project management needed more intensive follow-up and
focus on activities with high potential impact. The restructuring also aimed to improve the
steering committee’s strategic activities by including more members with stronger private sector
orientation. A budget reallocation was also made to enhance the operationalization of the
Commercial Court.

40.             The Government requested an extension of the project in September 2013,
extending the closing date from January 31, 2014 to October 31, 2014. This adjustment was
justified by the need to continue achieving objectives that could greatly impact the private sector
environment and create more conditions to facilitate job creation. The achievement of all the
project objectives was also expected to pave the way for a large, ambitious, integrated economic
support operation.

41.            A mid-year review was conducted in October 2012, and key findings included
the following:

      Project activities picked up significantly during the first half of 2012, and
       implementation of all components was on track. Successful implementation of project
       activities translated to an increase in disbursement—up from 22 percent in June to 46
       percent in November 2012, taking into account all ongoing payments in the pipeline at
       the time of the review. Given this progress, the project rating was upgraded from
       moderately unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory, and an action plan was drafted to
       serve as a road map to accelerate project implementation and disbursement.

      The overall institutional governance of the project was not satisfactory, and
       communication among project stakeholders was not adequate. In spite of progress made
       by the APEX-CI staff during the first half of 2012, project coordination was not
       proactive and visible. Much of this was attributed to the fact that the project management
       was weak.

      The steering committee was not effective in its governance role, due to inadequate
       private sector representation.

42.           Aside from the observed improvements toward achievement of project
objectives, the mid-year review recommended changes in the project’s institutional
arrangements, governance, beneficiary and stakeholder engagement, and M&E.

43.          Subsequent Bank supervision missions developed recommendations and time-
bound action plans that were agreed to with the authorities (and updated in subsequent

                                                 10
supervision and review missions) were to serve as a road map for the PIU and stakeholders to
help realize targeted activities and make progress toward the project’s development objectives.
The recruitment for a full-time project manager to address day-to-day project management
enhanced implementation of project activities which led to increased disbursement. It also
improved the project’s visibility to all stakeholders and facilitated communications both within
the project and between the project and beneficiaries. The steering committee was also
revamped with new, committed members and met regularly after the adjustments from the 2012
project restructuring. However, as noted in some supervision reports, the project’s management
did not systematically implement all of the recommendations made, and in other cases
recommendations were implemented late, thus delaying project activities.

44.            Overall, intensive project supervision, close Country Management Unit
monitoring and sustained commitment from Government and stakeholders—including the
private sector—resulted in noticeable improvements in project implementation and enhanced
prospects for achieving outcomes/results and the project’s development objectives. These
achievements translated into continued improvements in project performance from moderately
unsatisfactory in June 2012 to satisfactory, and an increase in disbursement rates from 22
percent in June 2012 to about 98 percent at project closing in 2014.

Partnership Arrangement and Coordination with IFC in Project Implementation

45.            IFC worked with the Bank to enhance the project’s impact on private sector and
SME development. Its role was to support the project objectives through its Foreign Investment
Advisory Services and through funding to the local banking sector through lines of credit and/or
guarantee facilities for SMEs.

46.             World Bank-IFC collaboration was a noticeable feature of project
implementation. Component 2 of the PARE-PME was implemented in close synergy with the
IFC Business Regulation Program, as reflected in joint supervision and activities and overall
client dialogue on the investment climate. After the 2011 post-electoral crisis and the
acceleration of project activities, the PARE-PME, in collaboration with IFC, helped create and
strengthen a dedicated Doing Business Reform Unit within CEPICI under the sponsorship of
the prime minister. The unit coordinated the annual DB reform agenda, in collaboration with
multiple public and private stakeholders, enabling Côte d'Ivoire to achieve a strong track record
of reforms in 2013 and 2014. Specific reforms—such as creating the one-stop shop, the
Commercial Court, and the credit registry RCCM (Registre de Commerce et de Crédit Mobilier),
and the simplification of procedures and costs for business registration and other formalities—
also benefited from IFC-World Bank synergy in providing support to the Government with
crucial legal, institutional, and regulatory TA, and capacity building (including equipment,
training, and so on). Component 1 (direct support to SMEs) also benefited from joint
supervision and support from IFC, which was complementary to ongoing IFC support to
financial intermediaries; for example, the MCF-PME (Mutuelle de Financement et de Crédit
des PME) established partnership agreements with BICICI (Banque Internationale du
Commerce et de l’Industrie de Côte d’Ivoire), a local bank involved in an IFC SME support
program.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

M&E Design

47.              At project preparation, results framework and monitoring were set up, but staff
positions were not included at preparation and there was no clear plan for implementing M&E.
Consequently the PIU did not recruit M&E staff, and the project did not have a functioning
M&E system during the first two years of the project life. This was due, in part, to the difficult
political situation at project preparation which made it particularly difficult to gather baseline
data from credible data sources.

M&E Implementation

48.             The absence of a functioning M&E system at project design meant that baseline
data were not available for Component 1, direct support to SMEs that required information from
potential beneficiaries. This gap was addressed during the 2012 mid-term review, and actions
were taken to recruit full time M&E staff and design a strong M&E plan. The absence of
baseline and other monitoring data for a key project component was a major shortcoming that
made it especially difficult to assess project performance and undertake rigorous economic
analysis to evaluate impact on beneficiaries. Baseline data from secondary sources—including
international benchmarking from Doing Business reports and other studies, such as the
racketeering study—provided useful baselines for the investment climate and governance
reform. As previously discussed, the adjustments to the M&E system established a robust data
collection system, which was used to monitor project performance.

M&E Utilization

49.           After the mid-year review, data from the M&E system was used to assess
performance as inputs into the strategic studies that the project supported. But the utilization of
M&E for decision making on project performance, satisfaction of project beneficiaries, and
assessment of project impacts at project closing stands out as a major shortcoming.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

50.            The project’s safeguard was classified as Category C and had no social or
environmental issues during implementation. The project’s fiduciary management was rated
satisfactory and in compliance during project implementation, and no major issues were raised
about financial management. A recommendations agenda was set up and monitored in
subsequent missions to deal with the management issues noted during the Bank supervision and
technical missions. The project’s fiduciary management was, in general, acceptable throughout
project implementation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives: High

51.             Improving performance of the SME sector in Côte d’Ivoire and the investment
climate were highly relevant for promoting private sector development and economic growth at
the design of the Project and in the current circumstances. The CPS, FY10-FY 13, strategic
objectives for Côte d’Ivoire has four pillars – strengthening governance and institutions,
improving the performance of the agriculture sector, strengthening the private sector, and
infrastructure renewal and basic services. The project directly supported two of these pillars –
strengthening the private sector and strengthening governance and institutions - by providing
support to small and medium enterprises, promoting reforms that improve the business
environment, strengthening competitiveness, and helping to build key institutions such as the
commercial court, investment promotion agency, and credit union for SMEs.

Relevance of Design: Substantial

52.             Two of the three project components – direct support to SMEs and investment
climate and governance reforms – were critical for achieving the Project’s objective. The
inclusion of strong private sector representation in the institutional support and implementation
arrangements also ensured that project design was responsive to the priority needs of SMEs and
the private sector. The design of the project involved a participatory process, with consultations
engaging all key public and private stakeholders at preparation and during implementation.
Project design also took into account strategies and policy priorities articulated in key
government and Bank documents, such as the ICA, the racketeering study, the FSAP, the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and the Country Sector Strategy. The project also addressed
key issues in the World Bank Strategy for Côte d’Ivoire, as specified in the Interim Strategy
Note for Côte d’Ivoire 2008, and financial sector reforms were and still are important priorities
in the Bank-Government policy dialogue.

Relevance of Implementation: Substantial

53.              Notwithstanding the challenges in the post-conflict situation in which the project
was implemented, the project team’s interventions were critical for ensuring the continued
relevance of the project and achievement of project objectives. The team developed detailed
action plans that served as a road map for the PIU and other stakeholders work on achieving
targeted activities and tracking progress against project objectives. The mid-year review and
level II restructuring led to adjustments in the PIU, Steering Committee, and M&E that resulted
in substantial improvements in implementation of project activities and reflected in sustained
increases in disbursement rates and performance ratings over the life of the project. The
outcomes from the project remained important in the country’s priority development objectives
even after its closure. Government continued to build on the Project outcomes and priorities
identified in the CPS. Current development priorities reflected in the National Development
Plan, 2012-2015, emphasizes strong SME and private sector participation and an improved

                                                 13
business environment as key pillars for economic recovery and industrialization. World Bank
and Government strategies, policies, and programs are also building on relevant findings and
lessons from the operation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating of Achievement of PDO: Substantial

54.             The project was successful in helping to improve the performance of the SME
sector in Côte d’Ivoire and the investment climate that affects it. To do this the Project helped
improve productivity and competitiveness of SMEs, promoted reforms that improved the
business environment, and generated evidence to inform a more competitive economy. The
project’s achievements in improving the performance of the SME sector and investment climate,
reflected in the key performance indicators, indicated a more than seven-fold increase in the
number of new SMEs registered at the one-stop shop and 154 percent increase in number of
new jobs generated by registered SMEs

55.             Improved performance of the SME sector in Côte d’Ivoire: This was
achieved through the financial and non-financial support provided by the project. The matching
grant scheme that subsidized 50 percent of the costs of training and other business development
services helped SMEs acquire needed know-how for reducing cost and improving firm
productivity. In addition, a mutual fund helped reduce SMEs’ financial burden through the
purchase of audited debt obligations of the Government to SME members of FIPME. The
matching grant scheme FARE/PME provided SMEs with access to finance, and capacity
building in management and organization, production processes and technologies, and
marketing and commercial activities. The establishment of the mutual fund MCF-PME helped
reduce the cash flow problems of participating SMEs arising from the accumulation of arrears
from the state and supported capacity building of the Ivorian Federation of SMEs that
represented the interests of SMEs in their engagement with Government and other organizations,
including development agencies. These interventions were fully implemented during the course
of the project, and performance targets set during project preparation were surpassed in most
areas. The Project’s direct support to SMEs resulted in more than nine-fold increase in
investment made by SMEs beneficiaries of the matching grant and an increase in average MFC-
PME lending to SME members from a target of 10 percent to 63 percent. SMEs respondents in
the beneficiary assessment conducted at project closing reported that the financing and non-
financing project support enabled them to improve managerial capacity, financial management,
and to access to technology and finance. According to the SMEs, these factors were critical in
improving productivity, reducing costs, and improving the quality of products sold or services
delivered.

56.            Improved investment climate that affects the SME sector in Côte d’Ivoire :
Project achievements that contributed to improving the business environment included :

      Creating a one-stop shop for business formalities anchored within the Investment
       Promotion Agency (CEPICI)—simplifying processes and reducing costs related to
       business creation

                                                14
      Supporting a Doing Business Reform Team, under the sponsorship of the prime
       minister’s office and the technical coordination of CEPICI

      Strengthening CCESP (Comité de Concertation Etat-Secteur Privé), the Public Private
       Dialogue (PPD) platform

      Establishing a specialized Commercial Court and modernizing RCCM

      Supporting the Government’s program to curb roadside racketeering, including
       communication campaigns, training, and technical support to the anti-racket unit ULCR
       (Unité de lutte contre le racket) and call center

57.             The project demonstrated successful outcomes in all of these areas. A one-stop
shop for business formalities housed within CEPICI was formally launched in December 2012.
A Doing Business Reform Unit was effectively set up within CEPICI. CCESP, largely inactive
during the crisis, was reinvigorated with the project’s support, including coordinating
consultations on competitiveness and establishment of industrial zones. The Commercial Court
of Abidjan was formally launched in October 2012, reducing the number of days required to
settle a dispute. Project interventions also enhanced the Commercial Court’s transparency, with
nearly all of its decisions published on its publicly accessible website at project closure. The
Court also developed an information system that was compatible to the Organization for the
Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (Organisation pour l'Harmonisation en Afrique du
Droit des Affaires), which modernized the RCCM. The sub-component supporting the anti-
racketeering program was fully implemented, including communication campaigns, capacity
building, and technical support to the anti-racketeering unit and call center. End of project results
for investment climate and governance reforms indicated the following achievements: (i) a
reduction in the number of days to establish a business (from 40 days to seven days);
(ii) decrease in the average number of days to settle a commercial dispute (from 770 days to
525 days); (iii) 100 percent publication of commercial court decisions on its website; and; (iv)
49 percent reduction in the average additional transportation cost induced by racketeering.
These reforms were critical in reducing transaction costs as well as providing incentives and
comfort for private investors.

58.             The successful delivery of investment climate reform outcomes that improved
the business climate in Côte d’Ivoire laid a sound foundation for sustaining investment climate
reforms. The Doing Business ranking for Côte d’Ivoire increased from 177 to 147 during the
project cycle, and the country is recognized among the Top 10 Global Reformers in two
consecutive DB Reports (2014 and 2015), with at least four reforms recorded each year. Such
achievements are reflected in increasing private sector participation in current economic
recovery efforts in Côte d’Ivoire.

59.            Overall, these results for achievement of the PDO, direct support for SMEs, and
investment climate and governance reforms largely met or surpassed the targets set during
project preparation. However, the absence of credible baseline data on outcome indicators for
the matching grant and MCF-PME at the beginning of the project—due mainly to the
challenging country context during project preparation and launch which preceded the post-

                                                  15
electoral conflict—made it especially difficult to accurately assess some of the achievements
regarding improved performance of SMEs.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating of Efficiency: Substantial

60.             Assessment of efficiency is based on quantitative and qualitative assessment of
project impacts obtained from information contained in project documents, beneficiary
assessments, and other secondary sources. The project was developed to improve performance
of the SME sector and the investment climate that affects it. The main beneficiaries of the
project and their intended benefits were targeted firms and associations, with access to finance
and nonfinancial business development services; the business consulting sector, with improved
availability and efficiency of business services; and the private sector, which benefits from an
improved investment climate.

61.              At appraisal, a cost-benefit analysis was performed for the matching grant
component, accounting for 32 percent of the total project cost, for which expected benefits could
be reasonably quantified. For the four-year project lifetime, the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) estimated a net present value (NPV) of US$7.3 million, and an economic rate of return
(ERR) of 38 percent. The ex-post NPV and ERR, based on project data, are estimated at
US$27 million and 61 percent, respectively—estimates that are significantly higher than those
estimated at project preparation. The estimated actual benefits are higher because the actual
number of jobs created from the matching grant was 1,598, which is higher than the projected
1,000 jobs used in the PAD. Given the number of beneficiary SMEs, which remained close to
the PAD target, the actual number of jobs created per SME was 15.8, compared with 10 in the
PAD. However, it is important to note that the baseline data used for assessment of impact are
targets based on strong assumptions because the project M&E system did not systematically
collect all the data required for a rigorous ex-post assessment of costs and benefits.

62.              Estimated cost compliance savings in four reform areas—starting a business,
construction permits, registering property, and enforcing contracts—are about US$8.8 million
as of February 2014, representing a 78 percent savings from 2012. In two areas, starting
business and enforcing contracts, where cost compliance savings from reforms were
implemented jointly with the PARE-PME project, estimated savings improved by 41 percent
and 99 percent (respectively) from the 2012 baseline values. The direct costs of the achieving
these cost savings was $3.55 million, representing by the cost of enterprise licensing ($2.35
million) and commercial courts ($1.20 million) sub-components of the investment climate and
governance reforms. Using the estimated benefits, measured by the estimated cost compliance
savings, and the direct costs of the related sub-components, the benefit cost ratio is 2.4. This
indicates that the benefits from cost compliance savings outweigh the costs and that the objective
in the investment climate and governance reform was achieved efficiently.




                                                16
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

63.            The relevance of project objective was rated high while design and
implementation were substantial due mainly to the challenging situation faced by the project in
the first two phases. Notwithstanding these challenges the rating on achievement of
development objectives was substantial given that most output targets were achieved or
surpassed at closing. Efficiency was rated substantial given that cost-benefit analysis of the
matching grant and investment climate reforms indicated that the objectives in both components
were achieved efficiently.

3.5 Overarching Themes, and Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

64.             The beneficiary assessment pointed to a number of issues that are relevant to the
Project’s contribution to creating jobs and income opportunities. About 34 percent of SMEs
reported increases in sales revenue and number of new partnerships and 20 percent an increase
in trading partners as a result of the project support. In addition, 64 percent of SMEs reported
that the matching grant enhanced their capabilities to run their businesses.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

65.             The framework and structure for implementing investment climate reforms that
were established by the joint PARE-PME and IFC business regulation programs also enhanced
the sustainability of the reform agenda. These arrangements are being used to implement other
reforms beyond doing business, such as reforms on inspection and business licensing and
taxation.

66.            The contribution of the project to building institutions (the Commercial Court,
the Investment Promotion Agency CEPICI, the Export Promotion Agency APEX-CI, a credit
union for SMEs) is essential to helping Côte d’Ivoire implement crucial reforms under the
project, but most important, after the project, paving the way for a second generation of reforms
on competitiveness, innovation, cluster and growth poles strategies for sustainable investment
and job creation. Even though the project focused more on a short-term intervention—which
seemed appropriate given the uncertain situation and the immediate challenges and
opportunities—it also aimed to build the right institutional capacity, and a broad strategic
roadmap for longer-term World Bank support.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

67.           The completion of the PARE-PME project and its achievements at project end
were commendable, given the very difficult political context in which it was designed and
implemented. Project interventions contributed immensely to public and private sector
commitments to the private sector reform agenda in Côte d’Ivoire. For example, project
supported missions involving World Bank management and senior advisors in West Africa
                                                17
played a key role in ensuring political engagement and setting a clear direction for the private
sector agenda. These interventions helped revitalize the CEPICI, where the one-stop shop was
eventually established, public private dialogues, and establishment of the commercial court.
These outcomes continue to be key pillars of the private sector and SME development agenda.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

68.            In general, the project beneficiaries recognize that the project was relevant and
helped them address some crucial issues such as access to finance and the improvement of their
capacity through TA. However, they found some conditions highly constraining, such as the 50
percent contribution in the matching grant component, the loan ceiling, and the refundable
period.

69.             Importantly, the TA enabled SMEs to improve their managerial capacity,
specifically to present credible documents such as loan applications and business plans; it also
gave them the opportunity to access more financing through the banking system. For example,
because of project TA, some MFC-PME members are now in partnership with BICICI.

70.            All public and private beneficiaries noted that the project greatly improved the
country’s investment climate.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

71.             A more stable political situation, an improvement in the investment environment,
and strong economic growth helped to mitigate a number of risks that were rated high in the
PAD. However, slow progress on national reconciliation poses risks to political stability,
particularly in the run-up to the 2015–2016 presidential and legislative elections.

72.           The project helped improve SMEs’ access to finance, including actions that
reduced Government arrears owed to SMEs. But the SME financing gap remains, with large
numbers of SMEs not getting access to financial services from commercial service providers,
such as banks. Limited access to credit and other financial services remains challenging and is
a major threat to SME and private sector development outcomes, including sector
competitiveness and job creation.

73.             The project also contributed to improve PPD, which provided a platform for
consultation, engagement, and making inputs into decision making that helped improve the
private sector’s confidence and trust in its relationship with the Government. These
developments are crucial for building a productive relationship between the Government and
the private sector now and in the future. With regard to racketeering, a permanent Center of the
Anti-Racket Unit was formally inaugurated in April 2014, but the Government still needs to
provide the necessary logistical support for its effective functioning. Failure to institutionalize
and support this unit risks eroding the gains from project activities that reduced transaction costs
from racketeering.

                                                 18
74.            Urgent actions are also needed to consolidate and institutionalize key project
achievements in areas such as the Commercial Court, the one-stop shop, and the mutual fund.
Failure to do so will erode the project’s gains, and its impact on SME and private sector
development and on society in general. Even though Government authorities signaled strong
intentions to build on the project outcomes, active follow-up will be necessary to ensure that
these intentions are translated into time-bound actions. The absence of a time-bound and
sequenced action plan backed by resources remains a threat to development outcome.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

75.             The World Bank team worked closely with the Government and the private
sector during project preparation to diagnose SME and private constraints, and use the
understanding of those constraints to prepare the project that aimed to support investment
climate reform and improve private sector performance. The Bank brought together a diverse,
knowledgeable team drawn from across the Bank Group that had solid experience in fragile and
post-conflict areas to prepare an operation that facilitated transition from post-crisis recovery to
a more sustainable growth path. The team provided strong leadership and drew from relevant
country and bank strategies, knowledge products, and lessons to provide investment, sound
advice, and TA.

76.          The project was small, but extremely innovative and ambitious in its objectives
and implementing process. A private sector organizations was used for project implementation,
and emphasis was given to collaboration and dialogue between the Government and the private
sector.

77.            Three shortcomings affected the quality of the Bank’s performance at entry.
These are:

      Limited diagnosis of key project management capabilities, including weaknesses in day-
       to-day management, and communication problems between the project and its key
       stakeholders.

      Inadequate attention to stronger private sector representation on the steering committee.

      Weaknesses in M&E arrangements (including staffing) to collect good quality data that
       would facilitate robust assessment of outcomes across all project components. The lack
       of good quality M&E data also made it difficult to undertake robust economic analysis
       to assess the potential impacts at entry.

78.             As previously stated, these shortcomings were addressed during the project life,
justifying the satisfactory Bank performance rating.
                                                 19
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

79.            During project implementation, nine World Bank supervision missions made up
of relevant staff were conducted. These supervisions developed recommendations and time-
bound action plans, and monitored project activities to put the project on track and keep the
focus on achievement of project objectives. Recommendations for improvement and action
plans were systematically reviewed during the subsequent missions. This proactive approach
allowed the Bank team to detect problems at an early stage and initiate corrective actions to
address problems during implementation.

80.            Adjustments made in institutional arrangements, governance, and staffing after
the supervision and review missions were crucial in putting the project on track and to progress
on achievement of the PDO at closing. These changes, including recruitment of a full-time
project manager, reinforcement of private sector perspectives in the steering committee, and
strengthening M&E, improved project implementation and the day-to-day project management,
which resulted in increased disbursements and enhanced performance on project outcomes.

81.             Due to the project characteristics and the implementing environment, the
fiduciary aspect was one of the most important issues that the team addressed during supervision
missions. Despite delays in dealing with some fiduciary aspects, the Bank’s fiduciary team
assessed the fiduciary risk as low.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

82.            Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. This rating is justified because
of excellent supervision by the project team, and the good preparation and quality of
consultation that were fundamental for a solid project design. Aside from the shortcomings in
implementation, governance, and M&E at the early phases of the project, significant progress
was made on achievement of the PDO, and all targets set during preparation were met or
surpassed.




                                                20
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

83.              The Government, particularly the new Government that took office in late 2012,
was a major champion for the project and demonstrated strong commitment to improving the
investment climate and to the overall business reform agenda. Initially there were challenges in
meeting some effectiveness conditions, such as the process for certification of SME debts.
These challenges delayed project effectiveness and launching of activities as scheduled in the
project design. After activities resumed, the project became a centerpiece of the Government’s
post-crisis strategy for private sector–led growth.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

84.              The implementing agency, APEX-CI, had the relevant experience required to
manage a private sector operation, but initially the agency was not adequately equipped with
sufficient staff to successfully manage the project. However, due to weak management and lack
of M&E staff the project implementation was delayed during the first year. In addition there
was weak financial support for the activities of the center in charge of managing the racketeering
subcomponent. This problem was however addressed during the level II restructuring with
allocation of increased funds for racketeering activities.

85.            The mid-term review resulted in improvements in the implementing agency,
including staff reinforcements, and project management improved considerably. From that
point on, the implementing agency managed the project effectively, resulting in increased
disbursement, enhanced fiduciary management (moderately satisfactory rating), and low
assessment for fiduciary risk.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

86.            An enhanced project implementing agency improved project management and
communication among project stakeholders. The assessment noted strong Government
commitment to the reform agenda, but this was marred by delays in fulfilling the effectiveness
conditions. The improved performance of the implementing agency and its effect on efficiently
achieving project objectives justifies the satisfactory rating for overall borrower performance.




                                                21
6. Lessons Learned

87.             Knowledge of the post-crisis environment, sustained donor support, strong
government commitment, and clear strategies for private sector and stakeholder
engagement are the prerequisites for designing effective private sector operations that
support transition from post-crisis recovery to a more sustainable growth path. Aside from
the challenging post-conflict situation, the PARE-PME project achieved all of its PDOs, with
all targets met or surpassed at project closing. Designing the project as a pilot re-engagement
with crucial components to support SME and private sector needs helped pave the way for a
large, more ambitious and integrated operation to improve private sector development.

88.            It is crucial to diagnose implementing agency capabilities up front—staffing,
performance-tracking system, and so on–– even for agencies with prior successful
experience with Bank operations, to avoid potential implementation problems that can
hamper a project’s impact. Strong participation of the private sector in governance
arrangements is essential for enhancing private sector perspectives in project decision making
processes. Even though the project used an existing private sector firm for implementation,
failures to adequately equip the firm with the necessary tools, including staffing in key areas,
and capacity to design and implement a well-thought out engagement strategy and results
measurement system can lead to implementation problems.

89.             Public-private dialogue takes a lot of time and effort to set up, but the
investments in time and money can have significant payoffs because building trust among
the parties is an important part of achieving successful private sector outcomes,
particularly in a post-conflict environment. The platform for PPD provided a good
foundation for setting the private sector agenda, and for building trust and open engagement for
future engagements between the government and the private sector. Such mechanisms take time
to build, but they can be important in post-conflict situations, where trusting relationships are
rare. The CCESP is a good example of a project finding that can be replicated in other countries.

90.             Even limited resources, when strategically engaged, can lead to large,
positive results with high impact when the knowledge base is strong, partnerships are
made to work, and stakeholders stay committed to achieving the project’s objectives.
PARE-PME was a small project, but it achieved big and ambitious outcomes. These successes
derive mainly from strong commitment to a participatory and stakeholder driven approach that
addressed the priority needs of the private sector and SMEs and Government’s desire to unleash
the private sector as a major source of growth.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

91.            The summary of the Borrower’s ICR is in Annex 7. According to the borrower,
the project was successfully implemented with all project objectives satisfactorily achieved at
closing. The most important issue raised by the Government, the implementing agency, and
other stakeholders was that future World Bank and other donor support build on the project’s
findings, ensuring that results and lessons learned are mainstreamed into private sector, SME
development operations and business climate reforms.

92.            On the Government’s side, the main recommendations included a call for
proactive actions to sustain the activities of the Commercial Court, address doing business and
racketeering issues, and continue supporting SME and private sector promotion through strong
partnership with the private sector and other stakeholders.

93.            On the Bank’s side, the main recommendation was a Government request for
large, ambitious, and integrated support building on the project’s achievements. According to
the borrower and private sector, the project had strong commitment from all stakeholders
making it easier to enhance private sector participation in the country’s growth process and
impact on the economy.

                             Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Project Development Objective (PDO) of The Côte d’Ivoire – SME Revitalization and
Governance Project was to help improve the performance of the SME sector in Côte d’Ivoire and
the investment climate that affects it. This would help stimulate economic activity and contribute to
broader private sector–led investment, growth, and employment generation. The overall objective of
the project would be achieved through three mutually reinforcing components, namely, (a)
strengthening SMEs through the provision of financial and non-financial services; (b) improvement
of the business environment through targeted reforms of key government regulations affecting
business and of key institutions; (c) strengthening policymaking for growth and providing support
for project implementation.

The quantitative economic analysis refers only to the matching grant component and not the entire
project. The assessment of impact from the other project components are described in the qualitative
assessment in the relevant sections of the ICR. Noteworthy qualitative impacts include the reduction
is racketeering, the creation of new jobs from SMEs registered in the one stop shop, the reduction of
costs related to business formalities and settlement of disputes.

Methodology

Undertaking a cost-benefit analysis for this project was very challenging. The PAD noted challenges
in conducting economic analysis of private sector development projects due to (i) the lagged effects
of the project and, the difficulty to isolate the direct impact of the different project activities related
to institutional development and business climate reforms on output growth and job creation, and
(ii) the lack of time series which can be used to estimate the relevant coefficients of correlation
required for simulation. In addition to the challenges, the project did not systematically collects
M&E data that is required for a rigorous ex-post cost benefit analysis. Without the data (at least on
number of firms and level of income before and after the matching grant) disaggregated per year, it
was difficult to get a realistic estimate of the ERR. Since these data are not available, the economic
analysis conducted in the ICR, kept the same level of income assumed in the PAD. The economic
analysis in the PAD which also focused on the matching grant also assumed that a minimum of 100
firms/associations would use the matching grant scheme either for consulting services or training,
the average grant was expected to be US$30,000 for individual firms, and the SMEs supported were
expected to create 10 jobs on average per SME.

Notwithstanding the above limitations, the analysis at project end, provides useful insights into the
magnitude of actual economic benefits and costs of the matching grant component. Key data
collected from the M&E system at project closing indicated that:

   (i)     101 firms benefited from the matching grant;
   (ii)    the average grant amount was about US$35,000; and
   (iii)   1598 jobs were created which is equivalent to an average of 15.8 jobs created per SME.
   These actual data are higher than those assumed in the PAD, indicating that the matching grant
   component was, in terms of rate of return (ERR), more successful than what was planned.

                                                  28
Based on the simple projection model used in the PAD, available data from M&E, and keeping
all other assumptions unchanged, the actual NPV and ERR are estimated at US$27 million and
61 percent respectively. These estimated compared to the ex-ante NPV and ERR of US$15
million and 46.4 percent respectively.

Estimated cost compliance savings in four reform areas—starting a business, construction
permits, registering property, and enforcing contracts—are about US$8.8 million as of February
2014, representing a 78 percent savings from 2012. In two areas, starting business and enforcing
contracts, where cost compliance savings from reforms were implemented jointly with the
PARE-PME project, estimated savings improved by 41 percent and 99 percent (respectively)
from the 2012 baseline values. The direct costs of the achieving these cost savings was $3.55
million, representing by the cost of enterprise licensing ($2.35 million) and commercial courts
($1.20 million) sub-components of the investment climate and governance reforms. Using the
estimated benefits, measured by the estimated cost compliance savings, and the direct costs of
the related sub-components, the benefit cost ratio is 2.4. This indicates that the benefits from
cost compliance savings outweigh the costs and that the objective in the investment climate and
governance reform was achieved efficiently

Main Points:
Project Description

    1. The report stated that the project was a post-crisis operation and aimed to contribute to the
       small and medium enterprise’s (SME’s) sector performance improvement, and to the
       investment climate in Côte d’Ivoire. The project planned direct and indirect support (financial
       and nonfinancial) to SMEs and institutional support to public and private sector organizations.

    2. The project was implemented through APEX-CI (Association pour la Promotion des
       Exportations de Côte d’Ivoire), a private organization with high experience in managing such
       operations. This approach facilitated project implementation and contributed to securing the
       commitment of all stakeholders during the project implementation period.

Project Context and Aim of the Evaluation

    3. The report also noted that the project was designed and implemented in a particular and
       difficult context. The project preparation began in 2008 and ended in 2009. The activities had
       to be launched early in 2010, but because of the delay in fulfilling the effectiveness conditions
       and other arrangements that needed to be put in place, the project activities did not begin until
       May 2010. Months later, the project implementation was suspended because of the crisis, and
       resumed in 2011. In 2012 the project activities picked up, and all project activities and
       objectives were achieved from this time to the project closing.

       but with good deliverables.
      The project was original and innovative in its design and how it was implemented. It
       demonstrated what can be achieved through successful partnership between the public and
       private sectors.
      The project was small with regard to the resources it engaged, yet it successfully achieved all
       project objectives.

Recommendations

Take action to perpetuate the results achieved by the project by planning a huge and integrated
operation to promote economic recovery and private sector promotion.

Context, Rationale, and Evolution of SME Revitalization and Governance Project

1.     After two decades of rapid growth that began in the 1980s and lasted until the beginning of
2011, Côte d'Ivoire entered a turbulent period characterized by a succession of economic and
sociopolitical crises. These crises disrupted all key sectors of the economy and increased the
country’s poverty level. The private sector suffered from this situation of instability—particularly
small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which already faced many difficulties. Given the key role of
SMEs in the economy and for sustainable development of this sector, it became urgent to address
some important challenges faced by SMEs. These challenges included lack of funding, management
problems, racketeering, corruption, and liquidity problems aggravated by the accumulation of debts
of SMEs in the state.

2.     As part of the post-crisis recovery strategy of the Ivorian economy, consensus was reached
among the Government, the private sector, and the World Bank to find solutions to these issues
through the Small and Medium Enterprises Revitalization and Governance Project (PARE-PME).

3.      The two main components of the project were to improve the performance of the SME sector
in Côte d’Ivoire, and the investment climate that affects the SME sector. Implementation of the project
would help stimulate economic activity and contribute to broader private sector–led investment,
growth, and employment generation.

4.     PARE-PME is an original project with regard to the objectives and the methods used to
achieve them. It was implemented by a private agency, APEX-CI (Association pour la Promotion des
Exportations de Côte d’Ivoire), which developed an innovative approach to reduce the Government’s
domestic debt owed to SMEs.

5.     Furthermore, the project implementation required the establishment of an institutional anchor,
by which a steering committee was established to take on a supervisory role, exercise
interdepartmental coordination, and provide the overall strategic direction in project management.
The steering committee is composed of members of the public (interministerial) and private sector.

6.       The project has three mutually reinforcing components:

           Strengthening SMEs through the provision of financial and nonfinancial services
           Improving the business environment through targeted reforms of key Government
            regulations affecting business and of key institutions
           Strengthening policymaking for growth and providing support for project implementation.

7.      The project experienced difficulties at its start because of the crisis and coordination. The
recruitment of a dedicated staff and a project manager revived the project and helped to achieve all
planned activities, with some flexibility.
                                                34
Assessment of the project

8.     The outcome of the project is largely positive. As of October 23, 2014, the analysis of the
performance of different subcomponents through the results shows that all objectives were achieved
or exceeded, except for objective regarding the disbursement rate of the FARE/PME (which is about
97.11 percent).

9.     These highly satisfactory results were achieved through the project management system
reforms introduced in 2012, and through the flexibility of the project team, the support of the World
Bank, and the attention paid by the Government to implementing the recommendations.

10.    Component 1, “Direct Support to SMEs,” helped to relieve the cash burden of beneficiaries
caused by debts owed to them by the Government and the difficulty of access to the banking system.
Above all, it helped to strengthen SMEs governance capacity.

11.     FARE/PME achieved two of three goals, specifically, the number of companies financed (101
against a target of 100) and the number of jobs created (1,578 against a target of 1,000). The third
target for the disbursement rate is at a highly satisfactory level of achievement (97.11 percent on
October 23, 2014).

12.     Concerning the mutual fund MCF-PME (Mutuelle de Financement et de Crédit des PME), the
loans of 90 SMEs were repurchased for a total amount of CFAF 1,821,843,258. Also, 61 loans were
granted with an annual growth rate of 14.3 percent on October 30, 2014 (compared with 2013) against
a target of 10 percent. The strategy implemented by the staff of the MCF-PME helped achieve a
satisfactory level of repayment (100 percent). To further support the development of SMEs, the MCF-
PME signed agreements with some institutions, including CNCGA (Collectif National des Centres de
Gestion Agréés) for capacity building, and BICICI (Banque Internationale du Commerce et de
l’Industrie de Côte d’Ivoire) to finance SMES’ investment projects. The strategy implemented by the
management team is expected to make its actions sustainable for its members.

13.     With regard to Component 2, the activities carried out under the project significantly improved
the business environment in Côte d'Ivoire. Reforms supported by the project through the establishment
of the Commercial Court, assistance to CEPICI (Centre de Promotion des Investissements en Côte
d’Ivoire) through the Doing Business Department, and the creation of GUFE (Guichet Unique de
Création des Entreprises), helped the country to be ranked among the top 10 performers in the world,
as noted by the Doing Business (DB) Reports 2014 and 2015. Also, racketeering was reduced with
support given to the Government through the Component 2 subcomponent that established the anti-
racketeering unit ULCR (Unité de lutte contre le racket). All the objectives of the three
subcomponents were met or exceeded.

14.    According to the Abidjan Commercial Court, establishing the Commercial Court reduced the
average number of days to judge a trade dispute from 770 to 38; the evaluation of DB 2015 reports
the average number of days reduced to 525 days. The project’s target was 450 days. Almost all of the
                                              35
decisions rendered by the Court (95.41 percent) are published on its website, against the target of 95
percent. According to the CEPICI, facilitating business creation procedures through the
operationalization of GUFE and simplifying procedures reduced the average number of days to start
a business to two, against the target of eight days. However, the DB 2015 notes an average of seven
days to start a business in Côte d'Ivoire. In total, 7,447 new companies were registered at GUFE
against the target of 1,000, and 25,468 jobs were created against a target of 10,000.

15.    The support for ULCR had a positive effect: the additional transport costs caused by
racketeering declined to CFAF 10.2, against a target of CFAF 15 per metric ton per kilometer.
However, the activities of ULCR were stopped for lack of funding. This may undermine the important
gains made by the project in the fight against racketeering.

16.     Regarding Component 3, “Institutional support and project implementation,” the results are
satisfactory. The two planned strategic studies were conducted (on competitiveness and on the private
sector development strategy), and these reports are available. The project conducted two additional
studies––on industrial statistics and industrial zones––on behalf of the Ministry of Industry and
Mining.

17.     After project coordination encountered difficulties at project start, reforms were introduced
that created the conditions for success. The coordination and management of the project were key
success factors. The results relied on the availability of the members of the steering committee, the
flexibility of the project manager and the manager of subcomponents, and the involvement of other
stakeholders.

Summary of evaluation questions

18.    Relevance. Development priorities reflected in the National Development Plan (NDP 2012–
2015), provides a reference for Côte d’Ivoire’s strategic objectives. The Small and Medium Enterprise
Revitalization and Governance Project PARE-PME (Projet d'Appui a la Revitalisation et a la
Gouvernance des Entreprises) addresses concerns related to the business environment and the
development of the SME sector. The project’s relevance—both overall and in its components and
subcomponents—is shown in the project’s choices to take into account the private sector’s concerns
about the business environment and, in particular, SMEs’ priorities regarding access to finance and
accumulation of credits on the Government.

19.    Consistency. The objectives of the components and subcomponents are consistent with one
another (internal consistency) and are appropriate to the context in which the project was initiated and
executed (external consistency). Furthermore, the implementation strategy and the methods used are
consistent with the project objectives.

20.     Efficiency. The results are highly satisfactory regarding the objectives. This success could be
attributed to the strong, positive involvement of all stakeholders in both actions and management of
resources. The project mobilized high-quality, heavily involved human resources.

                                                36
21.     However, the lack of incentive for members of the steering committee likely affected the
efficiency of actions. Also, the lack of travel equipment dedicated to the Fund for the Revitalization
of SMEs, FARE/PME, made follow-up and evaluation activities difficult. Notably, the travel
equipment requirements for the FARE/PME resulted from the project restructuring and so were not
taken into account during the design phase.

22.    Effectiveness. The project implemented all the planned activities and everything that
contributed to the achievement of the objectives of the various subcomponents. All objectives of the
seven subcomponents were exceeded, except for the objective relating to the disbursement rate of
FARE. Furthermore, the FARE/PME disbursement rate was highly satisfactory. The business
environment continues to improve due to the actions of the Commercial Court, the Doing Business
dedicated team, and the ULCR.

23.    The biggest problem in the area of effectiveness is the lack of financial resources for fuel and
per diems for ULCR agents, which compromises their field monitoring missions.

24.    The beneficiary SMEs either strengthened their governance capacity or relieved their cash
stress—or both—through the purchase of their claims by the project and through loans from the
mutual fund MCF-PME.

25.    Through the project’s support, the Government now has background documents to define its
new private sector development policy. These documents include the study on competitiveness, the
study on industrial statistics, a survey of industrial areas, and the Phoenix Plan of the Ministry of SME
and Commerce.

26.      Note that all of these satisfactory results are linked to the performance of the coordination unit
and the project steering committee, which ran all the planned activities on time. The progress and all
of the results were made possible by the reforms implemented after the project encountered difficulties
at the project start.

27.    Impact. The evaluators note that the project contributed significantly to improving the
business environment in Côte d'Ivoire. According to Doing Business, the country’s ranking improved
such that it was among the top 10 reformers in the world in 2013 and 2014. The project enabled the
SME beneficiaries to adopt good practices in governance and to have a financing instrument. All of
these actions positively influenced the activities of SMEs. Support of the SMEs by FARE/PME
increased their incomes by an average of 43.5 percent. FARE/PME also improved the productivity
and competitiveness of SMEs through their creation of new business partnerships (53.47 percent).

28.    The case studies confirm the positive impact of the project on SMEs’ activities. FARE/PME
beneficiaries adopted good practices in quality control, planning, and management that increased their
sales. Some MCF-PME beneficiaries increased their productive capacity through optimal


                                                  37
management of margins on loans. By reducing the Government’s domestic debt owed to SMEs, MCF-
PME contributed to creating more than 231 new jobs.

29.     The results confirm the positive impacts of the project, even in an environment characterized
by numerous initiatives that make it difficult to isolate and quantify its real contributions. Also, the
original project design did not include baseline studies to enable a rigorous assessment of its impact,
which added to the difficulty of quantifying results.

30.     Sustainability. One determining factor of sustainability in the project was the importance
placed on training the actors throughout implementation. Through its activities to train the various
leaders of the beneficiary institutions, the coordination of PARE-PME intended to give these leaders
the skills necessary to carry out activities without external support. The evaluation found that the
sustainability conditions are met at ULCR, the Commercial Court, Doing Business department, and
beneficiary SMEs (FARE/PME and MCF-PME).

31.    The evaluators noted, however, that training of the beneficiaries alone could not guarantee the
sustainability of benefits without the strong commitment of the Government regarding some activities
funded under its responsibility. These include the ULCR, the Doing Business department at CEPICI,
and the Commercial Court of Abidjan.

32.     Value Added. The Government’s efforts to improve the business environment and to develop
the private sector (and SMEs in particular) are clearly appreciated. In a crisis environment
characterized by a lack of external funding and the inability of Government to pay back its domestic
debts, PARE-PME responded to the concerns of the private sector, particularly those of SMEs. PARE-
PME contributed to finding solutions to the traders’ concerns about the business climate and helped
relieve SMEs of their cash burden caused by the Government’s liquidity problem.


Lessons learned

33.    The private sector’s strong self-advocacy during the dialogue between the World Bank
and the Government of Côte d'Ivoire led to the PARE-PME and to the Bank’s renewal of its
financial support after years of interruption due to the crisis. The Bank’s support renewal was
both complex and ambitious for the context in which it was initiated and the objectives pursued. Many
gains were observed and should be used to advantage in the future.

34.      The project was original in its design and anchor. The project was initiated for the private
sector and funded through a grant from the World Bank to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire. APEX-
CI, a private organization, was charged with coordinating all project activities and was responsible
for all procurement in collaboration with the other ministries. This arrangement enabled freedom of
action for the Government to conduct the project.

35.    Collaboration between the Government and the private sector was one of the key success
factors of the project. This experience should be replicated in other projects with the private sector,
                                                38
and it can be fully replicated by following the procedures of the money provider while taking measures
to correct some of the shortcomings noted by the beneficiaries.

36.     The project management was dynamic. Recruitment of high quality staff dedicated to the
project gave it new life after the difficulties at start-up and helped achieved all the objectives. The
availability, experience, and flexibility of the project manager were crucial to the project’s success.

37.     Beneficiaries were and still remain strongly adhered to the project. Despite their difficult
financial situations, SMEs accepted the highly restrictive conditions of the project—such as half-
shared cost financing and capitalization of MCF-PME with part of the repurchased debt—and they
fully adhered to these conditions to benefit from the project.

38.    The repurchase of Government’s debts to SMEs as proposed by the project was
innovative in clearing domestic debt. This unique experience could be used in the future by
extending it to all companies.
Recommendations

39.     The evaluation identified a series of recommendations at the end of the project’s
implementation period and after discussions with the various stakeholders. These recommendations
are aimed at maintaining and strengthening the support of the World Bank to Côte d’Ivoire’s private
sector through a more ambitious project based on the achievements of PARE-PME.


To the Government

40.    Implement all commitments necessary to maintain and extend the learning from PARE-PME.

       a. For the Commercial Court: Ensure that the operational, maintenance, and security costs of
          the infrastructure are maintained through the purchase of the building, the full
          computerization of the Court, capacity building, and extending the experience to the entire
          territory.
       b. For Doing Business: Ensure the financing of the technical secretariat and the dedicated
          Doing Business team, decentralize the activities of the GUFE to all major towns in the
          country, and support the communication campaign related to the reforms and actions
          undertaken.
       c. For combating racketeering: Provide adequate resources to ULCR, equip the call center,
          and continue sensitization through communication, awareness, and appropriate sanctions
          in proven cases of racketeering.
       d. For institutional support: Ensure wide dissemination and appropriation of the results of
          studies by the Government and the private sector so that they can be used in strategies and
          development policies.



                                                39
41.    To avoid duplicating efforts, capitalize on all the achievements and the expertise of the
coordination unit to achieve the same kinds of results in future projects.

42.    Negotiate another project with the World Bank that is more ambitious in volume of financial
support and scope of intervention.


To the World Bank

43.   Establish interim funding to enable completion of activities that were not completed at the end
of PARE-PME, and to maintain support for the business environment component (Commercial Court
and Doing Business) and the MCF-PME subcomponent to finance SMEs.

44.    Initiate a large-scale, integrated operation to develop the private sector, and SMEs in particular,
by increasing the amount of support and expanding the cost-shared financing experience to large
companies. Also, extend to large companies the experience of the redemption of Government debts
owed to SMEs.

45.    Integrate into new operations the constraints identified by SMEs, including modulation
according to the priority sectors of the requirement to SMEs for their participation in cost-shared
funding, and modulation of upper funding limits across sectors.

46.      Define support for MCF-PME to make it a real link between banks and SMEs that will increase
SMEs’ access to funding, and for establishing confidence between SMEs and large enterprises to
facilitate sub-outsourcing to the SMEs.

47.     At the project design stage, define and implement a monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
framework to facilitate rigorous impact evaluation. This framework should be based on baseline
studies and the project’s operational rules defined at the project design stage. Project designers should
also ensure that the impact indicators or development objectives differ from the indicators for output
and outcome of the project.

48.     From its beginning, the project should integrate M&E in the coordination unit to facilitate the
monitoring and reporting of activities, and to have information by which to measure the impact at the
end of the project.

To APEX-CI
