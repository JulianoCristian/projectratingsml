                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The SME Revitalization and Governance project became effective in May 2010, but its implementation virtually came to a halt between December-June 2011, as a result of the post-
                         electoral conflict in Cote d'Ivoire. After resumption of project activities in June 2011, overall implementation of the project remained limited for several months (it was only as of
                         September 2011 that all the components were mobilized and disbursement conditions met.) Given the slow mobilization, the PARE-PME was rated by the WB as MU and as a
                         problem project in the region's portfolio---thereby requiring close supervision and proactive measures. On this basis, a detailed action plan was agreed with the authorities in
                         September 2011 (and updated in subsequent missions in February and June 2012) to serve as a roadmap for the PIU and stakeholders to help realize targeted activities and make

                         confirm the positive evolution of project implementation, as well as the visible impact of this operation. Further to Government request, the project was extend by 9 months (to end
                         October 2014) so as to enable to completion and consolidation of project activities.

                         The project is now broadly recognized for its substantive impact on strengthening the business environment and the SME sector in Cote d' Ivoire. The contribution of the project is
                         particularly noted with regard to:
                         1) The creation of the Commercial Court of Abidjan: this is recognized as a major reform and continues to be a very effective and transparent instrument.
                         2) The MCF-PME (mutuelle de credit): now fully capitalized and building up its operations and capacity.
                         3) The One-stop shop for business formalities (CFE): which helped register 4158 new businesses, with the potential of creating 42000 jobs.
                         4) The 2014 Doing Business report. It is noteworthy that Cote d' Ivoire was recognized as a top 10 global reformer in the DB2014 report, for the first time registering a significant
                         improvement (10 places) in DB rankings
                         5) The articulation of private sector development policy. The project also provides an important contribution to the development of key strategic policy initiatives (SME development
                         strategy, Financial sector development strategy, Industrial policy) which have been validated by stakeholders or are at advanced stage of preparation. These policy initiatives are
                         expected to define the contours of a next phase of engagement on private sector development in Cote d' Ivoire.

                         Project management is rated satisfactory, and the project is on target with regard to the attainment of KPIs and activities. For example, the One-stop shop has registered 4158 firms,
                         accounting for potentially 42000 jobs. The time required to start a firm has declined to less than 48h at the Guichet Unique and a total of 5 days including other procedures. The
                         Commercial court published over 95% of its decisions and according to DB14 report this reform decreased the number of days to settle a commercial dispute from 770 to 585 days
                         (around 10-45 days required to take a first-level decision according to the Commercial Court statistics, but including all other processes such as appeal and enforcement, etc. the
                         number of days raises to 585). Project disbursements are over 80%, with firm commitments of over 90%. The project is well on its way to disburse 100% by October 2014. However,
                         the mission downgraded FM rating from S to MS and recommended a detailed action plan to address FM shortcomings (as the project will close in 5 months the mission deems
                         important to implement recommended actions as soon as possible). Closing arrangements were also discussed and ICR preparation started.
