                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The SME Revitalization and Governance project became effective in May 2010, but its implementation virtually came to a halt between December-June 2011, as a result of the post-
                         electoral conflict in Cote d'Ivoire. After resumption of project activities in June 2011, overall implementation of the project remained limited for several months (it was only as of
                         September 2011 that all the components were mobilized and disbursement conditions met.) Given the slow mobilization, the PARE-PME was rated by the WB as MU and as a
                         problem project in the region's portfolio---thereby requiring close supervision and proactive measures. On this basis, a detailed action plan was agreed with the authorities in
                         September 2011 (and updated in subsequent missions in February and June 2012) to serve as a roadmap for the PIU and stakeholders to help realize targeted activities and make

                         evolution of project implementation, as well as the visible impact of this operation.

                         The project is now broadly recognized for its substantive impact on strengthening the business environment and the SME sector in Cote d' Ivoire. The contribution of the project is
                         particularly noted with regard to:
                         1) The creation of the Commercial Court of Abidjan: this is recognized as a major reform and continues to be a very effective and transparent instrument.
                         2) The MCF-PME (mutuelle de credit): now fully capitalized and building up its operations and capacity.
                         3) The One-stop shop for business formalities (CFE): which helped register 2200 new businesses in 2013, with the potential of creating 20000 jobs.
                         4) The 2014 Doing Business report. It is noteworthy that Cote d' Ivoire was recognized as a top 10 global reformer in the DB2014 report, for the first time registering a significant
                         improvement (10 places) in DB rankings
                         5) The articulation of private sector development policy. The project also provides an important contribution to the development of key strategic policy initiatives (SME development
                         strategy, Financial sector development strategy, Industrial policy) which have been validated by stakeholders or are at advanced stage of preparation. These policy initiatives are
                         expected to define the contours of a next phase of engagement on private sector development in Cote d' Ivoire.

                         Project management and fiduciary arrangements are rated satisfactory, and the project is on target with regard to the attainment of KPIs and activities. For example, the One-stop
                         shop has registered over 2200 firms, accounting for potentially 20000 jobs. The time required to start a firm has declined to less than 48h at the Guichet Unit and a total of 5 days
                         including other procedures. The Commercial court published over 95% of its decisions and takes decisions in 10-45 days. Project disbursements are close to 75%, with firm
                         commitments of over 90%. During FY14, the project already disbursed $1.5m, and plans to disburse an additional $3m by June 2014 (reaching a disbursement level of 95%).
