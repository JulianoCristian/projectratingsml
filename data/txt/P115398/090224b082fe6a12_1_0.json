Some lessons learned included:\n            knowledge of the post-crisis environment, sustained donor\n            support, strong government commitment, and clear strategies\n            for private sector and stakeholder engagement are the\n            prerequisites for designing effective private sector\n            operations that support transition from post-crisis recovery\n            to a more sustainable growth path. It is crucial to diagnose\n            implementing agency capabilities up front, staffing,\n            performance-tracking system, and so on, even for agencies\n            with prior successful experience with Bank operations, to\n            avoid potential implementation problems that can hamper a\n            project\u2019s impact. Public-private dialogue takes a lot of\n            time and effort to set up, but the investments in time and\n            money can have significant payoffs because building trust\n            among the parties is an important part of achieving\n            successful private sector outcomes, particularly in a\n            post-conflict environment. Even limited resources, when\n            strategically engaged, can lead to large, positive results\n            with high impact when the knowledge base is strong,\n            partnerships are made to work, and stakeholders stay\n            committed to achieving the project\u2019s objectives."}, "docdt": "2015-06-30T04:23:03Z"}
