        Cote d'Ivoire - SME Revitalization and Governance Project (P115398)



 The USD15m IDA SME Revitalization and Governance project was approved by the Board in October 2009 and became effective in May 2010. The
 operation was designed as a "pilot" re-engagement instrument to support investment climate reform and boost private sector performance following the
 prolonged crisis in Cote d'Ivoire. Project components reflect priorities (such as: providing direct financial and technical support to SMEs, and tackling
 constraints related to justice, corruption, costly administrative processes for businesses) identified through joint consultations with public and private
 sector stakeholders. The project's governance and institutional arrangements (including contracting with APEX-CI as PIU, and ensuring private sector
 representation on steering committee and other project's bodies) reflect the objective of ensuring private sector leadership in project coordination.

 The first year of operation (2010-2011) was particularly challenging. Project mobilization was slow just ahead of the October 2010 election (with limited
 progress essentially registered only in the launch of the matching grant component and the dialogue on doing business reform), and activities actually
 came to a halt between December-June 2011, as a result of the post-electoral conflict and ensuing military crisis in Cote d'Ivoire. Given the slow
 mobilization and little progress across components, the PARE-PME was rated by the WB as MU and as a problem project in the region's portfolio---
 thereby requiring close supervision and proactive measures. Project activities restarted in June 2011, following formal resumption of WB operations in
 Cote d'Ivoire.

 The second year of the operation (2011-2012) was one of transition. The team re-engaged with project stakeholders, ensuring the relevance of the
 project and its structure, and making sure that the conditions for its effective implementation were present in the post-crisis context.
 In September 2011 all the components were mobilized and disbursement conditions met. A detailed action plan was agreed with the authorities (and
 updated in subsequent missions in February and June 2012) to serve as a roadmap for the PIU and stakeholders to help mobilize targeted activities and
 make progress toward the project's development objective. Project governance was revamped by strengthening the PIU and Steering Committee and
 the project became a center-piece of the Government's post-crisis strategy in support of private sector-led growth.

 The third and fourth year (2012-2013 and 2013-2014) saw a dramatic turn-around in project implementation and impact. Project performance turned
 around during the course of 2012-2013, and the project rating was upgraded to MS in December 2012 and S in June 2013.Further to Government
 request, the project was extend by 9 months (to end October 2014) so as to enable to completion and consolidation of project activities.

 This ISR traces project implementation status between May 2014 and project closing as of October 2014. The supervision missions undertaken in FY14
 (September and November 2013, and April 2014) and FY15 (July 2014 and October 2014) confirm the positive evolution of project implementation, as
 well as the visible impact of this operation. At time of project closing (October 2014) this operation is now broadly recognized for its substantive impact
 on strengthening the business environment (Cote d'Ivoire has been ranked top 10 Global Reformer by the Doing Business reports in two consecutive
 years 2014 and 2015) and the SME sector in Cote d' Ivoire, and contributing to the definition of key sector development strategies.

 The contribution of the project is particularly noted with regard to:
 1) Technical support provided to SMEs. The project supported the implementation of a capacity building program through a matching grant (FARE
 PME) which accompanied 101 SMEs, leading to the creation of over 1500 jobs.

 2) Financial support provided to SMEs. The project helped clear Government arrears to SMEs through the capitalization of the MCF PME (mutuelle de
 financement et de credit des PME). The MCF PME has steadily increased its operations since its launch in 2012.

 3) Strengthening the investment climate. Cote d'Ivoire accomplished remarkable strides on a number of critical areas related to the investment climate,
 with support of the project -- and has been recognized as Top Global Reformer for the second year in a row by the Doing Business Report (with an
 increa se in ranking from 177 to 147). Reforms supported by the project include:
 (a) the creation of the Commercial Court of Abidjan (this is recognized as a major reform and continues to be a very effective and transparent
 instrument);
 (b) the establishment of a One-stop shop for business formalities within CEPICI (with a dramatic reduction in required time and cost, and nearly 8000
 firms created for an estimated 25K jobs);
 (c) the establishment of a Doing Business Reform Unit supporting the works of the Interministerial reform Committees;
 (d) the redynamization of the Public Private Dialogue Platform, the CCESP;
 (e) the support to the anti-racketeering campaign and training (leading to a reduction of the incidence of roadside rackets since project start);
 (f) the articulation of key strategic policy initiatives (SME development strategy, Competitiveness, Financial sector development strategy, Industrial
 policy) which have been validated by Government and stakeholders. These policy initiatives are expected to define the contours of a next phase of
 engagement on private sector development in Cote d' Ivoire.

 The project is on target with regard to the attainment of the DPO related to helping improve the performance of the SMEs sector and the investment
 climate that affects it, as measured by KPIs. For example, the One-stop shop has registered over 7500 firms (as opposed to a target of 1000),
 accounting so far for an estimate 25000 jobs and potentially 30-40K (as opposed to a target of 10K). The time required to start a firm has declined to
 less than 48h at the Guichet Unique and a total of 7 days including other procedures (as opposed to a target of 8 days). The Commercial court
 published over 95% of its decisions and according to DB15 report this reform decreased the number of days to settle a commercial dispute from 770 to
 525 days (around 10-45 days required to take a first-level decision according to the Commercial Court statistics, but including all other processes such
 as appeal and enforcement, etc. the number of days raises to 525). The cost of racketeering has declined to 10.2 FCFA (surpassing the target of 15

 Project management is rated satisfactory -- project disbursements are over 93% with nearly 100% of resources to be disbursed during the grace period
 (until end February 2015). Fiduciary reviews by FM and PS confirmed the positive performance of the project. The ICR preparation started, in
 collaboration with project stakeholders.
 The supervision missions undertaken in FY14 and FY15 confirm the positive evolution of project implementation, as well as the visible impact of this
 operation. As of OCtober 31, 2014 project activities have been completed and final disbursements are being processed. The final audit and evaluation
 report will be prepared by February 2015.

 Business registration at the newly launched CFE (one stop shop) have progressed rapidly. Project target of 1000 is largely
 surpassed with around 7500 firms already registered by October 2014 as opposed to 2200 as of November 2013. Similarly,
 25K jobs are already estimated to have been created so far, with the potential of reaching 40-50K, well beyond the the 10K target.

               Comments
               Based on the ENSEA study completed in 2012-2014, racketeering cost was reassessed and reduced from 21.8
               FCFA/metric ton / km in 2008 to 12,64FCFA/metric ton/km in 2012 and 10.2 FCFA in 2014. The overall decrease in
               racketeering costs registered between 2010-2014 is therefore 50%, surpassing the 25% reduction target.

               The One-Stop-Shop for Business Formalities was inaugurated in December 2012. According to the DB2014 report, the
               number of days required to register a business in Cote d’ Ivoire has decreased from 32 to 5 days. Within the 5 days,
               the One-Stop-Shop processes its formalities in about 48-24h. The remaining time is due to other requirements
               (publication in newspaper, deposit of minimum capital inaBank, notary formalities), which bring the total to 5 days. The
               DB15 shows that time to register a firm at the One stop shop was further decreased to 3 days, and procedures in total
               equal to 7 days.



 Overall Comments
 The implementation of Component 1 was completely executed and is leading to concrete impact.
 ---With regard to the FARE matching grant, 101 beneficiaries have been involved in the program (as opposed to a target of 100), with an increase
 in disbursement from 50% to around 80% since the last supervision mission. In parallel, the job creation target has already been achieved (1391
 jobs).
 ---With regard to the MCF-PME, the capitalization has been fully achieved (the fund now counts 163 members), and credit activities are
 increasing steadily (with a stunning 100% recovery rate).
