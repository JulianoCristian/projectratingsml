     management, financing, and delivery of agricultural services\n            in Zimbabwe. There are two components. The first,\n            Rationalization and  Effectiveness of Agricultural Services\n            and Policymaking, 1) supports the preparation and initial\n            implementation of sub-sectoral strategic plans by the\n            Ministry of Lands and Agriculture (MoLA) for agricultural\n            research, extension, and veterinary services; 2) facilitates\n            the planning, implementation, and evaluation of pilot\n            efforts to commercialize, out-source, or privatize selected\n            public agricultural services; 3) finances competitive and\n            collaborative research and advisory services that support\n            smallholder agriculture; 4) provides equipment to improve\n            effectiveness and client-responsiveness; and 5) finances\n            analysis and consensus-building on outstanding and emerging\n            policy issues. The second component, Efficient Resource\n            Management, improves MoLA's management of human\n            resources through training and reallocating and/or\n            retrenching selected staff; designs and implements improved\n            financial and accounting systems and practices and\n            decentralizes them; strengthens the use of information\n            technology; and improves the quality of MoLA's\n            institutional reform process."}, "docdt": "1998-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
