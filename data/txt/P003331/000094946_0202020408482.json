Several\n            lessons are therefore drawn from the project. Institutional\n            reform entails not only, strong commitment from every level\n            of Government, but a constant reinforcement of how its\n            process will impact cultural change. Such procedural change\n            needs to be recognized as of the early stages in the project\n            design, and should as well include a clear management\n            structure, i.e., responsibilities, and accountability need\n            to be assigned at the design stage for project\n            implementation, coordination, and supervision.\n            Unfortunately, the framework prepared during project design\n            was too complex to overcome, and particularly difficult for\n            monitoring purposes. Further damaging factors, were the\n            economic downturn, and governance crisis which emerged at\n            the time of project approval. Nonetheless, the decision to\n            proceed with the project was correctly taken in spite of the\n            transpired unsatisfactory status of the project, an\n            appropriately taken risk to hopefully maintain the reform\n            process in the agricultural sector."}, "docdt": "2002-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
