Response\n            Development Policy Grant Project for Guinea were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: there were\n            advantages gained from keeping the design of the operation\n            simple and well focused on the Government priorities, e.g.,\n            customs duties reduction on rice and facilitation of\n            agricultural goods trade with well identified outcome\n            indicators. This helped ensure adequate Government's\n            response to the crisis given its limited capacities.\n            However, the longer-term sustainability of the\n            Government's food price crisis program and overall\n            economic reform efforts was weakened by the military coup of\n            late 2008, which undermine the ability of the Government to\n            address future food price shocks effectively. While the risk\n            of a worsening social and political instability was\n            identified given the country's fragile situation, the\n            death of President Conte precipitated a military coup which\n            in turn triggered the subsequent application of the\n            Bank's operational policy on dealing with de facto\n            governments. Given the (anticipated and unanticipated) risks\n            to this operation in the country's fragile context,\n            close coordination with other development partners has been\n            indispensable to mitigate risks, realize synergies, and\n            improve the leverage in the policy dialogue. Collaboration\n            with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also been\n            important. It can be challenging to ensure the establishment\n            of an effective monitoring and evaluation system in the\n            context of a crisis response operation. In the context of\n            Guinea, the Government monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            system worked reasonably well during the crisis but its\n            efforts weakened after the emergency period."}, "docdt": "2010-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
