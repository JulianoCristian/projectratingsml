PA;RT I - HISTORICAL
2.      In 1965, with the assistance of UNESCOS the Governmeint of Nicaragua
identified and prepared an education project consisting of the expansion of
secondary education, The project Twas submitted to the Bank and it was

PART III - THE PROJECT
7.      A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project in Nicaragua"
(TO-609) is attached hereto.
8,,     Ninety percent of Nicaraguan labor force has not even completed
primary school and only 0h percent attended university. Lack of qualified
manpower at intermediate level severely hinders development in all sectors
of the economy, The shortage of manpower is largely due to the lack of
sufficient educational facilities, to tie poor quaLity of education impar-
ted by the existing schools and the imbalance of specializations offered
by such schools in relation to the specializations needed on the labor
market. Secondary education is especially inadequate: existing school
facilities are overcrowded, curricula are obsolete and teaching is poor -
as very few secondary school teachers are academically qualified, Secon-
dary schools have a high proportion of dropouts and repeats and each
grade includes pupils of a too wide age range to make learnirng effective.
9,      The proposed project is designed to deal with these deficiencies
in The secondary schools in Managua as well as in the most importa:at
towns of Nicaragua. The project would provide 11,540 student places,
of which 8,100 are in addition to the existing ones and 3,440 are in re-
placement of existing unsuitable schools. Enrollment in individual sub-
jects will reflect the demand for skills of different kinds.
10.     A portion of the project concerns the training of teachers for
primary schools; 1,505 new places would be provided by the project, and
would make it possible to extend the teacher training course to three
years and substantially improve the curriculum0   Provisicr. for training
secondary school teachers is not included in the project since the action
already taken by the Schools of Education of the National and Central
American Universities ensures the availability of qualified teachers in
sufficient numbers.
11.     The execution of the project to simple standards would be en-
trusted to a special project unit, within the Mlinistry of Education.
Its completion should take four years.



120      Physically, the project consists of construction and equipment of
various schools, some of them completely new and same of them to be just
re-equipped. Specifically, the project includes (a) construction and
equipment of two new primary teacher training schools and the extension
of a third, (b) construction and equipment of nine new general secondary
schools, (c) the extension and equipment of seven other general aecondcu'y
schools, and (d) equipment only of two secondary schools. The proposed
schools will be in all the main population centers,
130      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$8.0 million,
with the major portion, 68 percent, of the total going for construction
costs. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$2.7 million9
The Bank will finance one half of the cost of the project and the Govern-
ment of Nicaragua will finance the other half and provide the necessary
funds for the operation of the schools.
14.      Procurement of goods and services for the project will be made
on the basis of international competitive bidding both for building con-
tracts and purchases of equipment. Disbursement would be made for the
full cost of imported equipment, and for about 25 percent of the cost
of the remainder of the project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
15.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua and
the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Secticn 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
16.      The establishment of the special project unit referred to in
paragraph 11 above and approval of the loan by the Congress of Nicaragua
are conditions of effectiveness.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
17.      The last economic report dealing with Nicaragua WH-170-a. dated
June 5, 1967 observed that during the period 1960 - 1965 the economy of
Nicaragua grew rapidly, GDP increasing by nearly 8 percent per year or 5
percent per capita, in real terms. Most of the increase was attributable
to growth in agricultural production for export, mainly cotton. The
favorable export performance permitted a considerable build-up of the bank-
ing systemts gross international reserves, which increased from US$12.7
million at the end of 1960 to $62.6 million at the end of 1965.
18.      The consequent expansion of the tax base, moreover, coupled with
improvements in tax collection and administration, resulted in substantial



surpluses in the budget of the Central Govermnent2 which was able to ac-
cur,mlate cash balances of over US$10 million at the Central Bank.
190     Things have changed somewhat during the past two years. Unfa-
vorable weather conditions and lower export prices combined to bring
about a reversal of this trend in 1966, and the deterioration continued
during 1967. GDP growth was 3.6 percent in 19.66 and slightly over 4 per-
cent in 1967. In 1966 export earnings declined by 5 percent; this, ac-
companied by a 13 percent i.ncrease in imports, resulted in a negative
trade bal.ance for the first time in nearly a decade. During 1967 ex-
ports grew by less than 2 perceznt while imports increasedb; over 8 per-
cent, aggravating the trade balance deficit. Capital movements, par-
ticularly direct foreign investment and drawings on external loans cush-
ioned the impact of these deficits but were insufficient to offset them
entirely. As a consequence, Nicaraguals gross international reserves
declined by an estimated $27.3 rillion during 1966 and 1967.
20.     Nicaraguats trade with the rest of Central America, which has
expanded rapidly s4.nce the Cormon Market was established in 1961, has
contr:?.     to this recent deterioration in external finances. The
growth of imports (from US$2.9 million in 1961 to $35.8 million in 1967)
far outpaced the growth cf exports ($1.8 and $l7.6 million respectively)
during each of these years.  Imports from Central America constitute at
present 18.4 percent of Micaraguals total imports; exports to Central
America, 12.2 percent of total exports. A number of projects now under
way are designed to increase substantially exports to Central America in
1968 and beyond, particularly insecticides, rice, textiles and metal and
miJil products.
21.     During 1966 and 1967 the fiscal situation suffered a deterior-
ation similar to that encountered in the balance of payments. Current
revenues grew by only 6,h percent in 1.966 and 5.6 percent in 1967, whlile
current expenditures increased by 12.8 percent and 25.3 percent respec-
tively. Current account surplus declined correspondingly, and the re-
sulting investment financing gap was met by larger utilization of external
loans and by the use of previously accunmulated Government deposits, which,
by the end of 1967, had been almost entirely depleted0 The substantial
inc;eases in current expenditures in 1966 and 1967 were primarily due   o
higher salaries and increased number of public school teachers, both steps
to ensure the success of the program cf investment in education which is
now getting under way.
22.     Public investment during the period 1961 - 1965 was heavily or-
iented toward infrastructure development, particularly transportation
and power.  Beginning in 1966 agricultural investment has been receiving
increasing attention. Present plans call for a more balanced development
effort in the future0 The Government is also taking a number of steps to
improve the project preparation and execution process and establish a
clearer division of responsibilities for project execution in order to
accelerate its development effort.



23.     In transportation the Central Go-;ermment will continue to pre-
pare and supervise projects, particularly roads, but construction work
will increasingly be executed by private contractors. External financing
for these projects is being provided by USAID, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration.
Investment in education, thus far comparatively neglected, is to receive
a major push during the coming years. External financln- for elementary
and university training has been arranged withi;S,,3-- and D1DB respectivrely;
IBRD financing for secondary education projects constitutes the object
of the present loan. External financing is also being sought for expanded
invesqtznt in agriculture and industry.
24.     The deterioration in the international reserve position led the
Nicaraguan authorities, for the first ti-me since 1964, to request in
December 1967 a stand-by agreement for US$19 million) wbich is ilow being
considered by the Internabioaral Monetary Fund0  As part of the proposed
agreement, Nicaraguan authulrJties have announced their intention to
adopt a series of measures designed to curb Whe grourth of jmports, with-
out resorting to direct control.s or exchange restricti.ons.  Basically,
the steps to be tal.;ii consist ia limits on domsstic credit and short-term
external borrowing, as well as determined efforts to reduce Central
Government's administrative expenditures and improve fiscal administra-
tion so as to increase the yield of existing taxes.
25.     A far-reaching program of export diversification was initiated
in Nicaragua in mid-1966. i. number of projects are oriented to the
Central American market; othiers, such as banianas, coffee, seafood and
wood products, to the rest of the world. As these projects begin to
bear fruit in 1968 and 1969, Nicaragua's export earnings are expected to
improve fairly soon. Nicaraguats overall external finances should improve
in step with the new financial policies now being initiated.
26.     During 1966 and 1967 substantial amounts of short and medium
term external loans were contracted by the Nicaraguan Goverment and
autonomous agencies. As a consequence, service payments on the external
debt rose considerably and, given the stagnation of export earnings, the
debt service ratio increased as well. The ratio stood at 4h8 percent in
1965 and rose to about 9.5 percent in 1967. Present plans contemplate
increased utilization of external loans by the Government and autonomous
agencies during the coming years; the new funds, however, will be mostly
forthcoming from long term loans, and service payments on them should not
increase appreciably the debt ratio in the foreseeable future, assuming
even a moderate degree of success in the export diver-sification program.
27.     To sUm up, Nicaragua is beginning to confront in an orderly manner
the new problems which have,emerged in the past two years.  Close attention
will have to be given during this adjustment to the adequacy of public
sector savings needed for greater development, to ensure the continuation
of Nicaragua's good performance of past years,
