To this end, the project\n            consists of (a) provision and installation of two oil-fueled\n            steam thermal generating units of between 45 MW and 60 MW\n            each, at the existing Khartoum North power plant; (b)\n            technical assistance, training and equipment and materials\n            for NEC's organizational and staff development; and (c)\n            provision of consulting services for an Environmental Study.\n            Lastly, the project also provides (d) technical assistance\n            for the National Energy Administration (NEA) for energy\n            planning, studies and for institutional development.\n            Implementation of the proposed project would relieve a heavy\n            constraint on production increases in agriculture and\n            manufacturing in the early 90's."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
