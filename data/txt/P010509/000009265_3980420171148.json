A second set of project\n            objectives are to streamline trade and transit procedures\n            and to improve the efficiency and organization of transit\n            trade documentation and data exchange. There are nine\n            components: (1) The construction of an inland container\n            depot (ICD) at Sirsiya (Birgunj) comprises civil works for a\n            modern multimodal transfer terminal and actions related to\n            implementing the ACRP (Acquisition, Compensation, and\n            Rehabilitation Plan). (2) The next component improves the\n            road ICD at Biratnagar. (3) The civil works required to\n            improve the road-only facility at Bhairahwa include site\n            preparation, earth work, warehouse construction,\n            administrative buildings, and electrical systems. (4)\n            Procurement of equipment for three ICDs. (5) Internationally\n            experienced consultants to supervise the construction and\n            improvement of the three ICDs. (6) Technical assistance and\n            training to reduce transport and Trade costs will simplify\n            documents and procedures; modernize carrier's\n            liability, insurance provisions, and customs policies and\n            procedures; strengthen freight forwarding and customs\n            clearing; and update foreign-currency trade regulations. (7)\n            Installation of the Automated Systems for Customs Data. (8)\n            Installation of the Advanced Cargo Information System.
