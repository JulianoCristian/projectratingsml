4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: Project implementation is expected to be completed by mid/end of the year 2000. The implementation period
for the civil works components of the project is estimated to be three years. Prequalification of bidders for the civil works has been
completed, which will enable award of the civil works contracts shortly after Credit Effectiveness. The institution building components
of the project (trade facilitation, ASYCUDA and ACIS) should be fully implemented within the first three years of the project.
Executing agencies: The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) will be fully responsible for project implementation and there will be an inter-
ministerial Project Steering Committee (PSC) for coordination purposes. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been established
within the MOC and will be staffed with staff with the necessary skills and qualifications to implement all of the project components.
The PIU will be fully responsible for procurement and implementation of all physical components of the project as well as for the
implementation of the trade facilitation components of the project; customs will be responsible for the detailed implementation of
ASYCUDA.
As part of its bilateral assistance to HMG/N, the Government of India (GOI) plans, in parallel with the project, to fund the construction of a
5 km rail spur to link the current rail terminus at Raxaul with the Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD. The construction of the rail spur is planned to be
completed by the end of 1999 which is well before the projected completion date of the ICD. The civil works cost for the Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD
do not include the cost of land, but include expenditures related to implementation of ACRP for which retroactive funancing of up to US$
100 thousand has been agreed for expenditures after August 1, 1997.

Project oversight: The MOC through the PIU will oversee the implementation of all project components. The PSC, which has been
responsible for project preparation, has been reconstituted under the chairmanship of the Secretary of Commerce to provide project
coordination for the PIU. The PSC would continue to be made up of representatives from National Planning Commission, Ministry of
Finance (MOF), MOC and etc.. The PSC, with the support of IDA, has already prepared the Borrower Project Implementation Plan
(BPIP), which was agreed during credit negotiations. This should ensure smooth project implementation and enhanced construction
quality. The consultants who prepared the feasibility study and detailed facilities design will be in charge of supervising the civil works
components of the project.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Overall project monitoring and evaluation will be the responsibility of the PIU. The PIU will
prepare and submit to IDA quarterly progress reports.
Accounting. financial reporting and auditing arrangements: According to the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1990, the Auditor
General is deemed to be the sole authority to audit HMG/N implemented projects. The Office of the Auditor General will conduct
audits of the project accounts at MOC to ensure their regularity, economy, efficiency, effectiveness and propriety, as provided by the
law. The Project Director shall prepare all financial statements and will confirm the accuracy of all financial statements concerning all
project financial statements. The project will submit the unaudited financial report within 6 months after the end of the Nepalese fiscal
year and the audited report within 9 months. These arrangements have been confirmed during Credit negotiations.
Since the project is being implemented by government entities (MOC through the PIU), HMG/N's standard financial management
system will be used to monitor financial performance. This system provides timely financial information and allows early waming of
problems affecting project implementation. Financial records as required by HMG/N's system are reliable and complete. The project
will be required to maintain the books of accounts as prescribed by the govemment. In addition, it will maintain a subsidiary loan
register and records which will provide information on the loan status. Internal audits will be arranged through Financial Controller
General's Office (FCGO) every month to ensure effective internal control.
A cash based accounting system will be used for project accounting. The accounting system will be fully integrated with all other
financial management systems (budget, treasury and debt management). MOC through the PIU will prepare and submit annual
budget requests to MOF. During credit negotiations it was agreed that the accounts officer assigned to the project should have prior
experience in handling either IDA or ADB projects and should be knowledgeable with IDA disbursement procedures. HMG/N has
already assigned to the PIU one experienced accounts officer and two accountants to handle the accounts of the project.
Finally, the project management team will have the ability to process and maintain both SOE and Special Account documentation to
IDA's standards. IDA will arrange to have an annual review of SOE accounts. The Special Accounts will be managed by the Project
Manager within the PIU. The Project Director will be responsible to handle and operate the special accounts. HMG/N will designate
one signatory from MOC to withdraw funds from the IDA Credit.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:   Document number and date of latest CAS: Report No.: 15508 NEP, April 30, 1996
(i) to improve Nepal's basic transport infrastructure; (ii) to facilitate the improvement of the trade and customs regime under which
Nepal's international trade transits through India and across its own borders; and (iii) promote private sector participation and
investment in economy. The project is fully consistent with the Nepal CAS discussed by the Board on June 6, 1996, and with the
Nepal CAS progress report that will be discussed concurrently with this project on November 25, 1997.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy: The country's poor capital stock especially in the area of transport infrastructure is
recognized as one of the major constraints for Nepal to achieve a high and sustainable rate of economic growth. Poor transport
infrastructure increases transaction costs for the price sensitive tradable sector of the Nepalese economy, making it less competitive in
the world market, and hence depressing the countries growth potential. Poor transport infrastructure and cumbersome customs
procedures have resulted in most import/export trade being transported by road in break bulk (loose boxes) from/to the port of Calcutta
to/from the border where they are customs cleared before being forwarded to their final destination in Nepal. The current system not
only results in high direct transport costs, but also in substantial losses from damage and theft. In its development strategy, HMG/N
has recognized this constraint to growth. It is in the process of re-prioritizing its budgetary resources (complemented with external
assistance) to reduce major infrastructural bottlenecks, particularly in the transport sub-sector. And plans to promote private sector
participation and investment to boost infrastructure capacity and efficiency. A second constraint to economic growth is the restrictive
provisions of certain protocols of the Trade and Transit Treaty with India of 1991. HMG/N is working toward improving these provisions
and should be able, as part of the project, to realize significant gains in trade and transit facilitation through technical assistance and
improved procedures.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices: The project will address the main sector issue of costly land
transport for its foreign trade via India and the lack of physical facilities and efficient trade facilitation arrangements for Nepal's foreign
trade. Achieving these objectives will require the implementation of multifaceted institutional reforms (see next para.):

Country: Nepal                                                         Project Title: Multi-Modal Transit and Trade Facilitation
*   Infrastructure: The initial investments in ICD infrastructure will be funded by HMG/N. The private sector will operate and manage
the three ICDs under long term leasehold agreements awarded in a competitive fashion. The construction of these facilities will
permit a shift in the current break bulk traffic moving by road toward containerized rail freight movements to Sirsiya (Birgunj) and
containerized road traffic movements to Biratnagar and Bhairahwa.
*   Institutional Development: On the institutional side the private sector will work in partnership with the public sector to improve
transit and trade practices. This partnership will take the institutional form of the recently established Nepal Trade and Transport
Facilitation Committee (NTTFC). The NTTFC is advising HMG/N on how to accelerate and carry through essential reforms
outlined in the Trade Facilitation Action Plan, as well as in the agenda for the facilitation of trade and transit procedures for
bilateral discussions with India. A second major institutional development concems the establishment of an independent public
body called the Nepal Intermodal Transportation Board (NITB). It will be created by HMG/N, and will be given regulatory power
over the three ICDs. The functions of NITB will be exercised through a Board of Members which should include members from
both the public and private sectors. Broad representation should ensure that the multiple and sometimes divergent interests of
the trade and transportation communities are properly represented in NITB's decisions. The most important function of NITB will
be to monitor and enforce terminal leaseholding and concession agreements with the Terminal Management Companies (TMC),
who will actually operate the ICDs. It will also monitor/regulate the maximum rates that TMCs can charge for services offered at
the ICDs. In addition, NITB will be empowered to negotiate an agency contract with Indian Railways (IR) and thus will be in a
position to ensure continuous rail service from Calcufta to the Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD. Draft documentation for the establishment of
NITB has been prepared and submitted to IDA. During negotiations it was agreed that the establishment of the NITB will be a
condition of Credit Effectiveness. Finally, the project also provides resources for institution building and human resource
development. A small trade facilitation cell within MOC will sustain local human capacity development, as an integral part of
technical assistance program.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection: The primary current transport mode for Nepal's import and export trade is
road transport via India, primarily in break-bulk form. This project will make available an alternative competitive mode of transport
involving rail transport to and from Sirsiya (Birgunj), as well as improved facilities at Biratnagar and Bhairahwa which will also
encourage through container transport (as contrasted with break-bulk) by road. These alternative modes are both more cost effective
and environmentally benign. Moreover, the competition which they will provide should put downward pressures on road transport rates
and lead to an improvement of service levels. Several alternative sites and several levels of investments were considered before
selecting the three terminal sites and scales of facility development. The final selection was based on technical, economic and
financial considerations. The facilities were designed for phased development to minimize the initial investments and project risks and
to permit cost effective expansion in line with future traffic growth.
9. Related ongoing or planned projects: IDA.(ij Road Mainter ance and Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2578-NE); and (i) Road
Maintenance III project (planned FY98). Asian Development Bank (ADB): (i) Third Road Improvement Project and Rural
Infrastructure Development Project (planned); (ii) technical assistance grant to implement ASYCUDA; and (iii) project to improve the
freight, passenger handling capacity of the international airport at Kathmandu.

10. Lesons learned and reflected in the project design: The proposed project would be the first IDA transport operation in Nepal that
focuses on intermodal transport, making any direct comparison with other projects difficult. However, projects in the transport sector
(i.e. road projects) have all suffered from a lack of adequate counterpart funds and timely payments to contractors, as well as from
weakfineffective project management and monitoring frameworks. These difficulties stem in large part from a lack of local managerial
and technical expertise required to implement projects effectively and in a timely manner. The technical, managerial and financial
weakness of the domestic and regional construction industry has also contributed to the poor implementation record in the transport
sub-sector. To overcome the implementation difficulties that IDA has experienced in Nepal, the BPIP has built-in quality control and
forward planning mechanisms, which should reduce project implementation problems, including specific measures to reduce human
resource and institutional development weaknesses. The BPIP contains a fully developed implementation action plan with physical
and institutional implementation targets, that will be closely monitored by both HMG/N and IDA. On the construction side, intemational
contractors have already expressed their interest in tendering for the civil works. The project will involve substantial private sector
participation in operating the constructed/improved ICDs, and is likely to draw on expatriate management expertise to introduce
intemational best practice. There are strong indications that several intemational groups are considering joint ventures or other
cooperative arrangements with Nepalese interests to tender for the operation of the ICDs.

11. Indicators of Borrower commitment and ownership: The borrower has fully committed to the project from its inception and has
actively participated in defining project objectives and in preparing a framework for implementation. Evidence of this commitment can
be found in the PPF request and use by HMG/N of approximately US$ 500,000 to fund project preparation activities. HMGIN has
established a high level steering commiHtee to oversee project preparation and implementation, thus ensuring its full and active
participation in the project. Senior HMG/N officials did confirm at the 1996 Annual Meetings that this project ranked at the top of their
priority list for Bank assistance and requested an acceleration in the preparation process. significantly, this project has been equally
and strongly supported by both the current govemment and its predecessor govemment, as well as by the private sector through the
Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI). HMG/N has fully endorsed the use of ICB for the procurement

of civil works contracts and of intemational consultants for supervision of the works (Annex 6). Also, it has fully endorsed the concept
of using private sector operators to operate the ICD facilities. Signiftcantly, HMG/N has also recently concluded negotiations and
signed a new trade agreement with India. As indicated earlier, HMG/N has also initiated discussions with India on an agenda for
bilateral negotiation and reached agreement with India concerning the rail spur.

12. Value added of IDA participation: IDA can assist in a uniquely valuable way in helping to facilitate transit and administrative
arrangements for moving third country goods between India and Nepal due to its unique understanding of conditions both in Nepal and
more importantly in India. In India IDA/IBRD have been recently involved in the preparation of a container transport logistics project
with Container Corporation of India (CONCOR) and their involvement with IR in the transport sector spans four decades. This gives
iDA/IBRD a critical understanding of the difficulties and constraints facing Nepal's use of its strategic land corridor(s) through India.
IDA can facilitate the development of this strategic transit corridor between the two countries by providing financing for basic
infrastructure and in providing access to global best intermodal practices and technologies. In addition, IDA can help the development
of institutional and human resource capacities required for project success through direct technical assistance and project
development. IDA's support builds on experience gained in other national contexts in transport sector deregulation, transit facilitation,
private sector participation and in creating competitive business environments.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project files)
13. Economic Assessment   [X]   Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ 103/11/2 million;             Cost Effectiveness
(see Annex 4):                     ERR= 45/44/17% (Birgunj/Biratnagar/Bhairahwa)             Analysis:
Separate calculations have been made for each of the three terminals as well as for the project as a whole. This shows that all of the
three terminals are economically feasible, although by different margins. The most economically attractive benefits appear to be
available through the development of the main Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD which accounts for more than half of the project cost. There are
significant uncertainties regarding the traffic forecasts but this has been taken into account in the sensitivity analysis (Annex 4). In
view of the risk factors which have emerged, the dimensions of the original terminal construction were scaled down and a phased
terminal expansion plans were developed for each facility. The technical assistance, including extension of ASYCUDA and
introduction of ACIS will yield substantial benefits in the form of improved data availability, stream lined procedures, enhanced human
capital, etc. but these are difficult to quantify and have been treated as non-quantified benefits. Finally, the project will also generate
substantial environmental benefits by causing a shift in the movement of import/export freight from the road to rail mode of transport
especially at the Sirsiya (Birgunj) lCD. These benefits have not been quantified in the economic analysis due to the difficulty in
evaluating such benefits. The overall ERR for the project is 40% while the NPV is US$ 112 million (the calculation of the aggregate
ERR and NPV include all costs such as supervision, TA, land acquisition and R&R but exclude the unquantifiable direct benefits of the
trade facilitation component).
Fiscal impact: The project should, overtime, make a significant positive contribution to the national budget. The initial fiscal impact on
HMG/N will be limited to meeting the counterpart funding requirements estimated at approximately US$ 5.0 million over the three/four
year project implementation period. Once the ICDs are in operation, the lease payments from the TMCs should easily cover the debt
servicing requirements of the IDA Credit. In addition, the project will generate additional tax revenue through increased economic
activity that will be generated by the constructed/improved ICDs and collateral commercial activities. More specifically, according to
the financial projections prepared by the consultants, during the first five years of operations the Sirsiya (Birgunj) lCD should generate
an extra US$ 500 thousand in income tax revenue for HMG/N.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.    ..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)               NPV=US$ 1.7/1.2/0.3 million; FRR= 19/59/26%
(Birgunj/Biratnagar/Bhairahwa)
Under the project HMG/N will bear the full capital cost of approximately US$ 20 million to construct/improve the three ICDs and to
provide the basic equipment required for their operation. HMG/N should recover the capital investment made to construct the facilities
from the leasehold fees that TMCs will pay to operate the three facilities. In turn, the TMC's will generate revenue to meet their lease
obligations to HMG/N by providing (directly and/or by sub-contracting) a full range of services to the users of the facilities. Thus,
actual traffic volumes and the markets' willingness to pay will determine the final level of lease revenue that ultimately is available to
HMG/N to meet the debt servicing obligations of the IDA Credit. The proposed phased approach to terminal investment (fine tune
capacity as closely as possible with traffic growth) should substantially reduce the financial risk to both the TMC and HMG/N.
Furthermore, the construction/improvement of three ICDs to serve three different but complementary markets in the country should
better spread the risk of lower than forecasted demand for the facilities.
T&........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
15. Technical Assessment: The actual construction/improvement of the three ICDs does not represent a major challenge from a
technical/technological point of view. The required construction expertise is widely available world wide. In light of past experience in
Nepal particular attention will be paid to managing construction quality, costs and delays. Effective monitoring mechanisms are being
developed as part of the BPIP to ensure that the physical works are completed within the stipulated contractual time. Intemationally
experienced supervision consultants have been selected to supervise the construction activities to ensure a high and consistent
construction quality and timely execution of the civil works. Finally, in order to attract intemationally experienced contractors, the
three civil works contracts have been put out to bid as one package following ICB procedures.

16. Institutional Assessment: Institutional support of both project components is considered appropriate and adequate for the project
to realize its full potential benefit:
a. Overall project implementation will be the responsibility of MOC through the PIU, with the reconstituted PSC providing
needed inter-ministerial coordination. Vvith the shift in primary responsibility from MOWT (during project preparation) to MOC (for
project implementation), the PIU and PSC have been reconstituted, and the Secretary of Commerce will head the PSC. The Secretary
of Commerce will also chair the recently established NTTFC. In addition to its overall project implementation role, MOC will be directly
responsible for the implementation of the trade facilitation component of the project with the support of a technical assistance team
who will work with and train a strengthened trade facilitation unit within MOC. MOC will also be responsible for the related ASYCUDA
component which will be implemented under its guidance by the Department of Customs under MOF. In light of MOC's lack of
experience in procurement of equipment and management of civil works, the PIU will be staffed with personnel that have the
necessary breadth and depth of skills to oversee their procurement and implementation.
b. NITB will regulate and control the TMCs that will operate the ICDs. NITB will competitively tender leasehold rights to
one private TMC for each terminal. The negotiated leasehold agreement will serve as the regulatory framework for defining the
respective rights and obligations of NITB and the TMCs. NITB will provide an early warning system for the monitoring of terminal
operations and their profit performance. Default or failure to perform under the lease agreement(s) will lead to the foreclosure and re-
bidding of the original leasehold.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~.................  i  ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................
17. Social Assessment: In connection with the constructionrimprovement of the three ICDs, land requirements and related social
impact are as follows: (i) at Sirsiya (Birgunj), for the project's major, rail-based ICD, about 37 hectares (HA) of privately-owned land is
being acquired, affecting about 144 families in the village of Sirsiya (Birgunj) (two families, with a total of 9 persons will need to be
resettled, while others will have to be compensated for the loss of land and rehabilitated); (ii) at Bhairahwa, for one smaller, road-
based ICD, under 2 ha. of privately-owned land will be necessary to be acquired (affecting about 14 families, but requiring no
resettlement); and (iii) at Biratnagar, the other road-based ICD, requires no land in excess to Customs Department's existing reserves.
A baseline social and economic survey was completed and the resettlement action plan (RAP, known as Resettlement Policy
Framework and Acquisition, Compensation and Rehabilitation Plan or ACRP) drafted for the Birgunj, Bhairahwa project sites have
been reviewed/cleared by IDA and approved by HMG/N. Given that the need for additional acquisition of privately-owned land at
Bhairahwa became clear only after pre-appraisal, PAFs at Bhairahwa were subsequently surveyed to the same standard as the PAFs
at Sirsiya (Birgunj). The new data - both from the Sirsiya (Birgunj) and Bhairahwa additional survey - have been incorporated into the
baseline social survey and the RAP documents. The full RAPs has been reviewed by IDA and is in full compliance will all relevant
Bank Group's OD's and will be implemented during the life of the project. Apart from the loss of land and the need for economic
rehabilitation, other major social impact includes the increased influx of people to Sirsiya (Birgunj). A project Information and
rehabilitation center (PIRC) has been established at Sirsiya (Birgunj) and a smaller satellite facility is being established at Bhairahwa.
Through the efforts of the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Coordinator (RRC) and local PIRC staff, awareness raising, training and
income generation programs will be developed for PAFs.
................................................ ...................................................... ..................I....................................................... ..........  .............   ...
18. Environmental Assessment:            Environmental Category: B
An EA has been prepared and made available to IDA. The major environmental benefit from the project will be reduced air pollution
and reduced traffic congestion in Sirsiya (Birgunj). This will be caused by the gradual diversion of traffic from trucks to the new rail
service. The civil works contracts would provide for: (i) full restoration and landscaping of burrow areas, quarries and spoil tips
opened specifically for this project; (ii) preparing storage areas, especially for diesel fuel and bitumen; (iii) adoption of sanitary
arrangements in offices, yards and on site, and; (iv) avoiding contamination of water courses and groundwater. As a result both
terminal construction and operation should result in minimal adverse environmental impact and overall the project should have a
p vpositive net impact.

20. Sustajnaii 0iy .Project sustainability will be ensured by extensive private sector involvement in the iong term operation of the
iCDs. The creation of NITB will ensure that private sector investments and involvement in operating the ICDs is supported by a well
conceived and transparent regulatory framework. This, together with the expected financial returns, should enhance the private
sector's willingness to invest and operate the ICDs. The result of this competitive process will be to accelerate the development of
the rail freight transport mode, and to further strengthen the road transport mode, thus ensuring the long term sustainability of the
project. The institution building goals underlying the software components should be sustained through the development of human
resources at MOC level. Human resource development is considered critical to enhance Nepalese capacity to deal with trade
facilitation issues. The institutional components of the project, if properly implemented, should lead to a long term and permanent
reduction in the cost of moving freight to and from Nepal. This should enable a more rapid growth in trade volumes which will
generate increasing amounts of business for the three ICDs, further enhancing their long term sustainability.

Detailed Project Description
Project Component I - Rail and road Sirsiya (Birguni) ICD (USS 18.0 million)2: This project component includes several categories
of civil works including site preparation, earth work, pavement, lighting, fencing, warehouse space construction, goods shed construction,
administrative office building, truck scale, electrical systems and utilities suitable for a modem multimodal transfer terminal as well as
actions related to the implementation of the ACRP, excluding land acquisition. This 203 thousand square meter "greenfield" facility is
designed to receive and originate, on opposite sides, container trains and general merchandise and bulk commodity trains from/to the
gateway ports (Calcutta and Haldia). In separate services zones, the facility will provide for expeditious customs inspections and cargo
clearances and for ISO container inspection and interchanges as well as for truck parking and loading.
Project Component 2 - Road only Biratnagar ICD (USS 2.0 million): This project component includes several categories of civil
works, including site preparation, earth work, pavement, lighting, fencing, warehouse space construction, administrative office building,
electrical systems and utilities suitable for a road only ICD. This 16 thousand square meter improved facility is designed to transfer
cargoes efficiently from trucks to ISO containers and vice versa, to inspect and interchange container equipment and to store cargoes. In
addition, the facility will provide for expeditious customs inspections and cargo clearance.
Project Component 3 - Road only Bhairahwa ICD (US$ 1.9 million): The scope and type of civil works required to improve the road
only facility at Bhairahwa are very similar to what is being done at the Biratnagar ICD. This 15 thousand square meter improved terminal
is designed to transfer cargoes efficiently between trucks and between ISO containers and trucks, to inspect and interchange container
equipment and to store cargoes. In addition, the facility will provide for expeditious customs inspections and cargo clearance.
Project Component 4 - Equipment for three ICDs (USS 2.0 million): For the Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD three wheeled reach stackers are
required with sufficient lifting capacity to handle a fully loaded 40 foot ISO container and to stack them three high. For the Biratnagar and
Bhairahwa ICDs, one wheeled reach stacker each with sufficient lifting capacity to handle empty 40 foot containers and to stack them two
high is required.
Project Component 5 - Supervision consultants (USS 800 thousand): Intemationally experienced supervision consultants will be used
to supervise the construction/improvement of the three ICDs. They will have full responsibility as per FIDIC 4 conditions as the
"engineer" on site.
Project Component 6 - TA for Trade Facilitation (US$ 1.1 million): The main focus of the activities under this component aim at
reducing the transport and trade costs associated with Nepal's foreign trade. These activities are: (i) simplification of documents and
procedures; (ii) modernization of carrier's liability, multimodal transport and insurance provisions; (iii) modernization of customs
administration policies and operational procedures; (iv) strengthening of freight forwarding and customs clearing agency standards and
capacity; (v) updating of foreign-currency regulations relating to transit trade. The above activities will lead to adjustments to certain
protocols of the Trade and Transit Treaties of 1991 (revised in 1993).
Project Component 7 - Introduction of ASYCUDA (USS 1.1 million): Automation of customs data through the introduction of
ASYCUDA (Automated Systems for Customs Data), should drastically reduce the incidence of fraud and expedite the clearance of freight
by allowing a greater degree of selectivity in customs examinations. The Bank will coordinate with the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
with UNCTAD and with Nepalese customs leading to the full introduction of ASYCUDA. It is expected that ADB will first introduce
ASYCUDA at Customs House and at the intemational airport in Kathmandu; and that IDA would finance the extension to the three border
ICDs (Sirsiya (Birgunj), Bhairawha, Biratnagar) financed under the project.
Project Component 8 - Introduction of ACIS (USS 1.1 million): Introduction and full implementation of ACIS (Advanced Cargo
Information Systems) as a freight tracking information system in the Calcutta to Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD rail corridor (the Nepal Corridor) is
complementary to ASYCUDA and to the information needs of freight in transit. The project will finance the introduction of ACIS with
UNCTAD acting as main provider and executor of technology and implementation know how. When implemented, ACIS should provide
the information flows needed by railway operators, customs administration, private sector operators and customs to streamline transit time
(reduce immobilization's).
Project Component 9 - PPF (USS 500 thousand): Repayment of PPF.
2   The Government of India (GOI) plans to fund in parallel with the project the construction of a 5 km rail spur to link the current rail terminus of
Raxaul (India) with the Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD in Nepal. The construction of the rail spur is planned to be completed by the end of 1999 which
is before the projected completion of the Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD.

Overall;                                40%                23%
Main Assumptions for the Economic Analysis:
*   The economic benefit from the investment in the Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD arises mainly from the significant reduction in total transport
costs on both import and export of goods by train (with the project) as compared with road transport as it's currently the case
(without the project). These benefits are directly reflected in the final price of goods using this facility.
*   The economic benefit from the investments in both the Biratnagar, and the Bhairawa ICDs arise mainly from the substantial increase
in the capacity, as well as from more efficient custom processing, and handling of goods, improvements will lead to time and hence
freight cost savings. However, the consultant's assessment of benefits for the Bhairawa facility did not include savings in freight
costs, and this has lead to a lower rate of return (ERR= 17%) as compared with Biratnagar and Sirsiya (Birgunj).
*    In the cost/benefit analysis it was assumed that the costs include both the construction cost of the new Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD along
with the construction cost of the new railway spur estimated at US$ 4 million.
*    It was also assumed that the existing traffic (using road transport) will be diverted gradually to rail following the opening of the new
facility (50% for the first year, 75% for the second year and 100% for the third year and onward).
*   Forecasted traffic growth was assumed to closely reflect Nepal's long term GDP growth.
Note 1: The large difference in economic and financial benefit is due to the fact that the economic evaluation covers the total transport
chain while the financial evaluation is limited to the financial assessment of the ICDs from the perspective of a TMC operator.
Note 2: The project should have a positive tax impact for HMG/N (see Block 3/13) through the generation of both direct and indirect taxes
generated by the economic activity of the 3 ICDs being improved/constructed.
Note 3: The only subsidy that will be granted by HMG/N to the TMCs will be the use of the land for the Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD.
Note 4: Total costs includes both the construction costs of the three facilities as well as the costs for construction supervision, R&R,
land acquisition and the cost of TA.

Sensitivity Analysis: The major risks affecting the project implementation (as identified in section 21) are cost overruns and construction
delays. In the economic analyses, the risk of construction delay was covered by making conservative assumptions regarding duration of
construction for the three facilities. The cost overrun risk was assessed in the sensitivity analysis and has shown to have a small impact on
the ERRs. The risk of macroeconomic problems (e.g.; lower economic growth) leading to reduced traffic growth through the facilities was
assessed by testing several lower traffic growth scenarios, and it is likely to have only a small impact on the ERRs. Overall the sensitivity
of the investments to the different scenarios tested is quite low.

Main Assumptions underlying Financial Analvsis: The main sources of revenue for the TMC operators arise both from the earnings from
sub-lessees (CFS and Goodshed) and tariffs on different services provided. The consultant undertook a detailed survey of the
trucking/shipping industry in order to develop the set of freight rates used in the financial analysis, and what follows are some of the
assumptions used:
*   The financial analysis was developed for the three ICDs from the TMCs prospective, assuming a gradual increase in the lease charge
from 8% to 20% of the capital cost of the facilities over the project life. This assumption can be justified by the increase in revenues
that will be generated over time by the increase in traffic using the three ICDs.
*   For the financial analysis of Biratnagar it was assumed that the share of containers using the facility will increase gradually from
40%/O to 80% over the project life.
*   However, the outcome of the procurement process of both the TMCs and the different operators (CFS and Goodshed), shall determine
the actual freight and lease rates.

A 'projected' Financial Summary (Income Statement, Funds Statement and Balance Sheet) was prepared only for the TMC operator of the
Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD because it is a new facility and will require a much larger capital investment (80% of total) when compared to the other
two IFTs being financed under the project, for which only projected income statements have been prepared.
4 Forecast for Sirsiya (Birgunj) ICD is based on the base case scenario for traffic projections, revenues and costs.
