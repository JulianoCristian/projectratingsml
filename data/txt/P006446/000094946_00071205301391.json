    achieved or significant progress was made toward achieving\n            them; the overall outcome, therefore, is satisfactory.\n            Project sustainability is likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were satisfactory overall. Some of the\n            principal lessons include the following: Good performance in\n            projects of this nature depends mainly on stable\n            administrative regulations and the country's economic\n            stability. Decentralization of funds to the states and\n            municipalities is effective only if these entities make\n            environmental and sustainable development objectives a\n            priority. Institutional strengthening projects generally\n            produce little or no effect unless they are part of other\n            projects which are geared towards concrete environmental\n            results. Investments to consolidate Conservation Units tend\n            to become sustainable only if they are combined with\n            activities involving the surrounding communities. It is\n            cautioned that the decentralization of environmental\n            management to municipalities based on a large number of\n            projects distributed over the national territory creates the\n            risk of fragmentation and scattering of funds resulting in\n            high supervision, technical assistance, and evaluation\n            costs. This underscores the point that state participation\n            in this process is indispensable."}, "docdt": "2000-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
