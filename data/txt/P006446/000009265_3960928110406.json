     economic and environmental losses associated with\n            uncontrolled deforestation, soil erosion, and air and\n            waterlution; (b) the institutions of the environmental\n            sector, with special emphasis on the strengthening of the\n            Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos\n            Naturais Renovaveis (IBAMA) and State Agencies in the Legal\n            Amazon and Pantanal, and (c) the regulatory framework of the\n            environmental sector. The project would support the first\n            three-year phase of Brazil's National Environmental\n            Program (Programa Nacional de Meio Ambiente - PMNA). It\n            would finance: (a) the strengthening of the National System\n            of Conservation Units; (b) protection of ecosystems; and (c)\n            institutional development."}, "docdt": "1990-01-07T00:00:00Z"}
