Description of the Project
Page  13
The objectives of the Project are to strengthen, with respect to the short and
medium
-term targets of the Borrower's environmental policies: (i) the protection of 
the country's most important
conservation areas and imminently endangered eco-systems, with special emphasis on the 
reduction of economic and environmental losses associated with uncontrolled
deforestation, soil erosion, and air and water pollution in the Pantanal, Legal
Amazon, Atlantic Forest and Brazilian Coast: (ii) the institutions of the 
environmental sector, with special emphasis on the strengthening of IBAMA and State
Agencies in Legal Amazon and Pantanal; and
(iii)
the regulatory framework of the
environmental sector.

10
studies, in the second and third Project execution year, in respect of Federal
Conservation Units to be located in other ecosystems which are in need of such Units,
such studies to include a recommendation on all legal requirements for the
establishment of such Conservation Units in accordance with the technical
recommendations of such studies; and
(b)
