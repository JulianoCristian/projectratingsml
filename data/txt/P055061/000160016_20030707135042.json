The overall\n            performance of the World Bank is rated satisfactory, while\n            Borrower performance is rated highly satisfactory. This\n            section analyzes lessons learned from two Bank operations,\n            the Health System Reform Project (the SECAL) and the Health\n            System Reform Technical Assistance Project (the TAL), acting\n            together to support one reform process. Some of the lessons\n            learned in this section might also apply to the SECAL and\n            are presented in the SECAL ICR (report no. 26236) and vice\n            versa. Lessons learned are organized in three sections: (1)\n            overall comments on project design and implementation; (2)\n            issues related to the separation of functions, resource\n            allocation and reimbursement mechanisms; and (3) the\n            redefined primary health care model. They include: 1) Strict\n            coherence between the TAL and the SECAL must be a result of\n            the parallel design, and its maintenance during project life\n            a result of the supervision process that brings \"tuning\n            up\" to the operations. Strict synergy of both\n            project's implementation is necessary to successfully\n            support the reform agenda. 2) The TAL financed some\n            activities that were not used for policy change under the\n            SECAL since those were regarded as pilots without any real\n            consensus around the policy changes they were proposing to\n            implement. 3) When the Bank acts as a catalyst to change in\n            the preparation phase, sufficient support should be provided\n            to ensure that technical issues are well addressed during\n            project implementation.4) To measure the impact and outcome\n            of each activity of the reform project, it is not enough to\n            define monitoring and performance indicators at appraisal.\n            5) A reform process supported by parallel SECAL and TAL\n            operations should develop a specific strategy to deal with\n            the political aspects of a reform. TA packages should be\n            such that allow for technical developments to be easily\n            linked to the policy arena for implementation. 6) It is\n            important to closely collaborate and coordinate efforts\n            among the Bank, the Institution and the PCU in order to\n            achieve the originally proposed goals and diminish the risk\n            of misunderstandings that might end changing the course of\n            the reform. 7) Successful implementation of information\n            systems in a reform project require a strong internal\n            champion and a clear operational need to guarantee timely\n            and successful implementation."}, "docdt": "2003-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
