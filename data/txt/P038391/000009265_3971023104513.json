objectives: 1) to improve the learning\n            environment in high poverty and predominantly rural areas;\n            2) to improve the quality of educational inputs; and 3) to\n            strengthen the Education and Physical Culture\n            Ministry's capacity to carry out teacher training,\n            student assessment and curriculum development. The\n            components to achieve these aims include: 1) rehabilitating\n            and furnishing 50-56 dilapidated and dangerous primary\n            schools in poverty areas; 2) facilitating teacher training\n            reform and developing a new system for producing and\n            financing piloted textbooks; 3) piloting a new\n            teacher-in-service training strategy, developing capacity\n            for student assessment covering core primary subjects, and\n            establishing a school mapping database."}, "docdt": "1997-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
