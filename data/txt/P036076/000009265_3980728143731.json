Adjustment\n            Loan Project in Algeria are as follows: overall outcome of\n            the project was rated as marginally satisfactory, and the\n            performance of the Bank and the Borrower were rated\n            satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: (a) an active and large scale employment creation\n            strategy is necessary in a situation marked by very high\n            unemployment to enable the political and social feasibility\n            of a swift implementation of reforms; (b) sequencing of\n            reforms matters. Trade and exchange rate liberalization\n            should go hand-in-hand with privatization and support to the\n            private sector for a quick supply response. The lack of such\n            a balanced and mutually supportive approach contributes to\n            de-industrialization, weakens the support for reform, and\n            undermines the implementation of the very trade and exchange\n            liberalization as they become unsustainable; and (c)\n            unbalanced and prolonged emphasis on stabilization at the\n            expense of structural reforms, and exaggerated valuation of\n            improved short term macro performance indicators alone\n            diverts attention from the need to accelerate structural\n            reform, as it gives policymakers a false sense of having\n            finished the agenda and gives the general population a false\n            expectation of an end to its pain."}, "docdt": "1998-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
