Project\n            (SAL) is the central element of the Bank's assistance\n            strategy for Algeria. This strategy aims to support the\n            Algerian authorities in: 1) stimulating private-sector-led\n            growth; 2) protecting the poor during the transition to a\n            market-based economy; and 3) enhancing the country's\n            ability to mobilize external resources. The SAL builds on\n            progress made under the recent Economic Rehabilitation\n            Support Loan, under which the Algerian authorities made\n            tangible progress in adjustment and met many of the agreed\n            objectives, including the adoption of a privatization law,\n            sooner than anticipated. The loan supports an adjustment\n            program that is moving Algeria closer to its goal of an\n            open, market-based economy in the context of growth and\n            increased employment. The key components of the project\n            include: 1) macroeconomic stabilization and rationalization\n            of public expenditures; 2) support for public enterprise\n            reform and private sector development, including: (a)\n            large-scale privatization of small public enterprises, where\n            local demand exists; (b) further reforms designed to limit\n            the losses of large public enterprises and ready for\n            privatization; (c) increased private-sector participation in\n            subcontracting and in the provision of municipal services;\n            and (d) financial sector reform designed to increase\n            competition and create needed new financial instruments; and\n            3) support the already successful implemented new social\n            protection system, including some measures to improve its performance."}, "docdt": "1996-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
