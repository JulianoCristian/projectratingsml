Compensation Fund Project (FONCODES) for Peru were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, project\n            sustainability was likely, Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            decentralization and delegation of responsibility to the\n            zonal offices, including project approval and release of\n            funds, brought FONCODES closer to the communities it served\n            and enabled the local staff to adapt their approach as\n            needed to suit local conditions. Transition t o the new MIS\n            was slower than estimated by the banks and FONCODES, and its\n            installment in regional and central offices proved\n            difficult. Greater attention to the development of the MIS\n            during the project preparation phase would likely have\n            facilitated this process. More emphasis needs to be placed\n            on educating beneficiaries concerning their role in the\n            project cycle and the use of services offered by the\n            project. Training in the operation and maintenance of\n            completed projects should become systematic and, perhaps\n            most importantly should be included in the costs of the\n            project. This is particularly true in the case of water and\n            sanitation projects. To enhance subproject quality and\n            sustainability greater emphasis should be placed on training\n            of individuals contracted by FONCODES as supervisors and inspectors."}, "docdt": "1998-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
