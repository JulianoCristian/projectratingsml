Administrator, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Administrator: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Administrator 
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the 
Administrator shall so request, refund to the Administrator) an amount

no further deposit by the Administrator into the Special Account shall 
be made until the Recipient has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)

any amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Recipient shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Administrator, refund to the Administrator
such outstanding amount.
(c)
The Recipient may, upon notice to the Administrator, refund 
to the Administrator all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the 
Special Account.

(a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Grant Account 
for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
