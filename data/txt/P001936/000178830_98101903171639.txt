TO T12 E,LECUTIVE DIRECTORS O' A
PROPOSED CRSDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF NIGME
FOR AiET AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.           I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed credit, in an amount in various currencies equivalent to
US$584,ooo to the Republic of Niger.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.           Following an IBRD/IDA identification mission in September
1966 and an FAO/IBRD preparation mission in ilovember, 1967, the Govern-
ment of Eiger in June 1968 requested a $2.5 million IDA credit to permit
the "Caisse Hationale de Credit Agricole" (CIUCA) to expand its short
and medium term lending operations to farmers and rural cooperatives.
Appraisal of the project in 0ovember 1968 showed that expected invest-
ment in agricultural machinery and purchases of inputs had been over-
estimated. This resulted in a reduction of the total cost of the
project from $3.3 to $0.87 million. Negotiations started on July
22, 1969 uith a Government delegation led by lir. Abdoulaye Diallo,
Commissioner General for Developinent; further discussions about
interest rates on credits to farmers and cooperatives and about
aeasures to strengthen CNCA's financial position were completed
only recently.
3.           This would be the Association's third credit to Xiger.
The follow-ing is a summary statemtent of IDA credits to _iger as of
April 30, 1970:

4.           Credit 55 helped finance the construction of a 30 km road
and the improvement of 35 km of another road in the e stern part of the
country. Execution was satisfactory and the credit has been fully dis-
bursed. The road maintenance project financed under Credit 128 provides
for the elimination of the backlog of deferred maintenance, the improve-
ment of maintenance operations, the training of local personnel, the
purchase of maintenance and shop equipment, and the extension of work-
shops and stores. Execution is satisfactory; disbursements are only
slightly behind schedule due to difficulties in recruiting personnel.
5.           A third road project is expected to be presented to the
Executive Directors during FY 1971.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
6.           Borrower:                    Republic of Niger
Purpose:                     To assist in financing (1)
credit extended by CNCA to
farmers for the purchase of
seasonal inputs, of draft
animals and animal-drawn farm
implements, and to rural
cooperatives for the purchase
of scales; (Ji) an expanaBcn of
extereicr. Servioesp and (iii)
technical assistarce to CNCA.
Amount:                      The equivalent in various
currencies of US$584,Coo.
Amortization:                In 50 years including a 10-
year period of grace, through
semi-annual installments of
1/2 of l% from July 15, 1980
through January 15, 1990 and
1-1/2o from July 15, 1990
through January 15, 2020.
Service Charge:              3/4 of lo per annum.

PART III - THE PROJECT
7.            An appraisal report entitled "Agricultural Credit Project -
Niger" (PA-16a), dated May 15, 1970, is attached.
8.            This would be the first Bank Group operation in agri-
culture in Niger, 95 per cent of whose population lives on the land. About
90 per cent of the land is desert or semi-desert, and most of the soils
are sandy and poor. Rainfall is adequate only in southern areas. In
those relatively fertile areas which sustain the bulk of the population,
the Government has undertaken a productivity program which has already
succeeded in making groundnut and cotton production competitive on
world markets, despite high transportation costs, without price sub-
sidies. Groundnuts constitute the main cash crop and yield 66.5% of
Niger's export earnings. Livestock and livestock products take second
place among exports (14.5%). Cotton exports are small (3.2%), and no
other crop seems to have good export prospects.
9.            The objective of the proposed credit is to raise agricul-
tural productivity in the southern part of the country. The amount
of the credit would be applied as follows:
Increase of capital of Caisse Nationale
de Credit Agricole (CNCA) for relending
to farmers and cooperatives             $ 360,000
Financing of the services of a banking
expert for CNCA                            64,000
Financing of expanded extension services
of Union Nigerienne de Cr6dit et de
Cooperation (UNCC)                        160,0o0
$ 584,000
10.           CNCA is Niger's agricultural credit bank.   It was
established in 1967 with capital provided by the Government and is
managed by a government-appointed administrative council. Its capital
is CFAF 117.4 million. So far, its revenues have come only from
credits to farmers and rural cooperatives and have not been sufficient
to cover its costs. However, the Government has now decided to
strengthen CNCA's position by transferring to it a share in the
financing in the groundnut marketing operations of Societe Nig6rienne
de Commercialisation de l'Arachide (SONARA), and for this purpose will
increase CNCA's capital by CFAF 50 million. Of the proposed credit,
$360,000 would be used by the Government to increase CNCA's capital by
a further CFAF 100 million to CFAF 267 million.



- 4 -
11.           Over the next few years CNCA plans to expand its lending
to farmers for seasonal purchases of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds
and for draft oxen and animal drawn farm implements and to cooperatives
for the purchase of scales. The estimated amount of these purchases is
CFAF 180 million ($650,000), of which the foreign exchange cost,
estimated at $360,000 (CFAF 100 million), would be provided from the
proposed credit. CNCA would, in addition, provide CFAF 60 million
($W15,COO) out of its other funds, the remaining CFAF 20 million being
provided by the farmers and cooperatives themselves. The goods to be
purchased by farmers and cooperatives out of the proceeds of the
proposed credit would be imported and would be procured centrally by
CNCA on the basis of international competitive bidding. The interest
rate paid by farmers and cooperatives would be 9 per cent per annum
on short-term credits and 8 per cent per annum on medium-term credits.
12.           In addition to providing FNCA with more capital, the
proposed credit would provide CUICA with a grant of $64,COO to pay for
the foreign exchange cost of the eervices for two years of an exper-
ienced banking expert who will assist in the training of local staff,
13.           UNCC is a government organization formed in 1962 to
provide the establishment of cooperatives and provide credit, but its
credit activities were transferred to CNCA. in 1967, and its present
functions are to prepare arrangements for procuring and distributing
imports to farmers and cooperatives and provide extension services.
The proposed credit would provide the equivalent of $160,000 to pay
for the services of 100 additional extension workers, 50 on cotton and
50 on groundnuts. These are local expenditures, the inclusion of which
I consider justified by the importance of this item for the success
of the project and by the economic considerations set out in Para. 25
below.
1h.           Successful project execution will depend upon close
cooperation between CNCA, UNCC and the Government. To this end a
Project Coordinating Committee would be set up consisting of repre-
sentatives of the ministrias involved aud of CNCA aad UUJCC, For the
time being, CNCA and UNCC have a common manager.
15.           The project is expected to result in a sustained increase
in the production of groundnuts, cotton and rice because of higher
yields. Even if prices of groundnuts and cotton fall somewhat, net
cash income of farmers coming under the project should be doubled, and
government revenues should also benefit. The areas included in the
project account for about 94 per cent of Niger's groundnut production
and the whole of the cotton and rice production.   Thus, despite its
smallness, the project should provide an important stimulus to the
development of the few cash crops on which Niger's foreign exchange
earnings depend.



16.           Improved fa.rming methods and greater use of fertilizers
and insecticides can give a very high rate of return: this is, however,
dependent on willingness of farmers to accept changes. Even with
conservative assumptions on yields and timing, however, the rate of
return should be of the order of 20 per cent.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.           The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Asso-
ciation and the Republic of Niger, the draft Project Agreement among
the Association, Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) and Union
Nigerienne de Credit et de Cooperation (UNCC), the recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
18.           The draft Development Credit Agreement and the draft
Project Agreement follow the general pattern of similar agreements for
agricultural projects. The execution and delivery of the Project
Agreement, the establishment of a Project Coordinating Committee, and
the appointment of auditors by CNCA are specified as conditions pre-
cedent to effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement (Section
6.01). The Association would have the right to suspend, cancel or
premature the Credit if the instruments concerning CNCA's and UNCC's
present structure and responsibilities were modified without the prior
approval of the Association or if CNCA or UNCC failed to perform their
respective obligations under the Project Agreement (Section 5."2).
PART V - THE ECONOMY
19.           A report entitled, "The Economy of Niger" (AF-77a) dated
July 8, 1968 was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 19,
1968. An economic mission will be sent to Niger in November 1970.
20.           Niger is a landlocked country with extremely difficult
natural conditions. Nevertheless, over-all economic growth since
independence (1960) was relatively satisfactory until 1968. During
these eight years, GDP increased by about 4.6% p.a. in real terms and
by about 2% p.a. on a per capita basis. GDP per capita was about
$87 in 1966.
21.           Since 1968, however, Niger has been undergoing a period of
economic difficulties due to droughts and to the civil war in Nigeria.
Livestock owners in particular suffered heavy losses. The resulting
decline in agricultural incomes and exports and the termination of
French budgetary support contributed to financial difficulties in the
public sector, which the Government attempted to solve by increasing
income taxes, taking measures to reduce personnel expenditures and asking
the French Government for renewed assistance. Recognizing Niger's dif-
ficulties, the French Government tentatively agreed to resume its support
for a period of four years (1970-73) in the amount of CFAF 1 billion
(US$3.6 million) per year or close to 10% of the national budget.



- 6 -
22.           With normal weather conditions and the end of the civil
war in Nigeria, production and trade should again expand. Livestock
and/or meat exports toward Ivory Coast and other countries of the
Entente group should also increase if the recent decision to set up
a common market for livestock and meat is effectively implemented.
Public finance will be helped by the fiscal revenues to be derived
from the mining of uranium in Arlit, when operations start shortly;
such revenues are expected to reach $h.3 million in 1983, i.e. about
13% of the 1969 budget. They would be further boosted if ongoing oil
exploration were to prove successful.
23.           Unless important discoveries are made, however, Niger's
development strategy cannot be based on the exploitation of mineral
resources, nor is there much scope for industrial development, particular-
ly in view of the serious handicap of transportation costs. The
country, therefore, has no choice but to make the best of poor natural
conditions in developing its agriculture and livestock. The main export
possibilities remain groundnuts and livestock, but cotton also appears
to hold some promise. At this stage, other projects in the agricul-
tural sector can only be directed toward domestic consumption.
24.           Given the severe constraints with which Iliger has to
struggle, the country's performance has been creditable. However, due
to its poverty and limited export possibilities, it cannot be considered
eligible for Bank financing.
25.           Niger's poverty sets rigorous limits to savings.   In re-
cent years only 16.5 per cent of public investment has been financed
internally and the bulk has been raised abroad. The direct import
content of investment projects, however, is much less than the external
resources required. These exceptional circumstances justify action by
foreign lenders in applying part of their funds to the financing of
local expenditure.
PART VII - RECOMNENDATION
26.           I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed Development Credit.
