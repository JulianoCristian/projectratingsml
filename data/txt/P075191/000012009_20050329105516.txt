3. Program Description

3.a.Description of the program

    Andhra Pradesh (AP) is the fifth largest state in India with a population of 76 million. In 1999, a far-
reaching vision for economic and social development was articulated in AP through the Vision 2020
document. During this process, AP became the first Indian state to put together a strategy for
comprehensive development and a complementary reform agenda. The Vision 2020 document is a
statement of intent to pursue economic growth, develop human capital, and reduce poverty. With specific
economic and social targets, similar to the Millennium Development Goals, this vision is laid out in a
series of sixteen sector/thematic strategy papers that were prepared between 1999 and 2001.

    AP is now one of India's leading reforming states. It has made significant progress in improving the
living standards of its citizens. Real GSDP growth averaged 5.3% annual rate during the first half of the
1990s, and accelerated to 6.1% in the second half of the 1990s (Table 1).

    In the first four years of the new century, despite two bad monsoon years (2001 and 2002), AP's
economy has grown at a 4.7% annual rate. During this period, the agriculture sector had a negative
growth of 0.8% (Table 1). The services and industrial (mainly manufacturing) sectors have grown
significantly in recent years largely due to the improved investment climate in the state.1 AP has sustained
double-digit growth in the information technology sector, including business process outsourcing and
other business-related services.

    Notwithstanding this progress, AP is still predominantly rural, and one of the poorer states of India.
While poverty has been reduced nation-wide, in 1999-00, the most recent year for which data are
available, 21.6 percent of the population was below the poverty line in AP, against the national average of
22.2 percent. In 1993-94, 26.2 percent of the population was below the poverty line, against the national
average of 29.1.




1 By most accounts, AP is now among the states with one of the best investment climates and the largest recipients
of foreign direct investment in India. A survey done by the World Bank and the Confederation of Indian Industries
in 2000 (and repeated in 2003) found that AP had the third best investment climate among major Indian states.

     National and state elections (including in AP) were held in May 2004. In AP, after two consecutive
five-year terms, the regional Telugu Desam party was defeated and the national Congress party formed
the state government.2 The direction of reforms in AP remains largely unchanged, but the pace has
slackened since the new government took over after the May 2004 State Assembly elections. The new
government has put more emphasis on agriculture and irrigation to improve the welfare of the rural poor.3

3.b. Description of the operation

     The shared commitment to poverty reduction is the basis for the long development partnership
between AP and the World Bank. With a lending portfolio (net commitments) of roughly US$1 billion,
AP currently has the second largest Bank program among Indian states. In the last several years, the Bank
has financed a variety of state specific investment projects--including rural poverty, rural roads and state
highways, health, child nutrition, forestry, irrigation, and power projects. The Bank's engagement in
Andhra Pradesh also has a major non-lending, technical assistance component, which has led to various
pieces of analytical work aimed at helping the state address complicated policy issues.

     In support of the state's ongoing reform program, a structural adjustment loan--the Andhra Pradesh
Economic Reform Loan 1 (APERL 1) --was approved in March, 2002, with a credit/loan amount of $250
million (plus an additional $100 million from DFID, UK). In recognition of further reform progress, a
second loan/credit (APERL 2) was approved in February 2004 for $220 million (plus an additional $100
million from DFID, UK). Assuming the continued success of AP's reform efforts, two more adjustment
operations are envisaged over the next three to four years.

     While these operations generally support the medium-term reform program of the State, each
operation provides financial support on the basis of progress made against a set of monitorable actions
that were identified in the previous loan. More specifically, APERL 2 funding was in recognition of
GoAP's satisfactory completion of a set of 14 main indicative actions that were outlined in APERL 1.
These actions originated from a program that had three main components: (i) fiscal reform, (ii) public
expenditure management reform, and (iii) governance and public management reform.

     Looking ahead, the APERL 2 program document has outlined a similar set of measures that will
underpin a decision to process the third loan.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

     Andhra Pradesh has made steady progress on its economic and social reform program that started in
1999. A few key components of this reform program are supported by the Bank through the APERLs.
The State was able to meet the key fiscal targets for 2001-02 and 2002-03 laid out in its Medium Term
Fiscal Reform Program. There has also been substantial progress in strengthening public expenditure
management and financial accountability. Governance reforms have continued to move forward with
impressive performance in Government of Andhra Pradesh initiatives like e-governance. Until the new
government took over in May 2004, the public enterprise reform program had also made considerable
progress.

     In a few areas, most notably in the power sector, however, the implementation of the program has
fallen short of the steps envisaged. Financial performance of the sector continues to be a major concern
due to the inability of the government to take corrective, albeit politically difficult, steps. Development of
better targeted and more effective ways of improving rural livelihoods have been difficult and the state
continues to provide highly subsidized (or, to some segments, free) electricity. In addition to the shortfalls


2In India, very few incumbent governments have won two or more consecutive assembly elections.
3It is seeking assistance from the Bank for a new irrigation project.

in the power sector reform program, there were some components of the governance reform program,
where the pace could have been faster.

    The following paragraphs provide a brief description of the achievements of APERL 2 under the three
reform clusters.

4.a. Fiscal reform (including the financial performance of the power sector)

    A review of the fiscal reform program indicates that there has been a commitment in the last several
of years to achieving aggregate fiscal discipline. An important measure of this commitment is the
adoption of and adherence to the Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) showing that the Department
of Finance has been serious about tailoring expenditures to incoming revenues. In both 2001-02 and
2002-03--the first two years of the MTFF--targets for all deficit measures were met. When revenues fell
below estimates during the course of the year (for a variety of reasons including a shortfall in transfers
from the Government of India), expenditures were adjusted to meet deficit targets. Despite some slippage
during the election year (2003-04), the new government has placed a heavy emphasis on fiscal prudence.

    The new government took office in the second month of the 2004-05 fiscal year, on a platform
focused on providing more government assistance to the rural poor, in particular by providing electricity
to farmers free of charge, who use it to run pump-sets for irrigation. The fiscal impact of the financial
support needed by the power sector as a result is reflected in the consolidated deficit (Table 2).

    As described below, the GoAP revised its power policy in January 2005, seeking to contain the fiscal
burden of growing agricultural power consumption through better targeting (expanding the metering of
power consumption and charging some farmers for power). In addition, the overall fiscal policy stance
has been good, with strong revenue performance projected, as well as deficits that continue to show a
downward trend (Table 2 and Figure 1). The 2004-05 fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 3.4 percent of
GSDP, compared with 4.6 percent the previous year, and an MTFF target of 4.1 percent. In 2004-05, the
GoAP expects to generate a small primary surplus for the first time in over a decade.

    Expenditure composition: Progress on improving the composition of spending has been mixed.
Expenditure on primary health and education rose slightly from 2.0 percent of GSDP in 2002-03 to 2.2
percent of GSDP projected in 2004-05, but this increase is smaller than had been anticipated in the
MTFF, which targeted an increase to 2.5 percent of GSDP in 2004-05. Moreover, there have been cases
where allocated social expenditures have not been released on time. The projections for 2004-05,
however, show protected maintenance expenditures and increased capital outlays as compared to the
MTFF.

    Power Sector: In the power sector, AP has implemented major structural, regulatory and governance
reforms during the last four years, yielding many positive outcomes. There have been improvements in
the access, availability and quality of power.4 Yet, like in most Indian states, improving the financial

4About 3000 MWs of new generation capacity has been added in the state's power system since 1999 (an increase
of 40 percent), resulting in improved availability of power. Electricity access rate has increased to 67 percent. Power
supply quality indicators have improved - reduction in transformer failures, improvements in voltages, and reduction
in supply interruptions. Customer Care Centers for handling commercial complaints, help-lines for lodging technical
and commercial complaints, and developing customer databases have also positively influenced utility-customer
interface and contributed to improvements in service quality


                                                          5

performance of the power sector in AP continues to be a major challenge. This is mainly because of the
political economy difficulties of raising the electricity tariff on agricultural consumers or reducing the
hours of supply. Moreover, state-wide droughts over the past several years have substantially lowered
hydro-power generation (a much cheaper option than thermal generation) and have increased electricity
demand for pumped irrigation.

    In 2000-01 and 2001-02, the power sector incurred financial losses of about Rs.3000 crore, which
placed an enormous strain on the state's finances. Thereafter, significant efforts were made to contain
such losses by curtailing theft, controlling agricultural supply within the limits of the government's
policy, improving efficiency, and rationalizing tariffs for industrial consumers. The state recovered well
from these difficult circumstances and reduced power sector losses by about 40 percent from Rs.2936
crore in 2001-02 to Rs.1982 crore in 2002-03 (see Table 3, below). This performance was laudable given
that the drought worsened in 2002-03. Cost recovery from tariffs increased from 67 percent in 2000-2001
to 87 percent in 2002-2003.

    Notwithstanding these efforts, the state has not been able to tackle the politically difficult twin issues
of metering and low tariffs in the agriculture sector, which impose high risks and makes any
improvements in the sector's financial performance vulnerable. The new AP government implemented
one of its main election promises of free electricity to farmers immediately after coming to power in May
2004.

    The new AP government is committed to supporting agriculture-based rural growth and employment,
and in this regard, the provision of low cost power is considered essential. However, the increasing strains
on the budget, the supply system, and the receding water table have convinced the GoAP to take
mitigating steps which amount to better targeting of the subsidy program.

    Between November 2004 and January 2005, the GoAP held consultations with key stakeholders to
determine how best to make power supply more affordable to farmers without undue strain on the budget.
Drawing on these consultations, the GoAP announced a revised power policy on January 25, 2005, which
aims to restrict the supply of free power to farming families who do not have access to the state's
irrigation system and who are dependent on agriculture as their primary source of income (though most
non-poor/non-marginal farmers will continue to benefit from heavily discounted power tariffs). The
GoAP is also seeking to establish demand side incentives to encourage the efficient use of power.
Implementation of this revised policy--which will start on April 1, 2005--however, remains a challenge.

4.b. Public expenditure management reform

    AP's Fiscal Reform Strategy Paper lays out a comprehensive budgetary and financial management
reform program. These reforms, critical in strengthening the link between public spending, service
delivery and development outcomes, have been supported by the APERLs. With assistance from the Bank
and DFID, the GoAP undertook a State Financial Accountability Assessment in 2003. This assessment,
with full ownership of the government, had several recommendations to improve public expenditure
management and financial accountability. The state is continuing to implement these recommendations.

     As part of the reform program, the State (i) established effective fiscal control mechanisms and a
credible budget, (ii) strengthened line department's political engagement, flexibility, performance
orientation, and participation in the budget process, (iii) increased transparency in budgets and out-turns,
(iv) improved the predictability of within-year funds flow to line departments, and (v) bolstered the
compliance of spending departments with the basic accounting requirements.

     Following a temporary pause associated with the elections and changes in key personnel, the
implementation of the financial management and accountability reforms has regained momentum. There
has been good progress on a broad range of issues, including strengthening internal controls, building
local government financial accountability, and preparing a fiscal responsibility bill.

4.c. Governance and public management

    AP has a broad agenda of governance reforms, encompassing the overall machinery of government as
well as more specific issues like pay and employment, human resource management and development,
transparency and citizen orientation, and anticorruption. The government continues to make good
progress in implementing reforms in core areas, including "e­governance," capacity building, and
focusing on citizen centric processes. Progress is also being made in deepening reforms and simplifying
procedures in line departments and in cross cutting areas such as human resource management and anti­
corruption. The structures needed to support reform processes are becoming institutionalized, as
exemplified by the establishment of the Centre for Good Governance (CGG), the General Administration
Department, and the Strategy and Performance Innovation Units (SPIUs) in selected departments. The
CGG has performed well in the areas of financial accountability, citizens' charters, on line monitoring
tools, and anti-corruption.

    E-Governance. The State's e-Seva program, which provides many government services
electronically, continues to go from strength to strength. Built on the success of a pilot project, there are
now (in 2005) 45 e-Seva centers (with 400 service counters) in major towns and municipalities in the
state. These centers are a one-stop-shop for more than 130 government-to-consumer and business-to-
consumer services including payment of utility bills; getting birth and death certificates, vehicle permits,



                                                      7

driving licenses; transport department services; telephone connections and bill payments; receipt of
complaints or requests in connection with citizen services. Plans are also underway to bring the benefits
of electronic governance to rural areas through the use of kiosks.

    Civil Service Reform. The GoAP's civil service reform agenda covers topics ranging from pay and
employment, to reforming the machinery of government, to improving performance orientation. While
the number of civil servants per capita in AP has historically been high for Indian states, over the past
couple of years the government has made progress in reducing the size of the civil service and controlling
the growth of the wage bill.

    Anticorruption. The State also took some promising steps in developing an innovative anticorruption
strategy focusing on prevention, prosecution and public relations. A number of Government Orders were
passed, such as making suspension mandatory for officers caught in entrapment cases, prohibiting officers
from being routinely released on bail until the completion of the investigation, and attaching
disproportionate assets acquired through illegal means to the court. As a result, between 2001 and 2003,
the number of entrapment cases rose by 71 percent, the number of disproportionate assets cases went up
by 83 percent, and the number of disproportionate assets seized in these raids increased by a 154 percent.
The number of convictions increased by 115 percent; the number of dismissals from service increased by
25 percent; and the number of gazetted and non-gazetted officers booked increased by 25 and 68 percent,
respectively. The performance of the Vigilance Enforcement Department also shows significant positive
improvements in many areas. There was a strong improvement in the detection of revenue leakage,
leading to a 31 percent increase in realized revenue in 2001-02.

    The Government is in the process of developing a second phase of its governance reform program.
Recognizing that reform needs to be embedded within line departments, this new strategy will focus on
re-engineering systems and processes in key line departments including urban development, health,
finance, irrigation and agriculture. SPIUs have been set up in these departments to serve as think tanks
and each department will produce reform action plans. Many of these SPIUs' have already begun
producing quality outputs.

    Promoting Investment Climate. Progress has also been made in areas such as administrative
deregulation to promote private sector growth. The "Industrial Single Window Clearance Act No. 17"
was enacted in 2002 to expedite the processing and issuance of various approvals, clearances and
permissions required for setting up industrial undertakings in the state. In August 2003, 94 percent of
large and medium industries and 82 percent of small-scale industries received approvals within the
prescribed time limit. Simplification of inspection procedures, prepared by the Confederation of Indian
Industry and Pricewaterhouse-Coopers, were outlined in a Government Order in August 2002.

    Monitoring Poverty and Undertaking Related Actions. The Poverty and Social Analysis Monitoring
Unit (PSAMU) has now become an organization partly fulfilling the research needs of the Society for
Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP). It still needs to establish itself as a policy advisory body and as a
data bank for the state. It is currently working on the "People's Report on Poverty," which is envisaged as
a series of short reports/pamphlets on various themes related to poverty and social/human development--
meant to foster a broader understanding of these issues. On the monitoring and updating aspects, the
PSAMU has established a partial baseline for indicators that are to be monitored, but they have not been
updated. In its latest annual Economic Survey, the GoAP included a chapter on poverty and employment.

    Reforming Public Enterprises. There has been a marked slowdown in the pace of the public enterprise
(PE) reform program, as the new government reviews the initiative. Phase II of the program was started
by the previous government in 2002, and involved 68 enterprises that were to be addressed over a five-
year period. Of these, 30 enterprises were closed/privatized/restructured in 2002-03 and 2003-04, but the
program did not move forward in 2004-05. The new government maintains that only loss making
enterprises will be restructured, and that assessments of the firms' financial performance need to be
updated before proceeding with further PE reforms. The Government has reiterated its commitment to the



                                                      8

general principles and direction of the PE reform program, but the pace at which it will move forward
remains to be seen.

    The overall APERL 2 program objectives (actions specified in APERL 1 as indicative for APERL 2,
listed with measurable indicators) and the outputs/outcomes achieved are noted in Appendix A.

4.d. Ratings for Outcome, Sustainability and Institutional Development

    The outcome of APERL 2 is rated satisfactory on the basis of the objectives and outputs achieved as
described in the above sub-sections. Sustainability of the reform measures is rated likely. While the pace
of reform slowed during the transition period of the new government taking office, the direction of the
overall reform program remains largely unchanged. The programs of (i) public expenditure and financial
management, (ii) governance, and (iii) regulatory reforms in the power sector indicate that the structures
needed to support reform processes are becoming institutionalized. As a result, institutional development
is rated strong.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

    Research and experience suggest that reform programs are much more likely to succeed when there is
strong country ownership. External agencies such as the Bank can then help facilitate the process by
providing technical and financial support. The AP experience clearly confirms this conclusion. For
example, in the case of AP's public expenditure management and financial accountability reforms, the
State Financial Accountability Assessment was done under the overall guidance of the Department of
Finance (with funds and consultants provided by a development partner, and Bank assistance in drafting
the work agenda), and the resulting reform program was owned by the Department of Finance. On the
other hand, the client ownership of the medium-term expenditure report in the health sector (funded and
carried out by another development partner) was weak. While the report identified several important
technical issues, very little progress has been made in implementing the resulting reform agenda.

    One factor that has continued to constrain the otherwise good progress on reform implementation is
political difficulty of metering and tariff-setting for farm electricity consumption. In turn, this has strong
implications for the overall fiscal situation of the state. During the past several years, a number of
laudable reform actions in the power sector--including curtailing theft, controlling agricultural supply
within the limits of the government's policy, improving efficiency by reducing transmission and
distribution losses, and rationalizing tariffs for industrial consumers--have been taken. But when it comes
to metering agricultural electricity consumption, reducing overall government support, and targeting
subsidies to poor farmers, governments continue to face strong political opposition. Only new agriculture
consumers and horticulture consumers are metered on a regular basis. Before the announcement in May
2004 that farmers would not be charged for electricity consumption, tariffs for agriculture in AP were the
lowest among all Indian states and had not been revised for the previous three years.

Looking forward

    The financial impact of free electricity to farmers has yet to be assessed. It is quite likely that the
trend of falling power sector losses over the last three years will be reversed in 2004-05 (Table 2). This is
due to the combined effect of no cost recovery from farmers, and increased consumption by the farm
community. The latter is resulting from a big jump in unauthorized agricultural pump set connections.

    The recent (January 2005) change in the electricity policy which limits free power to poor and needy
farmers is a step in the right direction. It remains to be seen how soon farm consumption can be metered
and how effectively the targeting is enforced.

    Another area where the program implementation could suffer concerns the public enterprise reform
agenda. During the last eight months, there has been very little progress. The new government's attitude


                                                        9

towards the private sector, public-private partnerships, out-sourcing, and the like, is favorable. The
direction of policy and reform appears to be largely unchanged, even if the speed of reform has slowed.
The authorities have reassured the Bank on this.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

    The Bank's lending performance is rated satisfactory on the basis of the following criteria:

    o The operation was processed after the Bank team was convinced that the state's reform program
         moved forward satisfactorily and that key milestones had been achieved.

    o The operation was consistent with the existing India CAS (a new CAS was approved by the
         Board in September 2004) which focuses Bank engagement on states that have demonstrated a
         commitment to broad-based reforms, particularly in the areas of fiscal management, power sector
         reforms, and governance.

    o The loan was based on information from a number of Bank reports as well as those done by the
         GoAP and DFID. These documents provided the necessary analytical background information to
         help design the loan.

    The Borrower's performance is also rated satisfactory. The medium term reform program, supported
by the past two operations, has been designed and owned by the state. The road map to attain the GoAP's
goals of economic growth, human capital development, and poverty reduction has been laid out in a series
of strategy papers. The existence of this vision and the associated road map meant that government
officials were well prepared for the project. Many of these reform activities were being carried out
independently by the GoAP. In the Bank and DFID, the government found willing facilitators of the
reform program who were able to provide technical and financial assistance. Most importantly, all along
the process there was a strong demand from the state leadership, helping to facilitate processing.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

    The Bank (with DFID) has processed two operations in support of AP's ongoing reform program, and
two more operations are to be processed over the next three to four years, depending on continued
progress in implementing reforms and the agreement of all concerned parties (Government of India,
Government of Andhra Pradesh, and the World Bank).

    As noted above, there has been a slowdown in the pace of reforms since the new government took
over in May 2004. Two components of the APERL supported reform program--charging for electricity
used by farmers and public enterprise reform program--have suffered. But other gains of the program
have continued. Despite some slippage during the election year (2003-04), the new government continues
to emphasize fiscal prudence and has achieved good results. Governance and public financial
management reform agenda continues to move forward. The pro-farmer and pro-rural tilt in the new
government's policy is quite visible. As part of its program to enhance the access of the poor to land,
155,000 acres of land were distributed to poor, landless groups in January 2005. Overall, the direction of
the overall reform program remains largely unchanged.

    Looking ahead, the APERL 2 program details a set of actions in eight key areas that are indicative for
a future APERL 3. These actions would need to be largely met before the operation can go forward. A
Bank team visited Hyderabad in January, 2005 to review progress on AP's reform program. The team
noted that overall reform progress in AP has been mixed. It reached an understanding with the GoAP to
continue moving forward with the reform agenda.

     A Bank mission is planned to visit Hyderabad in May 2005 to continue the engagement and the
supervision of the APERL supported medium-term reform program. Subject to clearance by the
Government of India, the Bank would also start its preparatory work for a possible third adjustment
operation during this mission.

8. Partner Comments

8.a. Cofinancier (Comments from DFID, U.K.)

     DFID co-financed APERL with a grant of £55 million. This was a second tranche of assistance. The
first tranche of £65 million was provided in March 2002, alongside the World Bank's assistance of $250
million. In addition, DFID has provided technical assistance to power sector reform, public enterprise
reform, governance reform and poverty monitoring and analysis.

     DFID considers that the Government of Andhra Pradesh has made good progress on the reform
programme supported by this assistance. Substantive gains were seen in a number of areas. The progress
on public enterprise reform and improving public expenditure management were particularly noteworthy,
and the reducing of the power sector financing requirement by more than a third was exceptional.
However, despite this overall good performance, there were shortfalls in a few key areas which led to a
reduction in donor assistance provided. Of particular concern to DFID were the less than anticipated
increases in spending on primary education and primary health, and the slower progress on developing
and implementing an anti-corruption strategy.

     DFID welcomes the direction in which the programme has evolved. Dialogue between government
and donors has led to a better structure, which gives more priority to poverty reduction, economic growth
and structural reforms in power sector, education and health. Reducing the number of triggers, focusing
on those most critical to the reform process, was also helpful. Improving the poverty focus of the overall
programme remains a challenge to ensure that the actions agreed between government and partners are
the most important for bringing about sustained poverty reduction in AP. The new Andhra Pradesh
government has signaled a strong focus on tackling poverty, particularly in rural areas, and this offers an
opportunity for a renewed effort to consider measures which will allow the government to address
poverty more effectively.

     As well as the content of the programme, DFID considers that the quality of the dialogue between
government and representatives of the Bank and DFID improved. More consideration was given to the
specification of the triggers in this operation, with them having a greater level of ownership across
government. Working relationships between Bank and DFID teams have been very good, with high levels
of collaboration, and joint documentation produced. DFID particularly welcomes the professional
expertise that the Bank staff brings to bear on the discussions.

     The Government of India has asked DFID to focus its future assistance on health, education, rural
development and tackling urban poverty. DFID will therefore not be providing further financial assistance
in support of this reform programme, as anticipated in the project document. DFID recognizes the
continuing importance of making progress on the issues contained in this reform programme of the
Government of Andhra Pradesh, and will continue to provide technical assistance in areas agreed with the
government.
