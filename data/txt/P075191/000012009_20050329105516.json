The experience of\n            this project suggests that there has been a slowdown in the\n            pace of reforms since the new government took over in May\n            2004. Two components of the project supported reform\n            program-charging for electricity used by farmers, and public\n            enterprise reform program-have suffered. But other program\n            gains continued. Despite some slippage during the election\n            year (2003-04), the new government continues to emphasize\n            fiscal prudence, and has achieved good results. Governance,\n            and the public financial management reform agenda continues\n            to move forward. The pro-farmer and pro-rural tilt in the\n            new government's policy is quite visible: as part of\n            its program to enhance the access of the poor to land, some\n            155,000 acres of land were distributed to poor and landless\n            groups in January 2005. By and large, the direction of the\n            overall reform program remains unchanged. Looking ahead, the\n            program details a set of actions in eight key areas that are\n            indicative for a future third operation, whose actions would\n            need to be largely met before the operation can move\n            forward, and, it was noted that overall reform progress in\n            Andhra Pradesh has been mixed. An understanding with the\n            Government of Andhra Pradesh was reached to strongly pursue\n            the reform agenda."}, "docdt": "2005-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
