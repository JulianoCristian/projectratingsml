                        six components: (i)    improving poverty monitoring and pro-poor policy
                        formulation and implementation, (ii)  implementing structural measures to
                        foster economic growth, (iii)restructuring and privatizing public
                        enterprises, (iv) improving fiscal discipline, the composition o f spending,

Benefits              : Inprovidingfurther support for the verymeaningfulreformprogramofthe

                        and will facilitate the state's next steps towards achieving better
                        socioeconomic outcomes and reducing poverty. More specifically, the
                        benefits expected from APERL 2 include: (a) improvement in the state's
                        investment climate through increased competition in agriculture and
                        greater labor market flexibility, (b) fiscal savings from further public
                        enterprise reform, (c) improved delivery o f public services as a result o f
                        public expenditure, financial management and governance reforms, and (d)
                        freed up resources for other development priorities from the continued
                        curtailment o fpower sector losses.

Risks                 : The major risks stem from: (a) a tightening o ffiscal targets inthe next few
                        years, leaving very little room for slackness, (b) the difficult issues o f
                        agriculture metering and low tariffs for power, posing financial risks, (c)
                        vulnerability to external shocks, such as poor monsoons, impinging on
                        overall growth, and (d) inherent risk o f changes in policy priorities as a
                        result o f elections due in2004.

                                                 A.      INTRODUCTION

1.     During the last two country assistance strategy cycles, an important component o f the Bank's
approach inIndia has been to focus on states that have demonstrated a commitment to broadbasedreforms,
particularly in the areas o f fiscal management, power sector administration, and governance.'              Together
with other external agencies, the Bank has adopted the logic o f selectivity and has focused on a small
number o f states, promoting their reform programs through a mix o f lending instruments, such as
adjustment and investment loans, and non-lending support in the form o f analytic work and technical
assistance.
2.     One o f India's leading reforming states, Andhra Pradesh (AP) has had a long and productive
relationship with the Bank. As part of its support to the Government o f Andhra Pradesh's medium-term
reform program, the Bank approved its first adjustment operation-the             Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform
Loan (APERL)--in March 2002 for US$250 million. The United Kingdom Department for International
Development (DFID), co-financed the operation with an additional E65 million (roughly US$lOO million).
Envisaged as the first in a series o f Structural Adjustment Loans (SALS), APERL 1 called for 14 up front
actions that were completed in early 2002, and outlined a set o f key indicative actions for a follow-up
second operation.
3.     These actions have been completed:             and this Program Document (PD) lays out the APERL 2
program. Section B.briefly describes the political and economic situation inIndia and provides the context
for this operation. Section C. summarizes the overall development progress and challenges in AP. Section
D.reports on AP's medium-term reform program supported by APERLs. Section E. outlines the Bank's
assistance strategy in AP and Section F. discusses the proposed APERL 2 operation. Looking ahead to
possible future adjustment operations, Section G. details a set o f key actions for APERL 3. Subject to
agreement among all concerned parties (Government o f India [GoI], Government o f Andhra Pradesh
[GoAP], the World Bank and DFID), APERL 3 is expected to be processed in late 2004 or early 2005.
Finally, Section H. details the lessons learned, and the benefits and risks o f both the AP program and the
Bank operation.

4.      Thepoliticalsituation. The present central government is a 24-party coalition and has been inoffice
since September 1999. Although the reform pace has been slow, the need for reform i s broadly accepted
across the political spectrum.        Different ruling parties in a number o f states are also pursuing reform
programs. Reforms in some states outpace those o f the central government, and several state governments
have shown considerable determination in backing reforms in the face o f opposition and strikes. India i s
entering into a period o f elections at both the state and national level. Elections were held in four states in
December 2003, and national and several state elections (including inAP) are due in2004.
5.      The economic situation. India has made significant progress inimproving the living standards o f its
citizens since launching wide-ranging economic reforms in 1991. Real GDP growth averaged 5.8 percent
duringthe 1990s, and poverty fell significantly, though the degree o f decline is debated. India is expected
to register growth o f around 6.8 percent in2003-04. After slow and uneven growth (4.3 percent) last year,

 The most recent India Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board on April 5, 2001. The CAS Progress
Report, which endorsesthis strategy, was discussedby the Boardon December 5,2002. Preparationfor anew CAS for a four year
period-2004-05 to 2007-08-has beenstarted and is expectedto becompletedby February2004.

due in part to a bad drought resulting in negative agncultural growth, growth i s expected to pick up this
year with a better monsoon and continued industrial recovery. The service sector has remained the main
source of growth while growth inthe industrial sector has slowed down since the late 1990s. Medium-term
growth prospects in India depend critically on the pace o f structural reform and fiscal consolidation.

IV report) argue that the current rate o f reforms and growth put at risk the achievement o f the 10th Five
Year Plan (2002-07) target o f 8 percent average GDP growth and poverty reduction from 26 percent in
2000 to 21 percent by 2007 and to 11percent by 2012. Accelerating India's economic growth will require
considerable improvements in infrastructure and the investment climate, along with improvements in
health, education and other services to set India on a higher growth trajectory.
6.      Fiscal consolidation remains elusive, and India's debt to GDP ratio continues to increase. The recent
passage o f the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill, which mandates the elimination o f the
fiscal current account deficit o f the central government by March 31,2008, i s an encouraging development.
Nevertheless, further efforts will be needed to address fiscal imbalances both at the center and inthe states.
Inspite ofthe highfiscal deficit, India's vulnerability to an external crisis is presently limitedby its large
reserves, equivalent to 15 months of imports, and its low level o f external public debt. Boththe capital and
the current account are in surplus on the back o f strong remittances and exports in services. Interest rates
are currently low, butthere is a risk that an increase ininterest rates, both internationally and inIndia, could
significantly raise the Government's debt service burden.                    The high fiscal deficit in India i s also
accompanied by a poor composition o f expenditure, with payments for wages, pensions, interest, and
subsidies crowding out capital and maintenance spending.                     Reorienting central government spending
towards public investment and maintenance will be necessary for developing infrastructure and
accelerating growth.
7.      Fiscal strengthening at the state level will also be crucial to fostering growth and infrastructure
development. Roughly 40 percent o f the combined center-state fiscal deficit stems from the deficits o f the
state governments. Inthe last few years, several state governments-AP,                   Karnataka, Maharashtra, among
othershave come forward with well-defined medium-term fiscal reform agendas primarily aimed at
reducing fiscal deficits to a sustainable level. A number o f states have also developed elaborate plans to
reform their power sectors, which have been draining their treasuries due to a variety o fproblems including
high transmission and distribution losses, and low metering and tariffs in the agricultural sector. The
reforming state governments have signed memoranda o funderstanding with the central government and are
receiving funds in support o f their reform programs. GoI's efforts to provide additional incentives for
broad reaching reform programs have generally worked well. Inthis vein, the new "Structural Adjustment
Assistance Facility" was created, under which state governments can approach the central government and
request funding from multilateral institutions in support o f fiscal and other structural policy reforms. To
ensure transparency, and equal access for all states, Go1has recently issued a set of guidelines on SALS.^
Finalized inDecember 2002, these guidelines emphasize that any state seelung S A L assistance shouldhave
a multi-year reformprogram for sustainablepoverty reductionthat:

     Aims at generating primary and revenue surpluses and limits the consolidated fiscal deficit to less than
     3 percent over a medium-term (3-5 years);
     Includes a sustainable program for subsidy elimination or containment, especially inthe power sector;
     Reforms civil services including reducingthe administrative costs o f governance; and
     Reforms public sector enterprises.
        The Guidelines also state that "An overall focus on poverty reduction and sector specific parameters
(infrastructure, education, etc.), which are ingredients o f MDGs,should also be reflected in-the action

9.      AP is the fifth largest state inIndia with a population o f 76 million. Predominantlyrural and one o f
the poorer states, AP's per capita income was about US$382 in 1999, which is about 86 percent o f the
national average (US$446 in 1999). In 1999-00,21.6 percent o f the population inAP-against          the national
average o f 22.2 percent-lived      below the poverty line.
10.     Inthe early 1990s, AP wasseenasaneconomically andsociallybackwardstateinIndia, particularly
incomparison with other states in South India. More than halfof the state's population was illiterate and
the state ranked 26th out o f 32 StatesLJnion Territories in literacy.           Levels o f education across the
population were also the lowest among Indian states. On key health indicators-infant               mortality, for
instance-AP      lagged behind the national average.         Economic growth was positive but lower than the
national average. Poverty had declined, but the decline was less impressive when compared to other states.
Not only was AP lagging behind in development, it had no vision or strategy to catch-up with other more
progressive states.
11. The situation changed in the mid-1990s. The Indian economy, with a strong push from the central
government, had already embarked on a market-oriented reformprogram. In 1999 GoAP articulated a far-
reaching vision for economic and social development through the Vision 2020 doc~ment.~During this
process, AP became the first Indian state to put together a strategy for comprehensive development and a
complementary reform agenda. The Vision 2020 document i s a statement o f intent to pursue economic
growth, develop human capital, and reduce poverty. It also specifies targets, similar to the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), including growth o f real GSDP over the period 1995-2020 at an ambitious
average annual rate o f 10.3 percent, total literacy by 2010 (later advanced to 2005), universal enrollment in
primary school with an increase inthe completion rate from 60 to 90 percent by 2005, a reduction in infant
mortality to 10 per 1,000 (live births), and the provision o f primary and secondary healthcare to all,
especially to the poor and vulnerable. Poverty eradication and improvements in social welfare are listed as
the main development themes, and better governance i s recognized as being a critical factor indevelopment
and for achievingthese goals.
 12.    This vision has been laid out ina series o f sixteen sector strategy papers that were prepared between
 1999 and 2001.5 A P ' s overall medium-term development strategy has two main objectives: (i)       eradicating
poverty and focusing on human development; and (ii)accelerating economic growth.                   The goals o f
eradicating poverty and accelerating human development are to be achieved through direct interventions
(for example, the pro-poor Velugu program), buildingthe capabilities o f the poor and disadvantaged groups
(by improving literacy and health), empowering wamen (addressing gender inequalities in education and
increasing gender-sensitivity in health programs), and by accelerating pro-poor growth.               The State
Government wants to transform its role inthe economy from beingprimarily a controller o f the economy to
becoming a facilitator and catalyst o f growth. To this end, GoAP wants to reform public enterprises and
focus its attention on those sectors o f the economy for which there i s a clear role for the state, leaving
others largely to market forces. Progress towards these twin objectives requires that the state be ina sound
fiscal position. According to AP's fiscal reform strategy, restoration o f the state's fiscal health i s to be
achieved by (i)   reforming and restructuring the power sector to reduce the drain on public resources, (ii)
containing the growth o f the public wage bill and improving the targeting o f subsidies and transfers, and
(iii)reforming the revenue system by introducing a Value Added Tax. Finally, AP wants to strengthen
governance by mahng government SMART (Simple, Moral, Accountable, Responsive, Transparent).

13.    To implement these strategies, GoAP has initiated reforms on several fronts: fiscal consolidation,
better governance, power sector restructuring, emphasis on primary education and health, privatization o f
public enterprises, reduction in the administrative and regulatory burden for firms, creation o f new
infrastructure, and social mobilization through the formation o f self-help groups.                    Sectoral targets and
actual performance are monitored quarterly and the implementation o f these strategies i s continuously
updated.
14.    With its reform agenda gaining momentum, the image o f AP as a backward state began to change.
Many o f these reforms have started to produce encouraging results and the state has begun to bridge the
wide development gap that existed between AP and more developed Indian states. Ina 2003 ranking o f the
best and the worst states inwhich to live and work-the               first o f its lund-the   India Today magazine rated
AP as the "Fastest Mover" in the 1990s. The positive impact o f good policies on outcomes, especially in
the second half o f the 1990s, is well documented on both social and economic fronts. The following
paragraphs describe AP's progress and future challenges inmajor social and economic areas:

(i) Povertyhasbeenreducedandsocialindicatorshaveimproved,butthepaceofchangeremains

15.    Most recent estimates suggest that poverty has declined inthe 1990s(Table 1).6

16.    Between the early and late 1990s, AP experienced a 39 percent increase in literacy, a 32 percent
increase in the proportion of births attended by a health professional, and a 24 percent increase in the
proportion of the population with access to safe drinhng water. The state has also been particularly
successful inincreasing the number o f children enrolled in school. Duringthe 1990s, the school enrollment
of 6-10 year-olds grew by 12 percentage points-from                     73 to 85 percent. According to the GoAP's
education department, the level o f enrollment reached 96 percent in 2002 following a strong public
campaign. GoAP has also recognized child labor as a significant factor constraining progress towards its
development goals, and i s addressing it through a number of actions.
17.    As a result o f these improvements, AP's human development index, which is a weighted average of
poverty and human development outcomes, has progressed. While the state's performance remains below
the national average and the rate o f its progress still needs to be accelerated, AP has done well, registeringa
40 percent increase inthe development index over a 20-year period (Table 2).




 There i s controversy about poverty numbers in India. Official head-count numbers, released by the Planning Commission of
India for the country as well as for states, show a steeper decline in overall poverty. The numbers reported in Table 1 are the
"adjusted" head-count estimates preparedby Deaton and Dreze. For more information on the numbers, see the Andhra Pradesh
PovertyNote, World Bank (2003).

18.      Future challenges. AP's development challenges can be seen from the progress that it has made in
achieving the MDGs.' Data on AP's progress, where available, are listed inTable 3.
19.      AP is likely to achieve some of the MDGtargets. Halving the proportion o f people suffering fi-om
extreme poverty and hunger i s possible by 2015 if AP i s able to sustain the achievements o f the 1990s.
Although poverty has declined in AP (Table l), reduction i s smaller than in other Indian states,
                                                                 the
particularly when compared with the other Southern states o f Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and the pace o f
poverty reduction has been relatively slower inrural areas. Inorder to meet its poverty reduction goals, the
challenge for AP i s to improve the access o f the poor to credit and social services (particularly, health and
education), especially in rural areas.              GoAP's strategy for rural poverty reduction focuses on direct
measures and targeted programs, and the main program i s Velugu (means Eternal Light). It seeks to raise
rural income by widening access to non-farm employment opportunities and improving access to financial
ixsources.* The success of this program will be key to reducingrural poverty.




 Since their launch at the Millennium Summit held in New York in September 2000, the MDGs have become a widely accepted
benchmark for measuring development progress.           The MDGs set selected quantitative targets for poverty reduction and
improvement invarious aspects o f welfare from their 1990 levels that should be achieved by 2015. There are eight broad goals and
a selected list of indicators to monitor progress towards each o f them. The gth goal deals with developing global partnerships for
development, and is not reported here because it i s more applicable at the country rather than the state level.
* The Bank has supported the Velugu program through two lending operations. The first was a $111 million district poverty
initiatives project that was approved in 2000. The second operation is a $150 million rural poverty reduction project that was
approved in 2003.

20.     The goal o f universal primary enrollment by 2015 i s likely to be met, but achieving the targeted
completion and retentionrates will be a challenge. There has been progress towards gender equality in the
labor market and in education-but                   targeted interventions are clearly necessary in order to eliminate the
gender gap in education. Despite its recent efforts inimproving school enrollments, the state continues to
lag behind other states in literacy and education outcomes. According to the Census o f 2001, with a
literacy rate o f 61 percent, AP was ranked 28* in a group o f 35 states and Union Territories. Moreover,
there are significant disparities across location, gender, income group and social category. The state i s
makmg efforts to address these problems. In 1999, AP developed an education policy that will be updated
annually to reflect achievements and problems. GoAP is adopting several strategies to increase enrollment,
retention and completion rates, such as increasing physical access to school faculties, expanding non-
formal and bridgingprograms, providing residential schools for children living in remote areas, increasing
access to teaching and learning materials, inspecting and evaluating school and service provider
performance, and monitoring student attendance.

21.    Inthe health sector, the challenges are even bigger. The state is on track to achieve its target of
reducing maternal mortality to three-quarters o f its 1990 level by 2015, and the goal o f halving the
proportion o f people without access to safe drinlung water i s also likely to met. Despite the very clear
emphasis on health outcomes in Vision 2020 ,however, the sector lacks a clear focus on outcomes and
would benefit from a more focused strategy. The major health status indicators are worse in AP than in
comparator southern states, and in some cases improvement seems to have stalled. Meeting the goal o f
reducing child mortality rates to two-thirds o f the 1990 level by 2015 i s unlikely given the rate o f progress
to date. Though numerical targets are unclear, progress towards combating HIV/AIDS and other diseases
like tuberculosis has also been slow in the 1990s. Given that the private sector in AP now accounts for
more than two-thirds o f all institutional deliveries, two-thirds o f antenatal care, and one-third o f
immunizations, achieving the MDGs will require a strong cooperative effort involvingboth the public and
private sectors.

(ii) Economicgrowthhasincreased,thoughitremainsbelowpotential
22.    After trailing the national economy during the first half of the 1990s, AP's economy picked up
momentum in the last 5 years. Inthe second half o f the 1990s (1996-97 to 2000-Ol), AP's GSDP growth
rate exceeded the average growth rate o f the national economy (Figure 2). The strong performance o f the
services sector has been the main driver of AP's better growth performance. The success in the services
sector i s largely attributable to the sustained double-digit growth rate in information technology,

                                                               7

telecommunication, business process outsourcing, and other business-related services.                                 While AP has
consistently performed better than the national economy in the agriculture sector during the 1990s, the
difference between the two has become more pronounced in the last five years. The performance o f the
industrial sector, however, has been a major concem. Despite the fact that AP i s perceivedto have the third
best investment climate among major Indian states, the growth rate o f the industrial sector has remained
low at 5 percent, comparable to the rate achieved by the rest o f the country.

23.     Impressive performance of the agriculture sector.                     The agricultural and allied services sector
(including livestock, forestry and fishery activities) employs more than 60 percent o f the state's labor force
and i s the main source o f livelihood for most o f the rural poor. The sector grew at an average rate o f 4.8
percent per year duringthe 1996-97-2000-01                     period, substantially higher than the national growth rate for
the agncultural and allied services sector o f 2.1 percent, which was adversely impacted by droughts in
several states. This improvement inAP has been achieved inlarge part due to the increased diversification
into livestock, fisheries and highvalue horticulture, which is consistent with the goals o f Vision 2020. The
strengthened growth performance has also been facilitated by the govemment's policies to spend more
public resources on productivity-enhancing investments, mostly irrigation and rural infra~tructure.~
Moreover, in the late 1990s, GoAP lifted some key trading restrictions on agricultural commodities (i.e.
inter-state transport and storage controls). Inorder to improve the management o f water resources, GoAP
boosted the participation o f farmershsers insystems management by enacting the "Andhra PradeshFarmer
Management Irrigation Systems Act."
24.     Large volatility of agriculture growth however remains a concern. While AP economy has emerged
as a dominant agricultural force in the country inrecent years, its growth rate remains highly volatile. In
three o f the last five years-1999-00,              2001-02, and 2002-03-AP         received significantly less rains, which
adversely affected the state's agnculture growth (not including allied services o f fisheries, livestock etc.,
where the state has done much better) and had a bearing on its overall growth rate. The agriculture sector
shrunkby 6.9 and 9.0 percent in2001-02 and2002-03, respectively (Figure 3). Withnearlytwo-third ofits
population still dependent on agnculture, the large fluctuations in agricultural growth rate are likely to have
a bearing on the level o f transient poverty rate in the state and perhaps explain the slow pace o f poverty
reductioninthe state inrecent years.



  Public investments in the agricultural and allied sectors, after a decline in the early 1990s increased in real terms from Rs. 5.2
billion in 1996-97 to Rs. 8.6 billion in 2000-01 (in constant 1993-94 rupees). Duringthe period, private investments in the sector
also increased inreal terms from Rs. 6.0 to Rs. 8.1 billion. More generally, private sector investment is significantly larger than the
public sector investments in most Indian states.

25.    Improvement in the investment climate is likely to boostfuture growth rate. AP has vastly improved
its investment climate by undertaking a slew o f deregulation initiatives. A survey done by the World Bank
and the Confederation o f Indian Industries in 2000 found that AP had the third best investment climate
among major Indian states (behind Gujarat and Maharashtra). A 2003 survey by the same organizations
has reconfirmed AP's favorable investment climate.                  A 2002 survey by the National Association o f
Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) rated the capital city o f Hyderabad as the top destination
for IT enabled service businesses among eight major Indian cities. Not surprisingly, last year, Hyderabad
recorded the highest exports o f IT enabled services among all major Indian cities.                      The improved
investment climate has led to greater commitment o f investment from private investors, with the expected
future investment being significantly higher than the current level. For example, investment inprojects that
were completed between 1997-2001 made up 20 percent o f AP's GSDP. On the other hand, investments in
projects under implementation account for nearly 47 percent o f state's GSDP, the second highest ratio
among major Indian states. Once these projects are completed, the state's growth rate i s expected to get a
significant boost.
26.    Achieving the Vision 2020 growth target remains a major challenge. To achieve the Vision 2020
annual average growth target o f 10.2 percent between 1995-2020 period, GoAP will not only have to
sustain the ongoing reform program but will also have to undertake new initiatives. A recent World Bank
study has found that, low productivity growth and considerable inter-state disparity in the distribution o f
opportunities are the two important causes why AP's economy has not grown at its potential".                    To raise
productivity and improve distribution o f opportunities, especially inthe industrial sector, the state needs to
eliminate a number o f barriers, prime among them are: (i)          over-staffed and fragmented industrial firms, and
rigid labor laws, (ii) o f competitive market for agricultural produce at the wholesale level, (iii)
                          lack                                                                                      low
level of intra-state and international trade, (iv) weak implementation o f various deregulation measures, and
(v) lack o f adequate opportunities for all citizens inall regions to seize the reforms to their advantage.
27.    The government is making strong efforts to eliminate these growth barriers. Vision 2020 and the
related strategy papers focus on 18 highpotential sectors as growth engines, and work has been initiated to
remove structural impediments to growth.                  For example, in the area o f reducing administrative and
regulatory barriers for setting up private business, the government has moved aggressively. It enacted
"Industrial Single Window Clearance Act No. 17 o f 2002" to expedite the processing and issuance o f
various approvals, clearances and permissions required for setting up industrial undertakings in the state.
In August 2003, 94 percent o f large and medium industries and 82 percent o f small-scale industries
received approvals within the prescribed time limit. Proposals for the simplification o f inspection

procedures have been prepared by the Confederation o f Indian Industryand Pricewaterhouse-Coopers,and
enshned in a Govemment Order in August 2002. GoAP i s also planning to deal with the currently
inflexible industrial labor market by granting permission related to lay-offs and closures o f industrial
undertahngs, and seeks to become a pioneer inbuildinginstitutions, which help to promptly resolve labor
disputes in the state. Given that agnculture is, and will continue to be for some time, the lifeline o f its
economy, GoAP has devised plans to be a powerhouse o f Indian agriculture. Elements o f the reform
program include (a) encouraging crop diversification to enhance agricultural growth and employment; (b)
giving farmers freedom o fchoice inmarketing their produce and (c) allowing private sector participationin
the operations o f wholesale markets.
(iii) Improvementinservicedelivery
28.    Inpursuitof Vision2020, GoAPhasplacedgreat emphasis uponimprovingthe qualityoffront-line
service delivery. All govemment departments have been placed in eight groups (such as economic or
human development, infrastructure or governance) depending upon their core functions. A number o f
performance indicators have been established for departments, which are monitored monthly, quarterly and
annually by the Chief Minister, ministers and secretaries. Performance achievements are reported online
by every department every month. About 90 departments and offices with a large public interface have
prepared Citizens Charters, and the state is currently setting up a network o f call centers to systematically
monitor charter implementation and record the timely disposal o f citizen complaints.             Some o f the
successes are notedbelow:

    Population Stabilization. Through a variety o f initiatives, such as media campaigns targeted at
    increasing the age o f marriage o f girls and efficient sterilization and reproductive health programs, AP
    recorded the third lowest population growth rate among Indian states from 1991 to 2001. Duringthe
     1980s, AP's population grew by 24 percent; in the 1990s, the decadal growth rate came down to less
    than 14percent. This performance i s remarkable when compared with the national rate, which was still
    over 20 percent inthe 1990s.

    Improving Literacy. GoAP has pursued a twin strategy o f achieving universal elementary education
    and adult literacy. The number o f children out o f school was reduced by nearly 50 percent-from        7.6
    to 4.2 percent in 2002. With the assistance o f non-govemmental organizations (NGOs), around 6.5
    million adults were given basic literacy training between 2000 and 2002.

    Improving Water Conservation. Ap has launched a watershed movement to treat 100,000 hectares o f
    waste dry lands, and currently 56,400 hectares are under treatment. The results are clearly visible on
    ground water levels and crop productivity. Out o f 5,298 watersheds evaluated in 20 districts, the
    average increase in water level was 1.96 meters, and the number o f dry bore wells has been reduced
    from 19,952 in2000 to 4,111 in2002.

    Expanding Forest Cover. Through the state's emphasis on forest conservation and Joint Forest
    Management program, AP experienced the highest growth in forest cover in the country between 1997
    and 2001. Dense forest cover increased by an average o f 19 percent; open forest grew by 26 percent;
    natural regeneration increased by 60 percent; and forest fires and grazing were reducedby 72 and 57
    percent, respectively.
    IT enabled initiatives. The state's efforts in applying information technology to improve service
    delivery have been among the most innovative in the developing world. There are several IT enabled
    initiatives inAP that have improved service delivery to citizens. One that particularly stands out i s the
    e-Seva program. Started in August 2001, it i s a one-stop-shop for 42 citizen services, ranging from
    paying utility bills and taxes, to obtaining birth certificates, to purchasing train tickets, at 33 service
    centers throughout Hyderabad and surrounding municipalities. Currently, well over half a million
    transactions take place each month, with an average service time o f 2 minutes in off-peak and 15
    minutes at peak time. Plans are currently underway to extend the service to 229 more sites in all 117
    municipalities by the end o f 2003. A parallel initiative that seeks to provide instant access to over 60

    services inrural areas, called the On Line Transaction Processing program, i s currently beingpiloted in
    two districts.

0   Infrastructure services. There are also signs that infrastructure services in AP are improving. GoAP
    has made it a priority to improve rural infrastructure and road connectivity. Between 1991 and 2001,
    the state witnessed a 27 percent increase in the number o f villages connected with "pucca" roads, as
    compared to 23 percent for Maharashtra, 17 percent for Kamataka and 8 percent for Tamil Nadu. In
    the power sector, availability and quality o f power supply has improved, and power theft has been
    significantly curbed. In2002, AP was ranked first in a performance rating-done by two independent
    credit agencies, CFUSIL and ICRA, on behalf o f the Government o f I n d i a - o f the state power sectors
    across 26 states.
29.    AP has come a long way from where it started in the mid-nineties. Its progress is real and is well
documented. However, the state has a huge unfinished development agenda and needs to do far more to
meet its development goals outlined in Vision 2020. Inthis context, three things are important: first, the
reform process has to be sustained; second, the pace o f progress has to increase; and third, the benefits o f
growth and public services need to be more pro-poor. A start has been made; now the reform process has
to be deepened and sustained. The state needs support from all its stakeholders to continue moving forward
on its development path.


                     D.     ANDHRAPRADESH'SMEDIUM-TERM REFORMPROGRAM

30.    A P ' s ongoing reformprogram, supported by APERLs, has six main components:

       A. Pro-poor policy formulation andimplementation, andmonitoringo fkeypoverty indicators;

       B. Structural measures to facilitate economic growth;

       C. Public enterprise reform: restructuring and privatization;

       D. Improving (a) aggregate fiscal discipline; (b) public expenditure management; and (c) financial
             accountability;

       E. Improving governance; and

       F. Sectoral (education, healthandpower) reforms
31.    The associated policy program matrix, which outlines specific actions and benchmarks for these
components, i s appendedto the GoAP's Letter o f Development Policy.

(i) Pro-poorpolicyformulationandimplementation,andmonitoringofkeypovertyindicators
32.    In Vision 2020, poverty eradication and improvement in social welfare are listed as the most
important parameters o f development progress. Initially, GoAP's poverty eradication strategy focused on
direct measures and targeted programs-for      example, launching additional public employment schemes,
enhancing the Public Distribution System to ensure the food security o f the poor and socially
disadvantaged, and launching pension schemes to protect the aged, disabled, and widows. In 2000, the
government constituted the State Poverty Eradication Mission (SPEM)-a             committee o f govemment
ministers and officials, and representatives from research institutions and civil society-whose     role i s to
coordinate and provide guidance onpoverty reduction efforts inthe state. A poverty reduction strategy was
drafted in 2001 that highlightsa broader set o f measures to reduce poverty in the state. This included: (a)
generating faster growth, particularly in agriculture; (b) strengthening primary health and education
services; (c) enhancing social capital through self-help groups; (d) promoting sustainable livelihoods o f the
poor; (e) focusing greater attention on backward regions and poorer segments o f society; and (f) improving
the administrative machinery in order to improve the delivery o f services for the poor and promote greater
convergence o f social development.

   33.    Interms ofactual implementation ofitspoverty eradicationstrategy, two particular stateinitiatives
   stand out: first, a holistic approach that addresses rural poverty by coordinating the activities o f a number o f
   line departments through the Velugu Program, and second, an exercise to identify the poor through
   participatory methods to provide better targeted programs. The Velugu Program, the local name given to
   the Bank supported District Poverty Initiatives Project (DPIP), helps rural poor families achieve improved
   and sustainable livelihoods. Focusing on the poorest o f the rural poor, the program provides credit to
   individuals through community investment funds, promotes people's organizations, and enhances social
   capital o f the poor. In the past, problems relating to identifying the poor had adversely affected proper
   targeting o f poverty programs. The ongoing Participatory Identification o f the Poor (PIP) in 700 mandals
   covering over 12,000 habitations will provide valuable information for effective implementation o f anti-
   poverty programs.
   34.    GoAP'swork on poverty monitoringhas been much slower than expected. After a delay o f almost a
   year-for     a variety o f reasonsthe Poverty and Social Analysis Monitoring Unit (PSAMU) has been
   established and i s now operational. Inconjunction with several line departments, PSAMU has prepared a
   draft consolidated action plan for implementing the government's strategy for poverty eradication. An
.  important aspect o f this work i s to monitor and analyze poverty, which in turn will strengthen pro-poor
   policies across line departments. The draft plan includes a preliminary list o fpoverty indicators that will be
   regularly monitored and disseminated. In turn, this information will provide better information on the
   efficiency and effectiveness o f service delivery to the poor. These actions are likely to lead to better
   mainstreamingo fpoverty across GoAP policies.

   (ii) Structuralmeasurestofacilitateeconomicgrowth
   35.    While AP's economic growth has picked up inthe last five years and the state is performing above
   the national average (Figure 2), its growth rate remains considerably below the ambitious Vision 2020
   target.  Improving productivity in agriculture and industry holds the key to higher economic growth.
   Among the many reform programs under consideration by GoAP, the following two deserve special
   mention:
   36.    Facilitating greater competition in agriculture. InAP, like many other states, agricultural markets
   are highly regulated, dominated by public sector organizations, and are monopolistic in nature. The
   Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Marketing Act o f 1966 prescribes that "288 notified
   apcultural produce" (processed and un-processed) including cereals, pulses, oilseeds, cash crops, fruits,
   vegetables, flowers, fish, livestock, and poultry can be sold wholesale only by farmers through designated
   government-regulated "mandis" or wholesale markets. Direct bulk sales to prospective buyers by farmers
   i s prohibited. Inorder for the agricultural marketing system to function efficiently, farmers must be given
   freedom o f choice to sell their produce wholesale either through mandis or other marketing channels and
   the operation o f wholesale markets be opened to the private sector. An Expert Committee set-up by Go1
   has recommended that state governments should replace current regime by an omnibus provisions that
   allow institutions other than the government to set-up an agricultural market, provided minimumstandards,
   specifications, formalities, and procedures laid down by the government are complied with. GoAP i s inthe
   process o f amending its agricultural marketing Act and draft proposals to this effect are currently being
   reviewed.
   37.    Labor market reform. A constrained and inflexible industrial labor market has been identified as one
   of the main factors contributing to low labor productivity inAP, which is one o f the lowest inthe country.
   AP accounts for 13 percent o f the industrial labor force in India but produces only 6 percent o f the
   industrial output. The state's labor rules are not necessarily more restrictive than those in other parts o f
   India, but substantial overstaffing means that industries in AP are disproportionately more affected by such
   inflexibilities than industries in other states, like Gujarat and Maharashtra.       GoAP recognizes that a
   dynamic and flexible labor market, with necessary safeguards, i s the key to a prosperous and vibrant
   industrial sector. It has therefore undertaken a number of initiatives inrecent years to streamline inspection
   procedures to reduce the regulatory burden faced by firms.             Annual inspections of industries and


                                                           12

eliminating unauthorized random inspections (August 2002) and self-certification facilities for all industries
(April 2001 and June 2002) are two such important policy changes that have been recently undertaken by
the state.
38.      Notwithstanding the current reforms, there i s an unfinished agenda in the labor market. Given that
`labor' i s in the "concurrent list" o f India's Constitution, AP cannot project a totally new agenda in labor
reform without the cooperation o f the central government. However, even within the limits o f the current
constitutional arrangement, there are a few channels through which the state can introduce flexibility inthe
labor market. In this context, AP recently became the first Indian State to amend its Contract Labor
(Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, to facilitate hiring o f temporary/contract labor for non-core service
oriented activities by the firms and commercial establishments. GoAP plans to undertake further labor
reform in the coming months, including the introduction o f the Special Enclave Service Condition and
Dispute Resolution Act, 2003. This Act will lead to creation o f labor arbitrators in notified areas and is
expected to result in faster resolution o f industrial disputes and removal o f certain rigidities in the
functioning o f the labor market inthe state.

(ii) Publicenterprise(PE)reform:Restructuringandprivatization
39.      Ap has made significant progress in its PE reform program. As o f September 2003, 9 enterprises
have been privatized, 8 disinvested, 22 closed and 11have been restructured. Gross proceeds from the sale
of assets amounted to about US$30 million, with about US$26 million receivedso far (the bulk o f w h c h
will be used to cover the existing liabilities o f the enterprises).          Proceeds from disinvestments o f 8
enterprises were close to US$40 million. Phase Io f the PEprogram, which started in 1999, i s drawing to a
close. Of the 19 units included inPhase I,        actions for sixteen were completed, five units were closed, and
eight were privatized, including Nizam Sugar Limited (counted as one enterprise but with eight separate
units) and seven sugar and spinning cooperatives."               In all but one of the cases, sale and purchase
agreements have been executed andprivate purchasers have taken control o f associated assets. Three o fthe
PEShave been restructured and downsized, including AP Irrigation Development Corporation, AP Meat
and Poultry Corporation, and AP Agro-Industries Corporation. The three remaining enterprises inPhase 1
include two spinning mills (one o f which i s at an advanced stage o f privatization while the other is held up
ina Mumbai court), andAP Handicrafts Corporationwhere a Cabinet decision has been taken to continue
the corporation for another year.
40.      Phase I1of the reform program covers 68 enterprises and will be implemented over a four year
period-from      2002-03 to 2006-07-with        a target o f an average 15 units to be completed each year. These
targets have been set based on the timing and implementation experiences under Phase I.Phase I1
enterprises include: (i) corporations ranging in size and covering a variety o f sectors, including finance,
                            16
industry, agro-industry, and services; (ii) cooperatives, in sugar, spinning, dairy, oil seeds, and rural
                                                43
electricity; and (iii)  9 enterprises, where the government holds minority shareholdings.
41.      The target of completing 15 units for 2002-03 has been achieved. Option studies for nearly 40
enterprises have been completed. Ten units have been closed, including five cooperatives and five
corporations o f varying sizes. Compensation as part o f the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) has been
paid to the employees, and the Implementation Secretariat i s inthe process o f appointing liquidators for the
sale o f assets and the settlement o f liabilities. Two units (sugar factories) have been privatized, and another
three units have been restructured through downsizing and the payment o f VRS. Another 10 are slated to
be privatizedclosedrestructured in 2003-04 and the process for all 68 enterprises inPhase I1is likely to be
completed by 2006-07. Recently a major sale was completed (Godavari Fertiliser Company), which raised
Rs..102 crore for the government; this was the first transaction which resulted in a net resource transfer to
GoAP's treasury.




   The five units of Nizam Sugar Limited that were privatized, have crushed 23 percent more cane and increased capacity
utilizationby 30 percent inone year.

                                                            13

42.     A P ' s PE reform program provides valuable leaming experience and has become a model program in
India. A number o f delegations from other states have visited AP to learn about its experiences. Several
factors contributed to these achievements, including political support from the top, the creation o f
Implementation Secretariat and its commitment to the program, and the Technical Assistance program to
buildinstitutional capacity and provide technical advice. Part o f its success comes from puttinginplace
the VRS and social safety net program to compensate employees for the loss o f jobs and assist them in
finding alternative employment. As o f September 2003, 21,467 employees in Phase Iand I1had taken
VRS. The DFID financed social safety net program provided counseling andor training services to over
6,000 workers. The Implementation Secretariat has also developed a communications program that has
helpedbuildacceptance ofPEreforms and lessened opposition. Phase Iwas essentially a leaming exercise
and a reorientation o f the government away from direct involvement in commercial activities. Its fiscal
impact has been relatively small so far. The state has yet to tackle the two major enterprises-A.P.                    State
Transport Corporation and Singareni Collieries-which               together account for 88 percent o f the total PE
employee strength o f 250,000. Nonetheless, the reform process has been sequenced appropriately and i s
slowly gaining acceptance among all stakeholders. Such acceptance should help set the stage for fbture
actions on the larger and more complex enterprises beyond Phase 11.

(iv) Improving fiscal discipline and spending composition; and public expenditure management &
        financial accountability
         Fiscal discipline and spending composition
43.      As part o f the Vision 2020 work, GoAP had prepared a Fiscal Reforms Strategy Paper in January
2002. Operationalized around a medium-term framework, the strategy projects broad fiscal aggregates
over a six-year period, and sets annual targets for deficit and debt. This strategy i s expected to achieve
fiscal stability and make additional funds available for priority development expenditures which are
identified as: (i)capital expenditure for new infrastructure creation, (ii)non-salary operations and
maintenance (O&M), and (iii)       social sector investments inprimary health and education.
44.     Achievements.       A review o f GoAP's fiscal reform program indicates that there has been a
commitment inthe last couple o f years to achieving aggregated fiscal discipline. An important measure of
this commitment is the adoption o f and adherence to the Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF)
indicating that the Finance Department i s serious about tailoring expenditures to incoming revenues."                    In
both 2001-02 and 2002-03-the           first two years o f the MTFF-targets         for all deficit measures were met
(Table 4). This i s commendable as inboth these years there was a shortfall in fiscal devolution from GoI.
The debt stock also moved at the anticipated pace.
45.      Looking forward, based on the first six months o f data, the fiscal numbers for 2003-04 also appear to
be on target. However, one reason for possible slippage in the consolidated fiscal deficit i s if the Fuel
Surcharge Adjustment (FSA) designed to cover higher production cost in the power sector i s not timely
passed on to the consumers (for more information, see paragraph 82). GoAP is however, committed to
implementthe FSA upon approval by the Regulator.




l2 The MTFF is laid out inthe GoAP's Fiscal Reforms Strategy Paper, 2002, which along with other government strategy papers is
available, on GoAP's Web site. The MTFFhas beenrevised in September 2003 and the revised version will be put up on the Web
site in January 2004.

46.       The bulk o f the fiscal adjustment has come from those areas explicitly identified in GoAP's fiscal
strategy-the         public wage bill through restrictions on new hiring, the power sector with a reduction in
associated financial losses and the focus on rice subsidy program-which                               strengthens the credibility of the
overall reform pr~gram.'~The largest fiscal gains have come through a substantial containment o f the
wage and pensionbill (Table 5). Since this i s the single largest component of state expenditures, continued
progress is a good signal for steady fiscal reforms. Expenditures on non-salary operations and maintenance
and capital investments have been increasing, but have fallen slightly for primary social services in 2002-
03. This i s a concem given the historical underinvestment in these areas. However, the impact o f this
underinvestment i s lessened as GoAP has made substantial improvement in other reform areas, such as
governance and public expenditure management, which are expected to improve the effectiveness o f public
spending on service delivery to the poor. Also, in line with this medium-term strategy, spending in this
area is budgeted to grow substantially to 2.4 percent of GSDP in 2003-04 and to 3 percent o f GSDP by
2006-07.

47.     Inthe area oftax reform, GoAPhas taken several actions to strengthenitsrevenue performance. AP
has been a leader in making preparations for adopting the Value Added Tax (VAT). The state's VAT
legislation has been approved by the Legislature and has been sent to Go1for obtaining the President of
India's assent. GoAP has acted upon several recommendations of the Revenue Reform Committee, which
has prepared reports on commercial taxes and stamps & registration. Reports on excise, motor vehicle
taxes are currently under preparation. The government has incorporated many recommendations o f the
RRC report, particularly in the case of VAT design. Other actions taken on the basis o f RRC reports
include abolition o f internal check posts, establishment of Large Taxpayers Units and Dealer Service
Centers in each division, holding o f regular bi-monthly meetings with Trade associations to address
grievances.
48.     As part of its annual exercise, GoAP has revised its MTFFand the fiscal adjustment process is now
to be guided by the Second MTFF prepared in September, 2003. The revised MTFF i s to be put on
GoAP's Web site in January 2004. Fiscal targets from the First and Second MTFFs are given in Table 6
and Table 7, respectively.

49.      The revised targets (Table 7) indicate that there i s some slippage in deficit measures in the outer
years, as compared to the FirstMTFFtargets that were prepared inFebruary, 2002. This slippage i s mainly
due to (i)    a revised (lower) projection o f fiscal devolution from the center; (ii)             delayed turn-around in the
financial performance o f the power sector (as compared to the aggressive forecasts that were made in the
first business plan o f the power sector) and continued subsidy in 2005-06 and 2006-07; and (c) slightly
slower than expected growth inAP's own revenue, due to sluggisheconomy.

Note: The revised MTFF assumes SAL amounts of US$320million in 2003-04, US$350million in 2005-06, and US$380 million in 2006-07 as
one of the sources of deficit financing.
Definitions: See Table 4.

50.       One positive point that stands out inthe revised MTFFexercise is that when looking at the total state
government spending as a ratio o f its own taxes, the two projected series-from                       the First MTFF and the
Second MTFF-are              pretty close. This indicates that the state government's own fiscal efforts in meeting
the deficit targets have been good.
51.       Inorder to control government guarantees, GoAPhaspassedGovernment Orders (GOs 445 and446)
imposing a ceiling on the guarantees of the state government and laying down guidelines for their credit
riskanalysis, disclosure andreporting. The maximumtotal outstanding government guarantees are fixed at
90 per cent o f the revenue receipts o f the second preceding year. The accompanying guidelines describe
pre-sanction procedures (which loans are eligible for state government guarantees, responsibilities of the
Administrative departments o f the Secretariameads o f Departments aslung for the guarantee, amount o f
guarantee commission, evaluating risk o f the guarantee), directions for the drafting o f the guarantee deed
and the required accompanying documentation and post-sanction procedures (performance monitoring o f
the guaranteed entity). The Departments of the Secretariat and the Heads of Departments are required to
submit on a quarterly basis entity-wise position o f the outstanding loans guaranteed by the government.
The Finance Department, on its part, i s required to maintain a database regarding all guarantees issued by
the government, monitor them and publishthem inthe State Budget. GoAP has also made a provision for a
guarantee redemption fundinthe budget amounting to 1percent o f the guarantees outstanding.

                                                                17

52.    Future challenges. At the same time, GoAP faces a few challenges. While there i s little the state
govemment could do when there i s a decline in fiscal devolution from the center, GoAP needs to continue
strengthening its revenue reform program. A major challenge in the upcoming fiscal year will be the
adoption and implementationo f the Value Added Tax (VAT).14 The VAT has the potentialto substantially
improve revenue performance andreduce distortions, but requires carefd implementation.
53.     GoAP has also initiated steps to reform their pension system. A pension forecasting plan with a
robust forecasting methodology has been prepared. The software package developed in the report serves
well as a policy tool: it can quantify the fiscal impact o f changes in any parametric or fundamental
variables (link contributions to pension benefits for existing employees). A blue print for pension reform
and ways to rationalize the pension system have also been suggested. The report has been put up to a
Cabinet Sub Committee for discussion. Implementation o f the report's recommendations will be planned
after its clearance.
54.     With the objective o f deepening the fiscal reform process, GoAP plans to undertake one further
action: To institutionalize the MTFF process through formal legislation, with the primary purpose o f
mandating the presentation o f a medium-term fiscal analysis and implications for annual deficit and debt
stabilization targets alongwith the annual budget.
55.     Inthe area of spending, a challenge for the govemment is to improve the effectiveness of public
expenditure and development outcomes. Given the enormous and pressing needs o f AP's developing
economy, it i s critical to have a process o f resource allocation across competing needs based on a
systematic evaluation o f priorities and the actual impact o f spending. The fiscal allocation process should
therefore be increasingly informed by evidence on actual performance, and driven by deliberation over
policy alternatives. Some reforms in this direction are being pursued through improvements in budget
processes and public expenditure management. Overall, reforms in governance and financial management
are improving accountability for public expenditures.
        Public expendituremanagement andfinancial accountability
56.     Achievements. GoAP's Fiscal Reform Strategy Paper lays out a comprehensive budgetary and
financial management reformprogram. These reforms are critical instrengthening the linkbetweenpublic
spending, service delivery and development outcomes. To date, the state has established: (i)                       effective fiscal
control mechanisms and a credible budget, (ii)               increased political engagement, line department flexibility,
performance orientation and participation in the budget process (iii)                  greater transparency in budgets and
out-tums, (iv) predictable within-year funds flow to line departments and (v) increased compliance with the
basic accounting requirements in spending departments and inlocal and other bodies. These measures are
described below:
(a) Measures to strengthen budget preuaration and execution process

0    Budget transparency and consultation.                  The MTFF guides the preparation o f the Annual Fiscal
     Framework (AFF), within which the detailed annual budget i s then developed. The AFF for 2002-03
     and 2003-04 were posted on the GoAP's Web site and comments were sought from all stakeholders.
     Feedbackswere receivedthrough seminars, media debate, and e-mail/mail.

0    Hard budget ceilings, and greaterflexibility to line departments. The AFF allows hard budget ceilings
     to be set for the line departments, at the beginning o f the budget proce~s.'~                  Within these ceilings the



l4The revised date o f VAT introduction-April       1, 2003-has   passed and VAT has not been implemented in any o f the Indian
states. While AP, along with a few other states, had done all the necessary preparation for introducing the VAT, Go1decided to
postpone the launch. Since state govemments are to receive 100 percent reimbursement from Go1 in case o f a revenue shortfall in
adopting the VAT, it is not possible for a state to go on its own. All concemed parties are looking into the issue and a new date for
VAT implementation is yet to be announced.

IsThis does not, however, mean that there are no revisions to allocations duringthe financial year. Revisions will be necessary if
revenues fall short o f estimates or if some new schemes are introduced during the year. The allocation o f cuts, decided upon by the

                                                                  18

      line departments are given greater responsibility and flexibility to prioritize their expenditures, and to
      re-appropriate budgets withinprescribednorms.16

      Improved budget release mechanisms. The.fiscal frameworks and the hard budget constraints enabled
      the Finance Department to make 6-month budget releases at the beginning o f the 2002-03 fiscal year,
      and a credible commitment to quarterly releases in the second half o f the year. This was further
      improved in2003-04 when the release at the beginning o f the year was for the first 9 months. This i s a
      critical development inincreasing the predictability o f funds flowing to line departments.

      Improved cash management. The improved budget release system described above combined with the
      newly structured payment schedule system (within each month) have facilitated better cash
      management by the Finance Department, including better matching o f revenue and expenditure cash
      flows.
      Incentives to provide better services and collect user charges. The modified initiative to provide
      incentives (in the form o f supplementary budgets) to line departments for providing enhanced quality
      of services and collecting additional user charges i s steadily taking-off, particularly indepartments such
      as transport, police, education, health, horticulture and agnculture." For 2002-03, the amount collected
      i s reportedto have been Rs. 103 crore by January 2003.

      Performance budget.            GoAP has enhanced the 2003-04 budget preparation process through (i)
      requiring each department to identify objectives, work plan, and performance targets (drawing from the
      GoAP's comprehensive performance measurement system)18 and linkmg these to funds requested, (ii)
      the Cabinet Sub-committee (CSC) playing a central role inconsidering the competing demands on the
      total funds available at a cross-government workshop, rather than this being essentially done through
      individual negotiations between the Finance Department and line departments, (iii)                      workshops at state
      and district levels to discuss the line department performance budgets with officials and the public.
      The performance budget process has not yet changed the format o f the budget presented to the
      Legislature, and it i s unlikely that it has impacted the quality or content o f the budget this first time
      round, but itprovides a basis for strengthening the process and quality o f the budget in future years.
(b) Measuresto strengthen financial accountability, internalcontrol andlegislativescrutiny
57.       The short-term (1-3 year) approach to improving financial accountability and intemal controls has
focused on:

0      "Getting the basics right" While GoAP has the foundations for a satisfactory financial management
      and accountability system, several basic weaknesses remain.                            Accordingly, measures being
      implementedin2002-03 and 2003-04 include:

      (i) Strengtheninginternalcontrolsthroughsignificantlyenhancedmonitoringandenforcementthe
                 timely and regular applicationo f financial procedures and controls. An internal audit system in
                 the State Government is being introduced;



Cabinet Sub-committee, i s closely linked to the budget release process, and the rate o f expenditure by different departments and
schemes.

l6 Currently there is limited room for prioritization and flexibility given the high proportion o f `non-discretionary' expenditures
(e.g., salaries, regular operating costs, already committed expenditure). The `discretionary' portion i s estimated to be about 10-12
percent o fthe total budget.
   The earlier announced initiative o f authorizing line departments to retain the amounts the incremental user charges collected in
Deposit Accounts and to use these, was modified. As a result o f views expressed by the Auditor General, line departments are now
required to deposit such amounts into the State's Consolidated Fund, and are then provided supplementary budgets to use these
amounts for authorized purposes. The incentives created by the initiative to generate revenue and improve service delivery may
therefore be less than originally anticipated.
   The system o f performance monitoring was reviewed by top officials in June 2003, with a view to streamlining the system, and
ensuring balance between what individuals are held accountable for and their authority.

                                                                 19

    (ii)      Continued modernization o f the financial accountability system through computerization (e.g.,
             o f treasuries and payment o f salaries, and networking), and by updating financial codes, rules
              and regulations; and

    (iii)     Fostering a culture o f transparency throughbetter disclosure o f financial information.

0   Diagnostic work to prepare for the medium-term In April 2003, a State Financial Accountability
    Assessment (SFAA) was completed by GoAP, to prepare a medium-term road map for deeper
    improvements inthe financial accountability and management system. The World Bank's assessment
    is that the analysis and reporting in the SFAA i s high quality and thorough, and that its findings are
    well-supported by strong analytical evidence which has provided a strong basis for an effective
    program of financial accountability reform. The main findings o fthe SFAA are:

    (i) TheoperationofthecentralizedTreasurysystemprovideseffectivedisciplineoverspending
              by line departments. The internal controls exercised by the line departments themselves are,
             however, generally weak.

    (ii)      A number o f weaknesses regarding control were noted in respect o f expenditures managed
              outside the centralized Treasury system, including f h d s provided to local and other bodies in
              the form o f grants-in-aid, advances and loans, and the funds managed inthe Public Account.

    (iii)     Timeliness o f financial reporting has been improved and the previous backlog o f overdue
              accounts and audit reports o flocal and other public bodies has beenreducedsignificantly.

    (iv)      Improvements inthe presentation o f budget documents and accounts have made them simpler
              to understand and enabled greater public scrutiny and participation.
58.   Future Challenges. The critical challenge for the next few years is to sustain and institutionalizethe
improvements inpublic expenditure management and financial accountability that have been achieved so
far, This i s a major feature of the GoAP program in2003-04 and subsequent years. Institutionalizing these
improvements is facilitatedby the introductiono f greater transparency and the expansion o f the role played
bythe Cabinet Sub-committee andline departments inallocatingresources.
59.    Effective institutionalization will also depend on translating the platform created by the Finance
Department into improved prioritization and service delivery performance in line departments. GoAP i s
introducing a medium term expenditure planning process, initially in three departments, drawing on the
experience thus far in the primary health sector.        In addition, performance budgeting will be further
developed and refined. GoAP plans to incorporate departmental objectives and targets inthe Demands-for-
Grants requests it submits to the LegislativeAssembly.
60.    Strengthening financial accountability remains a challenge for the reform program. As part o f the
SFAA process, the state government i s preparing an action plan that emphasizes several steps to be taken in
the short to medium term. The key features o f the plan involve:

e   Further improving basic financial controls and accountability within line departments, and for funds
    outside the direct control o f the Treasury such as grants-in-aid, loans and advances including
    modernization o f financial codes and functionary manuals to underpin recent improvements, and
    creation o f an effective internal audit function.

0   Establishing better management, control and accounting arrangements for funds held in the Public
    Account, including a thorough review o f the AP Government Life Insurance and AP Government
    Employees Group Insurance Scheme.

0   Extending the financial accountability assessment process to cover local government and public sector
    undertakings.
61.    Implementation o f SFAA recommendations is proceeding rapidly.               An SFAA Implementation
Committee was formed in September 2003 through a Government Order (GO 417) to take forward and


                                                        20

monitor the implementation o f the SFAA action plan. This is supported by a team o f senior officials and
external experts from the Centre for Good Governance. Significant steps have already been taken to
strengthen accountability in furtherance o f the action plan. These include issue o f a Government Order
(GO 451) which defines the accountability o f senior level Controlling Officers and linksrelease o f funds to
the proper discharge o f their fiduciary responsibilities. Related instructions have been issued to Treasuries
requiring them to ensure that financial norms have been met before releasing fund and guidance to
controlling and disbursingofficers in the form o f handbooks on financial accountability. A workmg group
has been established on internal audit, chaired by the Principal Finance Secretary, and a review o f existing
internal audit functions carried out by the Institute o f Chartered Accountants. Decisions have been made
on the structure and functioning o f internal audit, taking account of, including introduction o f systems audit
and some outsourcingto private sector professional audit firms.
(v)    Improving Governance
62.    GoAP i s pursuinga broad agenda o f governance reforms, encompassing machinery o f government
and pay and employment issues, human resource management and development, enhancing transparency
and citizen orientation, anticorruption, and improving the management o f the GoAP's legal agenda.
Advances in strengthening governance continue to be impressive in areas where GoAP has historically
placed its greatest emphasis, such as e-governance and human resource development. Progress i s also
being made in areas such as administrative deregulation to promote private sector growth, anticorruption
and the management of GoAP's legal agenda. The key challenge in coming years will be to ensure the
effective implementation o f the existing reform agenda while moving forward in a few selected areas such
as administrative rationalization.
63.    The highlightso f the reformprogram are briefly discussed below:

     Strategy for governance reform.             A White Paper on Governance Reform was prepared by the
     government and i s posted on the Internet. To carry the reform agenda forward, GoAP established an
     Administrative Reform Unit within the General Administration Department (GAD). With support
     from DFID, GoAP set up the Centre o f Good Governance (CGG) to provide support to the reform
     program with analysis and assistance for departments to draw on. The CGG has played a particularly
     valuable role in analyzing the effectiveness o f reforms and makmg recommendations to improve
     imp1ementati0n.l~ Other sources, such as the GoAP's Performance Management Committee, have
     made recommendations for improving the quality o f the states performance indicators. GoAP also
     recently created an Advisory Commission on People's Empowerment (COPE), which is charged with
     improving service delivery, combating corruption, increasing productivity and reducing administrative
     costs.

0    Civil service reform. The civil service reform agenda covers topics ranging from pay and employment
     to reforming the machinery o f government to improvingperformance orientation. While the number o f
     civil servants per capita in AP has historically been high for Indian states, over the past several years
     the government has made substantial progress inreducing the size o f the civil service and controlling
     the growth o f the wage bill. GoAP has also made notable progress in the conduct o f a civil service
     census and inits efforts to establish a computerized human resource database." GoAP has developed a
     comprehensive organizational chart o f reporting relationships for ministers, departments and HODS
     (Head o f Departments) and has grouped these departments under eight general categories which are
     considered collectively in budgeting and performance review exercises. GoAP also met the formal


   A CGG study has identified scope for a number of improvements in the CARD programto reduce corruption and improve
service delivery. Another study looked carehlly at enhancing the effectiveness of citizens charters, which have spread widely
throughout state departments and agencies. Yet another looked at ways in which the operation of the Administrative Tribunal
couldbe improved.
  While the initial target of June 2002 has proven overly optimistic, the SmartGov projecthas a major HRM component, and the
system is now being developed on a pilot basis and will be ready for launch in four major departments encompassingover 50
percentofthe civil serviceby December2004.

                                                              21

  goal for developing and publicizing citizens' charters in at least 25 departments, although more work
  remains to ensure effective implementation. Work on HRD issues, including establishing training
  centers in all 23 districts and identifying and training o f 10,000 "change agents," i s proceeding in a
  highlysatisfactory fashion.
  There are a few areas where implementation has not advanced rapidly. The first is the review and
  simplification o f human resource procedures, which should be one o f the functions performed by the
  new wing in GAD tasked with responsibility for Administrative Reform. A second i s the development
  of policy analysis capacity within the GoAP Secretariat, which i s a long-term objective that could be
  addressed through a combination o ftraining and capacity buildingand lateralrecruitment. Third, while
  GoAP has taken essential steps in reorganizing the Government along functional lines and has
  identified potential candidates for rationalization among Departments and HODS,it has yet to begin
  rationalizing departments, eliminating administrative overlap and duplication between them, and
  closing unitswhose services are no longer necessary.

0 Electronicgovernance. Progress on expanding electronic governance has been impressive. A blueprint
  for electronic governance has been drawn up for 35 major departments. Slums (renamed SmartGov)
  was launched in November 2002 (with 483 modules), and Twins/e-Seva has been expanded. Over 5
  million transactions have taken place since the system was launched inAugust 2001, and the number o f
  transactions has now surpassed 50,000 per day.          Plans are being developed to computerize the
  administration o f social benefits and to roll it out to over 100 locations throughout the state by June
  2004. Plans are also underway to make at least 25 services available on-line through the AP Portal by
  December 2003 and over 105 services available by FY 2005-06, as well as to bring the benefits o f
  electronic governance to rural areas through the use o fluosks.

0 Access to information. GoAP will implement the Government o f India's Freedom o f Information
  legislation, which was enacted inJanuary 2003 but has yet to be formally ratified. The law establishes
  a baseline set o f standards for federal and concurrent subjects, whereas states will establish guidelines
  for those areas within their designated mandate. Inpreparation for the notification o f this legislation,
  GoAP has prepared a draft set o f rules which incorporate important provisions such as suo-mot0
  disclosure, penalties for non-compliance and appeals procedures. GoAP has also established a high
  level committee to oversee implementationo f the FOIlegislation, designated a set information officers
  in the departments and districts, and prepared legislation on upgrading the quality of records
  management.

0 Anticorruption. During 2001 and early 2002, GoAP took some promising steps in developing an
  innovative anticorruption strategy focusing on prevention, prosecution and public relations. Talented
  officers were placed in charge o f the Anticorruption Bureau (ACB) and Vigilance Enforcement
  Department WED). A number o f Government Orders were passed making suspension mandatory for
  officers caught in entrapment cases, prohibiting officers from being routinely released on bail untilthe
  completion o f the investigation, and attaching disproportionate assets acquired through illegal means to
  the court, among others.      As a result, the performance o f these units has significantly improved.
  Between 2001 and 2003, the number o f trap cases went up by 71 percent; the number o f
  disproportionate assets cases went up by 83 percent; and the number o f disproportionate assets seized
  inthese raids increased by a 154 percent. The number of convictions increased by 115 percent; the
  number o f dismissals from service increased by 25 percent; and the number o f gazetted and non-
  gazetted officers booked increased by 25 and 68 percent, respectively. The performance o f the VED
  also shows significant positive improvements inmany areas. There was an increase inrevenue leakage
  detected by 181percent over 2001-02, and an increase inrevenue realizedby 31percent.
  Future plans call for significantly strengthening this effort. The budgets for the ACB and VED will be
  increased by 50 percent for the next fiscal year and 20 percent each year after that, leading to a
  doubling o f resources over the next three years and allowing them to expand their presence into the
  district level. A Cabinet Sub-committee has been formed to consider three items o f legislation that
  will directly or indirectly affect corruption issues, including the Performance Accountability Bill, the

                                                    22

    Corrupt Public Servant's Forfiuture o f Property Bill and the AP Transparency in Public Procurement
    Bill.

(vi)   Sectoral reforms: Education, Health and Power
       Education
64.    As laid out in Vision 2020, the education sector is central to AP's vision for economic and social
development, and has beenplacedon the front burner o f state issues. Specific education markers have been
outlined under this plan, which include achieving full functional literacy (by 2005) and ensuring that
educational achievement inthe state will be second to no other state inIndia.
65.    The specific objectives under Vision 2020 are (i)     ensuring full literacy, (ii)promoting education
among women, (iii)    focusing vocational and higher education on marketable slulls, (iv) encouraging private
sector initiatives in education especially in higher education and (v) creating effective frameworks for
managing and funding education. These objectives are being met through the adoption o f key strategies,
such as hiring more teachers, investing in physical infrastructure, revising curricula, focusing on the
disadvantaged groups, expanding non-formal coverage, focusing more attention on adult literacy programs,
and enhancing community involvement inplanning, management, administration and monitoring. GoAP' s
policy document entitledEducationfor All, together with Vision 2020, expands the scope for investment in
education inthe state and further illustrates GoAP's commitment to achieving the goals set in these policy
documents.
66.    Achievements. AP's education sector i s transforming rapidly and much o f this change has taken
place within a little less than a decade. As a priority, the government is making a tremendous effort to
achieve universal enrollment at the primary and upper primary levels, and to ensure retention and
completion at these levels. Usinghousehold census information, state education officers have periodically
conducted social audits in which the responsibility for bringingabsent children to school i s placed on the
sarpanch (the head of thepanchayat), members o f the Village Education Committees, members o f School
Education Committees, members o f the Parents-Teachers Associations and education officers from various
administrative levels. Primary school infrastructure has grown considerably across the state, and under a
new Centrally Sponsored Scheme known as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), a considerable amount o f
investment inupper primary schooling has been included inthe Tenth Plan, which i s likely to be continued
inthe EleventhPlanperiod.
67.    Teacher management has improved considerably in the state with the completion o f the teacher's
database and the introduction o f a counseling system to deal with teacher transfers issues. A complete
teachers database i s now available for scrutiny on the AP Government Web site. A counseling system has
been inplace to deal with the issue o f teacher transfers and has often been cited as a best practicemodel for
teacher management and rationalizationissues.
68.    GoAP has engaged a number of parateachers or Vidya Volunteers on a contractual basis to fill
teacher vacancies inthe short to medium term. The use o f Vidya Volunteers i s also expected to help during
the transition from the District Primary Education Project (another Go1 centrally sponsored scheme) to
SSA, which will shift the emphasis from primary to upper primary schooling.
69.    Statewide student assessments have been carried out for children in Grades I-V in Mathematics and
Telugu under a newly initiated Quality Improvement Program. Under the program, teachers participate in
an intensive 45-day training course that helps them make assessments on whether children in the same
cohort have acquired the minimum competency level in language and quantitative slulls for that group.
The assessments are used to identify weaker groups o f students within classrooms and these children are
then given increased attention to ensure that the set o f core competencies identified for that specific cohort
are attained. Since assessments and specialized training of this kmdmay be new to many o f the teachers,
and even mandal and district level officers, state level project officers who have already been trained in
these assessments facilitate courses at lower administrative levels.



                                                      23

70.     While the state government still does not actively encourage the private provision o f primary and
elementary schooling, several initiatives that have been undertaken that would help lead to greater private
involvement in both actual operations and the management o f existing school programs. Two recent
examples include the participation o f a private, non-profit organization, the Naandi Foundation, in the
management and runningo f the school feeding program in the twin cities o f Hyderabad and Secunderabad.
A similar arrangement has been established in Warangal as well. Secondly, GoAP has engaged forty
corporate houses to manage about a third o f the schools in the Hyderabad- Secunderabad area under a
limited arrangement through the same non-profit foundation.
71.     Future challenges. AP has made substantial progress inthe education sector, but much needs to be
accomplished before the goals o f Vision 2020 can be reached. While enrolment rates across all groups
have increased steadily over the years, attendance i s irregular, and retention and completion rates are still
low. This i s particularly true for disadvantaged, vulnerable groups and girls. Quality o f education services
i s still poor and attention is being paid to improving quality o f education through increased non-wage
operations and maintenance spending, improving the pupil-teacher ratio, provision o f textbooks and
uniforms, increased funds for innovation, teaching learning equipment and materials funded through the
SSA. Teacher quality is also being improved by pre-service and in-service training. For this purpose
GoAP has developed a training calendar, which ensures that teachers are not taken away from their primary
responsibilities too often by training programs.
72.      The key education sector issues that GoAP plans to address include: (i)improving the overall
capacity to plan for the sector, monitor and evaluate changes in outcomes, and move towards performance
based management o f the sector, (ii)   ensuring that all children are enrolled, attending and staying in school
through the basic cycle (Grades 1-7), are obtaining an education o f reasonable quality and are showing
demonstrable gains through assessment o f learning achievements conducted on a sample basis; (iii)       how to
improve resource flows to the sector and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f public spending,
and (iv) to ensure that public spending i s equitable innature, and that the limited or scarce access resources
that are available are spent judiciously across the various education levels, and across diverse gender, social
and economic groups.
73.      Furthermore, increased efficiency and equity inthe use o f public resources on education will also be
achieved by adopting a school cluster based performance improvement program, improvements in
attendance o f both teachers and pupils, by undertaking a public expenditure tracking survey and by
developing and implementing a strategy on the basis o f the findings through a public expenditure trackmg
survey.
74.      Increasing enrollments at the primary and upper primary level i s expected to place a considerable
amount o fpressure on the need for secondary school resources. GoAP i s cognizant o fthis requirement and
plans are being considered to expand the provision o f secondary schools in the state system. This will
require increased in-flows o f resources into the state tied for education services at all levels, particularly at
the secondary level.
         Health
75.      The National Sample Survey (NSS) and Bank studies for the AP health sector indicate that the
private sector i s a major player in health care provision and financing, accounting for almost 90 percent o f
all ambulatory care and more than 70 percent o f hospitalizations. The private sector accounts for two thirds
of antenatal care, more than two-thirds o f all institutional deliveries, and one-third o f immunizations. A
high and increasing proportion o f health care consumers, including the poor, are turning to the private
sector, despite considerable donor input intothe public sector over the last decade.
76.      A large amount o f public money is spent on the provision o f private goods (ambulatory care and
hospital care) and i s mostly captured by the upper income group. Although the state i s responsible for the
delivery o f health services, a major portion o f the funding derives from GoI's centrally sponsored schemes
which, in effect, limits the freedom o f the state to take new directions and approaches, and allocate funds
accordingly.

                                                       24

77.    Inshort, the health system in AP is heavily reliant on the private sector and efforts to improve
priority health outcomes will fail ifthey do not take this into account.
78.    AP has the good fortune o f a strong political commitment to improving health outcomes. These
goals, including infant and child mortality, maternal mortality, and communicable disease control, are
clearly articulated in Vision 2020. Achieving these targets will require dealing with the whole health
sector, bothpublic and private. This emphasis on health outcomes and the needto deal with both the public
and private sector means that the Department of Health will need to be reorganized to meet new challenges
and will need to try new approaches to reaching some o f the targets, including demand side interventions.
Accordingly, the state plans to undertake the following actions:

0   Develop a strategy to ensure that the private sector contributes optimally to achieving the health goals
    of Vision2020. The strategy will emphasize the oversight and enabling roles to be playedby the public
    sector inensuing the involvement o f the private sector inmeeting the healthgoals.

0   GoAP will develop a plan, based on the recent functional review, for reorganizingthe Department o f
    Health and the Commissionerate o f Family Welfare.

0   GoAP will emphasize demand side interventions to promote equity and improve quality (and provide
    alternatives to the failed supply side interventions) with initial emphasis on maternal and child
    mortality. To this end, detailed plans for a pilot scheme will be developed, which will use vouchers to
    enable poor women to obtain antenatal care, and delivery and postnatal care through public or private
    nursinghomes.
    Power
79.    The power sector in AP, like in most Indian states, exerts a significant impact on the overall fiscal
performance o f the state. GoAP has implemented major reforms during the last four years that have
yielded many positive outcomes. These compare very well with progress in the rest o f India, although
results are mixed insome areas. An assessment o f the reforms reveals:

0   Significantprogress in structural, regulatory and governance reforms. These include (i)     unbundlingin
    1999-2000 o f the Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board into six corporatized companies with
    independent management and functioning on commercial principles, (ii)          effective regulation by the
    independent Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) since its establishment in
    1999, (iii) enactment and rigorous enforcement o f anti-theft legislation and introduction o f a citizen's
    charter for the services provided by power utilities, (iv) significant reduction in transmission and
    distribution (T&D) losses from 37 percent in 1999-2000 to 26 percent in2002-03 and improvements in
    collection efficiency-to    over 98 percent-including       collection o f receivables from public sector
    consumers.

0   Improvements in access, availability and quality of power. About 3000 megawatts (MWs) o f new
    generation capacity has been added in AP's power system resulting in improved availability o f power
    supply. Special efforts have been made to improve the availability and quality o f power supply to
    industries, and to increase access to electricity inboth urban and rural areas.

0   Continuing concern over the power sector's Jinancial viability. The financial performance o f the
    power sector during2000-01and 2001-02 did not meet the expectations o f GoAP's own Business Plan,
    incurring losses o f about Rs.3000 crore in both years (see Table S), and placing an enormous strain on
    the state's finances. A severe country-wide drought during this period resulted in substantially lower
    hydro-power generation and increased electricity demand for imgation purposes. This delivered a
    double shock to the sector's financial situation.        The state recovered well from these difficult
    circumstances and reduced power sector losses by about 40 percent from Rs.2928 crore in 2001-02 to
    Rs.1911 crore in 2002-03. This Performance i s laudable given that the drought worsened in 2002-03.
    Significant efforts were made to contain financial losses by curtailing theft, controlling agricultural
    supply within the limits o f the government's policy, improving efficiency, and rationalizing tariffs for

                                                       25

     industrial consumers.21 Cost recovery for the distribution companies has accordingly increased from
     72 percent in 2000-2001to 79 percent in 2002-2003. AP has qualified to receive a cash support as an
     incentive for reducing the gap between average cost o f supply and revenue under the GoI's Accelerated
     Power Development and Reform Program (APDRP). Notwithstanding these efforts, the state has not
     been able to tackle the difficult twin issues o f metering and low tariffs inthe agnculture sector, which
     imposes high risks and makes improvements in the sector's financial performance vulnerable.
     However, GoAP fully acknowledges the importance o f progress in this area, and has initiated some
     work to lay the foundations for action (see below).

     There has been sustained progress in reducing cross subsidies. APERC has made good efforts to
     rationalize tariffs and reduce the cross subsidization. Tariffs for subsidizing categories (HT-industries,
     commercial consumers and railway traction) have declined inreal terms. For HT-industrial consumers
     tariffs have been reduced from a maximum o f Rs. 3.95kWh in 2002-03 to Rs. 3.60kWh in 2003-04.
     Progress in raising tariffs for subsidized consumers has been limited, however, especially for
     agricultural and residential users, who pay about 10 and 81 percent o f the average cost o f supply,
     respectively.
80.     Like other states in India agriculture metering and tariffs remain difficult in AP. Tariffs for
agnculture are the lowest among all Indian states and have not been revised for the last three years.
Progress on metering2.2 million agriculture consumers i s lagging. So far, only new agriculture consumers
and horticulture consumers are metered. Distribution companies (discoms) have submitted a metering plan
to the APERC, which proposes full metering o f all consumers by 2006-07. After several years o f un-
metered and subsidized power supply, farmers' interests in maintaining these concessions are firmly
entrenched.     While there i s greater acceptance o f the need for metering in order to comply with the
provisions o f National Electricity Act 2003 and continued pressure from the Regulator, progress on
meteringinthe medium term i s likely to remain difficult.
81.     Future challenges. Power sector reforms are critical for growth and the success o f fiscal reforms.
Despite continuing concern about the financial sustainability o f AP's power sector, GoAP i s malung
progress on a second generation o f reforms.              A number o f structural reforms and commercialization
initiatives are planned to provide stability and sustainability to the state's fiscal position, increasing cost
recovery, reducingkontaining subsidy support and lochng-in reform gains by preparing for the
privatizationo f distributionbusiness. The government i s also planning significant investments to eliminate
power shortages, further increase access and improve the quality o f power supply. The main components
of GoAP'spower sector reformstrategy include:
82.     Continued efsorts towards eficiency improvement, theft control, and tariff rationalization in order to
strengthen the sector's overall financial performance.                 In 2002-03, the power sector (the whole of
generation, transmission and distribution businesses) recovered its operating costs through its own revenue
(earnings before interest, tax and depreciation) for the first time since the initiation o f reforms in 1999-00,



2'By enforcing supply regulations more strictly and communicatingwith farmers on the power supply situation, distribution
companieswere able to containthe level of supplyto agriculture in 2002-03 to 2001-02 levels. ReductioninHT-industrial tariffs
and incentive scheme resulted in 27 percent increase in HT-sales vis-his previous year, reversing the trend of declining sales
duringtheperiod 1998-2002.

                                                              26

and realized an overall 79 percent cost recovery through tariffs. The goal i s to progressively reach 100
percent cost-recovery, which GoAP aims to achieve through sustained efforts to improve operational
efficiency, reduce the cost of power purchases, and rationalize tariffs. With the likely introductiono f open
access and competition (consistent with the provisions o f the Electricity Act 2003), pressure on the utilities
to further reduce cross subsidies will increase.                Greater overall cost recovery will, therefore, require
measures to rationalize tariffs from subsidized consumer categories. To mitigate the financial and fiscal
risko fthe failure o fhydropower generation, GoAP is committed to a timely andregular implementationo f
a Fuel Surcharge Adjustment (FSA), in accordance with the APERC's directive."                         As per the provisional
information available for the first six months in 2003-04, the loss for transmission and distribution
companies i s estimated to be about 117 crore, as against the target o f Rs. 25 crore profit for the first six
months.23 The projected loss for the year as a whole (2003-04) i s Rs.600 crore tahng into account the
committed subsidy for Rs.1513 crore. Of this gap, Rs.276 crore i s estimated on account o f power purchase
mix which is proposed to be recovered through FSA. Roughly 102 crore is on account o f inadequacy o f
depreciation to meet debt service obligation. The latter i s proposed to be covered through tariff
adjustments. In order to recover for the losses on account o f the increased cost due to adverse power
purchase mix, APTRANSCO has applied to the Regulator on October 18, 2003 for a fuel surcharge
adjustment. While the Regulator's order i s awaited, GoAP i s committed to implementing the FSA upon
receiving the approval.

83.     Implementation of alternative mechanisms for the delivery of subsidies directly to agriculture
consumers, enabling thepower utilities to operate commercially. At present, subsidies to agriculture power
consumers are provided through tariffs and are thus routed through the utility. The large share o f power
that i s supplied to the agriculture consumers either without metering or at low tariff rates is perceived as a
big business risk by potential private investors. Through a Task Force on power supply to agriculture,
GoAP i s exploring alternative ways o f delivering subsidies to agriculture without affecting the commercial
operation o f the utilities. The Task Force submitted its report to GoAP, and based on the government's
approval, the Task Force will pilot test alternative subsidy delivery mechanisms during the next 12-15
months. Based on the lessons learned from the pilots, the government will finalize its strategy on this
important issue, to be implemented from April 2005. The Task Force i s also initiating an incidence study
to promote a better understanding o f the subsidy being provided to residential and agriculture consumers.
Taken together, these initiatives will eventually enable the government to formulate a more effective
mechanism for targeting and delivering subsidies to apculture, while allowing the utilities to operate on
commercialprinciples, as well as reducingthe overall fiscal impact.




22In2001-02 and 2002-03, on account of drought andthe failure ofhydro power generation, GoAP hadto provide additional cost
support o f Rs.473 crore and Rs.262 crore, respectively. To address this issue, the APERFC inApril 2003 issued an order for a Fuel
Surcharge Adjustment in retail tariffs.    The FSA facilitates on a quarterly basis an automatic pass through of increased power
purchase costs on account o f uncontrollable elements includingfailure o f hydro generation.

23This has been mainly due to highproduction cost resulting from an adverse hydrohhermal mix. Hydro generation in the first six
months has been 755 MUSagainst the target of 2611 MUS.Ifthis pattern continues for the year, the resultant higher production
cost for the year could be inthe range o f Rs. 300 to 400 crore.

                                                                 27

84.     Separation of transmission and tradingfunctions and moving to a multi-buyer model. Inaccordance
with the Electricity Act 2003, AP plans to separate the transmission and trading functions and introduce
open access in consultation with the APERC. An initial feasibility study on the establishment o f a multi-
buyer model (MBM) and direct contracting between generators and distributors has been completed. The
government and the utilities are currently discussing the strategy for shiftingto a multi-buyer model, and
depending on the availability o f necessary infrastructure and commercial arrangements, the move i s to be
implemented by April 2005. Moving to MBM would promote further commercialization and facilitate
competition.
85.     Privatization of distribution. GoAP seeks to lock in the efficiency gains achieved in the first phase
of the power sector reforms by privatizing the distribution business. Two o f the important pre-requisites
identified   by the privatization advisors have already been addressed: (a) in April 2003, APERC has
enunciated long term tariff principles to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, and (b) the new Electricity Act
2003 provides for the establishment of alternative dispute resolution mechanism^.'^ GoAP has prepared a
draft privatization strategy, which will be finalized by March 2005 based on consideration o f the structural
issues laid out in the new Electricity Act 2003, and in consultation with the Regulator regarding
introduction o f open access and competition in the power sector. The government has prepared a draft
action plan to address these pre-requisites, important even in the context o f hrther commercialization o f
the sector, and intends to implement the actions over the next 15 months. The implementation o f the
agreed plan will be important for GoAP readiness to launch the privatization o f distribution in 2005. The
key to the success o f this effort lies inflexibility for the government to be able to customize its privatization
strategy to the market appetite and private sector's capacity to undertake investments indistribution.
86.     Expansion of access to electricity in rural areas. GoAP i s committed to providing electricity access
in all homes in the state by 2005-06. Currently, 67 percent of the population has access to electricity.
Developing viable business models for supply to rural areas and improving access will be critical. Utilities
and GoAP are discussing service delivery models and financing arrangements for improving access.


                                 E.       BANK'SASSISTANCE ANDHRAPRADESH
                                                                      TO

87.     The Bank's current assistance strategy in AP i s guided by the India Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), which was discussed by the Board in April 2001.                         Highlighting three strategic principles of
selectivity, adoption of a programmatic approach, and reliance on partnerships, it emphasizes assisting
those states which have: (i)chosen to embark on a comprehensive program of reforms, including fiscal,
governance and power sector reforms; (ii)            expressed interest in entering into a partnership with the Bank;
and (iii)  have a relatively high incidence of poverty. All three strategic principles are applicable to the
proposed operation.          AP has a comprehensive medium-term reform program that includes fiscal,
governance and power sector components. Together with other donors such as DFID, the Bank has a
strong partnership with AP, and as described inTable 1above, more than one infive people live inpoverty.
88.     The 2001 CAS outlines both a base case and a low case for lending. As explained inthe 2002 CAS
Progress Report (paragraph 6), India's performance currently places it towards the low end o f the base
case, with an otherwise strong macroeconomic performance undermined by highfiscal deficits, positive but
slow and uneven progress in structural reforms, and reasonable portfolio performance (though
disbursements rates have fallen, it i s marginally above the 17 percent threshold set out in the CAS). The
recent India Development Policy Review examined India's fiscal position in depth, and confirmed that it
was a drag on growth rather than a threat to stability. As outlined inboth the CAS and the CAS Progress
Report, the Bank i s proceeding in this context with sub-national adjustment lending with the key aim o f
reducing state-level deficits (now half o f the national deficit). Experience shows that there has been some



24Other issues identified as conditions precedent by the privatization advisor are: mitigation of measurement and subsidy risk for
power supply to agriculture, financial restructuring and re-capitalization of distribution companies, announcement of policy on
introduction of competition, and evolution ofthe sector structure to a multi-buyer model.

                                                                28

progress in reducing fiscal deficits in AP, Kamataka and Orissa. Encouraged by this progress, Go1 has
asked that the S A L facility be available more broadly to other states based on well defined criteria,
including progress in reducing fiscal deficits as a major trigger. Thus, the volume and timing o f such
lending i s governed by "self-regulating triggers" inthat they depend on the speed o f reforms, including in
the area o f fiscal policy, at the state level. Last fiscal year, no adjustment loans were processed; this year
about four are likely to be processed.
89.    The Bank has had a long development partnership with AP. It was one o f the earliest reforming
states to receive Bank Group support. With a current lending portfolio (active projects) o f roughly US$2
billion, it has the largest assistance program among Indian states. Through multi-state projects, channeled
via centrally-sponsored schemes, the Bank has supported AP in improving the delivery o f public health
services and primary education. Since 1995, the Bank has financed a variety o f state specific investment
projects-including     rural poverty, health, child nutrition, forestry, irrigation, rural roads and state
highways, and power projects.          A Structural Adjustment Loan, APERL 1, focusing on fiscal and
governance issues, was approved inMarch2002.
90.    The Bank's assistance strategy in AP also has a major non-lending component. Various pieces o f
analytical work have been done over the years both to help the client and to underpin the Bank's own
lending program. Formal and informal work done in the last five years includes a growth study, a fiscal
report, a state financial accountability assessment (done by the client), and sectoral studies on education,
health, water resource management, and environment.             Most o f the recent analytical work has been
undertaken, at the request o f GoAP, insupport o f Vision 2020. Inaddition, as part o f APERL 1supervision
and preparation for APERL 2, several due diligence policy notes have been prepared over the last 12
months on a variety o f topics, including poverty, fiscal, governance, public expenditure and financial
management, public enterprises, agriculture and rural development, education, health and power.
91.    Among external agencies, DFID's active assistance program has complemented the Bank's work the
most. Besides being a partner in adjustment operations, DFID i s providing technical assistance on the
state's reform agenda, including the key issues o f governance, public enterprise reform, power sector
reform and poverty monitoring and analysis.           Other programs in DFID's portfolio include efforts to
improve rural livelihoods, primary education, and services to poor people in 32 towns across the state.
DFIDalso finances a number o fnational projects inAP, particularly inthe health sector onHIV/AIDS.To
complement this work, DFIDhas provided strategic technical assistance on the health sector to GoAP.


                                     F.     THEPROPOSED       LOANKREDIT

92.    The proposed APERL 2 i s the second operation ina series o f planned SALSto AP. It is based on the
strength o f AP's overall reform program and on progress on the fourteen key indicative actions that were
documented in APERZ, 1. The loan supports the state's medium-term reform program through another
single tranche loadcredit to the Government o f India o f US$ 220 million (50 percent IBRD, 50 percent
IDA) to be on-lent to GoAP. Like the first, this operation will also be co-financed by DFIDwith a likely
grant amount o f about US$ 100 million. The overall size o f financial support has been set on the basis o f
(a) the principle set out in GoI's S A L guidelines; (b) the methodology o f determining S A L amount in
Indian states as set out in the note prepared by the Bank in August 2003; and (c) an assessment o f AP's
overall reform efforts.
93.    At the time ofthe APERL 1discussions inearly 2002, it was anticipated that subject to a satisfactory
performance, a comparable level o f support would be provided in 2002-03. As mentioned earlier, no
adjustment operation was processed in any o f the states in India while the Go1reconsidered their policy on
such assistance.
94.    AP has completed the APERL 2 actions.             However, implementation o f the reform program to
underpin APERL 2 has fallen short o f the steps envisaged at the time o f APERL 1 (see below). Moreover,
as noted in Table 9, the financial performance o f the power sector was weak in 2001-02; losses were

                                                         29

Rs.490 crore above the business plan target. Actions could have been taken to address the structural issues
inthe power sector, particularly those related to agnculturalmeteringand costrecovery (both ofwhich are
important for commercialization and privatization o f distribution). Given the good progress with reform
implementation otherwise, particularly in meeting the fiscal targets in 2001-02 and 2002-03, the proposal
here i s to proceed with APERL 2, but with a reduced amount-US$220               million plusUS$lOO million fi-om
DFID-compared to the first tranche o f assistance which was US$250 million from the Bank and US$lOO
million from DFID.

(i) LoadcreditAdministration
96.    Loadcredit funds arrangement will be similar to that o f the previous loan. Through GoI, GoAP will
submit to the Bank a withdrawal application upon loan effectiveness. The US dollar proceeds o f the
Loadcredit will be transferred from the Bank to GoI's account held at the Reserve Bank o f India, into
which all Bank disbursements are deposited. The account i s controlled by the Office o f Controller o f Aid,
Accounts and Audit, o f the Department o f Economic Affairs, Ministryo f Finance, GoI, and i s part o f GoI's
general foreign exchange reserves.           The Rupee equivalent funds will be transferred by Go1 to the
Consolidated Fund of GoAP in one tranche on standard terms for central resource transfers to state
development budgets (30 percent as grant and 70 percent as loan, with Go1bearing the foreign exchange
risk). GoAP will confirm to the Bankthe receipt o fthese funds within 30 days.
97.    Disbursement o f the funds will not be linked to specific purchases. However, Go1will not use the
Loadcredit proceeds to pay for certain expenditures included in the Bank's standard negative list which
includes expenditures on military hardware, luxury goods as defined in the Standard International Trade
Classification, and environmentally hazardous goods.
(ii) PerformanceMonitoring
98.    As a part o f its lending supervision program, the Bank team will monitor several measures and
indicators:

99.   GoAP hasbeenpromotinggreater transparency and accountability inits programs. Inthe last couple
of years, it has established over 980 performance indicators for both departments and districts, which are
monitored monthly, quarterly and annually by the Chief Minister, Ministers and Secretaries. Performance
indicators were also included in the "Performance Budgets" prepared by the line departments during the
2003-04 budget process. To monitor public service delivery, about 90 departments and offices with a large
public interface have prepared Citizen's Charters, and the state i s currently setting up a network o f call
centers to systematically monitor charter implementation and record the timely disposal o f citizen
complaints. These initiatives and measures will also facilitate performance monitoring as a part o f the
supervision o fthe APERL 2 loan.

(iii) StatusofMainIndicativeActionsforAPE= 2
100. There were 14main indicative actions for processing AP S A L 2 laid out inthe AP S A L 1document
(pages 25 and 26). These actions, listed under three categories, and information on their status, are
described below. Insome cases the actions havebeen revisedto reflect a change incircumstances.
    Fiscal reform
    Action I. Fiscal targets: (i) confirmation o f 2001-02 fiscal performance (budgetary and consolidated)
    through the available fiscal data; 2002103 performance on track to achieve consolidated fiscal targets
    for the year; (ii)expenditure composition reforms on track through shifting o f resources towards
    primary social services, non-salary O&M, and capital spending; and (iii)       GoAP to prepare a public
    report on mid-year fiscal performance.
    Status. Completed. Fiscal targets for 2001-02 and 2002-03 have been met (and based on the first six
    months o f data, the fiscal numbers for 2003-04 also appear to be consistent with the revised MTFF
    targets); (ii)
                 expenditure composition i s broadly on track though spending on primary social services
    has been less than the amount budgeted (all efforts are being made to ensure that the 2003-04 target is
    met); and (iii)a report on mid-year fiscal performance was prepared and was put on GoAP's Web site.

    Action 2. Development and implementation o f pension forecasting capacity, including selection o f a
    forecast methodology and staff training inthis system, as a first step towards pensionreform.
    Status. Completed. A report on state pension reform has been prepared. The report has a detailed
    pension forecasting plan with a robust estimation methodology.           An initial training session was
    conducted on the forecasting methodology.
    Action 3. Strengthening o f revenue mobilization through preparation measures toward implementation
    of the sub-national VAT; preparation o f the Revenue Reform Committee (RRC) report on tax revenue
    mobilization strategy, introduction o f statutory requirements for periodic revision o f specific duty rates.
    Status. Completed. APVAT Bill, 2003 has been passed by the Legislature and sent to Go1 for the
    assent of the President o f India. VAT implementation is a national issue and will be decided by GoI.
    All concerned parties (several states and GoI) are inthe process o f deciding on a new date for VAT

  implementation. The Revenue Reform Committee has prepared reports on commercial taxes, stamps
  and registrations.   Reports on excise and motor vehicle taxes are under preparation.          GoAP has
  incorporated many o f the recommendations, particularly on organizational changes to bring more
  autonomy and improving tax services in the Commercial Tax Department. While the government has
  not introducedany statutory requirement, it continues to periodically revise the specific duty rates.
  Public expendituremanagement reform

0 Action 4.     Development o f departmental medium-term expenditure plans, focused in 2002-03 on
  primary health and education expenditure linkages to the consolidated MTFF to ensure appropriate
  resource allocation consistent with sectoral policy objectives (universal literacy, primary health
  coverage targets, etc).
  Revised Action 4. Development o f departmental medium-term expenditure plans, focused in 2002-03
  on primary health expenditure linkages to the consolidated MTFF to ensure appropriate resource
  allocation consistent with sectoral policy objectives, such as primary health coverage targets.
  Development and agreement o f Terms o f Reference (TORs) for multi-year expenditure plans in
  education, health androads & buildings.
  Status. Completed. A report on a medium-term strategy and expenditure framework for health has
  been prepared and the sectoral budget links with the overall fiscal program are likely to be
  strengthened. Preparation o f the education sector MTEF was not approved by GoI, and therefore, the
  MTEFfor education was not established. To move forward onthe expenditure planningagenda, itwas
  decided by all concerned parties (GoAP, the Bank and DFID) to prepare TORs for multi-year
  expenditure plans for three key departments (education, health and roads & buildings) and agree on
  actions.

0 Action 5. Completion o f the State Financial Accountability Assessment and related action program
  covering the State Government; satisfactory progress towards implementation o f agreed financial
  accountability actions (reducing backlog o f accounts and audit o f 1999-00--2000-0 1;responses to audit
  report o f State Government; measures to improve some identifiedinternal control issues).
  Status. Completed. GoAP completed a State Financial Accountability Assessment in May 2003. An
  SFAA Implementation Committee was formed in September 2003 through a Government Order (GO
  417) to take forward and monitor the implementation o f the SFAA action plan. Significant steps have
  already been taken to strengthen accountability in furtherance o f the action plan. These include the
  issuance o f a Government Order (GO 451) which defines the accountability o f senior level Controlling
  Officers and links release o f funds to the proper discharge o f their fiduciary responsibilities. Related
  instructions have been issued to Treasuries requiring them to ensure that financial norms have been met
  before releasing funds and give guidance to controlling and disbursing officers in the form o f
  handbooks on financial accountability. A worhng group was established on internal audit, chaired by
  the Principal Finance Secretary, and a review o f existing internal audit functions was carried out by the
  Institute o f Chartered Accountants. Decisions have been made on the structure and functioning o f the
  internal audit, including the introduction o f systems audits and some outsourcing to private sector
  professional auditing firms. There has been a significant reduction inthe backlog o f local government
  accounts and audits. Within 5 months o f the release o f the 2000-01 report, the relevant departments
  responded to 16 o f the 63 (25 percent) audit paragraphsh-eviews. This is an improvement over the
  response to the 1999-2000 report, when only 20 o f the total 69 ( 28 percent) paragraphsheviews were
  respondedto inthe whole year.

0 Action 6. Formulation and implementation of comprehensive policy on government guarantees,
  including, inter alia, setting an aggregate cap on guarantees, methodology for assessing merit and risk
  o f individual guarantees, norms for budgetary provisioning for government guarantees, and
  establishment o f guarantee fees.



                                                   32

  Status. Completed.       A comprehensive policy on government guarantees has been prepared and is
  operational. A Guarantee RedemptionFundhas been established.

0 Action 7. Implementation o fan elective government payroll computerization system.
  Status. Completed. This measure provides state employees the option o f either receiving their salary
  payments in cash or having them transferred to their commercial bank account. In urban centers,
  around 90 percent o f GoAP employees now receive their salaries through Banks.
  Governance andpublic managementreform

0 Action 8. Establishment o f the Poverty and Social Analysis Monitoring Unit, and identification by the
  State Poverty Eradication Mission (SPEM) o f key poverty monitoring indicators, establishment o f a
  baseline, and implementation o f mechanisms for the regular updating and monitoring o f poverty
  indicators.
  Revised Action 8. Establishment o f the Poverty and Social Analysis Monitoring Unit (PSAMU),
  identification o f a preliminary list o f key poverty monitoring indicators, and preparation o f a Draft
  "Consolidation o f the Poverty EradicationAction Plan."
  Status. Completed. The Poverty and Social Analysis Monitoring Unit has been established and is
  operational. A draft consolidated poverty eradication action plan has been prepared, which includes a
  draft list o f poverty indicators that will be regularly monitored and disseminated. The final list o f
  indicators and the baseline will be developed following further consultations.        Mechanisms for
  updating, monitoring and disseminating the poverty indicators are being developed as part o f the
  Action Plan.

0 Action 9. Formulation and implementationo f measures to advance deregulation to relax constraints to
  business environment and growth, including legislation on enhancing the effectiveness o f the single
  window investment clearance system, and implementation o f measures to reform the business
  inspection regime.
  Status. Completed.      Legislation has been passed and i s being implemented with good results. In
  August 2003, 94 percent o f large and medium industries and 82 percent o f small scale industries
  received approvals within the prescribed time limit. Proposals for the simplification o f inspection
  procedures have been prepared by the Confederation of Indian Industry and Pricewaterhouse-Coopers,

  Revised Action 12. Initiation with a firm timetable o f the second (revised) procurement review and
  action plan. Initiation o f recommended measures, including inter alia: strengthening o f transparency in
  the bidding process, publishing o f large tenders on the internet, improving the system for handling
  complaints, and increasing GoAP's value for money instate procurement.
  Status. Completed. Following a request from GoAP, an initial procurement review was prepared by
  DFID consultants, but its quality was deemed unacceptable. After several iterations between GoAP,
  procurement experts in the Bank and in DFID, TORS were approved for a second (revised)
  procurement review. Global Procurement Consultants Limited have been recruited to do the second
  (revised) review, which i s underway and i s expected to be completed by December 2003. An e-

    has been issued to fix a minimum tenure o f three years for deputation o f personnel to the
    Anticorruption Bureau, and to allow their premature transfer only with the approval o f the Vigilance
    Commissioner. (iii)GoAP has agreed to proposed budget increases for the ACB and VED o f 50
    percent this year and 20 percent ineach o f the following two years, along with a plan for strengthening
    staffing inthese departments.
    Action 13. Establishment o f a computerized humanresourcemanagement database.
    RevisedAction 13. Design a comprehensive human resource management module as a sub component
    o f the SmartGovt. E-governance initiative.
    Status. Completed. GoAP continues to make solid progress in this area. A comprehensive HRh4
    module has been designed as a major sub-component o f the SmartGovt. e-governance initiative. It
    should be expanded to cover four major departments comprising over half the civil service by March
    2004, with complete roll-out scheduled for December 2004.
    Action 14. Submission o fthe Rightto Information Billto the State Legislative Assembly.
    Revised Action 14. Initiate preparation to implement the Freedomo f Information Legislation (Act. No.
    5 o f 2003, Go1 Freedom o f Information Act).      Draft rules that provide for an independent appeals
    process, penalties for non-compliance, and aggressive, department-specific suo-mot0 disclosure
    requirements.
    Status. Completed. A bill was drafted and was submitted to the Cabinet where some discussion
    ensued, resulting in the bill being referred to a Cabinet sub-committee for further consideration. AP
    now plans to use GoI's Right to Information Act, which was passed by Parliament in early 2003.
    GoAP translated the Go1act into Urduand Telegu, drafted its own rules to strengthen the central act,
    andprepared a training module on Freedomo f Information.
(iv)   Fiduciary Issues
101. Financial management. As discussed above (paragraph 57), the recently completed State Financial
Accountability Assessment provides an in depth analysis o f the strengths and weaknesses o f the financial
control environment in the State Government. The report's findings are strongly supported by evidence
and provide a satisfactory basis on which to make a fiduciary assessment o f the operations of the State
Govemment itself.
102. The World Bank/DFID team found the fiduciary risk to be significant to moderate, but that it i s
declining as a direct result o f the measures already taken by government. This assessment rests on the
following broad conclusions:

0   Effective budgetary control over core expenditures is achieved through the provision o f funds to line
    departments on a timely and predictable basis, in line with the budget, and throughthe operation o f the
    centralized Treasury system.

0   Weaknesses exist regarding funds managed outside the central Treasury system.

0   The GoAP's action plan addresses the key issues raised inthe SFAA, and the analysis i s to be extended
    to cover local government andpublic sector undertakings.
103. As discussed earlier (paragraph 59), GoAP has started implementing the SFAA action program.
Tracking the implementation will be one of the key means by which the Bank obtains fiduciary assurance.


                                                     34

The other main plank will be continued monitoring to ensure that progress achieved during APERL 1 i s
sustained and institutionalized.
104. Procurement. GoAP has identifiedprocurement as a key area inachieving SMART government and
i s seeking to upgrade its practices to improve transparency and accountability and achieve better value for
money. Options for pursuingthis include introducing new procurement legislation and issuing a general
govemment order, as well as the use o f e-Procurement. GoAP has requested technical assistance from
DFIDon improving and upgrading its procurement practices and policies, and a consultancy towards this
end should complete its work by December 2003, when it will provide a report to the GoAP's Committee
on Procurement chaired by the Principal Secretary, Information Technology. The assessment will be fairly
comprehensive in scope, ranging from the current bidding process and system o f tender evaluation and
review/approval committees, to post-award issues o f contract management, quality control and/or inventory
management, including legislation.        To ensure the consistency o f this work with Bank procurement
assessments in other Indian states, such as Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, Bank
procurement staff have been involved in the preparation and conduct o f this study. GoAP i s making
significant progress in the area o f e-Procurement, which was launched on a pilot basis in four departments
in January 2002, with an annual procurement of Rs. 1,441 crore (approximately $306 million). Current
plans call for rolling it out across govemment inthe next two years.
(v)    EnvironmentalManagement
105. GoAP pays serious attention to the environmental sustainability o f its growth agenda.            Several
environmental goals have been outlined in Vision 2020. AP has one o f the best performing Pollution
Control Boards in India. The Bank has been actively involved with GoAP on environmental management
issues over the past several years, from assisting in strengthening the AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB)
to assessing the impact o f environmental risk factors on health. As part o f its efforts to achieve the Vision
2020 environmental goals, GoAP has agreed with the Bank on a three-year program o f non-lending
technical assistance to improve environmental management capacity in several departments. The main
thrust o f this program is to assist GoAP in undertalung upstream strategic environmental assessments in
selected key growth areas and inpiloting the resulting institutional and policy initiatives to better integrate
environmental and sectoral objectives.
106. An environmental due diligence process has been introduced for the public enterprise reform
program. In this context, with the help o f DFID-financed consultants, the Implementation Secretariat o f
GoAP carries out environmental audits on enterprises that are targeted for privatization. These audits
identify existing as well as anticipated future environmental liabilities inthe enterprise. The audit report i s
available to the registered bidders for their study and due diligence on the enterprise. The enterprise is
asked to furnish the Pollution Control Board's consents and duly comply with the conditions if any before
the enterprise i s transferred to the purchaser. Bidders are given one year to complete environmental clean-
up. Environmentalissues will bemore importantinPhase I1as the larger and more complex enterprises are
dealt with. A detailed manual on environmental auditing was prepared in M a y 2002, which sets out the
specific steps involved. The practice o f usingtechnical experts to carry out the audits will continue.


                                      G.   FUTURE   APERL OPERATIONS

107. Future APERL operations will depend upon the pace and depth o f AP's ongoing reform program.
Assuming continued successful in GoAP's reform efforts, two more adjustment operations are envisaged
after APERL 2 over the next two to three years (Table 1l),   bringingthe total amount o fAPERL adjustment
lending over the five-year period from 2001-02 to 2006-07 to US$ 1.4 billion. The support amount i s
projected to increase in the outer years, when the reform process is expected to be more difficult and
require more effort. This principle o f back-end loading i s also aimed at incentivizing reforms.          The
indicated amounts in Table 11 will be adjusted and/or the timing o f assistance changed, depending upon
progress on the agreed actions. The amounts indicated in Table 11are also subject to resource availability
on the part o f the funding agencies.

            Note: The timings of future APERLs are indicative. APERL 3 would be processed upon meeting of the key actions.



108. Several actions ineight key areas are indicative for a future APE= 3, and would need to be largely
met before the operation can go forward (expected to be processed in late 2004 or early 2005). The areas
and actions are as follows:
      Poverty reduction. Inconsultation with the main line departments, the Consolidated Action Plan for
      Poverty Reductioni s finalized and i s operational.
      Agricultural and industrial growth. The state's investment climate i s improved by introducing
       legislation that (a) amends the "Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Market Act,"
      which will bring about greater liberalization o f agncultural wholesale markets, and (b) implements
       the "Special Enclave Service Condition and Dispute Resolution Act o f 2003," which will expedite
      the resolution o f industrial disputes.
      Fiscal consolidation. Primary and consolidated fiscal deficit targets and expenditure composition
       target are attained annually inaccordance with the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, and legislation
       i s introduced for the annual presentationo f the MTFF along with the budget.
      Public expenditure and financial management. The reforms in public expenditure and financial
       management as identified inthe State Financial Accountability Assessment are continued including
       (i) pendingauditparagraphs for2001-02 and2002-03 repliedtotheAccountant General; (ii)
            all
       maintenance o f timely resource releases; and (iii)             intemal audit unit established and functioning.
      Privatization and disinvestment. Phase I1o f the Public Enterprise Reformprogram i s implemented
       and program targets for 2003-04 and 2004-05 are achieved.
      Governance. An anticonuption action plan i s implemented with good progress (on the basis o f
       agreed milestones) in expanding the independence, capacity and effectiveness o f the anticorruption
       agencies. Legislation i s introduced in the Assembly to strengthen public procurement, and the e-
       procurement program i s implementedconsistent with existing milestones.
      Power sector. As key steps towards commercializationo f the power sector andreadying distribution
       companies for privatization, the sector's financial vulnerability and risks are mitigated by (i)
       reducingthe revenue subsidy support paid by GoAP (not to exceed Rs.15.13 billion in2003-04, and
       Rs. 14.11 billion in 2004-05) as per the sector's Business Plan, (ii)                        moving towards full cost
       recovery through tariffs in the distribution business (reaching at least 85 percent by 2003-04 and 88
       percent by 2004-05), to be achieved through efficiency improvement, tariff rationalization and
       reduced subsidies, (iii)         implementing the universal metering plan as approved by the APERC and
       (iv) finalizing an alternative mechanism to deliver subsidies to agricultural consumers to be fully
       implemented in at least one district serviced by each o f the four distribution companies from April
       2005.
      Education sector.         (1)  Class-to-class transition rates are increased at the elementary level leading to
       improved achievement inmathematics and languages at Grades 3 and 5, and (ii)                            student and teacher
       attendance is raised over a mutually agreed upon baseline.                           Assessment o f transition rates,

                                                                  36

        achievement levels in mathematics and language, student and teacher attendance i s done on a
        sample basis by an independent agency.
109. Achievement o f these key milestones will indicate that GoAP is sharpening the focus o f its policies
and programs to ensure that they make a greater contribution to poverty reduction and help move the state
closer to its development goals. Regular monitoring o f poverty and related key programs will ensure that
the latter are better targeted in addressing the needs o f the poor. It will mean that the government as a
whole-as     opposed to say, the rural development department-is        fully involved and responsible for
achieving the goal o f eradicating poverty inAI'. The two pieces o f legislationwill help improve the state's
investment climate by removing structural impediments to growth. Achievement o f the fiscal, public
expenditure and financial management actions will indicate that GoAP i s continuing its good work in fiscal
consolidation and that resources are made available on time for line departments to deliver effective and
efficient public services. Continued success in Phase I1of the PE reform program will ensure that the
government continues to move away from areas where the rationale for government involvement and
control i s weakest. Achievements in the area o f governance will move the state closer to its objective o f
having a SMART Government. The stated reforms in the power sector will put the sector's finances on a
structurally sound footing that will be less affected by external shocks. Moreover, the sector will be ready
for distribution privatization, which will further improve its efficiency when completed.       Finally, the
envisaged reforms inthe education sector will help the state move closer to its Vision 2020 targets.


                              H. LESSONS        LEARNED,    BENEFITSANDRISKS

(i) LessonsLearned
110. The current operation benefits from several important lessons drawn from AP's first policy based
lending program, two previous adjustment programs inKarnataka and Uttar Pradesh, and the Bank's wider
experience with adjustment lending.
    Research and experience suggest that reform programs are much more likely to succeed when there i s
    strong country ownership. External agencies such as the Bank can then help facilitate that process by
    providing technical and financial support. The AP experience clearly confirms this conclusion. The
    state has a well-defined medium-term reformprogram to achieve the targets listed in Vision 2020. The
    government regularly monitors progress against these targets and makes appropriate adjustments. The
    Bank and other external agencies are assisting the state-financially   and technically-in  pursuing this
    agenda.
    Bank-wide experience shows that our lending program must be supported by sound analytical work.
    On each component o f the reform program supported by APERL 2, there has been some analytical
    work done in the last 12 months. More specifically, due diligence notes have been prepared on a
    variety o f topics including poverty, fiscal, governance, public expenditure and financial management,
    public enterprises, agriculture and rural development, education, health and power. Other formal
    reports completed include a growth study, a fiscal report, a state financial accountability assessment
    (done by the client), and sectoral studies on school education, health, environment and water resource
    management.
    A series of single-tranche adjustment operations are better suited for supporting a multi-year reform
    process. While this entails higher administrative costs for the Bank, the process contributes to good
    incentives. It also helps provide an exit strategy for the Bank ifthe reformprogram falters. Inthe case
    o f AP, the proposed follow-up adjustment operation is based on a continuation o f the government's
    reform program, which meets the pre-specified lending criteria specified in the previous operation. If
    the state continues to move forward on its reform agenda, future adjustment support, subject to the
    approval of all concerned parties, i s likely to continue.

    Iti s important to institutionalizereforms as early aspossible. In the last couple o fyears, AP's budget
    management reformprogram has advanced impressively, with the introduction o f a medium term fiscal
    framework, a new budget release mechanism, and a draft budget for state-wide consultations prior to
    the annual budget process. These reforms have yet to be fully institutionalized, however, and the
    momentum for moving this agenda forward could start weakening with the transfer o f the main
    architect o f these reforms. For example, the task o f revising the MTFF has been delayed. This
    experience highlights the importance o f institutionalizing reforms, and the proposed operation
    emphasizes institutionalizing the MTFF process through formal legislation, which would mandate the
    presentation o f a medium-term fiscal analysis and the implications for annual fiscal outcomes and debt
    stabilization targets along with the annual budget.

    Although the pace o f progress o f different components o f a govemment owned reformprogram varies,
    it i s important to identify the critical elements of theprogram, where progress has to be sustained in
    order for the overall program to remain credible. For example, it i s clear that unless the financial
    performance o f AP's power sector is continually improved, overall fiscal reforms will remain tentative.
    The first loan didnot have any specific actions for the follow-up operation that were directly related to
    the financial performance o f the power sector.       In contrast, APERL 2 contains key actions for a
    possible future APERL 3, including actions that have a direct linkwith the financial performance o f the
    power sector, such as targets for cost recovery from tariffs.

    Adjustment programs need to show sensitivity to local political conditions. Power sector reforms in
    India are complex and politically difficult. The sequencing o f reforms, the pace o f progress and the
    achievement o f outcomes i s significantly affected by political considerations. For example, agriculture
    metering and tariffs are major issues in AP (as in several other Indian states as well).            While
    recognizing the need for improved power sector financial performance, APERL 2 i s sensitive to the
    politics o f agriculture metering and tariffs, and focuses the key power sector action for a future APERL
    3 on overall cost recovery targets, which i s consistent with GoAP's own revisedpower sector business
    plan.
(ii) Benefits
111. AP's development progress over the years is well documented.               More importantly, GoAP i s
committed to malung further progress towards achieving its development targets as outlined in Vision 2020.
The proposed follow-up adjustment operation recognizes AP's efforts inimproving the lives o f its citizens.
It provides an important signal to the development community that the state's reform efforts are being
noticed and supported.
112. The components o f AP's reform program that are being supported by APERLs will help the state in
achieving better socioeconomic outcomes and reduce poverty. More specifically:

    Coordinating an action program with different line departments will help GoAP reduce poverty.
    Strengthening poverty analysis and monitoring will facilitate more informed decisions and help reorient
    policies and programs for a greater impact on poverty.

    Supporting efforts to improve the state's highlyinflexible labor market i s likely to help AP move closer
    to its highgrowth targets.

    Malung further progress in privatizing and restructuring public enterprises will start generating fiscal
    savings.

    Consolidating the fiscal accounts further and reducing borrowing to finance revenue expenditures will
    continue to generate savings on interest and will create space for allocating more resources towards
    enhancing growth and reducing poverty, such as raising capital spending, non-wage O&M and social
    sector spending.

    Supporting public expenditure, financial management as well as the governance reform agendas will
    ensure that (a) budget releases to line departments and other agencies are timely and predictable, and

                                                        38

    (b) budget appropriations are being spent on the intended activities, promoting better service delivery
    to citizens.

0   Continuing to reduce power sector losses will improve the financial situation o f the sector and it will
    put the distribution companies in a much better position to provide good service to their clients.
    Moreover, financial savings in the power sector will free up resources for spending on other
    development priorities.
(iii) Risks
113. Major risks to the government's medium-term reformprogram can be characterized as follows:

0   Fiscal risks. Fiscal targets inthe outer years o f the MTFFbecome tighter and there i s very little room
    for slackness. While GoAP has shown remarkable commitment in keeping deficits down in the past
    two years, the real test o f fiscal discipline will be inthe coming years, particularly inthe election year
    2003-04.     Will the govemment reduce its spending-as              it has done in the past two years-if   its
    projected revenue (including those from the central government) fails to materialize? Can the deficit
    target be achieved in an election year? While much o f this fiscal risk is impossible to avoid, improved
    fiscal monitoring with statements published on the internet every six months will at least provide early
    warning if fiscal discipline weakens. The revised Second MTFF has adjusted the fiscal targets taking
    into account the state o f the economy and its impact on revenue-both          interms of the anticipated size
    of fiscal devolution from the national govemment as well as its own revenue.

0   Power sector risks. The power sector continues to pose substantial financial risks to the public budget.
    These risks are due to (i)       the difficulty o f reducing power subsidies to agnculture and residential
    consumers, and o f metering agriculture consumers, (ii)        the lower than projected growth in sales to HT-
    industries and the higher sales to agriculture consumers, (iii)the inability to further improve
    operational efficiency, and (iv) the failure o f distribution privatization. The evolution o f the market
    and industrial structure in the next 2-3 years as per the Electricity Act 2003, may also cause
    uncertainties inthe cost and revenues o fthe power companies.
    The national Electricity Act 2003, which mandatesmetering o f all consumers inthe next two years, and
    continued pressures from APERC are likely to assist in mitigating the power sector risks. The pilots
    initiated by GoAP's Task Force, through increased communication and consultation with farmers, are
    working towards improving the acceptance o f metering.25 GoAP i s also planning to test alternative
    mechanisms to deliver subsidies to farmers, which i s likely to assist in mitigating the agnculture
    subsidy risk impingingcommercializationand privatization o f distribution. The risk of low growth in
    sales to HT-industries i s to be mitigated through continued rationalization o f industrial tariffs and
    implementation o f the tariff incentive scheme. GoAP needs to strictly adhere to its policy o f supply
    regulation to agriculture. The APERC has devised a number o f mechanisms which mitigate these risks.
    First, monthly monitoring and review is expected to minimize the risks o f delays in efficiency
    improvements that have been assumed in the sector's business plan. Second, under the 2004 tariff
    order, it has established a mechanism o f a Fuel Surcharge Adjustment in retail tariffs which allows
    automatic pass through every quarter o f increased power purchase costs stemming from uncontrollable
    elements, such as hydro power generation shortfall. This will enable distribution companies to mitigate
    the financial risk associated with drought, which makes otherwise relatively cheaper hydro power
    generation less attractive and forces generation from more expensive thermal sources. Fromthe Bank`s
    standpoint, the team plans to continue tracking power sector performance on a quarterly basis to
    anticipate any significant variations inthese critical factors.

0   External shocks. Relatively poor monsoons inthe last three years have affected the performance o f the
    agriculture sector, which continues to provide the livelihood o f over 60 percent o f the state's labor
    force.   Another bad monsoon would put a further strain the state's economy (though early reports

*'Ina rural co-operativesocietynearly 50 percentoffarmers haveopted for metering.

                                                            39

    suggest a normal monsoon for 2003-04).        Increased diversification o f the agriculture sector, crop
    substitution, and the adoption o f drip irrigation have helped the state soften the impact of the poor
    monsoons.

e   Political risks. With elections in 2004, policy priorities may change and may differ from those being
    pursued as part o f the current reform agenda. Reduced commitment to the reformprogram, particularly
    ifitnegativelyaffects the financially vulnerable power sector, wouldleadto delays or alossof
    financial support from Go1and the Bank
114. The single most important risk mitigating factor to GoAP'sreform program is its past success. It i s
worth noting that AP i s one o f the major reforming states inIndia with full reform ownership. AP's strong
track record suggests that the reformprogram i s becoming self-sustaining, inthat improvements interms o f
growth and human development inthe recent past are contributing to the further sustainability o fthe reform
program.
115. The Bank's adjustment program also seeks to minimize risks. While APERLs generally support the
medium-term reform program o f GoAP, each APERL provides financial support on the basis o f progress
made against a set o f monitorable actions that were identified in the previous loan. More specifically,
APERL 2 fundingis inrecognition o fGoAP's satisfactory completion o fa set o factions that were outlined
inAPERL 1. Loolung ahead, the APERL 2 document outlines a similar set of measures that will underpin
a decision to process a possible future loan.

                                  A.       Implementationof reforms: Achievementsduring2002-03
1.      There has been continued good progress in implementation o f structural, regulatory and governance
reforms inAP duringthe last two years. Some key reformachievements include:

0   Independent functioning of the distribution companies. Independent Board o f Directors for each o f
     the discoms have been appointed, transfer o f employees post unbundling completed, and senior
     managers with appropriate skills and experience have been appointed through a competitive selection
     process.        Several initiatives to develop the regulatory, finance, commercial and customer service
     functions have been completed and continued improvements are underway. Performance monitoring
     and reporting system to monitor employee performance against pre-set performance targets has been
     established and i s operating successfully.

0    Sector Regulation. APERC has set an impressive track record o f operating through a transparent
     regulatory processes, with the involvement o f various stakeholders and public and has demonstrated its
     ability to take independent decisions. The Commission has issued regulation on Long Term Tariff
     Principles, defined customer service standards o f performance; and stipulated merit order dispatch for
     all generating stations to foster efficiency inpower procurement. The most recent regulatory order on
     Fuel Surcharge Adjustment will allow quarterly adjustments in the tariffs on account o f change in the
     fuel prices and in the generation mix due to uncertainties in hydro generation, thereby mitigating the
     financial risks o f the hydro failure.

0    Governance and efficiency improvements. AP has been a leader among the Indian states inimproving
     power sector governance and setting new benchmarks inits transparent management. The government
     and the companies have implemented impressive measures to control electricity theft, eliminate
     corruption and improve efficiency. It i s the first state to enact anti-theft legislation and its effective
     enforcement - 150,000 theft cases were registered during 2001-03 as against 9,200 cases in 11 years
     from 1989-2000. About 4100 consumers and more than 50 employees have been arrested for theft o f
     electricity.

0    Improvements in access, availability and quality of supply and services, About 3000 MWs o f new
     generation capacity has been added in the state's power system since 1999 (an increase o f 40 percent),
     resulting inimproved availability o f power. Electricity access rate has increasedto 67 percent. Power
     supply quality indicators have improved - reduction intransformer failures, improvementsinvoltages,
     and reduction in supply interruptions. Customer Care Centers for handling commercial complaints,
     help-lines for lodging technical and commercial complaints, and developing customer databases have
     also positively influenced utility-customer interface and contributedto improvements inservice quality.
                                           B.      FinancialPerformanceandFiscalImplications
2.      While financial performance o f the sector has improved since the initiation o f reforms, it i s short o f
the expectations o f the Business Plans prepared by GoAP and the utilities. Duringthe period 2000-02 the
sector incurred an annual loss o f about Rs.30 billion, causing enormous burden on the state's finances i.e.
nearly 2 percent o f GSDP.'                The financial performance in 2001-02 was particularly poor and losses
exceeded the expectations reflected in the government's medium term fiscal framework (MTFF) by 28
percent (Figure 1). Severe country-wide drought duringthis year resulting in low hydro-power generation
and increaseddemand for irrigationhad an adverse impact on the financial losses o f the power utilities.



IUnder the Annual Revenue Requirement (Am) and Tariff review process, APERC approves the quantum o f GoAP subsidy based on full
cost tariffs determined by APERC and retail tariffs approved. This subsidy essentially goes towards providing subsidy to agriculture,
residential consumers and rural electricity co-operative societies. Duringthe last three years the losses incurred by the utilities have been
muchhigher than that projected under the A W T a r i f f order mainly on account of increasedcost o f power purchase due to decline inhydro
generation, govemment's decision to increase power supply to agriculture consumers and under-realization of efficiency improvement
targets by the utilities. Under such situation the actual support provided by GOAP at the end o f the fiscal year has been much higher than
the subsidy approved by the regulator at thebeginning ofthe fiscal year.

                                                                                                                       Annex B
                                                                                                                     Page 2 of 7


3.     Financialperformance has improved in 2002-03. The power sector deficit was reduced to Rs.19.1
billion despite a difficult drought.*. The revenue subsidy support o f Rs. 18.8 billion from the government
duringthis year was 27 percent lower comparedto the previous year and only 5 percent higher than Rs.17.9
billion projected under the MTFF. This has been achieved through effective implementation o f the
APERC's directives on power supply, continued efficiency improvements in metering, billing and
collection, reduction in T&D losses and increase in sales to HT-industrial consumers. Through effective
supply regulationandextensive communicationwiththe farmers onthe power supply situation, crop choice
etc, utilities were able to contain the level of supply to agnculture during 2002-03 to 2001-02 level. Total
revenue has shown a marked increase o f Rs.15 billion, and average cost recovery through tariffs has
improved from 70 percent in2001-02 to 79 percent in2002-03. AP has qualified to receive cash support as
incentive for reducing the gap between average cost o f supply and revenue, under the GoI's Accelerated
Power Reforms and Development Program (APDRP) for 2002-03.

4.      Some o f the areas where AP's power sector has performedwell with a positive impact on its finances
include:
     A turnaround in HT sales - After a five year period o f declining sales to HT industrial consumers there
     has been a remarkable 26 percent growth in the sales during 2002-03 following the tariff incentive
     scheme introduced by APERC. In 2003-04 HT-industrial tariffs have been further reduced3 and
     incentive scheme continued till 2004-05. There has been continued year on year progress on reduction
     incross subsidies. As apolicy decision APERC set a cap of 15 percent tariff increase for subsidizing
     categories in its first tariff order. In subsequent tariff orders this cap has decreased and now stands at
     zero for some categories and negative for HT-industries. Tariffs have declined inreal terms. For HT-
     industries tariffs have been reduced from a maximum of Rs.3.95kWh in 2001-02 to Rs.3.60kWh in

e      Debt restructuring - utilities have restructured their expensive debt. Outstanding dues o f about Rs.25.3
       billion to central generating stations have been securitized as low interest bonds o f GoAP, reducing

5.        Power supply to agriculture measurement and subsidy issues: Like other states inIndia, Andhra
                                                   -
has adopted a policy o f providing subsidy for agricultural productionthrough low electricity tariff. Tariffs
for agriculture are lowest among all the states in the country and have not been revised in the last three
years. Average per unitrealization from agriculture in2002-03 i s estimated at only Rs.0.3lkWh (covering
only 11 percent o f the average cost of supply) in comparison to Rs.l.llkWh in Rajasthan, Rs.0.55 in
Karnataka and Rs.1.32kWh in Uttar Pradesh. Metering o f agriculture consumers i s another area where
progress i s lachng, inspite o f directives for full metering provided by the APERC. After several years o f
following this practice o f un-metered and subsidized power supply, farmer interests in maintaining these
concessions are firmly entrenched, and the issues have become highly politicized. Subsidies delivered
under the present flat-rate tariff system are regressive and benefit large farmers much more than the small
and marginal farmers. Externalities like overuse o f water and uneconomic crop choices are some o f the
negative outcomes o f the tariff subsidy policy. Improving the service provided to farmers, containing costs
and enhancing cost recovery and viable means o f regulating and measuring supply to agriculture, constitute
key challenges for GoAP incommercializing the power sector.
6.        Subsidies for domestic consumers: In 2002-03 the average revenue fkom residential consumers
covered about 81 percent o f the average cost o f upp ply.^                      Tariffs for the large residential consumers are
today perhaps highest in                     however tariff for the lowest consumption block (upto 50 k W m o n t h ) even
after an increase o f 70 percent inJuly 2000 and 7 percent inMarch 2001, are low compared to several other
states.6 Infuture any increase inthe power purchase costs on account o f uncontrollable factors i s proposed
to be passed on to residential consumers through fuel adjustment surcharge. With the government's plans
o f increasing the electricity access to all the habitations by 2007, adequate tariff adjustments will be
requiredto keep the operating subsidies at a sustainable level.
                                 C.       PhaseIIReformsand SectoralBusinessPlan(2003-04 to 2005-06)
7.        Inthenextphase ofreformsGoAP aims to pursue achievingfinancial viability for the power sector
through further commercialization, efficiency improvements and reforms. The objective i s to progressively
achieve full cost recovery through tariffs and limit power sector operating subsidies at a minimal and
fiscally affordable level. The government's business plan highlights the following structural and policy
measures inthe mediumterm time frame.

e        Tariff rationalization and cost recovery.Discoms plan to progressively improve cost recovery through
        tariffs in the medium term - from 79 percent in 2002-03 to 88 percent by 2004-05 and further to 96
        percent by 2006-07. This is proposed to be achieved through tariff rationalization, cost reduction and
        efficiency improvements. Measures for reduction in cross subsidy will be continued and attempts will
        be made to move tariffs close to cost o f service to the consumers.

e      Agriculture power supply and metering. Maintaining supply to agriculture consumers as per the
        government's regulation policy and in accordance with the regulatory directives. All new agriculture
        consumer and horticulture consumers are being metered. Utilities have submitted their metering plan



  APERC follows consumer category-wise cost o f service approach intariff determination (perhaps the only regulatory commission inthe
country). As per this approach the cost o f service to residential consumers in2003-04 is estimated Rs. 4.64.kWh. The cost recovery as per
cost of service approach is about 53 percent.

  Residential tariffs were increased substantially in July 2000 (69-300 percent across various consumption blocks), which lead to serious
agitation inthe state, inwhich three people lost their life. InApril 2001, APERC reduced the tariffs to mitigate the impact o f tariff shock in
its first tariff order (tariff for the lowest consumption block was not reduced). Tariffs were revised upward again inApril 2002.

  Tariffs for residential consumers consuming 50 kWh per month are (as on March 2002) : AP - Rs. 1.35/kWh;                   Kamataka - Rs.
2.05kWh; Madhya Pradesh- Rs. 1.10 kWh (plus 0.65 kWh FSA); Maharashtra-Rs. 1.45kWh; Orissa -Rs. 1.05kWh; and Rajasthan
-Rs.1.53kWh

    to the APERC and propose to complete 100 percent metering, based on the directions provided by the
    regulator.

0   Alternate subsidy delivery mechanism. Task Force on power supply to agriculture has submitted its
    report to GOAP on alternate mechanisms to provide subsidy to agriculture consumers. Based on the
    government's approval, the altemative(s) will be pilot tested duringnext 15-18 months, and the strategy
    finalized to be implemented from April 2005.' Task Force's report on subsidy delivery mechanism has
    evaluated and considered, among others, the option o f direct payment to farmers. It i s expected that
    with the implementation o f alternate subsidy delivery mechanism, subsidy would be provided by the
    government directly to agnculture consumers and not channeled throughpower utility.

0   Distribution Privatization. GoAP intends to lock in efficiency gains achieved in the first stage of
    reforms through privatization o f distribution business. Draft privatization strategy prepared with the
    assistance o f international investment bankers i s under review and some measures initiated to achieve
    key conditions precedents for privatization. One o f the main risks highlightedby the advisors pertains
    to power supply to agnculture- metering, cost recovery and subsidy payment. Many o f these actions
    are in-fact critical to the commercialization o f the sector even under government ownership. GoAP
    will finalize the privatization strategy and take actions by March 2005, to meet the conditions
    precedents required for launchingthe transaction.

0   Multi-buyer model and open access : Inaccordance with the provisions of the National Electricity Act
    2003 to separate the transmission and trading function and introduction o f open access, AP i s planning
    to move from the present sector structure to a multi-buyer model with direct contracting between the
    generators and distributors. This i s expected to enhance commercialization o f the sector and reduce
    costs through efficiency inpower procurement. An initial feasibility study on implementation o f multi-
    buyer model has been carried out with the assistance o f international consultants. It i s plannedto move
    to multi-buyer model by March 2005. Open access for the retail consumers will be implemented
    according to the APERC's directives to be issued, as per the provisions o fElectricity Act 2003.

0   Improving electricity access in rural areas - GoAP i s committedto provide electricity access inall the
    habitations in the state by FY2005-06. The utilities and GoAP are discussing service delivery models
    and financing arrangements for improving access. Structural shift from the present operating subsidy
    regime to a framework o f capital subsidy for access within fiscally affordable limitswill be required.
8.    According to power sector business plan approved by the GoAP, sector's losses are projected to
reduce from Rs.19.1 billion in 2002-03 to Rs.12.5 billion in 2004-05 and to Rs.0.5 billion in 2006-07
(Figure 3). Power sector's EBIDTA (aggregate for generation, transmission and distribution companies)
turned around to become positive in2002-03 (based on provision financial information). The EBITDA for
all the discoms i s expected to become positive from 2005-06. The projected improvement in financial
performance i s based on : (i)         an average 8.3 percent annual growth in electricity sales during 2002-03 to
2006-07, comprising 14.5 percent CAGR for HT-industries, 14.3 percent CAGR for residential consumers
resulting from load growth and 24 hours power supply in rural areas from 2004-05 and (-) 3.3 percent
CAGR for agriculture consumers to be realized through a combination o f measures including tariff
rationalization, feeder separation, effective supply regulation, metering and D S M measures. (ii)                   reduction
in transmission losses from 7.5 percent to 5 percent, and distribution losses from 19.7 percent to 14.5
percent, from 2002-03 to 2006-07 respectively; (iii)         increase inrevenue realization resulting from increase
inload, tariffrationalizationandimprovements inmetering, billingandcollection efficiency; (iv)reduction
inpower procurement costs through Genco's operational efficiency improvement, and strict adherence to



'Implementation is to berolledout in a phasedmanner; GoAP plans to roll out the new subsidydelivery mechanism in four districtsand
thenexpandit to other partsof the state.

9.      Although the financial health o f the sector has improved in 2002-03 and is forecast to continue to
improve, significant downside financial risks to the sector arise from: (i)                        difficulty inreducing subsidies for
agriculture and residential consumers, and metering o f apculture consumers; (ii)                               variations in the load
forecast and sales mix, specifically lower than projected sales growth for industry and higher growth in
sales to agriculture (iii)        inability to further increase and sustain operational efficiency improvement gains,
particularly collection efficiency and (iv) failure o f distribution privatization efforts. In the absence o f
meaningful solution for power supply to agriculture and mitigation o f the subsidy payment risk,
privatization o f discoms under the current structural configuration will remain a big challenge. Enactment
o f the National Electricity Act 2003 will have significant impact on the industryand market structure of the
power sector in the coming years. There are therefore likely to be uncertainties in costs and revenues
imposedby evolution o f the market structure inthe next 2-3 years.
10.     Agriculture metering and cost recovery is a difficult issue, as in other states. It i s expected that the
new Electricity Act, through its provision o f metering o f all consumers innext two years, and continued
pressures from APERC will help to mitigate this risk. The pilots initiatedby GoAP's Task Force, through
increased communication and consultation with the farmers attempting to increase the acceptance o f
metering by the farmers.'             GoAP is also planning to pilot test alternate mechanisms to deliver subsidy to
farmers, which will assist in mitigating agriculture subsidy risk for commercialization and privatization of
the distribution business. For successful privatization o f distribution business, the conditions precedent
identified by the advisors (investment bankers) should be adequately addressed before the launch o f the
transaction. Progress on minimizing subsidy risk will be critical. Risk o f regulatory un-certainty will be
mitigated through implementation o f long term tariff principals as per the APERC's order. Government
will need to flexibly adapt its privatization strategy in the context o f new market and industry structure
envisaged under the new Electricity Act, and inview o f the investor interest prevailing at the time o f launch
o fthe transaction.
11.     The table below presents the extent o f likely impact on power sector finances based on sensitivity
analysis o f some o f the above mentionedrisks :(i)                   AS Irefers to an alternate scenario which assumes lower


 Three models being pilot tested include service delivery by farmer's association, by a private franchisee and community mobilization It
has been informed that in these pilots some farmers are now coming fonvard to accept metering. Ina rural co-operative society nearly 50
percent o fthe farmers have opted for metering.

sales growth specifically for HT-industries, higher sales to agnculture and postponement o f generation
capacity addition by one year and (ii)                   AS I1refers to an alternate scenario which assumes efficiency
improvements to be 2 percent lower. Under the alternate scenario Ithe subsidy requirement i s estimated to
be higher by about Rs.3 billion and Rs. 2.6 billion respectively in 2003-04 and 2004-05; the estimates for
the alternate scenario I1are about Rs.1.79 billion for 2003-04 and Rs.1.81billion for 2004-05. The risks o f
lower than projected sales to industry will be mitigated through continued rationalization o f industrial
tariffs and implementation o f incentive scheme. The risk o f sales to agnculture sector will be mitigated
through strict adherence to supply regulation policy, and segregation o f feeders for agnculture load for
effective monitoring o f supply to agriculture. Monthly monitoring and review by APERC, i s expected to
minimize risks o f delays in efficiency improvements. Further the financial and fiscal risks o f failure o f
hydro power generation i s expected to be mitigated through regular implementation o f the fuel surcharge
adjustment intariffs.
12.     The deterioration inthe power sector finances could overturnthe fiscal gains that may be achieved in
the medium term.            Continued priority and support to the power sector reforms through restructuring
program, technical assistance and PSAL will be required to mitigate power sector risk. The Bank will
continue to undertake quarterly monitoring o f the financial performance o f the power sector to detect early
sign o f emerging financial problems, and to facilitate contingency planning to minimize adverse fiscal
impacts.

On July 18, 2003, the ExecutiveBoard o f the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) concluded the Article IV
consultation with India.'
Background
Economic activity in 2002103 was uneven across key sectors. Growth i s estimated to have slowed to 4%
percent in 2002103 from 5% percent in 2001102, with the sharp drought-induced decline in agriculture (by
3% percent) offsetting the recovery in industry and the strong growth in services. Within industry,
infrastructure-related sectors seem to have led the way, on the back o f the publicly sponsored national
highways development project.
Inflation has picked up in recent months, mostly owing to supply side factors. WPI inflation rose from
under 2 percent in April 2002 to about 6% percent at end-April 2003 before subsiding again to around 5
percent in early June. The pickup was mostly due to the higher global oil prices and a drought, which
affected edible oil prices.
Balance of payments developments have been favorable and foreign exchange reserves are being
accumulated at an unprecedented rate. Goods and services export growth was strong-benefiting                                  from
improved competitiveness and the global trend towards outsourcing dnven by the need to cut costs.
Notwithstanding the relatively strong growth innon-oil imports (13% percent in2002/03), India registered
a current account surplus estimated at 3/4 percent o f GDP in2002/03. Capital account developments appear
to have been driven by dollar weakness and expectation o f a rupee appreciation, a highly favorable interest
rate differential, and changes in international banlung practices. The result o f these developments has been
an unprecedentedaccumulation o f reserves-reserves                  reached $83 billion inmid-July-and            an appreciation
of the rupee vis-&vis the dollar by around 4 percent inthe year to mid-July2003.
Financial markets were characterized by general weakness in equity prices, coupled with a sustained rally
in bond markets. Stock market developments in India have generally been weak, but have improved
measurably since April 2003 along with global and regional equity markets. Incontrast, bond markets have
witnessed a sustained rally. Easy liquidityconditions, coupled with weak investment demand and structural
reforms that have deepened government securities markets, resulted in a sharp decline in interest rates to
historical lows, notwithstanding the large government borrowing needs. These conditions also allowed a


 UnderArticled IV ofthe IMF's Articles o fAgreement, the IMFholds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with oficials the country's economic
developments and policies. On retumto headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion o f the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman o f the Boards, summarizes the views o f
the Executive Directors, and this summaryis transmitted to the country's authorities.

                                                                                                               Page 2 of 6


lengthening o f the maturity o f government debt, and led to a flattening o f the yield curve and a narrowing
o f spreads between government and corporate bonds, across the maturity and credit quality spectrum.
Monetary and exchange rate policy was aimed at maintaining easy liquidity conditions while also
attempting to limit volatility in the rupee and stem its appreciation. Since April 2002, the bank rate-the
key policy signaling rate-has        been reduced by 50 bps to 6 percent, the rep0 rate by 100 bps to 5 percent,
and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 1percentage point to 4% percent. At the same time, the RBIcontinued
its policy to contain volatility inthe exchange rate, with the effect o f limitingthe appreciation o f the rupee.
This intervention in foreign exchange markets was accompanied by sterilizationoperations. The authorities
also used the opportunity provided by the strong reserve position to further open up the capital account,
prepay some external debt, and offer debt reliefto HIPC nations.
General government fiscal imbalances in 2002/03 are likely to be worse than expected in the budget. The
provisional estimate i s for a central government deficit (including privatization receipts inrevenues) o f 5.9
percent o f GDP, compared with the budget target o f 5.3 percent o f GDP. The outcome for the subnational
governments in 2002/03 i s also likely to be worse than expected-the                staff estimates a deficit o f over 4%
percent o f GDP, compared with a budget target o f 4 percent o f GDP. Revenue shortfalls were the main
factors underlying the weaker-than-planned outcome, notwithstanding some expenditure compression.
Consequently, the general government deficit in 2002/03 i s estimated to be about 10 percent o f GDP and
general government debt about 85 percent o f GDP. Contingent liabilities in the form o f central and state
government guarantees stand at around 12 percent o f GDP.
The budget for 2003/04, announced in February 2003, makes little headway inchecking fiscal imbalances.
The deficit i s to be reduced by only about !A percent of GDP to 5.6 percent o f GDP in 2003/04.* On the
revenue side, the budget includes some measures to improve tax administration, but does little to reduce
exemptions. The budget also expects to collect some Rs. 132 billion (% percent o f GDP) in privatization
revenues, compared with about Rs. 30 billion actually realizedin2002/03. There were only a few measures
aimed at containing expenditure. A central plank o f the budget i s the promotion o f infrastructure projects
worth Rs. 600 billion (2% percent o f GDP) over the medium term. These projects are to be undertaken
through public-privatepartnerships, with the government expecting to contribute Rs. 20 billion annually.
The budget also contains several proposals aimed at tahng advantage o f the low interest rate environment
to restructure the debt obligations o f both the central and state governments. The central and state
governments have agreed that, over a three year period ending in 2004/05, all states' debt owed to the
central government carrying interest rates in excess o f 13 percent will be swapped for additional proceeds
from small savings and market loans, both o f which currently have lower interest rates. In addition, the
government also offered a scheme to buy back banks' holdings o f central government securities which were
contracted under high interest rates o f the early 1990s. These securities are to be bought back on a
voluntary basis from banks that are in need o f liquidity or want to encash the premium on their bond
holdings for making provisions on their nonperforming assets (NPAs). To provide the incentive for banks
to do the latter, the authorities have allowed a tax deduction on the premium income if banks use it to
increase provisions.
The staff projects that the economy will grow at 5% percent in 2003/04, broadly in line with consensus
forecasts, but there i s some upside potential to this projection. Early indications are for good monsoon
rainfall. The projection for 2003/04 incorporates a recovery in agriculture, but there is potential for an even
stronger reboundinthis sector. Inflation i s expected to moderate to around 4% percentby end-2003/04. The
external current account i s projectedto remain in surplus.

ExecutiveBoardAssessment
Executive Directors viewed the recent resilience o f the Indian economy as testimony to the benefits o f the
reforms undertaken since the early 1990s. They noted that, despite a weak global environment and a severe
drought during 2002-03, the economy grew at a rate that compares favorably with that o f most other
countries. Directors welcomed the significant strengthening o f India's extemal position-manifest       in the
highlevel o freserves and low extemal vulnerability. At the same time, Directors notedthat the slowdown
in growth since the mid-1990s is of concern because of its implications for poverty reduction. They
reiterated the view that higher, sustained output and employment growth rests on pushing ahead with fiscal
consolidation and critical structural reforms. Some Directors asked for further study on isolating the
cyclical and structural factors affecting growth.
Directors stressed that India's large fiscal deficits and public debt are exacting an economic cost interms o f
foregone growth. Despite the apparent ease with which the fiscal deficit has been financed, they noted the
detrimental effects on growth through crowding out o f critically needed spending on physical and social
capital and through the preemption o f resources for private investment. Directors pointed out that the large
fiscal imbalances leave little room for maneuver in the face o f shocks and have tended to result in ad hoc
policy changes, which increase investment uncertainty. They believed that the authorities should use the
favorable extemal and interest rate environment to buildthe necessary political consensus for accelerating
needed fiscal and structural adjustments. Directors noted that the strategy o f postponing consolidation
while attempting to stimulate growth i s risky, and that few countries have had success in growing out of
severe fiscal problems without implementing a comprehensive reformprogram.
Directors looked forward to passage o f the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) bill,
and welcomed steps to advance implementation o f provisions o f the FRBM. They noted that the FRBM
would bringimportant discipline and transparency to the central government budget process and enable the
authorities to draw up a clear and time-bound plan for restoring fiscal sustainability. They urged early
introduction o f medium-term fiscal plans and targets, anchored by clearly specified fiscal rules that can be
enforced. Directors noted that fiscal adjustment needs to focus on revenue mobilization through widening
the tax net and simplifyingthe tax system. Inparticular, the range o f exemptions should be narrowed and
the scope for discretion reduced. Directors also encouraged the authorities to use the recommendations in
the various reports on tax and expenditure reform that have been prepared in recent years to draw up a
roadmap for fiscal reforms with explicit timetables.
Directors recognized that some important initiatives have been undertaken to strengthen state finances in
recent years, including the use of performance-based transfers from the center, limits on government
guaranteed loans, and the introduction of fiscal responsibility legislation by some states. Nevertheless,
Directors pointed out that state finances have improved only moderately, suggesting that much more needs
to be done, including in the areas of reforming the tax system, divesting public enterprises, and reducing
subsidies and losses inthe power sector. Inthis context, Directors regretted the delay inthe introduction of
the value added tax (VAT). They urged that top priority be given to developing the necessary consensus to
implement the VAT within the current fiscal year, with the central government launching a concerted
campaignjointly with the states about the VAT's benefits.
With inflationary pressures under control, Directors viewed the maintenance o f easy monetary conditions
as appropriate. They welcomed recent cuts in administered savings rates and policy rates, noting these
should allow banks to lower lendingand deposit rates and narrow the rupee/dollar interest rate differential.
However, Directors noted that administered interest rates and directed lending reduce the effectiveness o f
monetary policy and hinder financial development. Many Directors encouraged a clearly specified
automatic linkbetween administered rates and market rates to prevent a prolonged misalignment o f interest
rates.
Directors noted that, going forward, the scope for continued sterilized intervention could narrow and make
the task of managing the monetary impact of balance of payments inflows increasingly difficult. Several
Directors cautioned that the current strategy could inadvertently expose the system to more risk-through

                                                                                                      Annex C
                                                                                                    Page 4 of 6


further increases in interest-sensitive inflows and unhedged foreign currency exposure in the corporate
sector. They welcomed recent measures to facilitate and encourage hedging, but noted that such measures
would be most effective if market players perceive the need to undertake such hedging activities. While a
few Directors noted the potential implication o f exchange rate appreciation, most Directors encouraged the
authorities to gradually allow greater flexibility inthe exchange rate.
Directors saw the continued strength in the extemal accounts as a good opportunity to further liberalize
extemal transactions. They welcomed measures to liberalize capital account transactions, but going
forward, encouraged deeper trade reforms. Directors singled out the need to simplify the trade regime by
lowering tariffs, introducing a more uniform duty structure, significantly reducing exemptions and
eliminating administrative barriers. They welcomed India's decision to grant debt relief under the enhanced
HPC Initiative.
Directors commended the steady progress made in moving ahead with financial sector reforms. They
welcomed the introduction o f risk-based supervision and implementation o f a prompt corrective action
framework for commercial banks. They encouraged the introduction o f time limits on remedial actions in
the latter, so as to increase the framework's effectiveness. Directors also saw a need to broaden the scope o f
the market for interest rate derivatives and to tighten the regulatory treatment o f state-govemment
guaranteed loans.
Directors welcomed the recent reforms aimed at providing a comprehensive framework to clean up banks'
impaired assets and strengthen their underlying finances. In particular, Directors saw the passage o f the
Securitization Act, the issuance o f the accompanying guidelines by the Reserve Bank o f India, and the
amendments to the Companies Act creating the National Company Law Tribunal as important steps. T o
give full effect to these reforms, they encouraged early repeal o f the Sick Industrial Companies Act and
steps to ensure that borrowers are not able to obtain unduly long protection against collateral enforcement
under the new tribunal.
Directors encouraged the authorities to advance the timetable for bringing India's classification and
provisioning standards in line with international best practice. They viewed the government's new debt
buyback scheme with banks, as well as banks' improvedprofitability and the new securitization framework,
as a good opportunity to shorten the timeframe for classifying loans as doubtful and for buildingprovisions
needed under the new norms. Directors commended the recent passage o f the anti-money-laundering law,
and urgedthe authorities to complete the questionnaire on money launderingand terrorism financing.
Directors also encouraged further steps to strengthenthe performance and efficiency o f the banlung system,
including reducing government ownership and improving the commercial orientation o f public sector
banks. Some Directors noted that raising the foreign direct investment limit inprivate banks and lifting the
restrictions on voting rights would be complementary steps to strengthen competition in the banking
system. Directors also saw the need for a clearer strategy on the future role o f development finance
institutions, given their weak overall financial condition. Owing to the current fiscal situation and need to
contain systemic risk, they encouraged the authorities to move away from government-orchestrated rescue
packages o f these institutions, with little conditionality.
Directors viewed sustained progress on other reforms also as critical to improving growth prospects and
generating job opportunities. They welcomed recent steps to further decontrol fertilizer distribution and the
planned introduction o f a pricing system to discourage inefficient fertilizer production. However, Directors
called for early action on lifting restrictions on agricultural marketing and trade and reforming the public
distribution system, minimum support prices, and fertilizer subsidies. As for industry, they welcomed the
removal o f key goods from the list reserved for small-scale industries, the enactment o f a more modem
competition bill, and the passage o f a new Electricity Bill allowing the power sector to be opened up to
greater competition. Directors encouraged further progress with small-scale dereservation, and on
reforming labor laws to allow more flexibility, reflecting market conditions.
Directors noted the promising start to the process of privatization in the first half o f 2002l03, and
encouraged publicizing the benefits o f previous divestment to buildpopular support for this reform. They

                                                                                                      Annex C
                                                                                                   Page 5 of 6


also supported the authorities' proposal to create a fund for divestment receipts, to be used for debt
reduction and identified development programs, rather than for recurrent spending.
Directors welcomed the smooth operation o f periodic price adjustments for diesel and petrol. Going
forward, they encouraged the authorities to formulate an explicit strategy to deal with episodes when oil
prices temporarily move out o f a normal range.
Directors commended India for completing assessments under most o f the Fund's standards and codes.
They welcomed India's subscription to the SDDS, but urged that priority be given to addressing
shortcomings in the timeliness and coverage o f fiscal data to support the objective o f fiscal consolidation.
They also encouragedthe authorities to facilitate early completion o f the Statistics ROSC report.
