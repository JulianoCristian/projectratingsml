Concurrently a Master Plan would be drawn up\n            identifying priorities for a sustainable research program.\n            Cotton, root and tuber and farming systems research would be\n            improved in the early stages, while a research fund would\n            finance other priority programs identified by the Master\n            Plan.  There would also be funds for early purchase of\n            urgently needed vehicules, equipment and materials, to\n            sustain the ongoing research program.  Civil works,\n            technical assistance, training, and foreign recurrent costs\n            would also be financed.  The participation of the Special\n            Program for African Agricultural Research (SPAAR) should\n            ensure close donor coordination by agreement to tie the\n            research program to the Master Plan."}, "docdt": "1988-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
