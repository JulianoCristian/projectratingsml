    reform. Bank performance was satisfactory while borrower\n            performance was mixed, initially poor but eventually good as\n            management improved and innovative decisions began to take\n            hold. Lessons learned include: a) the new development\n            function must be clearly defined and explained; b) client\n            oriented research approaches must be fully integrated in\n            commodity and cross cutting programs along with further\n            training and support; c) livestock research deserves\n            strengthening; d) chronic financial constraints can generate\n            improved and innovative management approaches to mitigate\n            funding problems; e) expenditures on Technical Assistance\n            should be very selective and their quality and utility\n            carefully monitored; f) decentralization of management and\n            administration is strongly supported, although imaginative\n            coordination is needed; g) a statutory framework should be\n            established for cess-funded commodity research; h) retention\n            of competent and motivated management is essential for\n            effectiveness; i) the National Agricultural Research Fund\n            mandate will require review in light of lessons learned from\n            the Zonal Agricultural Research Funds; and j)\n            research-extension-farmer linkages improved overtime and\n            were helped by allocations made in extension projects."}, "docdt": "1999-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
