3.   The disbursement percentages have been calculated in compli-
ance with the policy of the Bank that no proceeds of the Loan

in the territory of, the Borrower on goods or services, or on the

the disbursement percentages set forth in the table in paragraph

Category, to the extent required to meet the estimated shortfall,
proceeds of the Loan which are then allocated to another Category
and which in the opinion of the Bank are not needed to meet other
expenditures; and (ii) if such reallocation cannot fully meet the
estimated shortfall, reduce the disbursement percentage then appli-
cable to such expenditures in order that further withdrawals under
such Category may continue until all expenditures thereunder shall
have been made.

(ii) Non-Philippine contractors shall not be required
to register in the Philippines as a condition of
bidding for a contract. Where said registration
is required of a non-Philippine contractor after
he has been awarded the contract, the Borrower
shall take such action as may be practicable to
facilitate his registration.
(iii) Prequalified contractors shall be given a period
of not less than 60 days for submission of bids,
which shall be accompanied by a bid bond or bank
guarantee in an amount equivalent to 5% of the
bid price.
(iv) The successfull bidder shall be required to
furnish at his option, either a 100% performance
bond or a bank guarantee by an acceptable finan-
cial institution in an amount of about 20% of the
cost of the contract, which guarantee or bond shall
remain in effect until the works specified in the
contract are completed.
(v) The contract with the successful bidder shall con-
tain terms and conditions which shall not, without
the Bank's concurrence, materially differ from


﻿-28-
those on which bids were asked, and shall include
the following provisions:
(a) the contract shall provide for retention
monies of 5% of the cost of works statei
in each monthly invoice until 100% of total
contract payments have been made, after which
retention shall be discontinued. One-half of
the retention monies shall be released when
all works have been substantially completed.
The balance of the retention monies shall be
retained until fourteen days after termination
of the contractor's responsibility in respect
of defects;
(b) at any time during the warranty periods
the contractor shall have the option of sub-
stituting a satisfactory bank guarantee for
such retention in which case the retention
money shall be released to him;
(c) the warranty period during which the con-
tractor remains responsible in respect of
defects in the works (fair wear and tear
excepted) shall extend for one year after
acceptance of the work, except as otherwise
agreed by the Bank.


﻿-29-
B.   Other Procurement Procedures
1.   Contracts for: (i) the construction and/or improvement of
minor roads; (ii) construction or extension of workshop, includ-
ing installation of equipment; and (iii) the restoration of the
national road network, shall be awarded after local competitive
bidding under procedures to be agreed with the Bank.
2.   Hand tools for road maintenance, and other items expected to
cost less than the equivalent of $15,000 each, shall be procured
under the Borrower's procurement procedures for such items, pro-
vided that the aggregate amount of all contracts for such tools
and items shall not exceed the equivalent of $500,000.
C.   Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Goods
1.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the
supply of goods except those to be procured in accordance with
local procedures: (i) bidders shall be required to state in their
bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods, or the ex-
factory price for domestically-manufactured goods; (ii) customs
duties and other import taxes on imported goods, and sales and sim-
ilar taxes on domestically-supplied goods, shall be excluded; and
(iii) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight and other expen-
ditures incidental to the delivery of goods to the place of their
use or installation shall be included.
2.   Goods manufactured in the Philippines may be granted a
margin of preference in accordance with, and subject to, the
following provisions:


﻿- 30-
(a) All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall
clearly indicate any preference which will be granted, the infor-
mation required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such
preference and the following methods and stages that will be fol-
lowed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
(b) After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in
one of the following three groups:
(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in the
Philippines if the bidder shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank
that the manufacturing cost of such goods includes
a value added in the Philippines equal to at least
20% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods.
(2) Group B: all other bids offering goods manufactured
in the Philippines.
(3) Group C: bids offering any other goods.
(c) All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared
among themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import
taxes on goods to be imported and any sales or similar taxes on
goods to be supplied domestically, to determine the lowest evalu-
ated bid of each group. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be
compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison,
a bid from group A or group B is the lowest, it shall be selected
for the award.
01


﻿-31-
(d) If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c)
above, the lowest bid is a bid from group C, all group C bids
shall be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from
group A after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of the imported
goods offered in each group C bid, for the purpose of this fur-
ther comparison only, an amount equal to (i) the amount of cus-
toms duties and other iLport taxes which a non-exempt importer
would have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in
such group C bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such
goods if said customs duties and taxes exceed 15% of such price.
If the group A bid in such further comparison is the lowest, it
shall be selected for the award; if not, the bid from group C
which as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c) is the
lowest evaluated bid shall be selected.
D.   Review of Procurement Decisions by the Bank
1.   Review of prequalification. The Borrower shall, before qua-
lification is invited, inform the Bank in detail of the procedure
to be followed, and shall introduce such modifications in said
procedure as the Bank shall reasonably request. The list of pre-
qualified bidders, together with a statement of their qualifica-
tions and of the reasons for the exclusion of any applicant for
prequalification shall be furnished by the Borrower to the Bank
for its comments before the applicants are notified of the Borrower's
decision, and the Borrower shall make such additions to, deletions
from, or modifications in, the said list as the Bank shall reasonably
request.


﻿- 32-
2.   Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final

the Bank, for its comments, the text of the invitations to bid
and the specifications and other bidding documents, together with
a description of the advertising procedures to be followed for

ments or procedures as the Bank shall reasonably request. Any
further modification to the bidding documents shall require the
Bank's concurrence before it is issued to the prospective bidders.
(b) After bids have been received and evaluated, the Bor-
rower shall, before a final decision on the award is made, inform
the Bank of the name of the bidder to which it intends to award
the contract and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient time for
its review, a detailed report, by the consultants referred to in
Section 3.02 of this Agreement, on the evaluation and comparison
of the bids received, together with the recommendations for award
of the said consultants and such other information as the Bank
shall reasonably request. The Bank shall, if it determines that
the intended award would be inconsistent with the Guidelines or
this Schedule, promptly inform the Borrower and state the reasons
for such determination.


﻿-33-
(c) The terms and conditions of the contract shall not, with-
out the Bank's concurrence, materially differ from those on which
bids were asked or prequalification invited.
(d) Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished
to the Bank promptly after its execution and prior to the submis-
sion to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of funds
from the Loan Account in respect of such contract.
3.   With respect to each contract to be financed out of the pro-
ceeds of the Loan and not governed by the preceding paragraph,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, promptly after its execu-
tion and prior to the submission to the Bank of the first applica-
tion for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of
such contract, two conformed copies of such contract, together
with the analysis of the respective bids, recommendations for
award and such other information as the Bank shall reasonably re-
quest. The Bank shall, if it determines that the award of the
contract was not consistent with the Guidelines or this Schedule,
