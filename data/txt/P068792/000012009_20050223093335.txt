3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The objective of the Economic Reform Loan (ERL) was to assist Turkey to implement its economic reform
program by providing quick disbursing financing for the balance of payments and the budget. A key aspect
was to ensure that core structural components of the reform program were implemented effectively to
ensure the sustainability of the disinflation program and create the basis for restored growth. The reform
program was expected to have a major impact in improving macroeconomic stability, strengthening public
sector governance, increasing living standards, and reducing economic vulnerability.

Technical advice and dialogue in conjunction with the project was expected to help shape specific reform
measures with the benefit of international best practice, and support from the Bank was expected to provide
an important signal to international financial markets and other official creditors.

The objective was highly relevant to the obstacles in the path of Turkey's economic development. ERL
provided an additional incentive to continue the dismantling of the statist policies in each of the areas
described below; reform progress, which had been inconsistent over the past few decades, showed promise
to accelerate. And continued progress toward fiscal responsibility and macroeconomic stability was and is
crucial to the acceleration of growth.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
The project components consisted of:

1.       Macroeconomic performance
2.       Fiscal Reform and Adjustment
3.       Social Security Reform
4.       Agricultural Reform
5.       Telecommunications Reform
6.       Energy Reform
7.       Enterprise Privatization.

The loan was designed in two tranches; the first of US$384.6 million was released upon effectiveness (and
fulfillment of specified conditions). The second tranche of US$375 million was released upon fulfillment of
further conditions and satisfactory progress in the reform program. The second tranche was originally
intended to be released within 1½ years of project inception, but it was released 4 years after effectiveness.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components were not revised.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry was overall satisfactory. The ERL was entirely consistent with the 1997 CAS; the
Government's reform program met the policy requirements for the "high case" as stated therein, including
major fiscal adjustment, substantial disinflation, and implementation of comprehensive reforms (complete
requirements listed in section 10). The design of the ERL was also supported by considerable analytical
work: a poverty study and a CEM completed in parallel with ERL preparation, as well as an analysis of the
sensitivity of interest rates to disinflation (citations in section 10).

While the project was very ambitious and comprehensive, in 1998 and 1999 the Bank had received a

number of signals that the country was beginning to undertake fundamental policy changes. The
front-loaded ERL, though quite inclusive, was deemed a more promising approach than a set of smaller
steps, or less far-reaching goals--a position with which QAG agreed, as noted below. Key aspects of the
reform program (including agricultural and energy reform) were the subject of intensive dialogue over a
period of several years, including national seminars in 1998 and 1999. And legislation reforming the
Social Security System was passed in 1999. The ERL policy matrix was reviewed extensively with Turkish
authorities, and was the subject of continuous discussion in the six weeks leading up to negotiations.

Further, the ERL was complemented by a number of other policy-related loans (Table 1, below), all of
them implemented satisfactorily, which amplified and reinforced reforms completed under ERL.
Identification and appraisal of the ERL was also marked by an intense dialogue with Turkish
policy-makers and with the IMF, with some Fund conditions reinforcing ERL positions.

ERL Quality at Entry was also deemed satisfactory by QAG, with satisfactory ratings across all
categories. Borrower ownership was rated satisfactory, and country knowledge highly satisfactory. In
particular, the Panel praised the project as being part of a well-thought-out program of reform. QAG also
praised the technical acumen of the ERL team.

This ICR considers several aspects of the ERL design as unrealistic, however. First, the project originally
estimated that the reform program could be carried out in 1½ years, an overestimation of the pace at which
reforms could be completed; the ERL was closed in 4 years (a further discussion of the delay is presented
below in section 4.1). Second, project conditionality required that 20% of TurkTelecomm be sold. (As
described later, this was not accomplished and a waiver was granted in return for a package of specified
actions) As a practical matter, selling a minority share of a state-owned telecommunications company,
without permitting the buyer to have any management participation, was an unlikely prospect.

A final design shortcoming was the formulation of the condition on energy privatization: "....launch of
pre-qualification tenders for the same of electricity distribution companies as agreed with the Bank." This
condition did not take adequate account of the considerable amount of progress that would have to precede
it, e.g., unbundling of the distribution companies, establishment of market rules. This situation is discussed
in section 4.2, below, in the section on energy reform, as well as in sec. 8 (Lessons Learned).

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Organization of this ICR: The ERL consisted of a very broad overall objective elaborated by 7 components



                                                      - 3 -

corresponding to the main sections of the project conditionality. The conditionality matrix (Annex A)
specifies sub-objectives for each area, and so this ICR presents in section 4.2 detailed evidence of
achievement organized by the 7 components and their included sub-objectives.

Overall, project outcome was satisfactory, as most relevant objectives were achieved, though later than
envisioned. Achievement is described in the next section, and is summarized as follows:

1.      Macroeconomic performance:         satisfactory
2.      Fiscal Reform and Adjustment: satisfactory
3.      Social Security Reform:            unsatisfactory
4.      Agricultural Reform:               satisfactory
5.      Telecomm Reform:                   moderately satisfactory
6.      Energy Reform:                     moderately unsatisfactory
7.      Enterprise Privatization:          satisfactory

Fulfillment of conditionality: All project core and non-core conditions were met, except as noted below.
Two core sub-conditions were not met, in the telecomm and energy areas. Waivers were granted, and the
government agreed to substitute specific, time-bound reform programs instead of the original conditions.
As described below, the outcome was more favorable in the telecomm area than in energy.

Delays: Project achievements occurred later than envisioned. The project became effective in June 2000
and was originally scheduled to achieve its objectives in around 1½ years. However, in November, 2000,
and February, 2001, the country had financial crises that occupied the attention of policy-makers and
necessitated extensive financial sector reforms. Following elections in late 2002, the new government
began working with the Bank in early 2003 on implementation of the remaining ERL conditions. The Bank
extended the closing date several times because of the extraordinary conditions and because by mid-2002, 6
of 9 second tranche conditions had already been met. In the event, the project closed in April, 2004.

4.2 Outputs by components:
1. Macroeconomic performance

Objective: Lower inflation to 10-12 percent by 2001 while promoting sustainable growth of output and
employment, strengthening the structure of the external capital account, and correcting the weaknesses
that underlie macroeconomic imbalances.

Macroeconomic performance was overall satisfactory. Performance was generally good from 2000 to
2004, but with some deficiencies. There were financial crises in November, 2000 and February, 2001,
with a significant deterioration of growth in 2001. Since these setbacks, however, the economy has
rebounded strongly. As shown in Figures 1 and 2 below, over the period as a whole inflation fell
dramatically and the public sector borrowing requirement declined substantially. These were landmark
achievements in a country inured to high levels of inflation and substantial domestic borrowing.

Macroeconomic outcomes for the period of the ERL generally met the benchmarks set under the economic
program, but with some deficiencies: inflation did not reach program levels until 2004, and fiscal
performance fell slightly short of the primary surplus target, achieving a 2003 primary balance of 6.3%
against a goal of 6.5% (Table 2). As also shown in the table, exchange rates have been mainly stable for
the last 3 years after falling dramatically in 2001. The current account, however, remains of concern.
Despite the high growth rates after the 2001 financial crises, unemployment rate has remained high. The
country has been under an IMF program since December, 1999, and Annex B presents a detailed

Signal to international markets: As stated in the project documents, support from the Bank was expected to
provide an important signal to international financial markets and other official creditors. In this context,
it should be noted that in early 2000, Turkey resumed borrowing on international capital markets, which
had not been possible for a number of years. The markets recognized that with a Fund program in place
and the Bank once again lending, Turkey was more creditworthy. At the time of the ICR mission, Turkey
was a regular participant in these markets.

2. Fiscal Reform and Adjustment

Objective: Underpin fiscal adjustment through a combination of revenue increases and structural
measures to strengthen the tax system and improve public expenditure management and control.

Fiscal reform was satisfactory. As shown in Table 1, the country's fiscal accounts--as measured by the
primary balance--improved significantly during the time of the ERL, in part due to implementation of the


                                                            - 5 -

structural measures achieved during the project. For example, a Board condition called for the elimination
of 20 of the extant 61 budgetary funds, and a second tranche condition called for elimination of at least 25
more. In the event, all budgetary funds except one were closed, as well as 6 extra-budgetary funds, more
than fulfilling the ERL target.

Additional measures achieved in pursuit of fiscal reform included:

    ·   Limits on the introduction of new projects into the public investment program: The number of new
        projects was reduced, as was their average completion time. The average completion time was
        reduced by 32% from 2001 to 2002, and a further 10% in 2003, with the number of projects
        introduced also falling each year.
    ·   VAT increase from 15% to 17%; 20% increase in VAT on alcohol and tobacco; additional
    increases amounting to 1.1% of GNP altogether.
    ·   Introduction of a package of new taxes, tax increases, and surcharges raising around 2% of GNP.
    ·   Establishment of a public registry of government guarantees and limits on guarantees: A public
    registry was established, and limits were established on the issuance of new guarantees.
    ·   More effective expenditure control mechanisms: Budgetary mechanisms were standardized across
    agencies, and external audit strengthened.

3. Social Security Reform

Objectives:
    ·   Introduce structural reforms to the three public social insurance funds with a view to ensuring
        financial sustainability, increasing coverage and compliance, and improving quality of service.
    ·   Create legal and regulatory framework for private pension funds to diversify the sources of
    long-term savings and facilitate development of the capital market.

Achievement in the area of Social Security reform was unsatisfactory. Although all ERL conditions
involving structural reforms were met, the key goal of ensuring financial sustainability was not met during
the period of the ERL. Although it is possible that in the longer term the structural changes made will
reduce the system's deficits, this had not yet occurred as of the project close. Positive elements included
successful achievement of structural reforms:

Structural Reforms: The ERL was intended to facilitate reforms initiated by the government in 1999, as
well as to implement additional measures to modernize and improve social insurance. Most of these actions
were taken as envisioned:

    ·   The 1999 pension reform law was fully implemented, with increased retirement ages, increased
        minimum contributions, and reduced replacement rates.
    ·   After some legal problems, administrative changes were implemented that promise to reduce
        overhead costs and improve operating efficiency. Analytic capacity was also enhanced.
    ·   A plan was adopted to improve the collection of contribution arrears, however, the majority of such
        arrears will probably go uncollected.
    ·   An unemployment insurance scheme was established. As of September, 2004, around 70,000
        workers were receiving payments for a period of around 6-8 months depending on their work
        history. The system also paid laid-off workers' health insurance premiums, matched potential
        workers with available job opportunities, and provided training.
    ·   Legislation to support individual pension plans was passed and regulations promulgated. By



                                                     - 6 -

         mid-2004, there were 11 pension funds authorized to collect contributions, and nearly 50,000
         contributors.

However, negative elements included growing budgetary transfers:

Budgetary Transfers to Social Security: As shown in Table 3, below, budgetary transfers to the social
security funds declined substantially from 1999 to 2000, thereby meeting the ERL second tranche
condition, "to generate 0.5% of GNP in fiscal savings in 2000." But the fiscal situation of the funds
subsequently deteriorated for two reasons. First, real wages fell after the 2000 and 2001 crises, while
payments were indexed to inflation, causing an increasing gap between income and payments. Second, in
2003 and 2004 Parliament approved social payments to all pensioners and increased pensions (unrelated to
the indexation provided for in the law). These cost an estimated 0.87% of GNP in 2003. As shown in the
table, budgetary savings were reduced to 0.58% in 2001, and 0.21% in 2002. By 2004, transfers were
0.70% higher than in 1999.

The introduction of the ad-hoc pension increase was inconsistent with the objectives of social security
system reform. While the weak economic performance in 2001 certainly played a role in the reduced
budgetary savings, the trend and the extent of the deviation from the savings target set under ERL indicate
that further structural reforms may be needed to secure the medium-term health of the system. (Many such
reforms are being considered by the prospective Programmatic Public Sector Development Policy Loan)

Table 3: Budgetary Transfers to Social Security Funds
                          1999            2000                2001              2002              2003
Total transfers,          3.75             2.57               3.17               3.52              4.45
as % of GNP
Source: Calculations by the project team.

As shown in the table, the overall budgetary transfer to the social security funds rose by around 19% from
1999 to 2003. Broken down by its main components, from 1999 to 2003, the Employee Pension Scheme
(SSK) reduced its budgetary subsidy by 5%, while the Self-employed Pensions (BK) budgetary subsidy
rose by 35%, and the Civil Servants Pension Scheme (ES) rose by 30%. The lack of reform of the ES
scheme was a major factor in the poor performance of pension reform.

Finally, the envisioned expansion of coverage did not occur. Approximately 11.1 million workers were
covered by the system in 1997, and 11.0 million in 2004. A possible reason for this decline was the
movement of workers out of the formal economy in response to the increased levels of earnings subject to
social security contribution.

4. Agricultural Reform

Objectives:
    ·    Introduce unified national program of direct income support targeted over time to poorer
    farmers
    ·    Phase out price and credit subsidies for agriculture
    ·    Restructure and initiate privatization of state enterprises in agriculture

Achievement in the area of agricultural reform was satisfactory, with significant progress toward each of
the objectives stated above. The reform program in agriculture was supported by both ERL and ARIP, so



                                                     - 7 -

the achievements described below should be attributed to both projects. For example, the DIS program
was piloted under ERL, with implementation being supported by ARIP as well as ERL.

Direct Income Support: ERL supported the introduction of a Direct Income Support (DIS) program to
compensate for the removal of existing distortionary and unsustainable subsidies for fertilizer, credit, and
price supports. By September, 2004, approximately 90% of the country's agricultural households were
registered and receiving direct income support payments, comprising around 79% of the area under
cultivation. Farmers received around 160 million TL per hectare in payments, with a maximum eligible
area of 50 hectares. Payments under DIS totaled US$976 million in 2002, US$1,506 million in 2003, and
an estimated US$1,757 million in 2004.

Supporting the establishment of DIS, a National Registry of Farmers was created in order to calculate and
justify DIS payments. Data in this system have been expanded over the course of ERL and ARIP and are
increasingly being analyzed and used for policy purposes.

Reduction of subsidies: Subsidies and price supports have nearly been eliminated. By 2002 subsidies to
agriculture had been reduced by over 90% compared to 1999. Cuts were made in agricultural support
prices as well as input and output price subsidies and direct credit subsidies. Budgetary transfers to
Agriculture Sales Cooperative Unions (ASCU), described in the next section, have been terminated.
However, there has been modest backsliding on credit subsidies, as indirect measures have been used to
offer sub-market rates to farmers (e.g., in August 2004, farm loans were being offered at 25% while market
rates were 30%). Tobacco price-setting by the state was abolished, with prices now being set by auctions
between private parties. State purchases of grain (to support prices) were reduced from 4.4 million tons to
2.4 million from 1999 to 2002, and have subsequently dropped below 1 million tons. Intervention in the
hazelnut market was discontinued, and price supports for sugar were phased out, but quotas were
introduced. In addition to the reduction in subsidies, tariffs on grain were reduced from around 85-90% to
45%.

Restructuring and privatization of state enterprises: ASCUs have essentially been transformed into
autonomous entities, and budgetary funding has been terminated. However, a revolving fund to deal with
their existing debt was established and additional funds were appropriated (from ARIP) to cushion the
severance of their workers.

Significant progress was made in the privatization of other agricultural SEEs:

    ·    The state tobacco company was offered for sale, but bids did not meet the state's reserve price and
    the firm was re-offered in late 2004, and the tender process is continuing.
    ·    The PA has established a timetable for the sale of factories formerly owned by the state sugar
    company, one factory has been sold, and the PA expects tenders to be issued on an ongoing basis.
    ·    The agricultural machinery company is being liquidated, with its largest complex having been
    merged into another firm which is itself being privatized.

5. Telecommunications Reform

Objectives:
    ·    Promote private participation and competition in telecommunications
    ·    Accelerate privatization




                                                     - 8 -

Achievement in this area was moderately satisfactory, with most major objectives achieved but with
significant shortcomings. Positive elements included:
     ·  Establishment of a regulatory authority: The Telecommunications Authority (TA) was established
        in 2000 and has been functioning effectively since then. Amendments to the telecomm law ere
        passed in 2001 that transferred licensing authority to the TA. TA meets established international
        criteria for regulatory agencies, and has issued licenses for mobile operators, around 90 Internet
        Service Providers, and numerous other telecomm operators. TA has also issued a number of other
        technical and business regulations that have the effect of liberalizing the telecomm market.
     ·  Turk Telecomm (TT) was prepared for privatization. The company was corporatized in 2000, and
        a strategic analysis of its operations performed by an international consulting firm. The company
        has replaced nearly its entire management team with staff with private sector telecomm experience.
     ·  Liberalization of the telecomm market: TT's exclusive right to provide fixed-line service expired
        at the end of 2003, one year before the country's commitment to WTO to take this measure. Partly
        as a result, prices for many services have fallen dramatically:
        o        Prices for calls from mobile to fixed lines have declined 60-70%
        o        Prices for long-distance calls have fallen around 30-40%
        o        International call prices have declined up to 80%
        o        TT's prices have fallen on average 45-60%
     ·  Sale of wireless licenses: A wireless license was sold in 2000 to a consortium consisting of both
        Turkish and foreign investors. However, the tender for a second wireless license did not attract
        any bidders above the reserve price. TT was the winning bidder for a 3rd mobile license, however,
        adverse business conditions required that TT's entity merge with another firm to form a new
        majority-private entrant.
     ·  Growth in mobile service: The number of mobile subscribers has grown to around 33-34 million
        (2004), exceeding the number of fixed-line phones. There are currently 3 firms providing wireless
        services, and the market is highly competitive.

It should be noted that some of the market liberalization and growth in mobile service noted above was not
attributable to ERL, as 2 wireless licenses were auctioned prior to ERL effectiveness.

However, shortcomings included:
     ·  Failure of privatization strategy: The planned sale of 20% of TT to a strategic foreign investor in
        September, 2000 did not succeed. This first effort included insufficient management rights to
        attract interest, and so a second tender for a 33.5% stake was held in May, 2001, with stronger
        management rights, but it also did not attract a bid. In retrospect, it was probably unrealistic to
        expect an offering of a 20% share, with no management rights, to attract significant attention. It
        should be noted, however, that under the law existing until mid-2001, it would not have been
        possible to sell more than 50% of TT.

     However, in response to these events, the government and TT moved quickly to accelerate TT
        privatization:
        o Legislative amendments were passed permitting privatization of up to 100% of TT, with the
             sole proviso that the government continue to have a voice in the company regarding national
             security (which interest is to be clearly defined). These same amendments provided that TT's
             exclusive rights to fixed line service would expire at the end of 2003, which required TT to be
             more focused on providing competitive services.
        o TT has retained an international financial advisor, as well as legal and technical advisors, to
             assist in the privatization. In close coordination with the PA, TT has made 11 presentations to



                                                       - 9 -

              potential investors, and has made available audited financial reports of its last 3 years results.
         o The tender process for the block sale of 55% of Turk Telekom was initiated with tender
              announcements of November 25, 2004, with a bidding deadline of May 31, 2005. The Cable
              TV infrastructure belonging to TTAS was kept outside of the tender.

It should also be noted that the ERL was implemented in close coordination with the Privatization Social
Support Project (FY01), which strengthened the safety net for laid-off workers. This is especially
important in the context of TT privatization, because the firm still employed around 56,000 workers as of
September, 2004, with the prospect of lay-offs after its sale.

6. Energy Reform

Objectives:
    ·    Strengthen legal and regulatory framework for private participation and private investment
    ·    Promote efficiency, private participation and competition in the energy sector
    ·    Accelerate privatization

Achievement in this area was moderately unsatisfactory. While the ERL undoubtedly advanced the energy
reform agenda, achievement at the time of the ICR mission was not commensurate with the expectations
envisioned in the project documents. While significant progress was made in establishing and strengthening
the regulatory framework, a key condition--launch of pre-qualification tenders for the sale of electricity
distribution companies--was not met, and the condition was waived. In return, a Strategy Paper was
developed with high-level government support, which laid out a plan and timetable for the first steps in
sector privatization. Unfortunately, at the time of the ICR mission, progress in accord with the Strategy
Paper seemed to be lagging, and there were numerous potential obstacles to a successful outcome.

Positive elements included:
    ·    An Electricity Market Law was passed (2001) which established an independent regulatory
         agency, EMRA, with full authority over tariff policy and a mandate to establish a competitive
         sectoral environment. EMRA is fully functional, has issued cognizant regulations, has licensed
         firms active in the sector, and has facilitated the direct access of large electricity customers to
         purchase directly from sources of their choice. (EMRA has benefited from technical assistance
         provided by the EU)
    ·    The former generation and transmission company, TEAS, has been restructured into 3 completely
         separate organizational entities for the 3 functions.
    ·    It has been decided that TEDAS, the distribution company, would be sub-divided into 21 operating
         units which are intended to become independent distribution companies.
    ·    TEDAS has modestly reduced the high rate of electricity theft--generally acknowledged as in
         excess of 20%. TEDAS also improved collections by outsourcing collections to private firms.
    ·    EMRA has been designated as the regulator for the natural gas market, and a new natural gas law
         was passed (2001). A number of other steps toward restructuring the natural gas sector were also
         taken, including privatization of 2 city gas distribution systems.
    ·    As of end-2004, natural gas distribution licenses were granted to companies in 20 cities

Negative elements included:
    ·    As noted earlier, the expected launch of pre-qualification tenders for the sale of electricity
         distribution companies did not take place, and a waiver was issued by the Bank.
    ·    In lieu of the planned launch of tenders, a Strategy Paper was issued with specified steps to be



                                                       - 10 -

         taken according to a defined timetable. However, as of the ICR mission, it seemed unlikely that the
         tasks envisioned would be achieved in accordance with the established schedule:
         o While the territory of each of the planned 21 distribution companies has been agreed, the
             companies themselves have not yet been corporatized. Consequently, the units are not yet legal
             entities, and agreement has not yet been reached on such potentially contentious issues as the
             division of physical assets, staff, and other resources.
         o Overall agreement has not yet been reached on what is to be sold at tender, either the physical
             assets of the distribution companies, the transfer of operating rights in a designated area, or
             something in between. A Turkish court has ruled that the physical assets could not be sold to a
             private owner, but an acceptable formula has not yet been reached.
         o Disagreements among key agencies involved in the privatization process, which hindered
             earlier progress, have not yet been resolved. For example, TEDAS has been reported as
             placing obstacles in the path of reform, including hampering the establishment of a "balancing
             market," wherein entities with a temporary surplus of electricity can offer this for sale to those
             who are in need.
         o Agreement has not yet been reached on a schedule of regional tariffs that reflect differences in
             the cost of producing, transmitting, and distributing electricity.
         o The Strategy Paper schedule envisioned that the launch of tenders would begin in March,
             2005, but with the obstacles described above not yet surmounted, this seems highly unlikely.

As discussed earlier in "Quality at Entry," the condition relating to privatization of the distribution
companies did not adequately take into account the necessary antecedent achievements that would permit
the condition to be met, for example, those listed in the previous paragraph.

It should be noted that in 2003-04, disagreements between government agencies continued to hinder
achievement in this area. In response, the Bank established an Expert Panel of recognized international
experts to mediate differences between the agencies, which resulted in the "Strategy Paper" noted above--a
positive step. The Panel had the credibility to cut through objections from some agencies and develop a
realistic plan.

In the supervision of the ERL, the Bank insisted that "privatization" connoted the sale of physical assets,
whereas the government preferred the concept of the "transfer of operating rights." This difference of
viewpoint hindered progress; however, the eventual court ruling on the impermissibility of the sale of
physical assets to a private company finally settled the issue.

7. Enterprise Privatization

Objective:
     ·   Accelerate privatization

Achievement in this area was satisfactory, with four large firms sold compared to a project condition of
selling 3 large companies from a defined list of candidate firms (privatization during the preceding few
years had been quite limited). All state shares in the petroleum distribution company, POAS, were sold in
stages from 2000 to 2002. The steel company ERDEMIR was merged with another firm and the
government's holdings brought below 50% by 2002. A 100% share of the alcoholic beverages unit of
TEKEL was sold in late 2003, and a 66% share of the refinery company TUPRAS was sold in early 2004,
however, the transaction was later overturned by court action.




                                                     - 11 -

Several additional privatization actions were taken in late 2004 that were called for in the ERL MOP:
ATAKOY Tourism Group and SEKA Paper and Pulp are in the process of privatization, while 23% of
Turkish Airlines was sold in December, 2004.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not applicable.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Institutional Development Impact was substantial:

    ·    Structural fiscal reforms, such as the implementation of more effective expenditure control
         mechanisms and the strengthening of external audit, streamlined and made more effective the
         budgetary process.
    ·    In the Social Security area:
         o For the first time in the country's history, an unemployment scheme was instituted, which
             promises to improve the efficiency of labor markets.
         o Legislation was passed to support the establishment of individual pension plans.
    ·    In agriculture:
         o A DIS system was established and most subsidies and price supports were phased out.
         o ASCUs were essentially transformed into autonomous entities, with no budgetary funding
         o State-owned agricultural enterprises were privatized or prepared for privatization.
    ·    In the telecomm area:
         o Legislation was passed that permitted privatization of TT and the establishment of a regulatory
             authority (TA), which was launched.
         o The telecomm market was liberalized, and TT's exclusive right to provide fixed-line service
             was ended.
    ·    In the energy area:
         o A constitutional basis was laid for privatization of the electricity sector
         o An Electricity Market Law was passed, and a fully-functional energy regulatory authority
             established (EMRA). EMRA was also designated as the regulator for natural gas.
         o The electricity generation and transmission company was split into 2 entities.
         o Two city natural gas distribution systems were privatized.
    ·    In enterprise privatization, 4 large SOEs were privatized.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The November 2002 elections and the consequent change of government delayed some reform efforts, as
new Ministers and other officials were brought up to date on the reform program.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
During the first 2 years of the project, the macroeconomic environment was very turbulent with financial
crises in November, 2000, and February, 2001. This hindered project performance, especially in the social
security area, where it caused receipts to fall and deficits to widen.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:




                                                     - 12 -

None.

5.4 Costs and financing:
As noted earlier, a first tranche of US$384.6 million was disbursed upon effectiveness in June, 2000, and a
second tranche of US$375 million was disbursed in April, 2004. The original closing date was September
30, 2001, but as described above closing was delayed until April 30, 2004.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability is likely:

    ·   Ongoing and planned Bank projects (ARIP, PFPSAL III, Energy Liberalization Project) as well as
        an ongoing Fund program increase the likelihood that reforms achieved under ERP will endure, and
        indeed, be expanded.
    ·   The government, currently reaping the benefits and increased revenues in part resulting from fiscal
        structural reforms, is unlikely to backtrack.
    ·   Having expended considerable political capital to implement Social Security reforms (e.g.,
        increased retirement age), the government is unlikely to backtrack, and indeed is now examining
        further reforms.
    ·   The Agricultural Strategy Document--a PFPSAL III Board condition--provides for the
        continuation of the DIS program from 2006 to 2010. Having effected a massive shift in the way
        public funds flow to the agricultural sector--and with strong policy support for the new
        regime--the government would seem highly unlikely to reverse its course.
    ·   The mechanisms (equipment, facilities, staff) to calculate and disburse agricultural price supports
        and subsidies have been liquidated.
    ·   Turkish authorities understand that the potential reintroduction of agricultural subsidies would be
        seen as highly negative by WTO as well as by the EU in the context of Turkey's potential
        accession.
    ·   Given the explosion of demand for wireless service as well as other "new" services, as well as the
        huge fall in prices for many residential and business services, backtracking in the telecomm area
        seems unlikely.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The transition to regular operations has, in effect, already begun. All reforms undertaken under the ERL
have been made part of ongoing government operations. In many cases, reforms started under ERL are
being extended under some of the later operations noted above.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
As discussed earlier under Quality at Entry, the ERL was carefully designed and was the culmination of
several years of discussions and analytic work. The Bank team took explicit account of earlier
unsuccessful efforts to support Turkish reform and designed the ERL to reward short-term reform actions
and set the stage for medium-term actions. Complementary policy support projects were undertaken that
amplified efforts under ERL. Lending was satisfactory.

7.2 Supervision:
Despite the perturbations of the financial crises and the change of government, Bank staff maintained a



                                                      - 13 -

constant dialogue with officials on fulfillment of second tranche project conditions. When macroeconomic
circumstances improved and the government resumed progress toward fulfillment of most policy
commitments, staff worked to facilitate that progress. For example, the Bank played a mediation role in
2003-04 between government agencies that could not reach agreement on how to proceed with energy
sector reforms. The Bank established an Expert Panel of recognized international experts to mediate
differences between the Energy Ministry, EMRA, and the Privatization Agency; this produced a positive
result in the "Strategy Paper."

While the ERL was managed from the Resident Mission, experts from headquarters participated in each of
the policy areas. Staff also participated in all of the Fund missions that reviewed compliance with the
macroeconomic program, and the project team worked closely with the Privatization Social Support Project
to mitigate the social impacts of the reforms. Supervision was satisfactory.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance was satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance in project preparation was satisfactory. The government participated actively in
project preparation, especially by its involvement in the CEM that was completed in parallel with the
project. Many ERL reforms were begun prior to project inception, for example, passage of the Social
Security Law in 1999.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Borrower performance in project implementation was overall satisfactory. While macroeconomic
performance was overall satisfactory, the financial crises of November, 2000, and February, 2001, delayed
project achievement. The introduction of the 2003-04 ad-hoc pension increases was inconsistent with the
objectives of the social security system reform. And has been described above, disagreements among key
agencies involved in energy privatization proved to be an obstacle.

Aside from these deficiencies, however, the Borrower implemented politically difficult reforms across all
the other areas. Achievement has been described above, however, it was the strong commitment of the
Borrower, when confronting vested interests in each area, that permitted the reforms to go forward.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Satisfactory, as explained above.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall borrower performance was satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

Conditions should be realistic:
    ·    In terms of the prior achievements that are required before a condition can be realized: The
         condition on the launch of pre-qualification tenders for the sale of electricity distribution companies
         did not take adequate account of critical precedent steps necessary for its achievement, including
         the specific definition of what is being sold and the corporatization of the distribution companies.
    ·    In terms of the market: The condition for sale of 20% of TT was not accompanied by the
         transfer of any management control, a situation not in conformance with market expectations.




                                                      - 14 -

Borrower ownership is key to effective reform: Reforms in all of the policy areas encompassed by ERL
were controversial and involved large and difficult constituencies. The areas in which the greatest progress
was achieved--agriculture, privatization, fiscal reform and macroeconomic performance--were areas
where the Bank identified a long-term agenda for the government and then played a support role. A high
Bank profile in the reform process would not have been effective.

An effective public communications strategy could have facilitated reform: Such a strategy could have
helped the government develop greater credibility to deal with interest groups.
