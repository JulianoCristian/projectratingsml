This\n            environmental assessment identifies environmental risks\n            connected with the project, and discusses measures to\n            mitigate them. Suggestions are as follows. Minimize dust\n            emissions from land clearing, from drilling and blasting and\n            ground excavation, as well as due to facility construction,\n            and from equipment traffic over temporary roads at the\n            construction site, by using the following methods: Cover\n            stockpiled material with suitable sheet material; sprinkle\n            water on construction areas, and access roads; limit vehicle\n            speed, cover vehicles, and maintain equipment and machinery.\n            Mix ash with gypsum, to be conveyed to mining disposal area.\n            Treat wastewaters from construction areas prior to its\n            discharge to river bodies, and, monitor groundwater quality.\n            Solid wastes, medical and oily wastes, hazardous wastes\n            (such as used batteries, bitumen, cables, copper,\n            fire-fighting foam, adhesives, general chemicals, acids, oil\n            rags and absorbents, solvents, contaminated soils,\n            insulation, paint sludge, used oil and paint cans and drums\n            etc.) should be packaged to be collected in black bags,\n            separated from medical, hazardous, dangerous and packaged\n            wastes. Separately collected domestic wastes will be\n            transported to a temporary waste storage center or\n            container, by special vehicles to be stored separately.\n            Store those recyclable wastes in separate closed containers.\n            Segregate paper, cardboards, plastics and metal packaged\n            wastes according to their type, to be collected in blue\n            bags. Handle other, including hazardous and medical, waste\n            according to regulations. To control noise, restrict hours\n            of operation, and ensure vehicle noise does not exceed\n            permitted levels. To minimize industrial accidents, train\n            personnel in health and safety issues, have workers wear\n            protective equipment, set up a health center on site, and\n            use fire prevention measures."}, "docdt": "2006-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
