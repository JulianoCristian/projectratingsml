Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project for Turkey were as\n            follows: the Bank performance was satisfactory, the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory, and all other ratings are\n            not applicable since the operation is cancelled.\n            Rehabilitation of large power plants is highly complex and\n            risky, and it is difficult to attract interested qualified\n            bidders. To meet the requirement for functional guarantees\n            for plant performance, a contractor faces technical and\n            financing challenges, as well as other factors that are out\n            of the control of the contractor, such as fuel quality.\n            Qualified bidders may not want to take the risks on\n            functional guarantees and to bear on high financial\n            commitments. Perhaps the prudent solution for such\n            investments is through private participation, where the\n            private investor is given the mandate of rehabilitating the\n            plant as well as operating it thereafter. This approach may\n            reduce risk perceptions, and also provide sufficient\n            incentives to the private sector to undertake such\n            investments. A strong and well-staffed implementing agency\n            equipped with suitable decision making authority is\n            necessary for such a large and complex project to be\n            implemented successfully. In addition, it would be useful to\n            consider hiring the services of a qualified and experienced\n            firm to assist the implementing agency in project management\n            and supervision, starting with preparation of tender\n            documents, managing the procurement process, and eventually\n            assisting in implementation."}, "docdt": "2010-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
