EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1         Introduction
Within the framework of the "Preparation of Energy Liberalization Project" assisted by the
World Bank, Republic of Turkey has applied a portion of a grant provided from Japan
Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) fund for the procurement of the
consultant services for the EIA study of the "Rehabilitation of Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal
Power Plant and Construction of Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) Unit". The International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is the administrator of this grant.
Concerning the environmental assessment of the rehabilitation project, the project is
classified as "Category A" by the World Bank and the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) procedure was applied. The EIA study and the procedure has also been carried out
according to both requirements of the current EIA Regulation of Turkish Government
(Official Gazette, No: 25318, 16.12.2003) and the Environmental Assessment Policies and
Procedures of the World Bank (OP/BP/GP 4.01 Environmental Assessment). According to
Turkish EIA Regulation, this project is included in Article 25 (b) that states extra ordinary
conditions for EIA procedure to be applied to the projects which are not subjected to EIA
Regulation officially, but subjected to international funding mechanisms. Therefore, a
unique EIA Report had been prepared for both Turkish Legislation and World Bank
Policies.
The chief objectives of the EIA were to: (a) determine if, based upon estimates of air
quality impacts, the overall program for rehabilitation and FGD installation for the Af,in-
Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant could be sequenced in time: first with a rehabilitation
project (Phase I) to be followed by an FGD installation project (Phase II), if so, (b)
determine impacts of the rehabilitation project and FGD project and necessary mitigating
actions to determine if the FGD project (Phase II) could be derogated. The EIA work
scope included a comparative analysis of air quality with respect to Turkish ambient air
quality standards for SO2 from current AETPP operation and resulting air quality after the
Phase I rehabilitation is completed. Thus, the EIA served as a decision document for
Turkish government officials to determine if the FGD investment was an immediate priority
or could be developed at a later date.
This EIA study has been conducted by ,INAR M(uhendislik MCI,avirlik ve Proje Hizmetleri
Ltd. ;ti. and KEMA International B.V. and this report has been prepared in accordance
with the contract with EUAi.
Aim of the EIA study is to meet both the requirements of the Turkish EIA Legislation and
World Bank for a "Category A" Environmental Assessment study (OP 4.01 Annex B
Content of an EA Category A Report). For this purpose, EIA has been prepared according
to the special EIA format regarding the requirements of the World Bank and Turkish
Ministry of Environment and Forestry
This EIA was prepared using both field surveys and desktop studies (literature survey,
calculation, assessments and modeling).

ELECTRICITY GENERATION              REHABILITATION OF AFSiN-ELBiSTAN A THERMAL POWER
CORPORATION INC.               PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1       Major Conclusions
The EIA procedure yielded the following major conclusions:
*  The rehabilitation of the ESPs on the main stack and the Bruden stacks is essential to
address the dust and particulate emission problems.
* The AEAPP operating at full load after rehabilitation/upgrade without an FGD unit will
meet both the Turkish long-term and short-term air quality standards for SO2.
4  In evaluating the EIA, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF) has
recognized that plant performance after rehabilitation will still comply with Turkish air
quality standards for SO2 in the plant vicinity, although the Turkish SO2 emission limit
values are not being met and therefore, has confirmed that it will provide a derogation
period in which to install an FGD in accordance with an Amendment to the "Regulation
on Control of Air Pollution Caused by Industrial Sources" (RCAP) to be issued shortly.
. The rehabilitation of the plant will improve the plant's environmental compliance with
Turkish dust emission standards. Dust emissions have been identified, during public
consultations as a major environmental issue among local groups.
2         Project Description
Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant (AEATPP) is located between Qogulhan and
Alemdar Towns of Af,in District of Kahramanmara, Province. It was established by TEK
during 1984-1987. It has 1355 MWe capacity with its four units and it is one of the most
important power plants in Turkey.
AEATPP is a conventional thermal power plant utilizing low quality lignite from Klslakoy
Region. Lignite is sent to the storage area by conveyors having a capacity of 1 million
tons. Lignite extracted from the different layers of the mine (having several calorific
values) is blended here and the lignite that has 1050 kcal/kg average value is conveyed to
the power plant. The power plant consumes 3000 ton fuel per hour.
Steam temperature and pressure in the boiler are 535°C and 197.5 kg/cm2 respectively
and each boiler produces 1020 ton/h steam. Voltage is 21 kV at the outlet of generator
that is then amplified to 380 kV in order to connect energy to the grid.
Process water is supplied from Ceyhan River Spring in Elbistan. Ash produced is
conveyed back to open mining site by ash conveyors and filled to the vacancies formed by
extraction of coal. These areas are then covered by topsoil and landscaped.
The plant was designed to burn the low quality lignite with high moisture easily without
using supplementary fuel. The system developed for such lignites is to first dry the lignite
to increase its calorific value.
AEATPP is designed for an annual electricity production of 8.800.000.000 kWh. However,
there have been a loss/decrease in capacity and reliability of the plant due to equipment

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
wear and some unscheduled shutdowns. Average efficiency has decreased below the
design efficiency. Therefore, General Directorate of Electricity Generation Corporation
(EUA$) decided that the rehabilitation of the plant is required.
Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant Rehabilitation and FGD Project will be sequenced
into two phases: the first phase includes rehabilitation of the plant and the second phase
will be construction of a Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) plant.
The first phase of the program to be financed by the World Bank is rehabilitation of
AEATPP. The rehabilitation is mainly focused on the rehabilitation of the plant and the
rehabilitation of electrostatic precipitators,
The efficiency of the electrostatic precipitators will be improved, in order to comply with
the Turkish PM10 standard, 100 mg/Nm3.
Scope of the rehabilitation of the plant comprises the following items.
Boiler and Boiler Auxiliaries
It will include necessary maintenance, modernization and rehabilitation studies such as,
replacement of boiler tubes in order to prevent tube leaks, eliminatination of slagging
problems, making the sootblowers functional to reduce fouling on the heating surfaces,
rehabilitation of fuel-oil burners, increasing the performances of the vapor electro-filters.
Turbine and Turbine Auxiliaries
Necessary maintenance, modernization and rehabilitation studies will be carried out such
0                as, rehabilitation or replacement of the automatic by-pass system heater and condensate
drainage and discharge systems, switching the control system to digital system,
rehabilitation of heaters, renewing or rehabilitation of pumps and related control system,
making the on-line observation equipments for chemical parameters functional, and
elimination of coating problems. .
Other Installations
It will include maintenance, modernization and rehabilitation studies in some other
installations such as, making the automatic coal sampling functional, modernization of old
type circuit breakers, improvement of cathodic protection line, taken the neutralization pit
outside the water treatment plant.
In the second phase, the FGD unit to be retrofitted to AEATPP will be similar to FGD unit
in the AEBTPP, and based on wet limestone process, with a 95% reduction efficiency
approximately.
3         Purpose Of The Project
The aims of the World Bank project for AEATPP are as follows:
* Improvement of plant reliability/availability,
* Improvement of the efficiency of the plant,
* Extension of the operating life of the plant, and

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
* Reduction of dust emission levels to fulfill Turkish Environmental Regulations.
3.1      Importance and Necessity of the Project
The energy-environment review carried out by the World Bank and the Government of
Turkey (GoT) concluded that rehabilitation of existing power plants is economically and
environmentally justified. The GoT has identified rehabilitation of all existing thermal
power plants and retrofitting FGD units during the next five years as a high priority of its
energy strategy. Af,in-Elbistan A Power Plant is at the top of the rehabilitation list
because it has experienced the most significant deterioration in its performance and
reliability. Coupled with the need to improve its environmental performance, rehabilitation
is the most cost effective option.
The GoT has also recognized that retrofitting FGD systems on all their thermal power
stations is required both to improve environmental performance in the energy sector and
as one of the conditions of the EU Acquis for the energy sector.
The derogation for a reasonable transition period is required to make necessary
investments to achieve the Turkish emission standards. As it is known, Turkey is a
candidate country for EU membership and the studies have been carried out for the
harmonization of EU environmental legislation-including the EU Large Combustion Plants
(LCP) Directive. It is expected that the EU will grant derogations for Turkey's existing
thermal power plants, since the EU has provided such derogations for both its' newer
members such as Poland and for candidate members such as Romania
Within this context, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) have been
informed about the legislative situation of these thermal power plants to achieve the
emission limit values specified in the Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control and
necessity of the derogation providing a transition period for.PM10 and SO2 emissions.
MENR has requested from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) provision of
derogation for a transition period to achieve the S02 emission limit values for the existing
lignite-fired power plants and the undersecretary level meetings have been carried out.
Within the high-level negotiations, MENR and MoEF agreed on the importance of the
derogation. MENR has recently received an official letter from MoEF related to the draft
derogation item for providing the 5 year-transition period to meet the emission limits given
in the Regulation. Within this framework, the amendment of the Regulation covering the
derogation is expected soon. In case of obtaining the derogation, it will be possible to
realize the rehabilitation of Af§in-Elbistan A Power Plant without the construction of FGD
plant at the first stage and to construct the FGD system on the second stage at the point
in time specified in the derogation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
3.1.1    Improvement of Environmental Performance
The Turkish Air Quality Legislation could be summarized in two different Regulations.
Regulation on Air Quality Protection states the short term and long term ground level
concentration limits to be observed in a defined impact area. The Regulation on Industrial
Air Pollution Control defines the limits for stack gas emissions for various industries. In
this section the focus will be emissions levels specified in the above Regulation.
The main air pollutants of the power plant, which require further control, are particulates
and sulfur dioxide (SO2). NOx-emissions are in the 400-500 mg/Nm3 range, which is in
compliance with the Turkish Environmental Regulations.
Air quality modelling results show that the plant will comply with Turkish air quality
standards after rehabilitation.
SO2 stack emission levels are 2,000 to 15,000 mg/Nm3 depending on the sulfur content of
the coal while the regulatory stack gas S02 emission limit value in Turkey is
1000 mg/Nm3. Therefore an FGD unit will be required as part of the second phase of the
program.
Main goals of the project are to improve reliability and efficiency of the AEATPP and
extend life of the plant to ensure security of energy supply and consequently decrease
emissions of the plant below the limits of Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control and
*                to decrease negative impacts on environment.
The total investment for the rehabilitation project is estimated to be approximately
440 million USD, and the FGD retrofit system is about 220 million USD.
4         Location of The Project
Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant is located within the Kahramanmaras Province of
Turkey. Location of AEATPP is 14 km far from Af,in District and 30 km from Elbistan
District. The nearest settlement place to the AEATPP is ,Cogulhan Town.
AEATPP is located to the 2.5 km east of existing AEBTPP. Location of power plant is 154
km north of Kahramanmara, City.
Project will affect primarily ,ogulhan Town, Af,in District, and Kahramanmaras Province.
5         Baseline Environmental Characteristics of the Project Area
In this section the Baseline environmental characteristic data that were obtained as a
result of literature and field surveys. The baseline environmental measurement results will
be presented in the following sections.
5.1       Meteorological Characteristics
Af,in District is located at the intersection of Mediterranean, Central Anatolia and Eastern
Anatolia. Although the terrestrial climate dominates, characteristics of these three regions
could be observed in this region. Dry and arid weather dominates in the summer while

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
cold and snowy weather dominates in the winter. Most of the rains are formed during
spring and autumn.
5.2       Geology and Geomorphological Characteristics
There are no special geological and geomorphological features and no negative effect of
the activity on the geology.
5.3       Surface and Ground waters
The Elbistan and Goksun plains are groundwater catchment areas around the project
area. The direction of groundwater flow in the project area is from northwest and northeast
to south towards Hurman Creek. The largest river in the project area is Hurman Creek.
5.4       Soil Characteristics
Soils of the region mainly composed of Alluvial, Colluvial, Brown and Red Brown Soils.
Most of the soils have heavy, neutral, less alkaline structure and very rich in lime. Soil of
the region has no problem in view of permeability and salinity.
Af,in District, where AEATPP is located, is approximately 41% agricultural fields, 39%
meadow and pasture lands, 9% forest, 10% others and 1% residential areas.
AEATPP is located on, alluvial, colluvial and forest soil group and the capability class of
the soil is Class I. Erosion degree is "less erosion".
The soil of the region, where AEATPP is located, has very high lime content and alkaline
structure. Therefore they have low acidification sensitivity.
The existing soil sample analysis and literature study shows that the soils of the region
and agricultural areas have alkaline character. Therefore, soils of the region show the
ability to neutralize SO2 deposition.
It is observed during the site surveys around the AEATPP that fly ash from the power
plant deposits on the ground, especially in ,ogulhan Town, which is the nearest
settlement to the power plant. During the public meeting, local farmers stated that the
agricultural products have been affected by the dust emitted from the AEATPP
Farmers of the region interviewed by EIA group experts indicated that there has been a
difference in vegetable production compared to before and after commencement of power
plant's activity, also, drying of the plants was observed. In addition, most of the complaints
were focused on settleable dust problem. These statements are based on farmers own
opinions and observations. However, there is no scientific study or statistical data
justifying complaints or observations.
5.5       Water Resources and Usage
The main water sources of Af,in and Elbistan Districts are Hurman stream, which is a
branch of Ceyhan River, Goksun Stream and Magara Gozu Stream. There has been
irrigated agriculture in the plain side. Hurman stream, passing through the Af,in Plain, is

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
0                 the most important stream of Af,in District. Ceyhan River springs from the PInarba§I
Locality, which is located in 3 km east of Elbistan.
The drinking water of Afsin District is supplied from (obanpinari Spring. This spring is 5
km west of Afsin District and 22 km far from AEATPP. Drinking and potable water source
of Elbistan District is Ceyhan Spring that is southeast of the Elbistan District. The flow rate
of the Ceyhan Spring is 5-7 m3/s. Based on information from Elbistan Municipality, existing
water supply of the Municipality is 0.35 m3/s and the future demand will be about 0.6 m3/s.
After second phase of the project, AEATPP will require 1.5 m3/s water. Therefore, water
supply of the AEATPP will not have a drawback. The drinking water demands of 9ogulhan
and Alemdar Towns are supplied by drinking water network that uses groundwater
sources.
5.6       Flora and Fauna
As a result of the rehabilitation project, the settleable dust emissions from the Af,in-
Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant (AEATPP) will decrease below the limit values of
Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control. This will have a positive impact on the
terrestrial flora of project impact area.
The project impact area does not constitute a special living and breeding habitat for the
fauna species. Planned project will be realized in the existing power plant area; therefore
there will not be any habitat loss for the fauna species. By the rehabilitation of power plant
and construction of FGD unit, the ambient air quality will increase and that will have a
positive impact on terrestrial fauna indirectly.
5.7       Lignite Sources
Af,in-Elbistan lignite reserve located in Kahramanmara, covers an area of almost 100
km2 in Af,in and Elbistan Districts. This region has proven ore deposits of 3.4 billion tones.
Reserve is on the economical open mining facility, considering the 3/1 m3/ton stripping
ratio about 1.7 billion tons of this total reserve is economic. The reserve under
consideration is used as three sectors named Q5llolar, Ki§lak6y and Af,in sectors. The
coal has been used in Af,in-Elbistan Thermal Power Plants.
6         Baseline Environmental Studies Conducted in the Region
Site surveys have been conducted to determine existing baseline environmental
conditions for Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant Rehabilitation Project area and its
close vicinity between 2nd of February and 5th of April 2005. These environmental surveys
covered the noise measurements, surface and groundwater sampling, air quality survey
and soil pollution sampling.
The scope of the work conducted in this region is the determination of the existing
pollution level of the area. The air quality monitoring was conducted during two 60 day
periods for a total duration of approximately four months while the other sampling and
monitoring works were only conducted fGr once. In addition to those studies there were no
other previous baseline studies conducted in the region. Therefore, there were no

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
previous data showing the environmental situation of the region before the power plant
was put into operation and hence it is not possible to compare the existing situation with
the previous one, so that the exact level of impact of the power plant on the environmental
conditions of the area could not be determined. The findings of the analysis could only be
compared and discussed with the regulations and with each other.
6.1       Noise Measurements
Noise survey was conducted between 4h and 13th of February 2005. Purpose of the
survey is to collect the baseline data regarding the background noise levels in the vicinity
of the Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant. For this purpose 12 hours continuous noise
measurements were conducted at totally 7 points.
Baseline noise measurement results were compared with the World Bank standards and
standards stated in Turkish Regulation on Assessment and Management of
Environmental Noise.
The L,q values measured around the Af§in Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant were in
compliance with the maximum allowable values given by Turkish Regulation on
Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise and the World Bank Limits.
6.2       Surface and Groundwater Sampling Studies
Water samples were taken from groundwater wells and surface water to determine the
baseline physical and chemical characteristics of the water resources of the Project site
within the context of surface and groundwater quality survey on 1 5th of February 2005.
Surface and ground water samples were taken around the Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal
Power Plant at totally 6 points which are expected to be affected from project activities.
Two of the wells were selected around the ash deposit area to determine the
characteristics of the groundwater according to the parameters stated at "Regulation on
Hazardous Waste" Annexl 1-A Table.
Samples were analyzed to determine the water classification for pH, DO, Conductivity,
TDS, Total Hardness, COD, BOD, NO3, N03-N, F, Cl, CN, Zn, Cu, Fe, SO4, P04-P, Mg,
As. Samples taken from ash deposit area were also analyzed according to the parameters
stated at the Table of Regulation on Hazardous Waste Control Regulation Annexll-A.
Quality of the water resources is determined incompliance with the Regulation on Water
Pollution Control. Most of the parameters for the surface and groundwater samples show
Class 1 and 2 properties. According to the Regulation, Class 1 is the highest quality water
and the Class 2 is the slightly polluted water that are both explained in Section 3.2.9.2 of
EIA Report.
The water samples taken at two boreholes in the ash deposit area were analyzed
according to the Regulation on Turkish Hazardous Waste Control Annexl 1 A. Parameters
analyzed in ground water samples taken from the ash deposit area are below the limit
values of hazardous waste. So that the existing facilities does not have a negative
influence on the existing water quality of the surrounding water sources.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
6.3       Baseline Soil Contamination Survey
Baseline soil contamination survey was conducted in February 2005. The focus of this
survey was the collection and subsequent analysis of the soil samples from the thermal
power plant and its surrounding to determine the baseline soil conditions. Totally 10 soil
samples were taken for the soil efficiency analysis (texture, salinity, pH, lime, phosphorus,
potassium, organic matter), cation exchange capacity and chemical analysis (TOC, Total
Nitrogen). 2 of the soil samples were taken from the ash deposit area to be analyzed
according to the parameters stated at Regulation on Hazardous Waste Control
Annex 11 A.
6.4       Baseline Air Quality Survey
Baseline air quality measurements were conducted for Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power
Plant rehabilitation area and its close vicinity between 2nd of February and 5th of April 2005
and between 18th of May and 17th of July 2005 to establish current levels of air quality and
to calibrate the air quality model that would subsequently be used to estimate the change
of air quality due to the activities for the Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant
Rehabilitation Project. Measurements were conducted at 10 locations. 2 measurements
were performed at the dominant wind directions on the nearest sensitive receptors to the
Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant along the long term dominant wind directions, and
remaining 8 measurements were conducted at locations in project impact area as
specified in Turkish Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control (Item 40 a-1). During
each monitoring period, at each location, three samples were taken, each representing a
twenty day average.
The overall measurement results for 120 days were compared with the long term (LT) limit
values stated in the Regulation on Air Quality Protection Article 6. The definition of ST limit
value is stated in the regulation as the value that should not be exceeded by the 95% of
all the measurement results of the daily average values. Since only twenty day averages
were available with the diffusion tube measurements, the ST or daily average values were
estimated by air quality modeling. The ISCST3 model developed by the USEPA and
which has been adopted as the international standard for multiple point sources modeling
of air quality impacts from tall stack emissions was used to estimate ST values of air
quality parameters (dust, SO2, and NOx). The definition of LT is stated in the regulation as
the value that should not be exceeded by the arithmetical average of all measurement
results. The ST limit values stated in the regulation are the daily average values that
should not be exceeded 95 per cent of the year.
The pollutants that were the focus of this air quality survey are PM10, HF, HCI, NOx and
SO2. Fractions of the suspended particulate matters with aerodynamic diameters less than
10 micrometers (PM10) are of main concern because of their strong correlation with
human health effects. In this survey, existing ambient PM10 levels were surveyed at ten
sampling points in the vicinity of the existing Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant. On the
other hand settleable particulate mafter having higher aerodynamic diameters, have

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
importance for visual nuisance and plant life since these particulates cover the leaves of
the plants and inhibits the photosynthesis.
Particulate matter (PM), NOx and S02 are three of the primary air pollutants of
combustion. Therefore at ten sampling points in the vicinity of the existing Af,in-Elbistan A
Thermal Power Plant site also were selected for NOx and SO2 analysis. The passive
diffusion tubes were used for these pollutants. Ten sampling points in the vicinity of the
existing Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant site were also selected for HF and HCI
analysis.
In addition the existence of particulate matter problem around Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal
Power Plant is obvious with the field observations. The particulate matter is classified as
settleable (large particulates) and PM10. The measurements were based on the
measurement of PM10 since it has a health hazard risk. This measurement results should
be accepted as a reference for future.
Measured nitrogen oxide concentrations were below the long term limit values.
SO2 was first measured at 10 sampling points around Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power
Plant between 2nd of February and 5th of April 2005. Second phase SO2 measurement
was conducted at the same sampling points around Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant
between 18th of May and 17th of July 2005. Slight decrease was observed in SO2
concentrations during the last period measurements. Af,in Elbistan A Thermal Power
Plant was not operated between 3rd and 13th of July 2005 according to the capacity report
which may explain the difference.
As a result of the air quality modelling analysis conducted, and the results of the ambient
SO2 measurements, it is determined that indicate that the Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power
Plant as it currently operates (at reduced capacity) and after it will be rehabilitated and
operated at full capacity are in compliance with the Turkish ST and LT air quality
standards. First phase air quality measurements conducted during the winter period
(February, March and early April), second phase air quality measurements conducted
during spring-summer period (May, June and July) and the results of continuous SO2
measurement station of EUA$ reflecting reduced capacity operation of the plant show that
both the short term and long term SO2 concentrations are in compliance with the
regulation. Furthermore, the modeling results for the plant operating at full capacity after
rehabilitation will also indicate that the plant will be in compliance with Turkish air quality
regulations.
7         Construction Period Environmental Impacts and The Mitigation
Measures
7.1 Emissions
The rehabilitation project (first phase) will involve removal and/or replacement of obsolete
plant components. Land preparation, excavation and construction works will be involved
for the second phase of the project for the foundation of FGD unit. The material excavated

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
during land preparation will be used as fill material and the excess material will be carried
to internal storage area by the trucks.
The main source of emissions to the atmosphere during construction is dust. Emissions
during the construction of a building can be associated with land clearing, drilling and
blasting, ground excavation, cut and fill operations and construction of a particular facility
itself. Dust emissions often vary substantially from day to day, depending on the level of
activity, the specific operations, and the prevailing meteorological conditions. A large
portion of the emissions can also results from equipment traffic over temporary roads at
the construction site.
Potential impacts associated with dust emissions during the land preparation and the
construction phase will be minimized by the following mitigation methods;
* Stockpiles of material will be done in such a manner so as not expose them
to wind by covering them with suitable sheet material.
* The access road will be water sprinkled to prevent dust formation.
*  Particular attention will be paid to dust suppression on the working width or
at construction sites when working within dry weather conditions.
* Vehicles delivering dusty construction materials to the site or removing spoil
will be limited at speed and covered.
The excavation works during construction of the project will be conducted in accordance
with "Regulation on Excavation Soil, Construction and Ruins Control" published by
18.03.2004 dated and 25406 numbered Official Gazette.
Total emission amount from the working machines were calculated and the emission
value is below the 1.5 kg/h limit value stated by Article 40 of Regulation on Industrial Air
Pollution Control. The vehicles will regularly be maintained and the vehicles will not be left
running unless needed.
7.2 Water and Wastewater
During the construction works of the project, water will be consumed for domestic
purposes and water spraying for dust prevention. Water demand of the AEATPP is
currently supplied from Ceyhan River Spring. During the rehabilitation of AEATPP and the
construction of FGD unit, required water will also be supplied from the same source.
During the construction activities at the first and second phase of the project, the chief
source of wastewater will be from domestic wastewater of the workers. The wastewater
produced will be conveyed to existing domestic wastewater treatment plant of the power
plant. The capacity of the treatment plant will meet the wastewater load of the personnel
during construction phase as the plant was designed for operation phase of the power
plant.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
*                 7.4      Noise
During the construction of both phases of the project noise is expected from trucks, dozer,
mixer, excavator, compressor, and grader. The potential for noise will be minimized by
restricting construction works to those hours permitted by the relevant working hours.
The noises from the vehicles used for the construction will not exceed the standard noise
levels and the limits of Regulation on Assessment and Management of Environmental
Noise will be met.
According to the calculations, noise level is below 70 dBA at 150 m distance from the
construction site. Nearest residential area is located 600 m far away from the AEATPP
location therefore noise levels would not expected to be excessive to have negative
impact on the community.
The Contractor will supply the personnel protective equipment such as ear guards.
Personnel employed for the construction works will be accommodated in the existing
guesthouse of the power plant, ,ogulhan Town and/or houses in the Af,in District.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
8         Environmental Impacts during Operation Phase of the Project and
Necessary Mitigation Measures
8.1       Water Consumption
All of the water required for process (feed water, cooling water and domestic water)
demand of AEATPP is supplied from Ceyhan Spring in Elbistan. Water is pumped to the
power plant by four pumps each has 1800 m3/h capacity and two steel pipelines have
been used for this purpose. Each line has 1 meter diameter and 30 km length. Incoming
water is demineralized before it is used in the process.
Maximum water consumption of the AEATPP is about 4300 t/h. Raw water line currently
feeding the AEATPP has a capacity of 7200 m3/h and the current maximum demand of
AEATPP is 4300 t/h. When the FGD is retrofitted at AEATPP it will require 1000 t/h water
supply. Therefore, the current source, namely Ceyhan Spring is enough for both the water
demand of process and FGD of AEATPP.
8.2       Wastewater
In AEATPP, some of the wastewater is reused and some part is discharged. The
wastewater to be discharged is treated at sewage or ash water treatment plants and then
discharged to ,ogulhan River in compliance with discharge standards.
8.3       Air Quality Impacts and Air Quality Dispersion Modeling
The stack gas emission report of TUBITAK-MAM prepared at the year 2000, for SO2 and
PM concentrations of the power plant were used to estimate the source strength.
The calculations are carried out with a US-EPA regulatory model ISCST3 that is a well
known model and is the standard for most international studies. It is a satisfactory model
for dispersion calculations. The model is especially designed for tall stacks.
For the purpose of this project the short term version has been applied, since hour-by-
hour meteorology data is available and it is generally recognized that detailed modeling
with hour-by-hour meteorology will result in more precise calculations. It is especially
suitable for the Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant. The model accepts hourly
meteorological data records to define the conditions for plume rise, transport, diffusion,
and deposition. The model estimates the concentration or deposition value for each
source and receptor combination for each hour of input meteorology, and calculates both
yearly averaged and short term (daily) averages.
Long term average values calculated by the model are average concentrations calculated
over separate atmospheric classes and averaged over at least one year. Since the one
year period might not be considered to be representative, 3 years period is used in
modeling studies.
For the dispersion of the emissions from power plant, modeling was applied for both the
existing situation of the power plant and 3 different scenarios. First case is according to
the existing situation of power plant, second case is the no FGD and PM emissions are

limited to 100 mg/Nm3 by ESPs, Third case is the FGD option and 100 mg/ Nm3 PM
concentration, the fourth case is FGD option an 50 mg/Nm3 PM concentration is limited by
ESP. For each case, the contribution of AEBTPP was also taken into account.
Dispersion calculations are carried out, using the following elements:
* emission data,
* surface parameters,
* meteorological data, and
* dispersion model.
Hourly observations of three years data were used to calculate the daily and annual
average concentrations for existing and future situation around power plant.
8.3.1     Modeling Results for Existing Situation Scenario
For the existing situation, the capacity factor of the power plant was taken as 40% in the
modelling studies.
8.3.1.1.  S02
1.49% of the model results of over 1,840,695 result (365 days x 1681 grid points x 3
years) exceed the 400 pg/M3. Therefore there is no violation with Turkish short term air
quality standard that is 5% of the results should not exceed 400 pg/M3. In addition, both
the short term air quality standard (<5 per cent df the daily average values to exceed 400
pg/M3) and the long term annual average air quality characteristics are also in compliance
with Turkish air quality standards at residential areas within the impact area of the project.
8.3.1.2.  NOx
The maximum annual average concentration and maximum daily average concentration
values calculated by the model are in compliance with the Turkish Regulation.
8.3.1.3.  PM1o
1.71 % of the model results of over 1.840.695 result (365 days xl 681 grid points x 3 years)
exceed the 300 pg/M3. Therefore there is no violation with Turkish short term air quality
standard that is 5% of the results should not exceed 300 pg/M3. Annual average air quality
characteristics are also in compliance at residential areas within the impact area of the
project.
8.3.2     Rehabilitation Scenarios
8.3.2.1.  Base scenario
The base scenario is the rehabilitation of the power plant without FGD. ESPs will be
installed in this option. All of the stacks of the power plant will operate, PM10 emission will
be reduced to 100 mg/Nm3. Ambient PM10 and SO2 levels will generally be in compliance
with the ST and LT limits of the Turkish Regulation.

CORPORATION INC.               PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
8.3.2.2.  Alternative 1 with FGD
In this scenario a FGD is installed and will reduce the SO2 emission concentration so it
complies with 1000mg/Nm3 which is the stack gas emission limit value of Turkish
Regulation. The dust (PM10) emission will be reduced to 100mg/Nm3. All ST and LT
ground levels of PM,0 and SO2 concentration calculation values comply with Turkish air
quality limits.
8.3.2.3.  Alternative 2 with FGD
In this scenario a FGD is installed and will reduce the SO2 emission concentration to
1000mg/Nm3. The dust emission concentration will be reduced to 50mg/Nm3. In this
alternative there is no difference in the ground level SO2 contribution. The stack gas dust
(PM,0) concentration will be reduced by a factor of two compared to Alternative 1 with
FGD.
8.3.3     Discussion of the Results of Dispersion Calculations
Using the ISCST3 model, the dispersion calculations was carried out for So2, PM10 and
NO).
For PM10, NO, and SO2 there are both long term and short term averaged limit values
given in Turkish Regulation were checked.
For existing case, base scenario and the alternatives with FGD, average annual (long
term) and short term (daily) air quality characteristics in Af§in-Elbistan area for residential
centers are in compliance with the long term air quality limits.
As a result of the modeling scenarios, it was determined that without an FGD, after the
rehabilitation, operation of the Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant would comply with
Turkish Ambient Air Quality Regulation.
8.4       Ash and Gypsum Disposal
Ash and slag produced by combustion in the power plant have been carried by ash
transportation system. Ash is first removed by the ESPs and then it is conveyed to mining
area by ash conveyors and buried there by filling the empty area caused by the coal
extraction.
The ashes of AEATPP were analyzed according to parameters of Regulation on
Hazardous Waste Control Annex 11-A and it was observed that ash is not in the
hazardous waste classification stated in the regulation in force.
At the second phase of the project, the gypsum from FGD unit will be mixed with ash and
then the mixture will be conveyed to the disposal at the mining area. Amount of gypsum
produced will be about 5,750 millions ton per year including sludge and ash. The water
amount in the gypsum will supply the moisture needs of the mixture to be conveyed. The
disposal of the mixture will be the same as the method stated above. Recycling of the
gypsum is not possible in this region. Ash and gypsum mixture will be disposed at the
mining area. Gypsum and waste ash from the power plant will be watered to prevent
blowing.

CORPORATION INC.               PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The ashes of existing AEATPP were analyzed by Middle East Technical University
Environmental Engineering Department according to parameters of Regulation on
Hazardous Waste Control Annex 11-A and the results are presented in the report of
"Research Project of Middle East Technical University on Storage of Thermal Power
Plants Ashes of TEAS According to the Regulation on Hazardous Waste Control (Project
Code No: 98.03.11.28)". The results were compared with the Regulation on Hazardous
Waste Control Annex 11-A and all parameters between the limit values and or in the
defined range, therefore the ashes can be land filled.
The cover of the disposal site will be afforested as current condition.
8.5       Other Solid Wastes
Disposal of sludge produced from wastewater treatment plant will be carried out according
to the Regulation on Solid Waste Control and regulation on Soil Pollution Control dated
31.05.2005.
Domestic solid wastes will also be produced during the operation period of the AEATPP.
Existing domestic waste production rate of power plant is 146,000 kg per year. Solid
wastes are collected by a private firm and they are disposed. After the first and second
phases of the project, same procedure will continue, no change in the amount of solid
waste is expected and the disposal method will remain the same if no additional
employment will be necessary.
8.6       Noise
Noise originates from workplace sites with high-powered equipment such as the steam
turbine, generator, and substations. The noise from these sources may exceed 85 decibel
acoustic (dBA) in the production area. The personnel working at these places should use
ear protection equipment. The impact of noise will be negligible beyond 500 m from the
site.
8.7       Soil Acidification
General sensitivity classification of soil properties shows that soil samples of the project
area are not sensitive to acid deposition. Furthermore, sensivity to alkaline cation loss,
sensivity to dissolved "Al" and general sensivity is "L" Category (low sensivity).
In conclusion, the project will not expected to have a negative impact on regional soil
quality.
8.8      Impacts of the Project on Existing Agricultural Areas and Agricultural
Products
Within the scope of the first phase, rehabilitation project, of AEATPP, the electrofilters will
be rehabilitated and ash will not be discharged on the soil and agricultural areas.

ELECTRICITY GENERATION              REHABILITATION OF AF,iN-ELBiSTAN A THERMAL POWER
CORPORATION INC.               PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In addition to that, at the second phase of the project FGD unit will be installed and the
FGD retrofit will decrease the ground level concentration of S02 emissions below the
limits of the Turkish Regulation.
8.9      Impacts on Groundwater and Surface Water and Mitigation Measures
Both sewage and ash water treatment plant will be in use during the operation of the
AEATPP. Therefore there will not be any discharge from the plant to the receiving water
bodies without treatment. Discharge parameters will be in compliance with the limits of
Water Pollution Control Regulation published on Official Gazette dated 315t of December
2004 and numbered 25687.
At the second phase of the project, gypsum produced at the FGD unit will be disposed by
discharging into the mining area where lignite is recovered completely. Low solubility of
ash and gypsum decreases the pollution risk. Dissolution and negative effect on
groundwater is not expected. Since the gypsum sludge is alkaline it tends to immobilize
heavy metals, preventing their leaching and subsequent migration to groundwater.
Groundwater quality around the AEATPP will be monitored regularly during the operation
of the project.
8.10      Occupational Health and Safety
One of the expected health effects of the existing plant is the air pollution level resulting
from the power plant. Results of stack gas measurements conducted by TUBiTAK MAM in
2000 show that dust and S02 emissions exceeds the limits of Regulation on Air Pollution
Control due to the failure ESP and lack of FGD unit. Therefore EUAS has planned the
rehabilitation of AEATPP and FGD retrofit.
Emissions will be under the limits of the Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control
currently in use.
Industrial accidents may be another risk that is normally seen at all industrial plants.
Personnel will be trained on Occupational Health and Safety Rules in order to guarantee
safety at plant. Details are given by EMP in the Annex 1A of the EIA report.
Waste management will properly be applied in the plant. All wastes will be collected and
disposed in accordance with Regulation on Water Pollution Control, Regulation on
Industrial Air Pollution Control, Regulation on Hazardous Wastes Control and Regulation
on Hazardous Chemicals.
Medical wastes produced from medical center of power plant will be disposed in
compliance with the Regulation on Medical Waste Control published by Official Gazette
dated 20.05.1993 and numbered 21586.
Fire fighting system will always be present, tested and in service in the plant.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The complaints of the public on the existing emissions from the plant, was especially
focused on dust deposition. Health problem and damage on agricultural products are also
mentioned by the participants and local residents. Another subject they mentioned is the
employment. Recruitment at the both AEATPP and AEBTPP is their common request.
The draft EIA report was made available for the public and NGOs at the Municipalities of
,Cogulhan Town, Af,in and Elbistan Districts, Kahramanmaras Provincial Directorate of
Environment and Forestry, Management offices of AEATPP and AEBTPP and the contact
office of QINAR in ,ogulhan. Availability of draft EIA report for review of interested parties
for duration of 15 days starting from the 1 5th of August 2005 was announced by
Kahramanmara, Provincial Directorate of Environment and Forestry and local
newspapers. Both Turkish and English summary of the EIA Report was also announced to
people at the web site of Qanar Muhendislik Mu,avirlik ve Proje Hizmetleri Ltd.,ti.
(www.cinarmuhendislik.com).
The comments of the public and NGO's on the draft EIA and their statements at public
meeting were incorporated in the EIA Report. A general complaint of the public is the air
pollutant emissions of the existing power plant. People believe that the rehabilitation
project and FGD installation project on the second stage will decrease the emissions from
the power plant and they present their thanks to E0AS,.
The copies of EIA Report were distributed to the official institutions after the EIA Report
was accepted by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry as a final document.
11       Impacts of the Project on Socio-Economic Environment and
Environmental Cost Benefit Analysis
As it is stated in the report, the failures caused decrease in the production capacity of the
AEATPP. Its production is very low compared to its design capacity. The rehabilitation is
inevitable because AEATPP has very important role in the economical use of the lignite
reserves and reverse as energy in Af,in-Elbistan Region and this power plant is the first
power plant of the region. The rehabilitation will decrease the production cost.
Environmental performance of the existing power plant has also been decreased due to
the failures in the plant especially on ESPs. PM and SO2 emissions of the power plant
exceeds the limit values of Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control. By this project,
ESP rehabilitation and FGD retrofit will provide lower emissions; SO2 and PM
concentrations will decrease the emission limit values of the regulation. Therefore,
negative impacts on human health, agricultural products and other living organisms will
be minimized.
12        Project Alternatives
Rehabilitation of the existing power plant on the first phase and construction of FGD unit
on the second phase has no other alternative.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
At the second phase, the most appropriate areas will be preferred for the location of FGD
unit and its buildings. From the technological point of view, the planned system for the
FGD, is wet-limestone process which is the most efficient system.
1 3       Conclusion
Main goals of the Project are to improve reliability and efficiency of the AEATPP and
extend the life of the plant and to decrease emissions of the plant below the limits of
Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control.
Rehabilitation of AEATPP at the first phase and installation of FGD unit at the second
phase will guarantee reliability and efficiency of the plant, it will also extend the life of the
plant and it will increase environmental performance of the plant which is one of the most
important power plants of Turkey.

CHAPTER 1: DEFINITION AND PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
(Definition, lifetime, and means of service of the project, the importance and necessity of
the project from the economical point of view, cost-benefit analysis of the project)
Definition of the Project
Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant (AEATPP), located between ,ogulhan and
Alemdar Towns of Af,in District of Kahramanmara, Province and established by TEK
during 1984-1987, has 1355 MWe capacity with its four units and one of the most
important power plants in Turkey. Installed capacities and operation dates of the power
plant are as follows.
Unit 1: 340 MWe, 07.07.1984
Unit 2: 340 MWe, 23.05.1984
Unit 3: 340 MWe, 25.01.1986
Unit4: 335 MWe, 21.11.1987
AEATPP is designed for an annual electricity production of 8,800,000,000 kWh.
However, there has been a loss/decrease in capacity and reliability of the plant due to the
equipment wear and some unscheduled shutdowns. Average efficiency has decreased
below the design efficiency. Therefore, General Directorate of Electricity Generation
Corporation (EUA,) decided that the rehabilitation of the plant is required for the
prevention of the generation losses, replacement of the worn or non-functional parts and
modernization of some parts.
Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant Rehabilitation and FGD Project will be
sequenced into two phases: the first phase includes rehabilitation of the plant and the
second phase will be construction of a Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) plant.
The first phase of the program to be financed by the World Bank is rehabilitation of
AEATPP. It will include maintenance, repair, rehabilitation and modernization of mainly
boiler, turbine accessories, ESPs, coal and ash systems, electrical systems, control and
monitoring system. In the second phase, the FGD unit to be retrofitted to AEATPP will be
similar to FGD unit in the AEBTPP, and based on wet limestone process.
FGD unit that will be established as retrofit in the second stage of the project will be
similar to the FGD unit in the AEBTPP, and based on wet limestone process. For the
planned project, flue gas discharge from cooling tower after treatment and collected at
one system is proposed.
Purpose of the Project
The aims of World Bank project for AEATPP are as follows:
*  Improvement of plant reliability/availability
*  Improvement of the efficiency of the plant
*  Extension of the operating life of the plant, and

Importance, Necessity of the Project and Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Project
Coal has an important role to play in meeting Turkey's rapidly growing demand for
energy. However, at the same time, there is considerable concern about the
environmental impact of burning fossil fuels that is one of the most important energy
sources for Turkey. Coal contributes for nearly 25% of the total primary energy production.
The lignite consumption in electrical energy is about 15%. In contrast, hard coal
accounted for only some 2% of the power generation fuel-supply. According to this, the
ratio of the coal in electrical energy is about 15.6%. Lignite reserves in Turkey amount to
more than 8.3 billion tones and are spread throughout the country. The biggest lignite
deposits, 40% of total identified resources, are in the Af,in-Elbistan region. Lignite is
extracted from the quarries of both TKI and EUAt; in Turkey and the annual total coal
consumption is about 52 million ton. There is a small but growing private sector that
supplies local power plant.
Turkish lignites are characterized by high ash and sulfur and a low caloric value
which ranges from less than 4 MJ up to 17 MJ/kg. However, approximately 66% of the
reserves range between 4-8 MJ/kg. Lignite will continue to be used primarily by mine-
mouth power plants designed to handle such low quality coal, from the points of view of
both reliability and environmental impact.
The energy-environment review carried out by the World Bank and the Government
of Turkey (GoT) concluded that rehabilitation of existing power plants is economically and
environmentally justified. The GoT has identified rehabilitation of all existing thermal
power plants and retrofitting FGD units during the next five years as a high priority of its
energy strategy. Af§in-Elbistan A Power Plant is at the top of the rehabilitation list because
it has experienced the most significant deterioration in its performance and reliability.
Coupled with the need to improve its environmental performance, rehabilitation is the
most cost effective option.
Following table shows key operating statistics of the plant.

While the design data were reviewed for all loads, including full load, the focus of the
evaluation (see table below) focuses on approximately 80% load because this was the
typical operating output presently. Actual data was obtained during the site visit of the
Project Team on 25th of February, 2004. The bold numbers in the actual data column
indicate parameters, which deviated significantly from the design values. More
specifically, and in addition to the turbine, boiler and plant efficiencies:
*   Reheat spray is 40 tons/h vs. 16.5 tons/h which is the design value
*   Stack gas temperature is 22300 vs. 160°C which is the design value
*   Excess air measured by excess oxygen in the economizer outlet is 10.6%             vs. the
design value of 4.4%.
*   All these have a significant adverse impact on plant efficiency.

Availability of the units of AEATPP has been reduced significantly from 70-80% to
30-40%, the decline is severe nevertheless and reflects deteriorating plant reliability.
Plant efficiency has declined by approximately 2.3 percentage points since 1998
(28.90% vs and 31.30%) and 7.7 percentage points below design value (36.6%). Also,
the units (even though designed for 344 MWnet output) cannot produce more than an
average of 305 MWnet and some units have been limited to even lower level.
The GoT has also recognized that retrofitting FGD systems on all their thermal
power stations is required both to improve environmental performance in the energy
sector and as one of the conditions of the EU Acquis for the energy sector.
The limit values for SO2 emissions given in the Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution
Control cannot be achieved in some of the existing thermal power plants and the
construction of FGD system is required. In spite of this requirement, these thermal power
plants, including Af,in-Elbistan A Power Plant, could not be retrofitted with the FGD
system because of the substantial investment requirements. These plants are very
important to provide the security of energy supply and they are in operation although the
requirements of the Environmental Legislation can not be met.

CORPORATION INC.               PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
Therefore, the derogation for a reasonable transition period is required to make
necessary investments. As it is known, Turkey is a candidate for EU membership and the
studies have been carried out for the harmonization of EU environmental legislation
including the EU Large Combustion Plants (LCP) Directive. It is expected that the EU will
grant Turkey derogations for its' existing thermal power plants, since the EU has provided
such derogations for both its' newer members such as Poland and for candidate members
such as Romania.
Within this context, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) have
been informed about the legislative situation of these thermal power plants to achieve the
emission limit values specified in the Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control and
necessity of the derogation providing a transition period for PM and S02 emissions up to
2010 and 2015, respectively. MENR has requested from the Ministry of Environment and
Forestry (MoEF) provision of derogation for a transition period to achieve the S02
emission limit values for the existing lignite-fired power plants and the undersecretary
level meetings have been carried out. Within the high-level negotiations, MENR and
MoEF agreed on the importance of the derogation. MENR has recently received an official
letter from MoEF related to the draft derogation item for providing the 5 year-transition
period to meet the emission limit values on the condition that to achieve the air quality
standards given in the Regulation on Protection of Air Quality. Within this framework, the
amendment of the Regulation covering the derogation is expected. In case of obtaining
derogation, it will be possible to realize the rehabilitation Af,in-Elbistan A Power Plant at
the first phase and to construct the FGD system on the second phase, at the point in time
specified in the derogation.
Furthermore, emissions are above Turkey's environmental standards, and control of
particulates and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are needed. Particulates are in the 420-8,000
mg/Nm3 range (dry basis corrected for 6% 02), significantly above the 100 mg/Nm3
required by Turkish environmental regulations. S02 emissions range from 2,000 to 15,000
mg/Nm3 depending on the sulfur content of the coal. Flue gas desulfurization (FGD)
systems are needed to reduce S02 emissions below 1000 mg/Nm3.
Improvement of Environmental Performance
The Turkish Air Quality Legislation could be summarized in two different Regulations
such as Regulation on Air Quality Protection which states the short term and long term
ground level concentration limits to be observed in a defined impact area and secondly
The Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control that defines the limits for stack gas
emissions for various industries. In this section the focus will be emissions levels specified
in the above Regulation.
The main air pollutants of the power plant, which require further control, are
particulates and sulfur dioxide (SO2). NOx-emissions are in the 400-500 mg/Nm3 range,
which is in compliance with the Turkish Environmental Regulations.
Particulates from the Bruden filters are in the 1,200-8,000 mg/Nm3 range while the
electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) downstream of the boiler have similar performance (420

mg/Nm3 to 6,000 mg/Nm3) which is above the current regulatory limit value of 100
mg/Nm3. Bruden (vapor) filters are used to separate vapor and coal dust. The moisture
content in the coal is evaporated by flue gas heating process in the mills. After mills, 1/3 of
coal dust together with 2/3 of gas leaving mills goes to the bruden filters where coal dust
is collected and fed to the boiler and steam is exhausted to the atmosphere by vapor fans.
SO2 is not controlled resulting in stack emission levels of 2,000 to 15,000 mg/Nm3
depending on the sulfur content of the coal where the regulatory stack gas S02 emission
limit value in Turkey is 1000 mg/Nm3. Therefore an FGD unit will be required as part of the
second phase of the program.
Main goals of the project are to improve reliability and efficiency of the AEATPP and
extend life of the plant to ensure security of energy supply and consequently decrease
emissions of the plant below the limits of Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control and
to decrease negative impacts on environment.
The total investment for the rehabilitation project is estimated to be approximately
440 million USD and the FGD retrofit system is about 220 million USD.
Cost-Benefit Analysis
Rehabilitation of AEATPP is cost-effective, as one of the low-cost producing stations
in Turkey. Its production costs, 1.5-1.7 cents/kWh when the plant capacity factor is high,
are consistent with the other lignite-fired plants (e.g., Seyitomer and Yatagan) and they
are the lowest in Turkey's power system. Production costs of competing natural gas-fired
power plants have averaged at 3.6-4.1 cents/kWh. AEATPP rehabilitation is a part of
Turkey's least-cost development plan.
Main Assumptions
*  Discount rate: 10%
*  Capacity factor: 60% without the rehabilitation and 75% with rehabilitation
*  Recovery of plant output from 305 MWnet to 344 MWnet for each unit
*  Displacement power cost: 3.878 cents/kWh
*  Production cost without rehabilitation: 1.499 cents/kWh
*  Production cost after rehabilitation: 0.941 cents/kWh
Also, a number of sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of
certain parameters, which possess some uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of the
project. The results in case that capacity factor with rehabilitation varies are summarized
below.

The above Table demonstrates that, if following rehabilitation, AEATPP units can
sustain more than around 70% capacity factor, the rehabilitation project has an internal
rate of return above 20%.
The total investment of the rehabilitation project is estimated to be approximately
440 million USD, and the FGD retrofit system is about 220 million USD.
Environmental Impact Assessment of the Project
Within the framework of the "Preparation of Energy Liberalization Project" assisted
by the World Bank, Republic of Turkey has applied a portion of a grant provided from
Japan Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) fund for the procurement of
the consultant services for the EIA study of the "Rehabilitation of Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal
Power Plant and Construction of Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) Unit". The International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is the administrator of this grant.
Concerning the environmental assessment of the rehabilitation project, the project is
classified as "Category A" by the World Bank and the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) procedure was applied. The EIA study and the procedure has also been carried out
according to both requirements of the current EIA Regulation of Turkish Government
(Official Gazette, No: 25318, 16.12.2003) and the Environmental Assessment Policies and
Procedures of the World Bank (OP/BP/GP 4.01 Environmental Assessment). According to
Turkish EIA Regulation, this project is included in Article 25 b that states extra ordinary
conditions for EIA procedure to be applied to the projects which are not subjected to EIA
Regulation officially, but subjected to international funding mechanisms. Therefore, a
unique EIA Report had been prepared for both Turkish Legislation and World Bank
Policies.
The chief objectives of the EIA were to (a) to determine if, based upon estimates of
air quality impacts, the overall program for rehabilitation and FGD installation for the Afsin-
Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant could be sequenced in time: first with a rehabilitation
project (phase 1) to be followed by an FGD installation project (phase 11), if so, (b)
determine impacts of the rehabilitation project and FGD project and necessary mitigating
actions. To determine if the FGD project (phase 11) could be derogated, the EIA work
scope included a comparative analysis of air quality with respect to Turkish ambient air
quality standards for SO2 from current AETPP operation and resulting air quality after the
phase I rehabilitation is completed. Thus the EIA served as a decision document for
Turkish government officials to determine if the FGD investment was an immediate priority
or could be developed at a later date.
EIA Team
The EIA study has been conducted by QINAR MOhendislik Mu,savirlik ve Proje
Hizmetleri Ltd. 5ti. and KEMA International B.V. and this report has been prepared in
accordance with the contract with EUA,.
Aim of the EIA study is to meet both the requirements of the Turkish EIA Legislation
and World Bank for a Category "A" Environmental Assessment study (OP 4.01 Annex B

Content of an EA Category A Report). For this purpose, EIA has been prepared according
to the special EIA format regarding the requirements of the World Bank and Turkish
Ministry of Environment and Forestry.
EIA Approach
This EIA was prepared using both field survey and desktop study (literature survey,
calculation, assessments and modeling).
Aim of the study is the preparation of the EIA report for the project to analyze all
environmental impacts of the project including impacts on air and water quality, water use
requirements, waste water and solid waste disposal, etc. as well as cumulative impacts
associated with the full operation of both Afsin-Elbistan units A and B.
Within the scope above, general aim of EIA is as stated below:
 to gather information on the existing environment
* to identify environmental constraints and opportunities associated with the area
which may be affected by the project;
. to identify and assess potential environmental impacts which may arise during
both the construction and operation of the project,
. to outline measures and/or design criteria to mitigate potential concerns or
impacts.
Method
Environmental information was obtained through site visits, surveys, consultation
with interested parties and a review of existing Turkish legislation and other literature. The
surveys included in-situ and laboratory analysis of existing environmental components
such as water, air, noise and soil.
This information was used to:
*  provide details of baseline environmental conditions present on the site and within
the surrounding area;
*  identify the potential causes of environmental impact, and;
* assess the impacts on environmental resources and sensitivities, taking account of
mitigation measures to be incorporated into the design process.
Assessment Criteria
The prediction of impact used a range of techniques, including:
. those specified in Turkish legislation and standards;
. guidelines, standards and regulations of World Bank;
. acceptable environmental software;
. comparative analysis, and;
. professional judgment.
*                                                     8

CHAPTER III: DETERMINATION OF THE AREA TO BE AFFECTED
FROM THE PROJECT AND DESCRIPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROPERTIES IN THIS AREA
(Definition of environmental issues to be affected from the project and interaction between
these factors)
111.1 Determination of the Area to be Affected From the Project, Illustration of
the Area on the Map
Project will be realized in the existing area of AEATPP. AEATPP is located within the
Kahramanmara, Province of Turkey. Location of the AEATPP is 14 km far from Af,in
District and 30 km from Elbistan District. The nearest settlement places to the AEATPP
are ,ogulhan Town, 500 meter from the power plant, and Alemdar Town that is about
1 km far from the power plant.
In order to determine the area that will be affected by the project, environmental,
economical and social impacts have to be assessed together. These impacts may be
direct or indirect. As the construction and operation phases of the project are considered,
the impacts can be divided into two groups of long-term impacts and short-term impacts.
The impacts of the construction phase are temporary and short-term. On the contrary,
most of the impacts of the operation phase are long-term effects. Considering all impacts,
the most important subject is the impact of the AEATPP on air quality. The impact area of
the project has been chosen considering this. Therefore, environmental impact area of the
project is taken as 20 kmx20 km area for which air quality modelling has been applied.
This area is selected as impact area considering the Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution
Control.
Project will affect ,ogulhan Town, Af,in District, and Kahramanmara, Province from
the economical and social point of view. The major economic affect will be on whole
Turkey.
111.2. Characteristics of the Physical and Biological Environment and Use of
Natural Resources
3.2.1. Meteorological and Climatological Characteristics (General and local
climatological characteristics of the region, topographical structure of the Project region,
temperature and precipitation regime, relative moisture, evaporation, number of the days
when inversion occurs, stability, wind direction and speed, annual and seasonal wind rose
etc.)
Because location of Kahramanmara, Province far from the sea and much higher
than the sea level, typical Mediterranean Climate is not observed in this province.
Because the province is close to Central and Eastern Anatolia, continental climate
influences here. As a result, it can be said that a modified Mediterranean Climate
influenced by continental climate is dominant here. In the most of the province, dry and
arid weather dominates in the summer while cold and snowy weather dominates in the
winter but moderate weather of Mediterranean Climate is observed in the plains.

0                       Af,in District is located at a point where Mediterranean, Central Anatolia and
Eastern Anatolia intersect. Therefore characteristics of these three regions are observed
in Af,in. Continental climate dominates. Dry and arid weather dominates in the summer
while cold and snowy weather dominates in the winter. Most of the rains are formed
during spring and autumn.
AEATPP is located on Af,in-Elbistan Plain and the average elevation of the region is
about 1100-1300 meter. The power plant was constructed on a flat land. Meteorological
data on the Af,in Meteorological Station is given by Table 3.2.1.1.

Elevation                                 1180m
General Directorate of State Meteorological Works Af,in Meteorological Station
Observation Records show that average temperature during 1975-2004 ranges between -
3.2 OC (January) and 23.2 OC (July), its average 10.2 °C (annual). Temperature increases
from January to July regularly and it starts to decrease from August until December. The
coldest months are December, January and February and the average temperature during
these months is below 0OC.
Maximum and minimum average relative moisture are 60% and 6% respectively.
These ratios are significantly dependent on evaporation. In addition, wind direction affects
relative moisture. Records also show that maximum and minimum average precipitation
amount is observed during December and August as 64.8 mm and 1.1 mm.
Detailed meteorological data, especially on rainfall, temperature, atmospherical
stability, is given by Section IV.2.5, where air quality modelling is presented.

3.2.2. Geological and Hydrogeological Characteristics
Geology of the Project Area
The geological units at the project area and its surrounding from oldest to youngest
are given below. The general geological map (1/25000) of the project area and the
generalized columnar section of the study area are given in Figure 3.2.2.1 and
Figure 3.2.2.2, respectively.
-  Permo-Carboniferous (limestones phyllite-schist facies)
- Upper Cretaceous (limestones Alacall Complex-conglomerates, sandstone, clayey
schist)
- Eocene ( limestones)
- Neogene
- Miocene (marl, sandstone)
-  Plio-Pleistocene  (clay,  gravelly-sandy  clay,  lignite,  Gidya  level
decomposed organisms, silt, sand, plant residues)
- Quaternary (alluvium, terraces)
Permo-Carboniferous
The oldest rocks in the area are Permo-Carboniferous limestones, phyllite-schist
facies. Limestones exhibit strong crystallization and local bedding which is gray, white and
rarely dark colored. Phyllite and clayey schist are seen as thin veinlets and intercalate with
limestones. Permo-Carboniferous facies show NE-SW oriented beddings and outcrop at
Kizildag at the north of the area.
Upper Cretaceous
It is composed of light colored limestones and ophiolitic type magmatics,
conglomerates, sandstones and clayey schists called Alacall Complex. It alternates with
limestones. The Upper Cretaceous units expose at the north and east of Ki§lak6y, at the
north and south of Elbistan (Kizildag) and ;ardao.
Eocene
Nummilitic limestones overlie the Permo-Carboniferous and Upper Cretaceous units
with discordance. The Eocene units start with base conglomerates trangressively and
discordances. Generally they dip towards north with 50 m thickness. The Eocene units
cover large areas at the Tekne Mountain where they are well bedded, light colored
limestones with 200 m thicknesses.
Neogene
Miocene
It forms from marine facies marl and sandstone which comes over Upper
Cretaceous limestones with discordance.

Plio-Pleistocene
The older units in the area are usually covered by young fresh water deposits and
fluviatal facies. The young fresh water deposits in the area starts with clay, limey clay,
gravelly clay and sandy clay and continues with a thick lignite bearing layer.

This lignite bearing layer has 30-70 m thickness according to lignite reserve drills and it is
Pliocene aged. The lignite level is overlain by Gidya level which is composed of various
colored and featured decomposed organisms, silty, sandy, plant residues and gastropode
fossils bearing deposits. The thickness of Gidya level changes between 15-80 m
according to reserve drills. In the region fresh water limestones are locally observed
above Gidya level indicating the last phase of young fresh water deposits. They usually
outcrop at the edge of basin with approximately 20 m thickness.
Quaternary
At the project area above the Gidya level Quaternary aged fluviatal facies deposits
of wet clay, gravel, clay and terraces are observed.
Terraces
The gravel series are seen as terraces at most parts the basin. The gravels are
mostly the gravels of the base rocks in the region and gravels of lacustrine limestones
seen at the edge of basin. The uppermost part of the terraces dips towards centre of basin
at which the oldest terraces are at the edge of basin. The size of the gravels decreases
towards centre of basin.
Alluvium
They are observed along the Hurman Creek and at extensive areas in the region
because of the accumulation characteristic of Hurman Creek. The Quaternary aged
deposits completely cover the Pliocene aged formations.
In the region there are no special geological and geomorphological features and
there is no negative effect of the activity on the geological point of view.
Tectonic
The area is in the east tourid belt belonging to the Anatolian tectonic units. As a
result, the area is subjected to highly fracturing, deformations and strong tectonic forces.
On the other hand, the project area is tectonically quiet at which the old and young
sedimentation in the region is usually horizontal. Most probably after the deposition of
lignite a rising of the edge of basin occurred. The highly fragmentation of schists makes
the possibility of region undergoing into Hersenien phase. Besides, it is proved the region
had undergone into Laramien orogeny between Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene.
Hydrogeology of the Project Area
The Elbistan and Goksun plains are water catchment areas at and around the
project area. The direction of groundwater flow in the project area is from northwest and
northeast to south towards Hurman Creek. The groundwater level is between 1-20 m
depth from the surface (Source: Mlrmirintepe Limestoen Site EIA Report). Groundwaters
are taken out by water pumps and used for irrigation purposes where locally artesian type
wells are also present.

The biggest river in the project area is Hurman Creek. The long term average
discharge of Hurman Creek is 8.207 m3/s. The creeks that join the Hurman Creek in the
plain are Ozdere, Karasu, Ber,enek, and Dagla creeks. The formations that bear
groundwater in the project area can be summarized as follows;
Basement Rocks and Formations
The Permo-Carbonifeorus aged limestones and Upper Cretaceous limestones,
Alacall Complex conglomerates and sandstone levels show aquifer properties. Especially
Permien and Upper Cretaceous aged limestones exhibit jointed, fractured and karstic
structures which are also good sources of water reservoir. It is possible to feed the upper
levels with groundwater along the faults at base and the waters are usually found along
faults, fractured zones, at the fractures of ophiolites and at the contacts of formations in
the area.
Besides, marl and clayey levels on top of aquiferous limestones acquires captive
layer (water capturing layer) properties to these levels. The Eocene aged limestones and
conglomerate levels outside the project area possibly carry some amount of groundwater.
The schist and quartzites in the metamorphic series are also good sources of drinking
water in the area.
Lignite Zone
According to the preliminary observation well measurements the lignite level in the
area has groundwater and the artesian characteristics of these wells indicate that the
lignite level has captive layer properties.
Gidya Level
According to preliminary observation well measurements Gidya level carries
groundwater. It is captive layer properties understood by the artesian behavior of the
wells. Gidya level includes groundwater but does not give out much water by pumping.
Cover Layers (Alluvium-Terraces)
This level comes over Gidya level which has aquifer and captive layer properties in
the project area.
Springs
Springs with very small discharges are seen at the basement formations of the area.
At the Ku9,ck 9ayir locality groundwater run out at depressions in the area as the level of
groundwater level is higher than topography and the outcoming waters flow into Hurman
Creek by channels due to inclination. Especially the fractures at ophiolites contain lots of
springs where sometimes they form small creeks when joined. These reservoir rocks are
not covered and exposes at spring locations.

3.2.3. Soil Characteristics and Its Usage (Soil Structure, land use capability
classification, pastures, meadows etc.)
Soil characteristics of the region have been determined by both field survey and
literature surveys. Soils of the region mainly composed of Alluvial, Colluvial, Brown and
Red Brown Soils. Most of the soils have heavy, neutral, less alkaline structure and very
rich in lime. Permeability of the soils is very good and these soils have no drainage
problem.

AEATPP is located on, alluvial, colluvial and forest soil group and the capability
class of the soil is Class 1. Erosion degree is "less erosion"
Alluvial Soils:
An azonal great soil group of soils, developed from transported and relatively
recently deposited material.
Colluvial Soil:
Materials that have moved downhill and have accumulated on lower slopes and/or at
the bottom of the hill; moved downhill by the force of gravity and to some extent by frost
action and local wash.
Brown Soils:
A great soil group of the temperate to cool arid regions composed of soils with a
Brown surface and a light-colored transitional subsurface horizon over calcium carbonate
accumulation.
The existing soil sample analysis and literature study shows that the soils of the
region and agricultural areas have alkaline character. Therefore, soils of the region show
the ability to neutralize SO2 deposition.

3.2.5. Hydrological Properties, and the Current and the Planned Usage of the
Surface Water Source (Physical, chemical, bacteriological and ecological properties of
the surface water sources such as rivers, lakes and other water sources and seasonal
changes to this extent)
The main water sources of Af,in District are Hurman stream, which is a branch of
Ceyhan River, G6ksun Stream and Magara G6zO Stream. There has been irrigated
agriculture in the plain side of the district. Hurman stream, passing through the Af,in Plain,
is the most important stream of Af,in District. Ceyhan River is sprung form the Plnarba§i
Locality, which is located in 3 km east of Elbistan.
The drinking water of Afsin District is supplied from Qobanpinarl Spring. This spring
is 5 km west of Af§in District and 22 km from AEATPP. Drinking water source of Elbistan
District is Ceyhan Spring that is southeast. The flow amount of the spring is 5-7 m3/s.
Based on information from Elbistan Municipality, existing water supply of the Municipality
is 0.35 m3/s and the future demand will be about 0.6 m3/s. The need of the AEATPP with
its FGD unit will be 1.5 m3/s. Therefore, water supply of the AEATPP will not have a
drawback. The drinking water demands of 9ogulhan and Alemdar Towns are supplied by
drinking network that uses groundwater sources.
The project site and its environment are not near a seaside. In this context, the water
resources of the region are made up of surface water and underground water.
Inland Surface Waters
The region is located in the Ceyhan River basin and has a large stream network.
There has been S6gutIu stream, which is found in the district Elbistan, Hurman, Nargile
and Nurhak stream in the region. Hurman stream also passes through Afsin plain and it is
the most important stream of Af,in District. There is no natural lake in the region other
than small crater lakes. However, there are a lot of dams in the region.
Being one of the most important streams, Ceyhan River is sprung from PInarba§l
locality, which is located 3 km east side of Elbistan district, and its length is approximately
220 km in the border of province of Kahramanmaras. Slope is more than 1% in the middle
and the upper parts of the river. In sequence, Ceyhan River is connected with S6gutitul,
Hurman and G6ksun streams and it flows in narrow and deep valleys in some places. The

CORPORATION INC.                       PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
flowrate of Ceyhan River is 301 m3/s as an average and this value is reduced to 56 m3/s in
dry  months    and   is increased   to   1.960  m3/s in    spring  months    (Kahramanmaras
Governorship, 1993). However, so-called surface water sources are located outside the
projects influence area.
Sources
As a consequence of the excessive karstic formations in the mountainous areas
which surround the region, rain and snow water is entering through the springs in the
hillsides. The most attractive springs are Pinarba,i located in Elbistan and springs located
in Tanlr. The water temperature in the so-called springs is below 10 IC and pH value is
neutral.
Drinking, Usage and Irrigation
There are many dam lakes in the region used for irrigation, drinking, energy
production or flood prevention. The dam lakes in the region are also suitable for
professional and amateur fishing activity. Also, there has been fresh water fish production
by the fishing cooperatives found in the region. The surroundings of the dam lakes are
very suitable for the recreational use because of the rich vegetative cover and the easy
transportation from the settlements.

Ecological Characteristics
The immediate project impact area does not constitute a special living and breeding
habitat for the aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna species. Planned project will be
realized in the existing power plant area using existing rights-of-way. Any impacts would
be minor and short-lived and is very unlikely to result in any habitat loss for any species
since this is an area that has been used for commercial/industrial activities for a long time.
By the rehabilitation of power plant and construction of FGD unit, the ambient air quality
will increase and that will have a positive impact on terrestrial fauna indirectly.
Fish species that live and possible to live in the surface waters in the impact area
are explained below. These species are not specific to the project area, these exist also in
0                 other regions in Turkey. There are no endemic fish species in the project impact area, and
no negative impact of the rehabilitation project and operation of the power plant on the
ecological characteristics is likely.
Salmo trutta macrostigma
Their bodies are grey black colored and black spotted, their tails are red spotted.
Black spots are on side line. They usually prefer oxygen rich, clear and cold mountain
rivers. The period for laying eggs is November-December and in this period, they lay their
eggs to gravel flor of shallow waters of high river basin. They feed on fishes and insects.
They are not "strictly protected" or "protected" species according to Bern Convention
Annex-2 and Annex-3.
Leuciscus cephalus
Their bodies are covered with big silver colored scales. They leave eggs between
April-June and stick their eggs on rocks and wood pieces. Eggs open after 6-8 days. They
become mature at 3-4 years. Females leave 50.000-200.000 eggs at time. They fed on
invertebrate and algae while young, and on big invertebrate and fishes. They are not
"strictly protected" or "protected" species according to Bern Convention Appendix-2 and
Annex-3.

3.2.6. Flora and Fauna (Species, Endemic Species, Wildlife Species, Species
Under Protection by National or International Legislation, Rare and Endangered Species
and Their Habitats, Protection Decisions for These Species, Protection Measures for the
Living Beings Impacted from Project Activities (during construction and operation phases),
Field Study for Flora should be Conducted during Vegetation Period, Determination of
This Period)
Flora and fauna studies of EIA Report of Rehabilitation of AEATPP and Construction
of FGD Plant Project were conducted by expert biologist Fatma Ding (M.Sc.) during
January, February, March and April, 2005.
Flora and fauna species that live in the project impact area are explained below. The
rehabilitation project is not likely to have any negative impact on the flora and fauna
species found in the impact area. The Project is a rehabilitation project and retrofit of FGD
in the second phase will extend efficiency and reliability and decrease the emissions
below the limits. Impacts on flora and fauna species are stated at Section IV.2.9.1.
It should be taken into account that only one vegetation period cannot reflect the
flora fauna of that region. Therefore, the species that is observed at previous EIA Studies
in this region are also considered in this study. Even if these species could not be
observed in the field studies conducted for this project, the EIA report includes these
species to the tables.
Flora
The project area is located in the B6 square of Gridding System. "Flora of Turkey
and East Aegean Islands" publication of Davis have been the main source for the
detection of the flora species. In addition, the field survey study has been supported by
the review of same publication. Flora inventory prepared by field and literature surveys is
given by Table 3.2.6.1. (Annex B.12). Table includes Latin names of all flora species, their
habitats, endemism, phytogeographical regions, IUCN Red Data Book categories and
relative abundance degrees.
. Vegetation
General vegetation of the region is composed of oak forests, forests of tree species,
low and high mountain steppes and aquatic vegetation. The natural vegetational cover of
the region is mainly distracted and andropogenic steppes are common. The surrounding
of the power plant is covered with agricultural lands.
The most common species in the streams around project area are: Juncus alpinus
subsp. alpinus, Juncus bufonius, Schoenoplectus supinus, Typha domingensis, Typha
latifolia, Sparganium  erectum  subsp. Microcarpum,  Sparganium  erectum  subsp.
Neglectum, Euphorbia altissima var. altissima, Euphorbia falcata subsp. falcata var.
falcata, Euphorbia falcata subsp. falcata var. galilaea, Euphorbia falcata subsp.
macrostegia ve su i,inde Lemna gibba, Potamogeton berchtoldii, Potamogeton nodosus,
Potamogeton panormitanus. Populus euphratica (poplar), Salix excelsa (willow) and
Elaeagnus angustifolia (oleaster) are very common.

In this region, forest upper level is about 1800-2000 meter. They are generally
Cedrus libani (cedar), sometimes Abies cilicica subsp. cilicica and Pinus nigra subsp.
pallasiana (blackpine). Cedar, fir and blackpine show poor growth. Oak species shows
more growth. Between Goksun and Af,in, specifically between Binboga and Berit
Mountains, Quercus cerris var. cerris is also observed. Ouercus cerris var. cerris,
Quercus petraea ssp. pinnatiloba groups are wide in west and south of the mountains
(such as Nurhak) surrounding the project area. Juniper species such as Juniperus excelsa
and Juniperus foetidissima are very common in the places where the forests are
destracted. Junipers and forests and oak places, Juniperus oxycedrus ssp. oxycedrus,
Crataegus monogyna ssp. monogyna, Rosa canina and Pyrus elaeagnifolia subsp.
elaeagnifolia bushes are very common. These bushes also characterize steppe transition
regions. Furhermore, the species of Mediterranean Region are also observed in the south
of Berit Mountains.
The andropogen steppes shown around the project location formed as a result of
distraction of forest and shrubs. Steppes are common in the slopes tha are not
appropriate for agriculture. In the elevations of 1700-1800 meters, Astragalus sp. and
Acantholimon sp. species are common. Astragalus gummifer, Astragalus amblolepis and
Astragalus macrocephalus subsp. finitimus are dominant species. Dominant species of
1800-2500 meters are Onobrychis cornuta, Astragalus lamarckii and Astragalus
tauricolus.
*                     . Habitat Characteristics
- Crop fields: The most widespread biotope in study area and its vicinity
- Steppe vegetation: This vegetation is seen in study area, apart from agricultural
lands.
- Brow with gravel: In these fields, substrate is so active and soil is too shallow.
- Rocky areas: These biotopes are almost made up limestone rocks.
- Road sides: Biotopes with sparse vegetation usually dry soils.
-  Wetlands: They are not widespread in study area, but observed in only in the sides
of creeks and brooks, and in the small lakes.
-  Brushwood: It is between Goksun and Af,in, out of study area.
-  Blackpine forests: It is between Goksun and Af,in, out of study area.
. Endemism
There are wide varieties of endemic plant species in Turkey due to the fact that
Turkey is international transition region. 30% of plant species determined in Turkey are
endemic. 1994 IUCN Red Data Book categories used in "Red Data Book of Turkey's
Plants" prepared by Ekim, T. and his friends (2000) are explained below.

country and local utilizations)
Af,in-Elbistan lignite reserve covers an area of almost 100 km2 in between Af,in and
Elbistan Districts, in the province of Kahramanmara,. Lignite reserves were discovered as
a result of the research conducted by Dr.ing Otto Gold firm, MTA and TKI during 1967-
1969 years. Approximately 850 drillings were conducted at this region during this period of
time and mine borders and characteristics have been determined. This region has proven
ore deposits of 3.4 billion tones. About 1.7 billion tons of this total reserve is usable
capacity. The reserve occurs mainly in three sectors, namely, Q,Cllolar, Ki§lak6y and Af,in
sectors. The coal has been using for the Af,in-Elbistan Power Plants.

3.2.9. Determination of Existing Pollution Load of the Region (air, water, soil
and noise)
Surveys to record existing baseline environmental conditions were undertaken for
Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant rehabilitation area and its close vicinity between
2nd of February and 5th of April 2005. These environmental surveys covered the noise
measurements, surface and groundwater sampling, air quality survey and soil pollution
sampling. Air quality survey was also conducted May-July periods.
The scope of the work conducted in this region is the determination of the existing
pollution level in the area. The air quality monitoring was conducted during two 60 day
periods for a total duration of approximately four months while the other sampling and
monitoring works were only conducted once. In addition to those studies there were no
other previous baseline studies conducted in the region. Therefore, there were no
previous data showing the environmental situation of the region before the power plant
was put into operation and hence it is not possible to compare the existing situation with
the previous one, so that the exact level of impact of the power plant on the environmental
conditions of the area could not be determined. The findings of the analysis could only be
compared and discussed with the regulations and with each other.
3.2.9.1. Baseline Noise Survey
Methodology
Noise survey was conducted on 4th - 13th of February 2005. Purpose of the survey
is to collect the baseline data regarding the background noise levels in the vicinity of the
Af§in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant. For this purpose 12 hours continuous noise
measurements were conducted at 7 points.
Topographical obstacles in this area are the main attenuation factor in the noise
transmission between the source and receptor. Wind, temperature and humidity are
important meteorological factors, which might influence the measurement device thus the
accuracy of the measurement results. In order to prevent such an influence, for example,
due to wind blowing across the microphone, a special wind-screen consisting of a ball of
porous polyurethane sponge was used over the microphone during measurements. In
addition to that to prevent the humidity effect on measurement, sound level meter was
located in a place protected from rain. Humidity levels up to 90% have no influence on the
instrument. During the survey period, such meteorological conditions did not occur.
Vegetative cover in the measurement area is another noise attenuation factor in
addition to the topographical and meteorological ones. For instance, it is known that noise
level decreases 3 dB while transmitting through a highly dense vegetative (i.e., forest)
cover with a width of 50 m.
Agricultural fields are main vegetative cover types around the power plant. There are
some vegetative obstacles such as trees between the power plant and the noise
measurement locations, but no significant effect of these obstacles are expected.

In establishing the noise measurement program, the following factors were taken
into consideration for the environmental assessment:
*   Significance of noise levels generated by the project activities,
*   Existing noise sources near the project location, and
*   Proximity of population centers sensitive to the project noise sources.
For this purposes seven noise measurement locations were selected in the vicinity
of Af,in Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant that are the main receptors. The name and
coordinates of locations are listed in Table 3.2.9.1.

Noise measurements were conducted by SVAN           943A   sound level meter with
measurement range between 26-133 dB. The equipment works in the principles according
to the TS 8535 EN 60651 standards.
Sound level meter was located at least 1 m away from the reflecting surfaces for the
measurement accuracy. Measurements were conducted for 12 hours continuously,
average data were taken each 15 minutes intervals.
Result of Background Noise Measurement
The results of the measurements are listed in the following tables. The Leq is the
equivalent SPL. The sound from noise sources often fluctuates widely during a given
period of time. Leq is the average of all SPL's measured during a period of time such as
one hour. The Leq value can be obtained directly with an integrating sound level meter.
Lmax indicates the highest SPL and Lmin indicate the lowest SPL measured
throughout the survey period at one location. The average noise level measurement
results measured at each measurement location is given in Table 3.2.9.2 indicating Leq,
Lmax and Lmin values.

Sampling procedures, sample preservation and storage techniques were carried out
in compliance with Regulation on Water Pollution Control Sampling and Analysis Methods
Guide prepared by Ministry of Environment and Forestry.
During groundwater sampling, if there is pump at wells, groundwater from wells fitted
with pumps was sampled directly from the tap closest to the well head. However, bailer
tubes were used for the sampling where there is no pump. Surface water sample was
taken at a depth of at least 15 cm in the thalweg (deepest mid-stream). For the surface
water sampling, bucket was dipped in to water wading to the upstream direction. During
sampling special attention was paid not to disturb sediments.
pH, DO, TDS, Salinity and Conductivity of the samples were measured on site with
the instrument Hach Sension 156. The equipment is the portable multi-parameter
instrument measuring the above stated parameters by electrochemical method.
Water samples were taken into clean plastic containers. Before use sample
containers were cleaned and kept away from contamination. Containers were rinsed with
distilled water before sampling. Before sampling, decontaminated sampling buckets were
flushed 2-3 times with sampled water at sampling point.
For ex-situ measurements samples were immediately capped and labelled before
shipment. Samples were kept in dark at 2-5 oC.

0                     Turkish Regulation related to water quality is the Regulation on Water Pollution
Control (RWPC) which is first published on 4th of September 1988 and republished on
31 st of December 2004.
Quality of the water resources is defined in the RWPC (Table 1, Continental Water
Resources Quality Class). This table states general four classes for water sources.
The classification and the usage areas for the surface waters are as follows:
Class 1 - Highest Quality Water:
a. Drinking water purposes after disinfection,
b. Recreational purposes, and
c. Animal and trout production.
Class 2 - Slightly Polluted Water:
a. Drinking water purposes after advanced treatment,
b. Recreational purposes,
c. Fish production except trout,
d. Purposes other than stated in class 1.
Class 3 -Polluted Water: Industrial purposes other than the food and textile industry
requiring higher quality water.
Class 4 -Highlv Polluted Water: Could only be used after proper treatment to
improve the quality.
The classification and the usage areas for the ground waters are as follows: First
three categories are taken into consideration for quality. Class 1 is used for drinking water
purposes after proper disinfection and also for food industry. Class 2 is used for drinking
purposes after treatment; this type of groundwater is used for irrigation and animal

3.2.9.3.   Baseline Soil Contamination Survey
Baseline soil contamination survey was conducted in February 2005. The focus of
this survey was the collection and subsequent analysis of the soil samples from the
thermal power plant and its surrounding to determine the baseline soil conditions. Totally
10 soil samples were taken for the soil efficiency analysis (texture, salinity, pH, lime,
phosphorus, potassium, organic matter), cation exchange capacity and chemical analysis
(TOO, Total Nitrogen). 2 of the soil samples were taken from the ash deposit area to be
analyzed according to the parameters stated at Regulation on Hazardous Waste Control
Annex 11 A. There is no statement related to the baseline quality of soil. The Regulation
on Soil Pollution Control dated 31st of May 2005, although there is no specific parameter
for classification of existing soil quality the 8th item of the regulation states that the change
in soil quality should have to be followed by documenting the baseline soil quality
parameters of the region. In this respect, the following analyses have been conducted to
document the existing soil quality of the region.

Methodology and Soil Sampling Locations
Soil samples were taken by a clean shovel. Totally 10 soil samples were taken from
the project area. 2 of the soil samples were taken from ash deposit areas. One of the
samples was taken into plastic container for soil efficiency analysis (texture, salinity, pH,
lime, phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter), cation exchange capacity and chemical
analysis (TOC, Total Nitrogen) and the other was taken into the glass jar for analysis to be
conducted according to the Regulation on Hazardous Waste Control. The soil sample
locations are listed in the Table 3.2.9.10.

Samples were taken from the soil surface, for this purpose 10-15 cm of soil was
stripped to separate the vegetative cover, the plant roots and stones were totally cleaned.
Then 5-6 kg soil sample was taken from each sampling point.
Results of the Soil Analysis
The result of soil efficiency analysis (texture, salinity, pH, lime, phosphorus,
potassium, and organic matter), cation exchange capacity and chemical analysis (TOC,
Total Nitrogen) which was conducted by Institute of Soil and Fertilizer Research is given in

The limit values stated at Table 3.2.9.12 are related to regular waste storage
facilities for hazardous wastes (Annex-1 1A of Regulation on Hazardous Waste Control).
Soil analyses results and the regulation values given by Table 3.2.9.12 and Table 3.2.9.13
show that existing facilities have no impact on the soils.
3.2.9.4. Baseline Air Quality Survey
Baseline air quality measurement was conducted for Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal
Power Plant rehabilitation area and its close vicinity between 2nd of February and 5th of
April 2005 to establish current levels of air quality and to calibrate air quality model that
would subsequently be used to estimate the change of air quality due to the activities for
the Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant Rehabilitation Project. Measurements were
conducted at 10 locations. 2 measurements were performed at the dominant wind
directions on the nearest sensitive receptors to the Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant
along the long term dominant wind directions, and remaining 8 measurements were
conducted at locations in project impact area as specified in Regulation on Air Quality
Protection item 40 a-1. According to the same Regulation item 40 g, if the passive
diffusion tube sampling method will be applied for monitoring of air quality, 8 sampling
points should be decided on the minimum 8 points selected on the main wind directions.
In compliance with the above stated item 10 sampling points was decided. During each
monitoring period, at each location, three samples were taken, each representing a twenty
dat average.
During activities of the project, there will be various air pollutants released into the
atmosphere in varying amounts. The magnitude of impacts of these air pollutants will
depend on factors such as pollutant emission rates, source characteristics, meteorology,
topography, and land use. After existing levels of air pollutants determined in order to
establish a baseline for these anticipated impacts, the operational phase air pollutions
would be determined.
The pollutants that were the focus of this air quality survey are PM10, HF, HCI, NOx
and SO2. Fractions of the suspended particulate matters with aerodynamic diameters less
than 10 micrometers (PM,o) are of main concern because of their strong correlation with
human health effects. In this survey, existing ambient PM10 levels were surveyed at ten
sampling points in the vicinity of the existing Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant.
NOx and SO2 are two of the primary air pollutants of combustion. Therefore at ten
sampling points in the vicinity of the existing Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant site
also were selected for NOx and SO2 analysis. The passive diffusion tubes were used for
these pollutants.
Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and Hydrogen Chloride (HCI) are air toxics. Exposure to
these compounds cause health problems including cancer. Ten sampling points in the

vicinity of the existing Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant site also were selected for HF
and HCI analysis. The passive diffusion tubes were used for these pollutants.
Measurement Locations
The air quality survey was conducted at ten sampling points in the vicinity of the
existing Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant. 2 measurements were performed at
nearest sensitive receptor to the Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant along the long
term dominant wind directions, and remaining 8 measurements were conducted at basic 8
directions. Name and locations of the air quality measurement locations are listed in the
following table. The determination of the air quality sampling points in compliance with the
item 40 of the Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control has been conducted by
determination of a circle having a radius of 50 times the stack height as the area of
impact. 8 points HK 1, HK 2, HK 3, HK 4, HK 5, HK 6, HK 7, and HK 8 has been selected
as the points that are close to the residential areas on 8 directions within the area of
impact. HK 9 and HK 10 are decided as the points close to the residential areas on the
main wind direction.

Regulations for Ambient Air Quality
Air quality standards and guidelines for ground level concentrations listed in the
Turkish Regulation, WHO Guidelines and USEPA Standards (Pollution Prevention and
Abatement Handbook World Bank Group Effective Since July 1998) are tabulated in Table
3.2.9.15.
The Regulation on Air Quality Protection article 6 provides the limit values for
various parameters. The regulation requires that the short term (ST) limit value should not
be exceeded by more than 95% of all the measurement results of the daily average
values. Since only twenty day averages were available with the diffusion tube
measurements, the ST or daily average values were estimated by air quality modeling.
The ISCST3 model developed by the USEPA and which has been adopted as the
international standard for multiple point sources modeling of air quality impacts from tall
stack emissions was used to estimate ST values of air quality parameters (dust, SO2, and
NOx). The definition of LT is stated in the regulation as the value that should not be
exceeded by the arithmetical average of all measurement results.

Particulate Matter Survey
Methodology
PM10 sampling was conducted at 10 sampling points for duration of 24 hours for 6
days at each location using portable low-volume sampler in compliance with TS 2361
standard.
The ambient PM10 levels were surveyed by means-of a filtration technique commonly
employed by many regulatory agencies worldwide. A low-volume sampler was used for
the current survey. The low-volume sampler pulls in air at a rate of 5 litres-per-minute
(Ipm) through an impactor designed to segregate SPMs larger than 10-pm in aerodynamic
diameter. SPM is smaller than 10-pm pass through the impactor unhindered,
consecutively to be retained on a 47-mm fibre-film filter.
At the beginning of the sampling, the sampler flow rate was calibrated using a
transfer orifice traceable to U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
The sampler works on the basis of pulling ambient air through a 47-mm filter. A particle
impactor with a cut-point diameter of 10 pm removes larger particles from the incoming air
stream before reaching the filter. Difference in filter weight divided by the volume of
collected air gives the ambient PM10 concentration. The filters shall be weighed using an
0                                                                  55

analytical balance with a sensitivity of 0.0001 grams or better. This method will yield PM10
concentrations with a sensitivity of 1 pg/M3.
PM10 Monitoring Methodology
PM10 sampling was conducted using Airmetric's Minivol portable low-volume
sampler. The sampler works on the basis of pulling ambient air through a 47-mm filter for
a period of 24 hours. A particle impactor with a cut-point diameter of 10 pm removes
larger particles from the incoming air stream before reaching the filter. Difference in filter
weight divided by the volume of collected air gives the ambient PM10 concentration. The
filters shall be weighed using an analytical balance with a sensitivity of 0.00001 grams or
better. This method yields PM10 concentrations with a sensitivity of 1 pg/M3. The sampling
wasl conducted respectively at every sampling point.
Sampling Duration
In general, the sampling duration is determined depending on the current air quality
of the region to be monitored.

The PM10 measurement period was 24 hours at one location. The measurements
were repeated for 6 periods at each location for this reason, the values stated at
Table 3.2.9.16 was compared with the short term limit values and the 6 period's average
value was compared with the long term average values.
The long term limits are the values which are the average of the whole measurement
results. For this reason, the averages of the on are calculated and compared with the long
term limits.
Short term limit values are the values that correspond to the 95% of the
measurement results when measurement results are sorted out. In this study the
measurement results were sorted in a descending order and the 95 percentile value was
compared with the short term limit value.

As it can be detected from the Table 3.2.9.16 the measured PM10 concentrations are
in compliance with the LT and ST limit values.
In addition to that the existence of particulate maiter problem around Af,in-Elbistan
A Thermal Power Plant is obvious with the field observations. The particulate matter is
classified as settleable (large particulates) and PM10. In this project usually settleable
large particulate problem is significant which is also supported by the field observations.
The public complaints about the particulate problem is also very much. The
measurements were based on the measurement of PM10 since it has a health hazard risk
but the other particulates are the main problem. The measured values for PM10 could be
accepted as inadequate when the total area is considered. But this measurement results
should be accepted as a reference for future and measurements should be conducted
regularly on the long term.

NOx, SO2, HF and HCI SURVEY
Methodology and Sampling Locations
Ambient concentrations of atmospheric pollutants (SO2, NOx, HF, HCI) was
surveyed using diffusion tube sampling methodology. These samplers consist of small
plastic tubes, approximately 7 cm long with about 1 cm internal diameter. The storage
time for the diffusion tubes is 12 weeks after preparation to analysis. At site and during
transport, the storage conditions shall be kept as cool as possible without refrigeration (i.e.
heat insulated boxes shall be used).
The same sampling points with PM10 equipped with passive diffusion tubes for total
of 60 days. Survey was continued during all the 20 days for each sampling points, and the
6 periods were completed in that way. Thus, the survey was completed in 120 days. The
laboratory analysis followed that period. All tubes sent to a laboratory in UK accredited
laboratory of GRADKO, and instrumental analysis for each tube was conducted.

NOx AND S02 MONITORING METHODOLOGY
0                     NOx and SO2 Diffusion Tube Samplers
Ambient concentrations of NOx and SO2 will be measured using diffusion tube
sampling methodology. These samplers consist of small plastic tubes, approximately 7 cm
long with about 1 cm internal diameter (see in Figure 3.2.9.2 and Figure 3.2.9.3).
During sampling, one end of the tubes will remain open to air and the other will be
closed. The NOx and SO2 tubes are differentiated by the color of their upper caps. The
closed ends contain an absorbent for the gaseous species to be monitored (in this case
NOx and SO2), and the samplers operate on the principle of molecular diffusion. The tubes
will be mounted on pylons or masts as shown in the figures below:

Triethanolamine (TEA) has been shown to be a suitable NOx absorber for use in the
diffusion tubes. Stainless steel mesh discs are coated with absorber by either dipping into
solution of TEA and acetone or pipeting a small quantity of the aqueous solution onto the
discs in the assembled tube. The impregnated mesh discs are held at the closed ends of
the tubes. The closed ends of the tubes are sealed and the tubes are stored prior to
exposure. The caps are removed immediately before exposure period and NOx is allowed
to diffuse through the tubes. After completion of exposure, the caps are placed again and
the tubes are sent to the laboratory for analysis.
The absorbent used for SO2 tubes is, potassium hydroxide in glycerol solution
placed on the closed end of the tubes. The other ends will be covered with another cap
containing a filter to prevent any kind of acidic particulate matter that can contaminate the
0                                                     58

samplers. The tubes will be then stored in plastic bottles. The tubes will be removed from
the plastic bottles immediately before exposure and left without removing the filter. After
exposure period (one month), the tubes will be placed into their plastic bottles and sent to
the laboratory for analysis.
The storage time for the NOx and SO2 tubes is 12 weeks after preparation to
analysis. At site and during transport, the storage conditions shall be kept as cool as
possible without refrigeration (i.e. heat insulated boxes shall be used).
Sampling Duration
In general, the sampling duration is determined depending on the current air quality
of the region to be monitored. If the region of concern is a rural area and a significant
pollution level is not expected, a sampling duration of 30 days is possible to be applied. If
the monitored area is around an industrial source(s) or it is expected that the monitoring
parameters of interest already exist in the ambient air, then, a sampling duration of
20 days was preferred.
Laboratory Analysis
After 20 days exposure period, the NOx tubes are sent to the laboratory with bottom
ends closed and in an airtight bag. NOx is extracted from the absorbent and the extract is
analyzed by U.V. Spectrophotometer to obtain the amount of nitrite (NOx-) in pg. The
concentration of NOx in the environment (in pg/M3) is be calculated accordingly using the
mass of nitrite determined in pg, exposure time and diffusion coefficient of the gas.
The SO2 tubes are brought to the analysis laboratory in their plastic bottles and
analyzed for sulfate (thus S in pg) by Ion Chromatography. The ambient concentration of
S02 is calculated accordingly using the amount of sulfate (SO4-2), exposure time and
diffusion coefficient of SO2.
NOx Survey
Nitrogen oxides, or NOx, are the generic term for a group of highly reactive gases,
all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Many of the nitrogen oxides
are colorless and odorless. However, one common pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) along
with particles in the air can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over many urban
areas.
Nitrogen oxides form when fuel is burned at high temperatures, as in a combustion
process. The primary manmade sources of NOx are motor vehicles, electric utilities, and
other industrial, commercial, and residential sources that burn fuels. NOx can also be
formed naturally.
NO and NO2 were sampled to determine the nitrogen oxides. Measured NOx
concentrations were listed in table below. Short term limit values are the maximum
average daily values. Tubes were exposed to ambient air for 20 days in each period.

The analysis results shown by the table are below the short term limits listed by
Table 3.2.9.15. At the HK1 sampling point, during the measurement period 24.02.2005-
16.03.2005 the measured 493.71 pg/M3 value is a very high value compared to the other
periods. The reason for this high concentration is possibly a huge instant NOx secondary
emission or a possible contamination during the transportation or analysis of the tubes in
GRADKO Laboratories. Still this measurement value is under the ST limit value of 600
pg/m3. During the same measurement period the NO concentrations at HK 3 and 6 show
similar increasing trends compared to the other periods. The locations of HK 1, 3 and 6
does not show a similarity when compared with each other to explain the similar
increasing trends. In this case this situation could be explained with the meteorological
parameters, such that by the effect of meteorology the concentrations might be carried up
to the mixing layer height during the other periods and they were carried to further points

Nitrogen oxide concentrations were in compliance with long term limit values. But
the concentration observed at HK 1 for NO is due to the measurement result explained at
the previous paragraphs. This high value affected the averages also.
SO2 Survey
Sulfur dioxide, or SO2, belongs to the family of sulfur oxide gases (SOx). These
gases dissolve easily in water. SOx gases are formed when fuel containing sulfur, such as
coal and oil, is burned, and when gasoline is extracted from oil, or metals are extracted
from ore. SO2 dissolves in water vapor to form acid, and interacts with other gases and
particles in the air to form sulfates and other products that can be harmful to people and
their environment.
Depending on the sulfur content of the coal burned in the project, the effects
mentioned above could be observed at the close vicinity (0-2 km) or a distant apart
(2-10 kin). Since the stack height is long it could be expected to have a longer range of
transport for the thermal power plants.
SO2 was first measured at 10 sampling points around Af§in-Elbistan A Thermal
Power Plant between 2nd of February and 5th of April 2005. The results of the
measurement are listed in the Table 3.2.9.20.

As seen in Table 3.2.9.21, slight decrease was observed in S02 concentrations
between 27th of June and 1 7th of July 2005. Af,in Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant was not
operated between 3rd and 1 3th of July 2005 according to the official capacity report of the
plant which may explain the difference.
For two phases of the measurements, there were 6 periods each was 20 days. The
dominant wind direction of the winter measurement is NNW, the second periods' is SSW,
and third period's is SSW. For the summer period, the dominant wind direction during the
first period is SW, for the second period is NNW and the third period's is NNW.
Around HK 1 station there is a long term S02 measurement station of EUA,S which
was established by TUBiTAK-MAM. This station has been conducting hourly SO2
measurements. The results of the available measurements conducted in EUA,5 station in

Slight increase was observed in summer time measurements. During the summer
time measurement power plant was operated at 1/4 of design load, like winter
measurement. Although during the winter time residential areas might cause an extra SO2
load, small increase in SO2 concentration was observed during the summer time
measurement.
As it is stated by TS EN 13528 Standard, wind has the effect on diffusion tubes.
During the winter time wind velocity is generally higher than the summer time. Due to the
high wind velocity, absorbation rate of passive diffusion tubes might be decreased during
winter, however, in the summer time wind speed will decrease causing increase in
absorbation rate of diffusion tubes. As stated in TS EN 13528 standard, wind effect is
approximately 10 % on the measured concentration of SO2.
Buoyancy force is the most important parameter affecting the plume rise. As seen
from the following formula buoyancy force decreases when atmospheric temperature
increases. Then high buoyancy force is expected during winter, pollutants rises at higher

During the winter time, temperature difference between stack and atmosphere is
higher than the summer time. Then emissions may rise to higher elevations in the
atmosphere in winter. Since the buoyancy force on pollutants is higher and stack height is
high, it might be transported above the mixing layer height and longer transport of
pollutants may occur. On the other hand, summer time temperature difference between
stack and atmosphere is smaller than winter time. Due to the buoyancy effect, pollutants

would not pass the mixing height or partly pass. In summer there is no SO2 effect from
residential areas. The values given in Table 3.2.9.21 are resulted from thermal power
plant.
Dominant wind direction varies during time of measurements conducted at different
phases. Similar values are observed for two phases as seen in Table 3.2.9.23 at different
locations. Therefore, the effect of dominant wind direction on transportation of pollutants
could not be observed clearly.
As a result of the analysis conducted, the results of the ambient S02
measurements indicate that the Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant as it currently
operates (at reduced capacity) and after it will be rehabilitated and operated at full
capacity are in compliance with the Turkish ST and LT air quality standards. First phase
air quality measurements conducted during the winter period (February, March and early
April), second phase air quality measurements conducted during spring-summer period
(May, June and July) and the results of continuous SO2 measurement station of EUA,
reflecting reduced capacity operation of the plant show that both the short term and long
term S02 concentrations are in compliance with the regulation.
HF and HCI SURVEY
Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and Hydrogen Chloride (HCI) are the air toxics. Exposure to
these compounds cause health problems including cancer. Ten sampling points in the
vicinity of the existing Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant site were selected for HF and
HCI analysis. The result of the measurement is listed in Table 3.2.9.25.

Previous Measurement Results
TEAS assigned TUBITAK-MAM Research Center, which is national official science
center of Turkey, for the S02 baseline measurements on the region in 2002. The study
was conducted during 01.11.2002 and 04.11.2003. The measurement was based on
Ultraviolet Fluoresans Principle and AF21 M instrument working according to EPA EQSA-
0292-084. The measurement results are given by Annex B8.
The results of the measurement were evaluated according to RAQP which was in
use in 2003. One year measurement results show that, SO2 concentration is in
compliance with the both LT and ST Turkish air quality standards, which are 150 pg/Nm3
and 400 pg/Nm3 respectively.

In this region, epidemiologic cancer survey has been conducted by Ministry of
Health Cancer Department. According to the results of the survey, cancer occurrences are
not observed in Af,in-Elbistan Region, they are observed in the people living in
Kahramanmara, City Center.
The report prepared by Ministry of Health states that there is no evidence that the
cancer occurrences are resulted from the power plant.
The result of the defining epidemiology survey shows that there have been 57
cancer occurrences in Elbistan during 4 years.

In conclusion, the cancer occurrences have not been well-recorded therefore the
number of the occurrences is below the estimation. Approximately 100 cancer
occurrences per year are observed at a place with 100.000 population. As it is seen by the
table, the records of the occurrences are below the ratio of 1/4. According to these
numerical distributions, rate of the cancer increase is not high in Elbistan.
The result of the defining epidemiology survey shows that there have been
34 cancer occurrences in Afsin during 5 years.

CHAPTER IV: IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT ON THE AREA
DESCRIBED BY CHAPTER III AND MITIGATION MEASURES
(In this chapter, impacts of the project on physical and biological environment, legal,
administrative and technical mitigation measures to prevent, mitigate and rehabilitate
these impacts are discussed in detail for both Section IV.1 & Section IV.2)
IV.1. Activities during Land preparation, Construction and installation, Impacts
on Physical and Biological Environment and Mitigation Measures
IV.1.1. Location and Amount of Excavation Works, Where Excavation Wastes
Such As Soil, Stone, Sand etc. Will Be Transported and for Which Purposes They
Will Be Used, Dust Emitting Mechanical Processes such as Crushing, Grinding,
Transportation and Storage, Mitigation Measures during Land Preparation and
Construction of FGD Unit
The rehabilitation project (first phase) will involve removal and/or replacement of
obsolete plant components. Land preparation and construction works will be involved for
the project for the foundation of FGD unit. Total amount of excavated material will be
about 100,000 m3 maximum. The material excavated during land preparation will be used
as filling material and the excess material will be conveyed to stripping area by the trucks.
The main sources of emissions to the atmosphere during construction will comprise
dust. Emissions during the construction of a building can be associated with land clearing,
drilling and blasting, ground excavation, cut and fill operations and construction of a
particular facility itself. Dust emissions often vary substantially from day to day, depending
on the level of activity, the specific operations, and the prevailing meteorological
conditions. A large portion of the emissions can also results from equipment traffic over
temporary roads at the construction site.
Dust emission produced during the land preparation and construction of FGD unit is
calculated below.
Activity area  : 26267 m2
Duration      : 156 days
Daily excavation: 168 m2/day
Emission Factor: 9 g/m2/day (Source: USEPA)
During construction, normal working hours will be 8 hours a day.
Dust emission: 9 g/m2/day x 168 m2 x (1day/8 hours)
: 189 g/h =0.189 kg/h

EPA, 1998)
= 2.819 x (5/12)08 x (30/3)° 5 / (20/0.2)0-4
= 0.701 kg/km
Emission (travel) = 0.701 kg/km x 0.2 km/travel x 1 travel/h
= 0.14 kg/h
E (return)     = 2.819 x (K/1 2)08 x (A/3)0°5 /(N/0.2)04
= 2.819 x (5/12)0°8 x (10/3)0 .5 /(20/0.2)0.4
= 0.405 kg/km
Emission (return) = 0.405 kg/km x 0.2 km/travel x 1 travel/h
= 0.081 kg/h
Total Emission: 0.189 + 0.14+0.081 = 0.41 kg/h
Article 40 of RIAPC states that emission limit value for the sources except for the
stacks are 1.5 kg/h. Regulation states that "If the calculated emission amount is above this
value, contribution to air quality should be calculated". Because the total dust emission is
below the 1.5 kg/h, there is no need to calculate contribution to air quality.
Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control (RIAPC) will be complied.
Potential impacts associated with dust emissions during the land preparation and the
construction phase will be minimized by the following methods;
. Stockpiles of material will be done in such a manner so as not expose them to
wind by covering them with suitable sheet material.
. The access road will be water sprinkled to prevent dust formation.
. Particular attention will be paid to dust suppression on the working width or at
construction sites when working within during dry weather conditions.
. Vehicles delivering dusty construction materials to the site or removing spoil will
be limited at speed and covered.
According to "Regulation on Excavation Soil, Construction and Ruins Control"
published by 18.03.2004 dated and 25406 numbered Official Gazette, following items of
will be complied during the excavation works carried out at site.
. People conducting the excavation works are responsible from the taking the
precautions reducing the noise and visual pollution and dust emissions and
covering of the surrounding of the activity area. Planning is to equalize the soil
amount from the excavation and the filling amount and the priority is given to reuse
of the excavation soil in the activity area.
. Natural drainage systems are protected during the excavation and precaution is
taken for the possible erosion. People/establishment conducting the excavation is
responsible from  the  protection  of the  buildings,  natural drainages,
energy/telecommunication facilities/systems, pavements and road coverages, and
the precautions for the losses and the erosions.

on the site.
IV.1.3. Water Supply System and Plan of the Project, Amount and
Characteristics of Water that Will Be Used, Where and How the Water Will be
Supplied, Amount and Characteristics of The Wastewater Resulting from These
Activities, How It Will Be Treated and Where It Will Be Discharged
Water Supply during the Construction Phase
During the construction works of the project, water will be consumed for domestic
use and watering for dust prevention. Water demand of the AEATPP is currently supplied
from Ceyhan River Spring at Pinarba§l Locality of Elbistan District. During the
rehabilitation of AEATPP and the construction of FGD unit, required water will continue to
be supplied from same source.
During the construction works of the power plant, approximately 300 people will be
employed. Assuming daily water consumption 1501/capita, daily water demand will be
about
300 capita x 150 I/day-capita = 45000 I/day= 45 m3/day.
Wastewater to be produced during Construction Phase
Assuming all of the consumed water will be discharged as wastewater, domestic
wastewater in amount of 45 m3/day will be produced during construction works of the
project. Wastewater to be produced at the work sites will be discharged to the present
sewer system. Pollution load of the general domestic wastewater is given by Table
IV. 1. 3. 1.

IV.1.5. Sources and Levels of Vibration and Noise Produced as a Result of
Activities Starting from the Land Preparation to Commissioning of the Units
During the construction works, potential for noise is expected from trucks, dozer,
mixer, excavator, compressor, and grader. These equipments are considered to produce
noise of similar type and level to noise sources often experienced in rural environments.
The potential for noise will be minimized by restricting construction works to those hours
permitted by the relevant working hours.
All equipment to be used on site shall be fitted with standard noise suppression and
will meet Regulation on Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise.
An assessment of noise levels likely to be experienced during the main phases of
works has been carried out for the soil excavation works, the foundation and ground
improvement works, construction of the buildings. Assessment has been made using the
following assumptions:
Conservative proportions of time that plant will be operating (i.e. all of the
equipments will not operate at the same time so noise levels will actually be lower than we
have calculated);
No mitigation measures to prevent transmission of noise included on site (this can
be arranged if required);
Machines and equipment working during land preparation and construction are
tabulated below:
Table IV.1.5.1. Noise Levels of the Machines Used for Construction
Machine                                       Noise Level (dBA)

Excavator                                          105
Compressor                                         115

Equivalent noise levels from working machines are calculated by the following
formula:
Leq = L- + 10 log (Q/4iTr2)
Leq = Sound pressure level, dBA
L, = sound power of the source, dBA
r = distance, m
Q = Coefficient depending on roughness of area
Average equivalent noise level at site decreases by the effect of the atmosphere
Decrease in sound by the effect of the atmosphere (Aatm) varies with the frequency of
source and distance from the source. Frequency range is accepted as 3500 Hertz.
Aatm = 7.4 * 10-8 (f2 x r /t)
Aatm = Decrease in sound by the effect of atmosphere, dBA
f   = Frequency of the source, Hertz
= Relative moisture, %
r   = distance, m

As it is seen on the table and graph above, noise level is below 70 dBA at 150 m
distance from the construction site. The noise level in ,Cogulhan that is 600 m far from the
AEATPP location is 45 dBA in the worst case; therefore noise level will not have big
impacts on dwellings.
The result is that our assessment is a conservative estimation of noise, and actual
noise should normally be much lower than calculated.
In order to protect workers from the noise, following issues will be considered.
During activity,
-to protect health of workers
-to keep continuation of activity, Regulation on Assessment and Management of
Environmental Noise will be complied.
Contractor will provide personnel protection equipment such as ear guards.
Limits from the Regulation on Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise
for noise levels to be achieved at receptors during construction are presented in the
following table. Limit value for the building constructions for daytime is 70 dBA.

Description of Existing Condition of AEATPP
AEATPP is a conventional thermal power plant utilizing low quality lignite from
Ki§lakoy Region. Lignite is sent to stock pile, which have capacity of 1 million, with bands.
The power plant consumes 3000-ton fuel per hour at full load with 4 units.
Lignite reserves of Af,in-Elbistan are the biggest reserves of Turkey. Total amount
of the reserve is 3.4 billion ton and 1.7 billion ton of the total amount is economical
reserve. As the reserves are concentrated in the region, it is possible to construct big
power plants, although its ash and moisture ratio is high and calorific value is low.
Steam temperature and pressure in the boiler superheater outlet are 535 °C and
197.5 kg/cm2 respectively and each boiler produces 1020 ton/h steam. Voltage is 21 kV at
the outlet of generator that is then amplified to 380 kV in order to connect energy to
interconnected system.
Process water of the plant is supplied from the Ceyhan River Spring. Water need of
the power plant is 5400 ton/h.
Ash going to the stack is kept by the electrostatic precipitators. Stacks are 145 meter
*                high.
There is a spare pond with 40.000 tons of water capacity if any failure occurs in the
cooling water system and there are two fuel tanks for the diesel and fuel oil used for
startup. Each tank has 10000-ton capacity.
The plant was designed to burn the low quality lignite with high moisture easily
without using supplementary fuel. The system developed for such lignite is indirect firing
system.
Coal is taken from bunker to mills and heated with the hot gas from the boiler outlet
in order to evaporate the moisture in it. This mixture of gas, steam and dust coal is passed
from the mechanical separator and some part is sent to the boiler, the other part is sent to
electrostatic precipitator (bruden filters). Electrostatic precipitator filters dry coal dust and
the vapor is discharged from the bruden stacks that are 120 meter in height. Dry coal dust
is given to the boiler as fuel that has high calorific value. This fuel is 1/3 of total amount
and it is enough to maintain combustion.

Process Description of AEATPP
This plant is fired with lignite. In the plant, the lignite is ground into fine particles and
injected with air through a number of burners into the lower part of a combustion chamber.
The lignite is coming from the great Elbistan open coal mine area. Before the lignite is
entering the boiler the lignite will be crushed by a coal crusher. After the coal crusher the
coal is transported to the mills. Each boiler has six mills. Full load can be achieved with 5
out of 6 mills in service.
Hot flue gas from the boiler is recirculated to the mills to dry the coal. From the mills
the coal is fed to the burners. Each boiler has 12 main and 12 bruden burners so that the
heat is equally spreaded across the boiler. The flue gas and vapor leaving the coal mills is
led to a vapor electrostatic precipitator (bruden filter) removing the coal particles and then
discharged to the atmosphere via three vapor (Bruden) stacks on top of the boiler. The
coal dust removed by the Bruden ESP is fed to the burners. After retrofit with an FGD the
vapor gas should be led to the FGD too. Bruden (vapor) filters are used to separate vapor
and coal dust. The moisture content in the coal is evaporated by flue gas heating process
in the mills.
In the boiler, feed water is passed through the tube bundles in the economizer,
evaporator and superheater sections of the boiler. As the feed water is passed through
the tubes, it absorbs the heat energy from the exhaust gases and is converted into steam.
The exhaust gases from the boiler are exhausted to the atmosphere via a stack after
passing through the main ESP. Each stack is 145 meters high.
At this moment the flue gases from the boilers are passing two main ESP's to
remove the fly ash. Afterwards the ESP's a part of the flue gases are recirculated back to
the coal mills to regulate the temperature in the coal mill. The gas and vapor from the coal
mills are passing through smaller ESP's (Bruden filters) where the coal should be
removed. The coal is sent back the boiler to be burned. After passing the Bruden filters
the gas is transported to the Bruden stacks (3 stacks per unit, 120 m high). The Bruden
ESP's are not working well so a lot of coal is emitted into the air (black colored vapor).

Maintenance, Modernization and Rehabilitations
The tube leaks were dense mainly in boiler hopper and the reheater 1. The
operation management stated that there have been tube leaks in the boiler hopper zone
due to erosion effect of ash and slag.
The slagging problems in the boiler of the power plant units still continue. Even the
blockage of gas duct and extreme fouling in the superheater 2 depending on the CaO
content were prevented with the modifications in the superheater 2 tubes, the fouling in
the superheater bundles still continue due to the very high temperatures at high loads.
Before eliminating the slagging problem, it is recommended that the boiler optimization
should be carried out. Mills, vapor filters and coal burner air adjustments should be done
and then investigation and rehabilitation which will solve the boiler slagging problem
should be done.
The water sootblowers making soot blowing up to 44 m of elevation in the boilers of
all units are not working. Making this equipment functional will help reducing the fouling on
the heating surfaces in the combustion chamber.
There are initial operation problems in all fuel-oil burners. This situation causes time
and fuel waste during start up.
It is necessary to perform rehabilitation on the pump and regulating valve system for
the overflow water at the burn out grate slag water tank.
The performances of the vapor electro-filters are low in all units. Therefore units
cause heavy dust pollution. Some precautions should be taken to reduce heavy pollution
to the minimum level. These precautions:
It is not possible to keep the vapor gas temperature between 105-120 °C with the
existing installation. This value is very important parameter affecting the electro-filter
temperature, affects the electro-filter performance in a negative way and coal dust and
ash stick to the bunkers and causes corrosion. To remove these negative effects and to
have a temporary improvement, spray water regulating valve and temperature control
system should immediately be supplied.
In addition, the performance of vapor electro-filters should be improved with
maintenance.
There is inconsistent coal flow due to the sealing problems on the coal dust
extractors at the exit of the coal bunkers of the vapor filters. This situation that causes
inconsistent and undesirable amount of coal flow to the boiler, increases furnace
temperature and shifts the flame ball to the exit of the combustion chamber. This leads to
the higher temperatures at the heating surfaces with convection and causes to slagging.

CORPORATION INC.               PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
To resolve the problem, the similar coal extractor used in Af,in Elbistan B Power
Plant can be supplied and tested in one unit, and if positive results are obtained, the
necessary modifications can be carried out in all units.
The extractor which mixes the water and the ash to be transferred from the ash
bunker to ash conveyor belts are failed very often and the proper moistening with ash
watering devices cannot be achieved. With improper moistening, there are problems in
ash transport. Rehabilitation is necessary.
It is a well known fact that the conveyor belts NU33 and NU 34, transport the ash
from the ash bunker to the ash conveyor belts at the Coal Operation Site, are 850 m in
elongation, but 750 m of them are underground and operate with very difficult and
negative conditions. The belts with steel cord are utilized utmost one year and renewing
the belts every six months is accepted as normal. Due to high CaO content in the ash and
inappropriate air-conditioning, the water vapor (humidity) and temperature inside the
gallery eliminate the operating and maintenance conditions and belt conveyor Works
without any control. These belts should be taken to the surface.
The ash is transported from the Power Plant to the Coal Mine with only one
conveyor belt line. For operation safety one spare should be built.
11. The Problems in the Turbine and Turbine Auxiliaries and the Necessary
Maintenance, Modernization and Rehabilitations
Two High Pressure (HP) Heaters of all the units are de-assembled condition. The
units are operating without HP feed water heaters. HP heaters that have been problematic
0               starting from the first construction, had been ordered to the firm named ALFA Machinery
after a domestic tendering in 1998. But, due to improper supply of the heaters by the firm,
the issue has been transferred to the legal platform. Because the heaters are not in
operation, it causes considerable economic losses (limits the load and drops the
efficiency). One HP heater for each unit should be ordered.
While ordering HP heaters, appropriateness to the original design, rehabilitation or
replacement of the automatic by-pass system heater and condensate drainage and
discharge systems (e.g., pump and control valve, etc.) should be considered.
Unit Master Control System has not been taken into operation, due to inappropriate
connections/interface between the boiler control system and the control system of this
turbine. Unit main control system should be taken into operation by providing interface
between the boiler and turbine control systems. This system should be modernized at
least at unit 4 and equipped for transfer of the data between the boiler and turbine (i.e.,
necessary also for participation to the frequency control).
The boiler-turbine control systems are Siemens Teleperm C in units 1, 2 and 3.
Siemens is not, any more, manufacturing their spares. The control system should be
switched to the digital system, in order to endanger units operation due to lack of the
spare and to get achieve better participation to the primary frequency control.

The filler materials, nozzles and atomizing materials in the cooling towers should be
renewed. The periodical cleaning and, if required, acid cleaning of the condenser pipes
should be carried out.
Especially, the problems that cause to condensate temperature to become high at
unit 4 should eliminated. The problem is arising from excessive loading of the condenser
due to discharge of the condensate of LP heaters to condenser instead of condensate line
used in normal operation mode and lack of HP heaters. All the heaters should be brought
back to their normal operation modes. Bad condensate vacuum causes to decrease in
efficiency.
The equipments used for on-line observation of the chemical parameters on the
water and steam cycle should be subjected to rehabilitation. Most of the equipments are
not functioning. For safe operation of the boiler and turbine these equipments should be
functional.
The condensate pumps of LP feed heaters have not been working properly since
commissioning. In order to prevent excessive loading of the condenser, the pumps and
related control system should be rehabilitated or renewed.
III. Other Installations
The device for automatic coal sampling has not been functional. The equipments
which are necessary for proper calorific value determination of fired and fed coals, should
be supplied. The online sampling device should be installed.
The damage in the neutralization pit in the water treatment plant should be
investigated and this pit should be taken outside the water treatment plant. The coatings
of the drainage channels inside the water treatment plant should be done urgently.
The invertors at units 1, 2 and 3 should be improved and renewed as done at
unit 4 and they should be taken into operation.
The excitation system at least one of the four units should be changed so that
redundancy should be provided to the other units. Due to different design turbo-generator
set, it would be suitable to change the excitation system at unit 4.
The mechanic circuit breakers of the units' 6 kV internal consumption system should
be changed with vacuum type circuit breakers.
The drier should be purchased for the compressors which supply air to the circuit
breakers of the switchyard. There is no drier for the outlet air of the existing compressors.
Because of the frozen moisture in the air during winter circuit breaker control might be
endangered. The issue is important and related with safety. Air drier should be installed
urgently.
As the unit and the transfer circuit breakers are air type, circuit breakers are affected
from low temperature of the medium in the winter and due to increase in contact
resistance they cause explosions. Therefore, the 380 kV circuit breakers (6 pieces) should
be replaced with gas type (SF6) circuit breakers.

The cathodic protection of the raw water line from Elbistan has been damaged. Due
to this pipe bursts are occurring frequently. For operation safety, cathodic protection of the
line should be improved.
The coal crusher near the stone belt is not working properly and big pieces of coal
are dumped to the outside, hence coal is transferred to the coal handling system again
with working machines and trucks. With a functional crusher to be installed near the stone
belt, the big pieces of the coal can be crushed and transferred to the conveyor belt
carrying coal to the boiler, hence additional expenditures can be prevented.
24 V and 220 V system rectifiers are damaged very often and constant voltage
cannot be obtained. This leads to overloading and fail in short time of DC System. The
24 V and 220 V system rectifiers of both units should be renewed.
There are problems in the turbine drainage valves of both units. Drainage valves
should be changed in accordance with their design.
The air conditioning system of control rooms and relay rooms should be subject to
rehabilitation.
FLUE GAS DESULFURIZATION SYSTEM INSTALLATION PHASE (SECOND
PHASE OF THE PROJECT)
In the second phase, Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) Unit will be established in
order to decrease flue gas SO2 concentration below the Industrial Air Pollution Control
Regulation that is 1000 mg/Nm3. FGD unit will provide 95% treatment and wet limestone
process technology will be preferred for FGD system. Although 83% treatment provides
enough efficiency for 1000 mg/Nm3 flue gas concentration of SO2, FGD system providing
95% treatment will be supplied to meet the further limit values in the future.
At present, wet lime/limestone process is applied at 86% of the large power plants
(>100 MW) in the world. In this system, limestone (CaCO3) slurry is used for the
absorption of SO2 in the flue gas in scrubber. Limestone slurry is pumped to the scrubber
from limestone solution preparation unit. In the scrubber, SO2 containing flue gas is
cleaned by spraying limestone solution at different levels to pollutant gas rising from
bottom to upwards. Gypsum solution formed by the binding of SO2 and this composition is
de-watered by hydrocyclones with a ratio of 50%. Gypsum will be disposed by mixing
with ash and then conveying to the ash deposit area. Detailed information on gypsum
disposal is given by the Section IV.2.6.
The location of the planned FGDs will probably be the empty place between cooling
tower and the stacks as shown in the Figure IV.2.1.3.
Besides water usage of about 1000 m3/h, there will also be an electric consumption
of about 40 MW and a limestone consumption of about 170 ton/h for all 4 FGD units in the
plant. The limestone used will be extracted from mines within the area of MIrmirin Hill.

Main Features of FGD System
Main features of the FGD system are,
FGD Process          Wet limestone
Features             Limestone slurry sprayed Wet Limestone in absorber tower.
Aeration and de-watering+ Flowpac
Reagent              Ca CO3
By-product           CaSO4 - 2 H20
One FGD unit will be constructed for each unit of AEATPP. Each FGD unit will
comprise the absorber tower with internals (spray levels, mist eliminator, oxidation air
pipers etc), the gypsum dewatering station with ash mixing devices, the oxidation air
compressor, the process water station. In total 2 emergency storage tanks will be
installed.
Liquid flow (recirculation) will be about 56000 t/h at maximum gas flow.
The limestone storage, ball mills and limestone slurry preparation will be same for 4
units. Three wet ball mills to grind the limestone will be installed, thereof one as spare.
Each ball mill is connected with an own limestone slurry tank and a circular pipeline. The
spare one can deliver limestone slurry to both tanks.
The limestone slurry will be pumped all the time in ring pipe to avoid settling of the
limestone and extensive use of water for flushing purpose.
To increase availability, the tanks are connected by pipes. Each tank is able to feed
the limestone slurry to each circular line.
To decrease the number of installed equipment, the unloading system is different to
the one used in AEBTPP. The trucks deliver the limestone from the quarry to unloading
hopper which feeds the limestone directly to a precrusher. The precrusher is designed for
a particle size suitable for the ball mills. The limestone is filled to silos with bucket
elevators.
Ash Handling System
The fly ash from the ESP will be transported pneumatically to the new ash silos, the
slag ash will be transported by the rehabilitated belt conveyors. The existing ash bunker
system will be modified for interim storage of slag ash. The ash silos to be installed will be
of a capacity of approximately 3 days full operation. The fly ash will be mixed with the
gypsum slurry and transported by conveyor belt to existing ash conveyor.
The existing conveyor belt has to be split up into two parts, the underground part
and the part above ground level.
Gypsum-Ash Mixing System
6 pug mills will be installed. 4 of them will be in operation and 2 of them will be
spare. Each pug mill has a designed capacity of 25%. Design capacity is 400 ton/h.

Process Water System
Total demand of process water is determined by the evaporation in the absorber
tower and the amount of water leaving the system via the gypsum-ash mixing system.
Total amount is determined as 600 t/h.
Two new process water pumps will be installed close to the storage pond with a
capacity of 800 tVh. The process water tank will have capacity of 1 day operation demand,
15000 m3.
Description of Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD)
In most developed countries, wet scrubber (flue-gas desulfurization; FGD)
technology is a well-established process for removing SO2. A simplified process flow
diagram of a conventional wet scrubber is shown in the figure below. In wet scrubbers, the
flue gas enters a large vessel (spray tower or absorber), where it is sprayed with water
slurry (approximately 10 percent lime or limestone). The calcium in the slurry reacts with
the SO2 to form calcium sulfite or calcium sulfate. A portion of the slurry from the reaction
tank is pumped into the thickener, where the solids settle before going to a filter for final
dewatering to about 50 percent solids. The calcium sulfite waste product is usually mixed
with fly ash (approximately 1:1) and fixative lime (approximately 5%) and disposed of in
landfills. Alternatively, gypsum can be produced from FGD waste, which is a useful by-
product.
"Mist eliminators" installed at the spray tower outlet or downstream ductwork collects
slurry droplets and removes moisture from the flue gas. In some installations, the flue gas
is reheated to avoid corrosion downstream in the power plant. Many scrubbers have gas-
bypassing capability, which can be used for gas reheating. Also, gas-to-gas reheating
may be used, which does not have a penalty on plant efficiency.
The figure shows conventional limestone/lime flue-gas desulfurization. After leaving
the particulate removal device- ESP or a fabric filter -the gas enters a spray tower or
absorber, where it is sprayed with calcium-based water slurry. The calcium in the slurry
and the SO2 in the flue gas form calcium sulfite or calcium sulfate, which are removed by
dewatering and settling into a thickener. The FGD wastes are usually mixed with the fly
ash collected in the fabric filter or ESP and lime in a pug mill, and they are disposed of in
landfills.

Figure IV.2.1.1. Conventional Limestone/Lime Flue-Gas Desulfurization
In the early years of introduction of FGD technology, a spare absorber was included
to allow full-load operation with one absorber out of service. Recent improvements in
reliability have contributed to the elimination of the spare module in most installations.
Presently, the largest capacity scrubber module can handle flue gas approximately
equivalent to that of a 1000 MW coal power plant.

Cooling Tower Discharge
Discharging cleaned flue gases into the atmosphere can be made by injecting the
gas into the natural draught cooling tower plume and to discharge it together with this
plume, i.e. to use the energy of the cooling tower plume to emit the clean gas. Discharging
cleaned flue gases via a cooling tower into the air was first put into practice at the
Volkingen prototype power station in 1980. The results obtained from measurements
confirmed the theoretical forecast and proved that the column shaped cooling tower plume
achieved significantly greater buoyancy than a corresponding flue gas plume due to the
high heat flow. It can also penetrate inversion layers. The dispersion of the pollutants
contained in the plume/flue gas mixture is therefore better and the resultant local
concentration on ground level is significant lower than that of a chimney of the same
height. This was the reason to install this process in AEBTPP. Therefore, implementation
of a FGD in plant AEATPP will be same with AEBTPP.

Process
The lignite coal taken from AEL Open Mining Area is stored in main coal bunkers
with the aid of two conveyors, each of which has a capacity of 4900 t/h. Coal coming to
the crushers via 4 vibrating extractor which is placed under the bunker, are broken into
pieces till they get sizes of 0-60 mm. Meanwhile, stone, wooden and such pieces found in
the coal are separated. The metallic particles which can be joined in the coal are
separated with the aid of magnetic separators. The operations done up to so far are done
in the crushing building. Also, there is a sampling system in the coal crushing building
which is used to detect the characteristics of the coal. Samples taken are analyzed in the
laboratories and the humidity, CaO, calorie and ash rates of the coal are detected.
Characteristics of the coal including humidity, CaO, calorific value and ash content are
given in the Section IV.2.5.
After processed in the coal crushing building, coal is sent to the bunkers of the units
via two conveyers, each of which has a capacity of 4000 tVh. Since there have been
4 units, there has been 6 bunkers in each unit, each of which has a capacity of 495 m3.
Coal is extracted with the aid of blendomats; these are below the bunker. Then coal is
transported via conveyors to the mills, which are used to grind the coal. Here, it is grinded
till it has sizes about 0-2 mm and at the same time; it is dried in order remove the humidity
inside the particles.

Raw water line currently feeding the AEATPP has a capacity of 7200 M3 /h and the
current maximum demand of AEATPP is 4300 tlh. Retrofitted FGD unit of the AEATPP
after the second phase of the project will require 1000 t/h water supply. Therefore, the
current source, namely Ceyhan Spring is enough for both the water demand of process
and FGD of AEATPP.
In the current situation, incoming water is demineralized before it is used in the
process. Same procedure will be applied after the FGD retrofitted. The demineralization
plant is shown by the picture below.

Article 26-f of Regulation on Water Pollution Control states that "If an industrial plant
comprises sectors more than one or subsectors of one sector, the discharge parameters
of the sector of which wastewater amount is higher are essential. However, if some of the
parameters for the wastewater with lower flow rate are available, these also taken in to
account." This issue will be taken into account in the power plant.

AIR QUALITY DISPERSION MODELLING STUDY
For dispersion of emissions from the power plant, air quality dispersion modelling
was applied both for the existing situation of the power plant and for 3 different scenarios.
First case designates the existing situation of the power plant; second case is formed for
no FGD situation where PM emission is limited to 100 mg/Nm3 by the use of ESPs (the
World Bank Project). Third case includes the use of FGD where PM concentration is again
limited to 100 mg/Nm3. Finally, fourth case is considered with FGD option where PM
concentration is limited to 50 mg/Nm3. For each case, the contribution of AEBTPP was
also taken into account.
These scenarios are explained in detail as follows.
1. Existing Situation of Afin-Elbistan Plant A
The units operated with a capacity less than 26% during the years 2002 and 2003.
However, emission measurements were conducted in the year 2000. The capacity factor
was 39.61% (3500 hours/year) for the year 2000.
Calculation of Emissions for the Existinq Situation
All assumptions given below is based on the measurement reports of TUBITAK-
Marmara Research Center. In addition to that Chubu and STEAG reports are used in the
calculation as a reference.
_  >  Main stack
0                    All amounts are based on an average of unit 1 and unit 3. The concentrations given
in the Chubu and STEAG reports are used in the calculations. Each unit has 1 main stack
and 3 Bruden stacks. All data is based on the measurements conducted in August 2000
by TUBITAK-Marmara Research Center.
The average real wet velocity of the flue gas is determined to be 22.75 m/s with 15%
H20. The average temperature is 210 IC and the cross-sectional area of the stack is
36.32 m2.
The emission flow rate at normal conditions (0 0C, 1 atm, dry gas, 6% 02) is:
Qw = (22.75 m/s)x 273) x (36.32m2 )= 467.0m3/s (onwetbasis)
Qd   (467.0 m3/s)x (I -0.15)= 397m3/s (on diybasis)
> Bruden stacks
The average real wet velocity is 28.33 m/s with 30% H20. The average temperature
is 105 IC. The cross-sectional area of the stack is 7.07 m2.
The emission flow rate at normal conditions (0 0C, 1 atm, dry gas, 6% 02) iS:

So2
The average sulphur content of the lignite is 0.8%. In 2000, the coal consumption
was 11,000,000 ton/year and the power plant was operating with a capacity factor of
39.61% (3500 hours/year). According to this, SO2 emission to be produced will be;

year )   100 ton coal )  32glmolS              year
Therefore, total S02 emission arising from the power plant is;
176,000 ton S02/year  50 ton S02 /h
3500k/year
and the amount of S02 emission for each unit is;

12.5 tons of SO2 per hour per each unit is distributed among the main stack and
burden stacks as;

NO,
The results of measurements indicated in the TUBITAK MAM's report comply with
each other. The total emission of unit 1 is determined as 1060 kg/h and for unit 3 as
896 kg/h. The approximate average of these data is found as 980 kg/h. The
measurements show that about 70% of the NOx emissions are due to the main stack and
10% of the emissions are due to each Bruden stack. According to this;
0.7 x 980 = 686 kg/h of NOx is emitted through main stack
0.1 x 980 = 98 kg/h of NOx is emitted through each Bruden stack

The results of measurements indicated in the TUBITAK MAM's report comply with
each other. The total emission of unit 1 is determined as 5436 kg/h and for unit-3 as
6663 kg/h. The average of these is 6050 kg/h, which is approximated as 6 tVh. It is
estimated from the Report that 50% of the PM emissions is due to the main stack and the
rest is due to Bruden stacks. According to this;
(6 ton/h) x 0.50 =3 tonPMlh is emitted through main stack and 1 ton/h is emitted
through each Bruden stack.

Therefore, the main input parameters for modeling of the existing situation are

-flue gas quantity (dry, 6% 02)  397  m3/s

-flue gas quantity (dry, 6% 02)  120  m3/s
-flue gas temperature           105  °C

- NO,                           98   kg/h
- PM10                         1000  kg/h
2. Base Scenario (PMjo emission is limited to 100 mg/m3 by ESP without FGD)
All units will be operating for 6,500 hours per year. There will not be an FGD but
there will be new ESPs for all stacks. Bruden stacks will continue to be used. The
total SO2 and NOx emissions will be 9.1 t/h while the emissions are distributed as 1/3 rd of
emissions will originate from the 3 Bruden stacks at each unit and the remaining will be
emitted from main stack. In this case the emissions will became, 6.1 t/h S02 from main
stack and 1 t/h SO2 from each Bruden stacks and 650 kg/h NOx from main stack and
110 kg/h NOx from each Bruden stacks. Calculation of SO2 emission is explained in
detailed below (calculation of emissions for base scenario). Although the annual coal
consumption is higher than the amount used in the existing situation scenario, S02
emission (as tons/h) is lower. The reason for that is the improved plant efficiency which
results in increase in capacity factor and thus operation hours (6500 h/yr). NOx emission
is assumed to remain the same after rehabilitation of the power plant. NOx emission is
assumed to remain the same after rehabilitation of the power plant.

CORPORATION INC.               PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
Calculation of Emissions for Base Scenario
The flue gas flow was indicated in the STEAG Report as 2,100,000 m3/h (at 0°C, 1
atm.) for the rehabilitation. This flow was based on the idea that all flue gas should flow
through the main stack. In the new base case 2/3 of the total emission flows through the
main stack = 1,400,000 m3/h and the remaining 700,000 m3/h flows through 3 Bruden
stacks (233,333 m3/h through each burden stack). These flows are based on the design
characteristics of the boiler.

None of the alternatives discussed above has impact on reduction of NOR-emissions.
Therefore, in all cases NO,-emissions will stay the same as it is for the existing situation.
After the rehabilitation, it is expected that the boiler will operate properly.
Modeling Approach
Dispersion calculations are carried out by use of the following elements:
*  emission data,
*  surface parameters,
*  meteorological data
*  and dispersion model.
Industrial Source Complex Short Term Version 3 (ISCST3) computer model, which
is developed by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is used to model the
dispersion of air pollutants in the study area. The basis of the model is the steady-state
Gaussian plume equation, which is used with some modifications to calculate the
dispersion of various air pollutants from several kinds of sources. Emission sources are
categorized into four basic types of sources, such as; point, volume, line and area sources
or a complex of 2 or more of these sources.
ISC model developed by the U.S. EPA is one of the most widely used model in the
world. It is accepted worldwide by the regulatory authorities, researchers and decision-
makers for estimating concentrations of non-reacting air pollutants up to 50 kilometers
*                away from the source.
Inputs of ISCST3 Model
There are three types of inputs that are needed to run the ISCST model. They are;
* Topographical input,
* The meteorological data and
*  Input run stream file.
The run stream setup file contains the selected modelling options (rural or urban, flat
or elevated terrain), as well as source location and parameter data like: pollutant emission
rate, stack height, gas temperature, gas exit velocity, internal diameter of stack, averaging
time, concentration and/or deposition estimates etc. Receptor data provides the location
where a predicted concentration is desired.
Topographical Map
Topographical map of the study area is given in Figure IV.2.5.1. Topographical input
data for each receptor is included in the modelling calculations and served for the
following purposes:
* Terrain data input to the ISCST3 model, and
*  Location of exact positions of point sources present in the study area.

Meteorological Data
The ISC Short Term model accepts hourly meteorological data records for wind
speed, wind direction, temperature, and stability class, urban and rural mixing layer
heights for modeling pollutants. Model uses these data to define the conditions for plume
rise, transport and diffusion. The model estimates the concentration value for each source
and receptor combination for each hour of input meteorological data.
An Overview of Meteorology of the Region
Meteorology is the basic factor governing the dispersion of air pollutants. Therefore,
for the Modelling studies due aftention is given for processing of the meteorological data.
The State Department of Meteorology (DM!) operates a measurement station in Af,sin,
where several meteorological parameters such as ambient temperature, atmospheric
pressure, wind speed, wind velocity, relative humidity etc. are recorded on hourly b-asis.
Last three year (2002, 2003 and 2004) meteorological data were obtained from the State

Department of Meteorology and is analyzed to understand the average meteorological
conditions in the region. Moreover, the meteorological data for the year 2004 was found to
represent the general characteristic meteorological conditions in the region. In addition,
the model run for 3 years, 2004 year run also applied for existing case and base case
situations.
The meteorological data was processed by PCRAMMET, which is suggested by
EPA to be used as a meteorological pre-processor with ISCST, was used for preparation
of the meteorological input data. PCRAMMET was used in order to identify hourly
atmospheric stability constants and the mixing layer heights to be used in ISCST3.
Receptors
The study area selected is shown in Figure IV.2.5.1 with the dimensions of 20 km x
20 km, in which AEATPP is located at the centre. The reason for selection is to cover the
closest residential areas that are in the scope of the project and to be able to observe the
ground level concentration distribution of pollutants at the selected area clearly.
The local terrain is simple along with a flat land of totally 1681 (41 x 41) receptor
points; each is 500 meters apart from each other.
Summary of Emission Concentrations for the Modelling
For the existing situation, the plant is not operating properly and the stack gas
emissions are high with respect to the measurement data. Based on the input data, the
stack gas concentrations for the existing situation, base scenario and the alternatives are
given in the Table IV.2.5.4. It can be seen from the table that both for the existing case
and the base case, SO2 emission concentration exceeds limit value given in Turkish
Regulation. In case of dust emission, the limit value is exceeded only at the base case. In
the baseline scenario, the dust emission will be reduced to the limit value. After installation
of FGD unit the emission concentration will be lower than the Turkish Regulation.

The contribution of the emissions to the local background concentration was
calculated. For all scenarios, the emissions of power plant B have been incorporated in
the calculations. For plant B the emissions per unit are:
SO2                            185 g/s
NO,                            121 g/s
Dust                            6.6 g/s
Operating time                 6500 h/yr
MODELLING RESULTS
After preparing the emission inventory, the dispersions of pollutants are studied by
using the USEPA's Industrial Source Complex Short Term Model Version 3 (ISCST3).
The following features of ISCST3 are used for air dispersion modeling purposes;
- Rural dispersion on an elevated terrain is considered,
- Effects of stack-tip downwash are considered,
- Buoyancy-induced dispersion is included,
- No dry/wet deposition or depletion (removal) of particulate or gaseous mass from
the plume is considered,
- Default wind profile exponents and default vertical potential temperature
gradients are used,
- No exponential decay of gaseous pollutants is considered.
Based on the results of modeling calculations, the ground level pollution
concentration distributions for SO2, NOx and PM are prepared and superimposed on the
map of the study area (given in Appendix B.13). This gives a clear picture of the ground
level concentrations of the pollutants concerned.
All sources from AEATPP and AEBTPP are included in dispersion modeling study.
The model is run considering two averaging periods. For the first case, the years between
2002 and 2004 are considered and the dispersion of pollutants within this time period is
examined for existing situation, base scenario, alternative 1 with FGD and alternative 2
with FGD.
As another case, the meteorological input data prepared for the year 2004 is used
and the dispersion of pollutants is obtained for the existing situation and base scenario.
The 24 hour average daily maximum concentrations for years 2002-2004 and % of
exceedances of the Turkish Regulation value of 400 pg/M3 is tabulated in Table IV.2.5.11.
Calculation of Exceedances of Short Term Turkish Air Quality Limit Values:
Number of Receptor Points: 41 x 41 = 1681
Numbers of Days, Daily Averages are calculated: 365 days for the year 2004
365 x 3 for three years run

For existing situation for the year 2002-2004 number of exceedances for daily average
limit value (400 pg/M3) are 27,377 out of 1,840,695 data points. The percentile of
exceedences in this case is:
((27,377)/(1,840,695)) x 100 = 1.49%

The annual average and highest 24 hours average ground level concentrations of
the above-mentioned pollutants due to all sources are modeled with ISCST3. The outputs
of the model and the results for dispersion modeling calculations are given in Annex B. 13.
Modeling results show that, for SO2, for all scenarios none exceed the Turkish short
term limit, which is defined in the Turkish Regulation that 95% of the all results should be
less than 400 pg/M3.
For NOx, none of annual average values exceed long term limit values stated in the
Turkish Regulation. For all cases, there is compliance with Turkish short term limit, which
is defined in the Turkish regulation that 95% of the all results should be less than 300
pg/M3.
For PM10, in all scenarios, there is compliance with Turkish short term limit, which is
defined in the Turkish regulation that 95% of the all results should be less than 300 pg/M3.

During the operation period of the project, ground level concentrations of the
emissions from the power plant will be in compliance with the short term and long term
limits of the Regulation on Air Quality Protection. The only exceedance is the annual
average SO2 ambient concentration at the point of the ground level maximum     (GLma;x).
However, this point is on a remote hillside area far removed from any population center or
area of ecological significance. At all sensitive receptors, and on an area -wide average
basis, there are no exceedences of Turkish long term and short term air quality standards
for SO2.
According to Article (j) of Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control, "if the limit
values of RAQP are exceeded in the region where the plant is located, the emergency
plan prepared by the Governorship will be complied".

The ashes of AEATPP was analyzed according to parameters of Regulation on
Hazardous Waste Control Annex 11-A and it is shown that the ashes are not hazardous
wastes.
The gypsum from FGD unit at the second phase of the project will be mixed with ash
and then the mixture will be conveyed for the disposal at mining area. Amount of gypsum,
0                  ash and slag produced will be about 5.750 millions ton per year. The water amount in the
gypsum will supply the moisture needs of the mixture to be conveyed. The disposal of the
mixture will be same as the method state above. Reuse of the gypsum is not possible in
this region. Ash and gypsum mixture will be disposed at mining area. To prevent
spreading, water will be applied on gypsum and ashes.
The ashes of AEATPP was analyzed according to parameters of Regulation on
Hazardous Waste Control Annex 11-A and the results are presented in the report of
Project of Middle East Technical University on Thermal Power Plants Ashes of TEA;
(Project Code No: 98.03.11.28) and Table IV.2.6.4. The results were compared with the
Regulation on Hazardous Waste Control Annex 11-A and all parameters between the limit
values and or in the defined range, therefore the ashes can be landfilled.

IV.2.8. Vibration and Noise Sources and Their Levels, Impacts and Proposed
Measures during Operation Period
Noise originates from workplace sites with high-powered equipment such as the
steam turbine, generator, and substations. The noise from these sources may exceed
85 decibel acoustic (dBA) in the production area. The personnel working these places
should use ear protection equipment. The impact of noise will be negligible beyond 500 m
from the generation site.
Under the normal operation conditions, the sound pressure level will not exceed
65 dBA in the border of the power plant. The daytime and the night time limit values for
industry noise levels stated by Regulation on Assessment and Management of
Environmental Noise that are 68 dBA and 58 dBA (industry and settlement are together,
dominant is industry) respectively will be complied.

IV.2.9. Possible Impacts on Terrestrial Flora/Fauna and Mitigation Measures
IV.2.9.1. Impacts on terrestrial flora
As a result of the rehabilitation project, the settleable dust emissions from the Af,in-
Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant (AEATPP) will decrease below the limit values of
Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control. This will have a positive impact on the
terrestrial flora of project impact area.
IV.2.9.2. Impacts on terrestrial fauna
The project impact area does not constitute a special living and breeding habitat for
the fauna species. Planned project will be realized in the existing power plant area;
therefore there will not be any habitat loss for the fauna species. By the rehabilitation of
power plant and construction of FGD unit, the ambient air quality will increase and that will
have a positive impact on terrestrial fauna indirectly.

The sensivity of the soils around the power plant have been                evaluated by the
qualitative approach developed by Holowaychuk and Fessenden (1987). pH, cation
exchange capacity, basic saturation percentage, CaCO3 percentage, and total changeable

General sensitivity classification and baseline soil survey show that soil samples of
the project area are not susceptible to soil acidity. Furthermore, sensivity to alkaline cation
loss, sensivity to Al dissolve and general sensivity is "L" Category (low sensivity).
In conclusion, project will not have a negative impact on regional soil quality.
IV.2.11. Impacts of the Project on Existing Agricultural Areas and Agricultural
Products
Impacts of the fly ash from the power plant on agricultural lands and agricultural
products are explained in the Chapter 3, Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4. Scientific researches
on this subject are also included in that section. In the scope of the rehabilitation project
for AEATPP, the electrofilters will be rehabilitated and dust discharge will be limited,
therefore the possible negative impacts of dust on the agricultural products of Afsin-
Elbistan Plain will decrease by the rehabilitation project.
IV.2.12. Impacts on Groundwater and Surface Water and Mitigation Measures
Both sewage and ash water treatment plant will be in use during the operation of the
AEATPP. Therefore there will not be any discharge from the plant to the receiving bodies
without treatment. Discharge limits of the current Water Pollution Control Regulation came
into force by 31.12.2004 dated and 25687 numbered Official Gazette will be complied.
Cooling water demand of the power plant currently supplied from the Plnarba,i Pond
of Ceyhan River Spring in Elbistan. However, Pinarba§i Pond, which has been an
excursion spot for the public, has been in time got excessive mossy. Excessive moss,
point out that there has been eutrophication problem in the pond.

CORPORATION INC.               PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
In order to cover the moss problem, a project has been established under the name
of "Detection of the moss problem in Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant Water Source
and the Solution Suggestions Project", which was prepared in 2000 by Chemical
Engineering Department of Faculty of Hacettepe University upon the request from TEAS
General Directorate Environmental Directorate. In this project, in order to detect the moss
problem, samples of water, moss and sediments are taken and analyzed in August and
September 2000. For the sake of the solution of excessive moss, advantage and
disadvantages of the biological, chemical and mechanical contention methods were
discussed in this report and mechanical contention method was suggested as the most
appropriate contention method.
In the mechanical contention method, the plants accumulated on the water level,
and the plants accumulated just beneath the water level should be gathered and
transported to the shore. Thus, without disturbing the vision at the bottom of the pond and
without causing a long term drought in the pond, the ugly image occurring on the water
surface, which preventing the surface flow of water, will be removed completely without
exterminating all the plants and living beings. Also, one of the advantages of this method
is that, since the amount of organic material and nutriment is reduced with removing such
plants, the speed of the eutrophication will be reduced.
In order to attain to this goal, a project has been prepared under the name "Cleaning
of the moss on the surface of the Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant Water" in 2002 by
Chemical Engineering department of Hacettepe University. In this project, in order to
realize the mechanical contention method, which was suggested in order to remove the
moss, a device called "Yuzer-Bi,er" (Floating-Cutter) was designed.

Floating-cutter boat was delivered to General Directorate of EUA, after the test work
done in 2002. After the usage, it was realized that "Floating-cutter" boat has satisfactorily
maintained the function for what it was designed, so that the desired goal have been
attained. The blanket type of moss, which was causing environmental and image pollution
and affecting the natural life in the pond in a negative manner by covering the surface of
the pond, was gathered satisfactorily from the surface of the pond. As a consequence of
regular usage of floating-cutter boat in a periodic manner, the problem corresponding to
the pond will be solved. The photographs taken during the operation of the "floating-
cutter" boat is shown above.

Impacts on Groundwater
At the second stage of the project, the gypsum produced at the FGD unit will be
transported by the closed conveyor and disposed by discharging into the mining area
where lignite is removed completely. Low solubility of ash and gypsum decreases
pollution risk. Dissolution and negative effect on groundwater is not expected. Since the
site has basic characteristics, leakage of heavy metals from ash is not expected.
Groundwater around the AEATPP will be monitored during the operation period of
the project.
IV.2.1 3.Traffic Load
During the construction period of the project, the construction vehicles and trucks will
have a contribution to baseline traffic flow.
Daily transportation of the both AEATPP and AEBTPP staff has been supplied by
the service buses. Transportation will continue to be same after rehabilitation of the plant.

CORPORATION INC.               PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
Transportation of the limestone from the quarry to the power plant will also have a
small traffic load to the existing traffic load of the region.
IV.2.14. Risky and Hazardous Activities of the Project during Operation Period
with respect to Human Health and Environment
The most important risk of the existing plant is existing air pollution resulting from the
failure of the ESPs of the power plant and excess S02. As it seen in the measurement
report, results of stack gas measurements conducted in 2000 show that dust and SO2
emissions exceeds the limits of Regulation on Air Quality Protection which was in use in
year 2000. Therefore EUAS has planned the rehabilitation of AEATPP and FGD retrofit.
By this project, risky and hazardous health impacts of existing plant will be minimized.
Emissions will be under the limits of the current Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution
Control currently in use.
Industrial accidents caused by the carelessness of the personnel may be other risk
that is normally seen at all industrial plants. Personnel will be trained on Occupational
Health and Safety rules in order to guarantee safety at plant. Traing issue is detailed in
the EMP presented by Annex Al.
A view from the existing signs from inside AEATPP is shown below.

CORPORATION INC.              PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
Waste management will properly be applied in the plant. All wastes will be collected
and disposed in accordance with Regulation on Water Pollution Control, Regulation on
Industrial Air Pollution Control, Regulation on Hazardous Wastes Control and Regulation
on Hazardous Chemicals. The requirements of these regulations are presented by
Environmental Management Plan stated by Annex Al.
The medical wastes from the medical center of the power plant will be disposed in
compliance with Regulation on Medical Wastes came into force by 20.05.1993 dated and
21586 numbered Official Gazette.
Fire fighting system will always be present, tested and in service in the plant.
IV.2.15. Impacts of the Project on Socio-Economic Environment and
Environmental Cost Benefit Analysis
Power plants produce electricity supplying the energy needs of the country. Therefore,
socio-economic effects of the power plants can be regarded as direct and indirect. Direct
impacts are the energy supply and the recruitment at the plant. The indirect impacts are the
general increase in the production where the energy is used. The whole usage areas from
personnel to the infrastructural services are affected from the electrical energy production.
These are the positive impacts of the project during the operation phase.
Local people are affected from the project during both construction and operation
phases. Temporary employment will be provided in the region during the construction
phase and if required, the additional personnel will be employed at AEATPP.
Environmental impacts of the project during construction are generally short term
which is described in the related sections. The most important impacts will occur during
the operation, which will give positive impacts on environment. A general environmental
cost/benefit analysis is given in Table IV.2.15.1.
As it is stated in the report, the failures caused the decrease in the production of
AEATPP. Its production is very low compared to its design capacity. The rehabilitation is
inevitable because AEATPP has very important role in the use of the lignite sources in
Af,in-Elbistan Region and this power plant is the first power plant of the region. It is
estimated that the rehabilitation will decrease the production cost from 1.499 cents/kWh
to 0.941 cents/kWh.
Environmental performance of the power plant has also been affected from the
failures in the plant. Environmental performance of the power plant decreased because of
the ESP failures. PM and S02 emissions of the power plant exceed the limit values of
Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control. By this project, ESPs will be rehabilitated
and the efficient dust removal will provide reduction of dust emissions below the limits of
regulation. The design efficiency of the electrostatic filters is 99% but the existing
efficiency is 96%. Increase in ESP efficiency and low PM emissions crucial part of the
rehabilitation.
Second phase of the project includes FGD unit retrofit that will decrease SO2
emissions in flue gases below the limits of Regulation on Industrial Air Pollution Control
that is 1000 mg/Nm3, and ground level SO2 concentrations will be below the limits of
132

Regulation on Air Quality Protection, that are 150 pg/Nm3 for long term           and 400 pg/Nm3
for short term. The short term limit values are the daily average values that should not be
exceeded at 95% of the measured or calculated values.
By this project, the efficiency of the power plant units will increase, amount of lignite
required for same amount of energy production (per kWh) will decrease. Therefore,
production cost for per kWh will decrease. Lower lignite consumption will provide lower
wastes from the power plant.
Local farmers state that there has been decrease and losses in agricultural products
because of the particulate matter emissions from the power plant. As the ground level PM
concentrations will be lowered by the project, agricultural efficiency will increase. This
increase will contribute to positive impacts of the project on the economy.
Electricity will be produced by the less cost by the project and impacts on
environment and human health will decrease.

*                     CHAPTER V: PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
(Summary of the main alternatives searched by the investor and site selection
criteria)
Location
Rehabilitation of the existing power plant (AEATPP) and retrofit of FGD project has
no location alternative. Location of the project is the existing plant. The most appropriate
areas will be preferred for the location of FGD unit and its buildings.
Technology Alternatives
In almost all FGD systems, SO2, which is acidic in nature, is removed from the flue
gas by reaction with a suitable alkaline substance to produce a solid sulfite or sulfate
product. FGD Technologies may be subdivided as wet, semi-dry and dry processes.
Further, they may be classified as once-through and regenerable processes. In wet FGD
processes, the alkali, usually as slurry, is contacted with the flue gas in a spray tower to
form a weak acid solution that reacts with and is neutralized by the dissolved alkali. The
sulfite and sulfate salts produced then precipitate out of solution and may be recovered as
a saleable product. In dry systems the alkali sorbent is either injected into the gas stream
or the gas stream is passed through a bed of the sorbent. S02 reacts directly with the
solid alkali to form the sulfite or sulfate product. This type of system relies on the sorbent
either being very porous and/or finely divided. Semi-dry systems are similar except that
water is added to the flue gas to form a liquid film on the sorbent particles in which the
SO2 dissolves, promoting the reaction with the solid. The solid product is collected in the
particulate control device .for possible sale/disposal. Once-through FGD processes are
those such as the wet limestone gypsum (LG) process where the alkali, in this case
limestone slurry, removes and neutralizes the SO2 to form a gypsum product. There is
therefore a need for a continuous new sorbent source to sustain the process.
Regenerable processes include the Wellman-Lord (WL) process where the reagent used
to remove the SO2 is regenerated in a second stage process and returned to the absorber
tower for re-use. There is a wide range of FGD processes commercially available. These
include:
 wet processes such as LG, WL, SWW and ammonia scrubbing
* semi-dry processes such as circulating fluidized bed (CFB), spray-dry and duct
spray-dry
 dry processes such as furnace sorbent injection and sodium bicarbonate injection.
Choice will depend on technical, economic and commercial considerations. LG
systems are well proven, achieve the required removal efficiency, are capable of being
retrofitted and competitive in terms of overall lifetime costs.
For the FGD, the planned system is wet-limestone process which is the most
preferred system.

Cooling Discharge Alternative
In conventional applications, the flue gas is discharged through stacks while in CTD
applications, flue gas is discharged through the cooling towers. The main purpose of CTD
technology is to provide a better dispersion than that of conventional stacks. It has been
proved by the researches and various practical applications that natural buoyancy of
cooling tower plume provides the CTD technology to maintain this purpose. Related
studies indicated that the environmental and economical benefits provided by the CTD
technology are;
. Provide a better dispersion of air pollutants
. Result in a reasonable decrease in the GLC of pollutants
. Minimize the building downwash problem.

First of all, I thank you for you because you are involved such a project. People here
inhale this polluted air and nobody made anything for this. I think that nobody will do for
that. 90 % of the people here is unemployed. If you can not solve air pollution problem
here, please solve recruitment problem and people can make their medical treatment
happen.
I again thank you for you such a project.
Yours sincerely.

I thank you for you on behalf of ,Cogulhan Public because you share this project and this
report with Cogulhan Public.
My age is about the same with the age of the Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant. But
nobody has shown interest or study for us until now. Even though you can not do anything
or they do not put new filters for power plant, your studies on this make us happy. We are
happy that there are some studies on this and there are people who consider us. We get
used to dust on the fruits and vegetables. But if we get together as ,Cogulhan people, we
could not express our problems as you did for us. We have many thanks for you our
thanks would not be enough because we can not make people informed on our problem
as you did.

b) Non-technical Summary of the Project
Main goals of the project are to improve reliability and efficiency of the AEATPP and
extend life of the plant and to decrease emissions of the plant below the limits of Industrial
Air Pollution Control Regulation. Therefore the project itself aims at decreasing the
negative impacts on the environment.
Environmental baseline studies have been conducting around the region of AEATPP
in order to determine environmental baseline of the project area. In the scope of these
studies air quality, groundwater and surface water quality, soil quality and noise level will
be determined and the results are included in EIA Report.
Emissions of AEATPP will be in compliance with the Regulation on Industrial Air
Pollution Control by the rehabilitation of the power plant and addition of the FGD Unit.
FGD unit that will be established as retrofit will be similar to FGD unit in the
AEBTPP, and based on wet limestone process.
The results of the modelling show that, in the existing situation, ground level
concentration of SO2 does not exceed the short term limits of Turkish Regulation. After the
FGD and the ESP installation, the scenarios show lower concentration values.
Rehabilitation of AEATPP and addition and operation of FGD unit will guarantee
reliability and efficiency of the plant, it will also extend the life of the plant and it will
increase environmental performance of the plant that is one of the most important power
plants of Turkey.

CHAPTER VIl: CONCLUSIONS
Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant Rehabilitation Project is rehabilitation of the
plant and in this scope renewal of the some part of the units and construction of FGD
plant will provide extension of life of the plant, increase in efficiency and decrease in
emissions from the plant.
Rehabilitation of Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant will include maintenance,
rehabilitation and modernization of the some parts of the units, mainly boiler, turbine and
electrostatic precipitators.
The EIA procedure yielded the following major conclusions:
*  The rehabilitation of the ESPs on the main stack and the Bruden stacks is essential to
address the dust and particulate emission problems.
* According to the air quality modeling studies, the AEAPP operating at full load after
rehabilitation/upgrade without an FGD unit will meet both the long-term and short-term
air quality standards for SO2.
* The AEAPP operating at full load will not meet Turkish S02 emission standards.
(However, in evaluating the EIA, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF) has
recognized that plant performance after rehabilitation does not affect compliance with
Turkish air quality standards for S02 in the plant vicinity and therefore, has confirmed
that it will provide a derogation period in which to install an FGD in accordance with an
Amendment to the "Regulation on Control of Air Pollution Caused by Industrial
Sources" (RCAP) to be issued shortly.
The rehabilitation of the plant will improve the plant's environmental compliance with
Turkish dust emission standards. Dust emission has been identified, during public
consultations as a major environmental issue among local groups.
Following measures will be taken during the construction works to minimize the
negative environmental impacts.
If any excavation is applied during the project, it will be stored in the project site and
then used for the filling and leveling works, remaining amount will be utilized for
landscape studies.
Technical and administrative units of the power plant will be utilized used for the
accommodation or any needs of the employees as far as possible. Wastewater from the
personnel will be given to the existing domestic wastewater treatment plant of the power
plant.
Domestic solid wastes and the construction wastes will be collected at closed
containers and taken by the private firm to discharge these waste.
In order to minimize dust formation during the construction period, measures will be
taken such as watering and filling and unloading without scattering, covering during the
transportation of the material and keeping the upper material with 10% moisture.

ELECTRICITY GENERATION             REHABILITATION OF AFSIN-ELBiSTAN A THERMAL POWER
CORPORATION INC.              PLANT AND CONSTRUCTION OF FGD UNIT PROJECT EIA REPORT
Regulation on Noise Control published in 11.12.1986 dated and 19308 numbered
Official Gazette will be complied. In addition, maintenance of the machines will be
provided regularly in order to keep the noise level low.
In order to decrease emissions from the vehicles used during operation period,
routine controls of the vehicles will be done regularly. The vehicles requiring the
maintenance will be maintained and the other vehicles will be used instead of that.
Air quality dispersion modelling has been applied for AEATPP. In the scope of the
modelling, following scenarios has been evaluated.
 Existing situation
.  Baseline scenario with the most likely to happen environmental control
options (e.g., ESP limiting particulates to 100 mg/Nm3 and no FGD)
*  ESP limiting particulates to 100 mg/Nm3 and FGD complying with Turkey's
environmental standards
* ESP limiting particulates to 50 mg/Nm3 with FGD
The results of the modelling show that, in the existing situation, concentration of SO2
does not exceed the short term air quality limits of Turkey. After the FGD and the ESP
retrofit, the scenarios show that concentrations are lower.
Domestic and industrial wastewater will be discharged in compliance with
"Regulation on Water Pollution Control".
Domestic solid wastes and solid wastes from the process will be disposed in
compliance with "Regulation on Solid Waste Control" and "Regulation on Hazardous
Waste Control".
Caps, earlaps, or earplugs will be given to workers in compliance with the Work Law
numbered 4857 if the recommended noise levels are exceeded or if the technical means
are insufficient to decrease noise and vibrations.
The project will decrease the emissions below the limits of "Regulation on Industrial
Air Pollution Control" and therefore negative impacts on environment will decrease.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
CHAPTER I- PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant (AEATPP), located between 9ogulhan and
Alemdar Towns of Af,in District of Kahramanmaras Province and established by TEK
during 1984-1987. AEATPP has already got 1355 MWe power due to its four units. It is
one of the most important thermal power plants in our country. There have been a
loss/decrease in capacity and reliability of the plant due to the fact wears and some great
failures have occurred. Average efficiency has decreased below the design efficiency.
Therefore, General Directorate of Electricity Generation Corporation (EUAg;) decided that
the rehabilitation and modernization of the plant is required for the prevention of the
generation losses.
Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant Rehabilitation Project includes rehabilitation of
the plant with electrostatic precipitators and construction of Flue Gas Desulphurization
(FGD) plant after that.
Rehabilitation of Af,in-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant will include maintenance,
rehabilitation and modernization of the some parts of the units, mainly boiler, turbine and
electrostatic precipitators.
FGD unit that will be established as retrofit will be similar to FGD unit in the
AEBTPP, and based on wet limestone process and the process will have an efficiency of
95%. For the planned project, flue gas discharge is planned from cooling tower after
treatment.
AEATPP is located within the Kahramanmara~ Province of Turkey. Location of
AEATPP is 14 km far from Af,in District and 30 km from Elbistan District. The nearest
settlement places to the AEATPP is ,ogulhan Town, 500 meter from the plant, and
Alemdar Town that is about 1 km far from the plant.
Environmental impact area of the project is taken as 20 kmx20 km area for which air
quality modelling has been applied in EIA.
Af§in District is located at a point where Mediterranean, Central Anatolia and
Eastern Anatolia intersect. Therefore characteristics of these three regions are observed
in Af,in. Continental climate dominates. Dry and arid weather dominates in the summer
while cold and snowy weather dominates in the winter. Most of the rains are formed
during spring and autumn. AEATPP is located on Af~in-Elbistan Plain and the average
elevation of the region is about 1100-1300 meter. The land is flat. AEATPP is located on,
alluvial, colluvial and forest soil group and the capability class of the soil is Class I.
Erosion degree is "less erosion" The soil of the region, where AEATPP is located, has
very high lime content and alkaline structure. Therefore the soils of the region have low
acidification sensitivity.
Air quality modelling study that made for emissions dispersion shows that maximum
ground level concentration of SO2 and PM exceed the short term limits of RAQP. The
concentrations of NOx do not exceed the limits.

Measures for the dust in Site Operations
a The materials will be enclosed and covered during stockpiling and transport.
* Water sprays will be applied periodically for dust control at site.
* The vehicles delivering materals will have a sped of maximum 30 km/h to prevent
dust formation on the roads.
According to "Regulation on Excavation Soil, Construction and Ruins Control"
published by 18.03.2004 dated, following item of will be complied.
"People conducting the excavation works are responsible from the taking the
precautions reducing the noise and visual pollution and dust emissions and covering
of the surrounding of the activity area. Planning is to equalize the soil amount from
the excavation and the filling amount and the priority is given to reuse of the
excavation soil in the activity area. "
Measures for the Avoidance of Nuisance from Exhaust Emissions
Engines will not be left running unnecessarily to reduce emissions from fuel from
engines.
Exhaust emissions of the vehicles will be measured in accordance with Notice on
Measurement and Inspection of the Vehicles published by Ministry of Environment on
08.07.2003 dated and 25162 numbered Official Gazette. Exhaust emission sticker and
exhaust emission license of the vehicles will be supplied.
All vehicles and equipment will be regularly maintained.

11.2.3. Controlling Noise
Construction working hours will be determined by EUA, prior to commencing work.
All equipments used will be adequately maintained to minimize noise emissions
All items of equipments operating on the site in intermittent use will be shut down in the
intervening periods between periods of use.
Any item of plant or equipment found to be emitting excessive noise levels due to a
faulty silencer, broken or other reason, will immediately be taken out of service and
be adequately serviced, repaired or replaced.
Site personnel will be trained for the proper use and maintenance of tools and
equipment, and the proper positioning of machinery on site.
11.2.4. Waste Minimization
The following measures will be taken to avoid waste generation and minimize both
quantities and hazards of waste generated.
All hazardous wastes, non-hazardous wastes and inert wastes including the
recyclable ones and non recyclable ones will be stored at site separately and the ones
that could be recyclable will be segregated and treated at site. The records of these
applications will also be kept.
.  Principally all the waste generated during construction works will be minimized by
the contractor and as much as possible, biologically degradable wastes would be
produced.
.  The staff and the workers are trained for generating less waste. Supervision will be
supplied to increase environmentally awareness of the workers.
.  Hazardous wastes will be stored separately so that there will be no contamination
to the non hazardous wastes.

11.3. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED MITIGATION MEASURES TO BE APPLIED
DURING OPERATION PHASE
11.3.1. Mitigation Measures for Controlling Emissions to Air
By AEATPP Rehabilitation Project, high PM and SO2 concentrations will be
decreased below the limits of RIAPC. Ground level concentrations of the emissions will be
below the long term and short term limits of the Article 6 of RAQP.
ESPs, FGD unit and its auxiliaries will be regularly maintained.
Discharge of stacks gases will be supplied by the discharge from the cooling tower
instead of using the stacks, which will provide more dilute dispersion of the emissions.
Ambient air quality of the region will be monitored by installing measurement station
at the point where the highest concentrations deposits.
Emission license will be taken for the power plant.
11.3.2. Mitigation Measures for Controlling Noise
   Noise protection equipment such as earmuffs will be provided for workers in high
noise level areas. Regulation on Work Health and Safety will be applied.
*   The workers will be periodically rotated in high noise impact areas to minimize the
impact.
*   All equipments will be adequately and periodically maintained to minimize noise
emissions

* waste avoidance,
* minimization of quantities and hazards of waste generated,
* reuse, recovery and recycling of waste,
* disposal of waste.
Regular waste disposal will be provided in the plant. The wastes will be collected
and stored according to their content. The following steps will be taken to avoid waste
generation and minimize both quantities and hazards of waste generated.
*  Principally all the waste generated by the contractor during operation phase will be
minimized and biodegradable.
 The staff and the workers are trained for generating less waste if there is any
possible substitution for the method to be applied. Environmentally soundness will
be mainstream of the works to be realized.
.  Hazardous wastes will be stored separately from non hazardous wastes so that
there will be no contamination to the non hazardous wastes.
.  Biologically degradable wastes are going to be collected at bins at the power plant.
* Storm waters will be collected by surface collectors.

aware of potential emergency situations and the emergency plans and capabilities of the
site personnel.
*                    The detailed Emergency Response Plans will be prepared during detailed Project
design to cover construction stage and will be updated during the construction phase to
address changing current site situations. The Emergency Response Plans will be
periodically evaluated and updated in response to new site information and conditions,
changes in operations and personnel and/or as follow-up to any specific emergencies that
may occur. Appropriate regularly record keeping will be maintained for all significant
environmental matters, (including injuries/accidents, spills, fires and other emergencies).
Copies of the Emergency Response Plans will be available at the site in locations
known to all workers. The following information will be posted in strategic locations at the
site:
General emergency implementations;
Emergency telephone numbers/communication phases;
Location of emergency showers, and/or eye washes;
Emergency escape routes, and
Route map to nearest medical facility.
The emergency implementation procedures outlined in the Emergency Response
Plans will be rehearsed regularly as part of the employee training program.

Responsibility
An Emergency Response Coordinator will be responsible for supervising and
coordinating all emergency responses. The Emergency Response Coordinator will also
be responsible for preparing/updating the Emergency Response Plans, and employee
training.
Emergencies
All emergencies will require immediate action, with priorities of:
Protecting human lives and preventing injury;
Protecting the environment and mitigating damage;
Protecting equipment in the power plant and
Minimizing disruption or interference to AEATPP' business activities.
The following section outlines the responsibilities and procedural sequences of the
events following the discovery of an emergency situation. An emergency situation may be
defined as an incident that may cause personnel injury, uncontrolled damage and/or
disruption of business. Examples of such cases would be a fire, a chemical spill and/or a
General Emergency Procedures
Any employee discovering a potential emergency situation shall notify their
immediate supervisor as soon as practicable after the discovery. The supervisor shall
immediately investigate the situation and obtain all of the relevant information, take initial
action to remedy or alleviate the situation and notify the Site Manager as soon as
practicable with all the pertinent information.
The Site Manager shall immediately notify the Emergency Response Coordinator
and the General Manager and inform them of the nature of the emergency and the actions
taken. The General Manager or his designated alternate will make the decision to declare
an EMERGENCY.
Once an EMERGENCY has been declared, all key response personnel will
congregate at the designated command center on site. The Site Manager shall contact
the appropriate authorities and provide the necessary information as approved by the
General Manager. The Emergency Response Coordinator shall coordinate corrective
actions with the appropriate agencies.
The emergency response will vary with the nature and circumstances of the
emergency. Some emergencies will require the services of a response team. When a
situation exists that may warrant the declaration of an emergency after day shift hours, the
on-site manager can be notified through the site communication system.  It is his
responsibility to notify those persons on the emergency response team. A list and
location of the team members will be known at all times and posted for easy access.
After the emergency has been successfully controlled, a final report and response
assessment will be prepared.

CHAPTER III-MONITORING PLAN
111.1. Description of Monitoring Programs and Parameters
This section outlines the specific monitoring parameters, and expected frequencies.
The scope of this monitoring program includes receiving watercourses, air emissions
noise and soils. This monitoring program is not designed to detect long-term changes in
ecosystems, but will serve as an early warning system whereby construction activities can
be modified where necessary to remain within project environmental standards.
Monitoring data will be used in the project quality assurance process and will be
compared to project environmental standards.
The goal in implementing an inspection and monitoring program is to ensure
complete compliance with the EIA with regard to mitigation measures and permit
conditions and requirements. The methods and procedures presented in this document
are intended to assure the completion of an effective monitoring program.
111.2. Elements of the Monitoring Program
It is neither necessary, nor practicable, to continuously monitor all potentially
affected environmental parameters. Ultimately a monitoring program is a compromise that
can effectively serve to characterize existing and future environmental conditions to detect
unacceptable changes.
The monitoring program, by systematic sampling, will assess the quantity and quality
of project discharges. In general, monitoring data derived for noise, solid waste and air will
be compared to project environmental standards.
The monitoring should be conducted at the points where baseline Environmental
Monitoring studies were carried out. In addition to that as the air quality modeling results
are obtained the maximum ground level concentration (GLC) point will be determined, this
point should be selected for further monitoring.
Monitoring during the construction will be conducted in monthly basis where the
monitoring of the operation will be conducted in seasonal basis. Regulation on Industrial
Air Pollution Control states that the sampling with the passive diffusion tubes should cover
at least two months period. In this scope, in two months, 3 samplings each is 20 day
period will be conducted and this study will be repeated 3 times a year.
Emissions from the plant will be monitored in compliance with Article 40-a of the
RIAPC.
The responsibility of these monitoring applications will be under the responsibility of
EUAt;.
111.3. Implementation of the Monitoring Program
Monitoring personnel will be provided trained in sample collection techniques,
maintenance of equipment, sample labeling and transport, record keeping, tracking waste
movements, and reporting procedures.
Appropriate equipment will be employed in the sampling program, including
sampling devices (such as containers, storage, instantaneous water quality, automatic air
and noise monitoring devices, weight/volume devices, data recorders).

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Where direct on-site measurement is required, staff will be trained in the use of
appropriate equipment and record data and undertake any interpretation that will be
necessary to facilitate rapid response.
A record keeping system for monitoring data will be developed. The database will be
available at the power plant management.

The training programs will ensure that all personnel involved will;
fully understand the pollution prevention and control requirements and
how they will be implemented,
be aware of the respective roles of contractor staff and the EOA;
representatives for pollution prevention and control.
This training program could be presented by the official training lectures, field
training or professional guidance.
Monitoring, Inspection and Auditing
EUAII will implement a program of inspection, audit and monitoring in line with the
requirements outlined in the EMP to ensure the existence and effectiveness of
environmental mitigations outlined in this plan. This will also enable environmental
problems to be identified and responded to at an early stage.

POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
FRAMEWORK



POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
Rehabilitation of AEATPP and Construction of FGD Unit Project will be designed,
built and operated in a manner intended to conform with a number of legislative and
regulatory requirements and other guidelines and policies, the main categories of which
are set below:
-National Legislation
-World Bank Policies;
-International Conventions in force in Turkey;
Project will be implemented in accordance with standards, practices and guidelines
requiring conduct that will, in many instances, exceed those legal requirements.
Environmental Assessment Policy of World Bank
In accordance with requirements of O.D. 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), this
project has been assigned an environmental category "A". EIA Studies have been
conducted to meet World Bank requirements. Mitigating measures for air, water and soil
pollution are designed to meet all Turkish (national and local) requirements and/or World
Bank environmental guidelines, whichever are stricter. In the absence of either,
international standards or codes of practice was be used.
Environmental Legislation in Turkey
The protection of environment and public health from pollution arising from energy
production and consumption activities is one of the principles of the Turkish national
energy policy. In conjunction with this policy, in 1983 "Environment Law" was promulgated
in which the general principles of the Turkish environment policies were established.
The Environment Law (coded 2872) which came into force in 1983 starts from the
principle of the "the polluter pays" and handles the environmental issue on a very broad
scope. The aim of the Law, which considers the environment as a whole is not only to
prevent and eliminate pollution, but also to allow for the management of the natural and
historical values and the land in such a way as to utilize and preserve such richness to
concern for the future generations as well. The measures to be taken and the
arrangements to be made should be compatible with the economic and development
targets. According to the basic principles that govern the application of the Environment
Law and as stated in constitution, citizens as well as the state bear responsibility for the
protection of the environment. The principle in economic activities for determining the
implementation of production methods to minimize and solve environmental problems is
one of the basic of the Environment Law.
Regulation on Environmental Impact Assessment first was put into force on 7th of
February,1993. The purpose of Turkish EIA Regulation is to regulate the administrative
and technical principles which will be obeyed during the process of environmental impact
assessment to be realized with a view to identify and to evaluate all possible impacts on
environment of investment decisions of all public or private organizations, institutions and
agencies whose proposed activities may cause environmental problems; to prevent or
mitigate the adverse impacts which may cause any harm to the environment and to asses
the alternatives of the activities. The regulation was amended two times and the latest
Regulation was put into force in 16.12. 2003.
A.2-1



Regulation on Air Quality Protection(RAQP) was formulated in line with the purpose
and principles envisaged in the Environment Law and it was issued in November 1986.
The Regulation Industrial Air Pollution Control was put into force in 2004.
The purpose of RAQP is to bring under control emissions in the form of soot, smoke,
dust, gases, steam and aerosols diffused into the atmosphere as a result of any activities;
to protect human beings and their environment from hazards arising from pollution of the
air as a receptor medium; to eliminate the adverse effects of air pollution which cause
seriously damage to the public and neighbourly relations and to ensure that such effects
are not created.
The other regulations complementary to the Environment Law and Public Health
Law related' to electrical energy sector are given as follows:
Water Pollution Control Regulation
Regulation set discharged limit values for different waste water streams of thermal
power plants
Noise Control Regulation
Regulation sets limits for noise in thermal power plants
Control of Harmful Chemical Substances and Products Regulation prohibits the use
of poly chlorinated biphenyls (PCB) which are currently being used in old
transformators in old thermal power plants from the beginning of 1995,
Hazardous Waste Control Regulation
Fly ash from thermal power plants and gypsum from FGD plants are considered in
the scope of the Regulation and they are required to be disposed in accordance with the
rules which will be set by the Ministry of Environment. In addition, some chemical wastes
and residual oils which may be disposed from the thermal power plants are required to be
used, handled and disposed in accordance with the rules of the Regulation
The evaluation takes into consideration the provisions of the following legal instruments:
Soil:
Turkish Regulation on the Control of Soil Pollution;
Solid Waste Control Regulation;
Hazardous Waste Control Regulation;
Law on Forestry (#6831);
Law on Mobilisation for the National Afforestation and Erosion Control (#4122).
Groundwater resources
Article 12 of the Regulation on Control of Water Pollution (RCWP) presents a
classification methodology for groundwater, as set out below:
* Groundwater Class l:
* Groundwater Class II:
* Groundwater Class IlIl
A.2-2



Ecology
Turkish Law:
* Environment Law No. 2872 (11 th August 1983)
* National Parks Law No. 2873 (11th August 1983)
* Hunting Law No. 3167 (5th May 1967)
* Law on Establishment and Duties of Ministry of Forestry No. 3800
Turkish Guidance:
* Risk categories devised by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in
1994
* Risk categories used by Demirsoy (1996), based on the IUCN Red Data Book
* Classification system for risk categories for birds devised by Kiziroglu (1993)
The first and second categories were used to assess all fauna except birds.
International Guidance:
* World Bank Group:
* Environmental Assessment Sourcebook: Update Number 20 (Chapter 2) - Biodiversity
and Environmental Assessment
* Environmental Assessment Sourcebook: Update Number 10 (Chapter 2) - International
Agreements on Environment and Natural Resources
* Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook 1998
* Operational Policy: OP 4.04, Natural Habitats
* Biodiversity and Environmental Assessment Toolkit
- OPIC Environmental Handbook;
- US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):
* Considering Ecological Processes in ElAs (Guidance in applying NEPA)
* Pollution Prevention - Environmental Impact Reduction Checklists for NEPA Reviewers
(General Checklist: Habitat Preservation and Protection; Siting; and Oil and Gas Projects)
Atmospheric emissions and air quality
Standards for the protection of air quality have been derived from various sources,
including the following:
* Turkish Regulation on Preservation of Air Quality
* EU standards
* World Bank standards
* World Health Organisation standards
Noise and vibration
Standards
Criteria against which predicted noise and vibration levels are assessed have been
derived using relevant, recognised national (ie the Turkish Noise Control Regulation) and
international guidance (eg World Bank and World Health Organisation).
A.2-3



Terrestrial surface water resources
The significance of any potential impact on surface water quality will depend on the
present (or designated) use of the resource (eg for drinking supply, fishing, bathing) or its
importance to ecology or amenity and the nature and magnitude of change caused by the
Project.
The Regulation on Control of Water Pollution (RCWP) assigns ambient water quality
criteria for receiving water bodies based on established water quality classifications. The
four water quality classifications for inland surface waters (ie rivers, lakes and reservoirs)
are as follows:
* Class I: High quality water;
* Class II: Slightly polluted water;
* Class Ill: Polluted water;
* Class IV: Extremely polluted water.
All regulations associated with the Turkish Environment Law will be complied.
Requirement for Preparation of an EIA Report
Article 10 of the Turkish Environment Law requires preparation of an EIA in order to
evaluate the potential impacts on the environment that may arise from a project. The EIA
has been prepared in accordance with the Turkish Environment Law after completion of a
scoping study and Baseline Study.
The EIA is a prerequisite for the implementation of the project and must be complete
before any other permits can be issued. Moreover, the EIA must comply with World Bank
Requirements.
