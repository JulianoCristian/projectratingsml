This environmental\n            assessment summary briefly identifies environmental risks\n            connected with the project and discusses measures to\n            mitigate them. Among the suggestions the following are\n            offered. Minimize dust emissions from land clearing,\n            drilling and blasting, ground excavation, cut and fill\n            operations, facility construction, and from equipment\n            traffic over temporary roads at the construction site by\n            using the following methods: Cover stockpiled material with\n            suitable sheet material; sprinkle water on access roads,\n            limit vehicle speed, cover vehicles, and maintain equipment\n            and machinery. Mix ash with gypsum and convey to mining\n            disposal area. Treat wastewater from workers before\n            discharge to river bodies, and monitor groundwater quality.\n            Solid waste from the personnel, medical wastes, and oily\n            wastes, hazardous wastes such as used batteries, bitumen,\n            cables, copper, fire-fighting foam, adhesives, general\n            chemicals, acids, oil rags and absorbents, solvents,\n            contaminated soils, insulation, paint sludge, used oil and\n            paint cans and drums etc. and package wastes will be\n            collected at black bags separated from medical, hazardous,\n            dangerous and package wastes. Separately collected domestic\n            wastes will be transported to temporary waste storage center\n            or container by special vehicles and stored separately.\n            Store recyclable wastes in different closed containers.\n            Segregate paper, cardboards, plastics and metal package\n            wastes according to their type and collected by blue bags.\n            Handle other, including hazardous and medical, waste\n            according to regulation. To control noise, restrict hours of\n            operation and ensure vehicle noise does not exceed stated\n            levels. To minimize industrial accidents, train personnel in\n            health and safety issues, have workers wear protective\n            equipment, set up health center on site, and use fire\n            prevention measures."}, "docdt": "2005-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
