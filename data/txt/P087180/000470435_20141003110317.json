"Ratings for the Higher Education Project\n            for Mauritania were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. The key lessons learned are as\n            follows:  Policy reform is a complex undertaking and this\n            awareness should be reflected in the project design. The\n            visibility of Bank support should not be underestimated as\n            it can act as an important catalyst in mobilizing resources\n            from both the Government as well as other development\n            partners. Bank teams should ensure the establishment of a\n            robust M&E system in order to properly document the\n            achievements and shortcomings of a Project. The Bank should\n            ensure that procurement processes applied during\n            implementation enable the Project to effectively evaluate\n            the quality and adequacy of proposals and their associated\n            bids. The cost of an intervention may not be directly\n            proportional to its impact."}, "docdt": "2014-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
