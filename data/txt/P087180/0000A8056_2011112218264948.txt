                         Since the previous mission, progress has been made in the following: (i) decrees enacting the Higher education Law have been approved to create a more favorable environment for
                         the development of the private sector, to set up the standards for academic programs at level of License and Master and to organize scientific research; (ii) through the twinning
                         arrangements, 51 academic programs have been renewed, surpassing the 17 academic programs targeted at the beginning of the project and their structure reorganized according
                         to LMD standards, with a first class of students having graduated in June 2011; and (iii) there are now 28 professional programs representing 14 Percent of total higher education
                         programs, exceeding the target set up for the project (i.e. 8 professional programs and 12% of overall university students). The technical specification for the University integrated

                         management information system for student records and services, personnel and financial management and for plant and equipment inventory has been prepared.
                         However, construction of the Central library, the Central Administrative building and the Distance Learning Centre is behind schedule because of the technical problems encountered
                         by the building company in charge of the site. The government and the construction company have been in intensive negotiations to ensure that the civil works program picks up
                         quickly and will be carried out according to the terms of the original contract and with the necessary precautions in place.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Progress has been made in: (i) decrees enacting the Higher education Law have been approved to create a more favorable environment for the development of the private sector, to
                         set up the standards for academic programs at level of License and Master and to organize scientific research; and (ii) renewing and professionalizing academic programs according
                         to LMD standards. However, the construction of the library, the administrative building and the distance learning center is behind schedule. The Government is in process of
                         requesting an extension of the closing date of the project to allow finalization of civil works, procurement of equipment and installation of the management system.
