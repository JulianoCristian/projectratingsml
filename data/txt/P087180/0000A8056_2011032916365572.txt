                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          The project is in line in meeting it development objectives. The main political and institutional changes have been made in the sector so the successful implementation of this project
                         now depends on the synergy that can be established between the private sector and the higher education institutions, in order for the sector to respond to improving economic
                         productivity through increased external efficiency. To enhance students' learning environment, the construction and equipment of a new central library, distance learning center and
                         administration building to serve as the focal points for Internet access and for university-wide distribution of information has been launched.
