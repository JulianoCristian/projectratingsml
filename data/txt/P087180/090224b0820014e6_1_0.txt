                         and diversification of its economy. The project aims at:(i)improving the quality of the learning environment and the relevance of courses to the labor market; and (ii)
                         establishing pedagogic, administrative, and financial management systems in the IHEs.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Mauritania Higher Education Project was approved on August 3, 2004 and became effective on January 12, 2005. The first restructuring in June 2010 extended the closing date
                         by 21 months to March 2012 in order to compensate for the Bank inactivity in Mauritania following a coup d’état in August 2008. The second restructuring in March 2012 extended
                         the closing date by 19-months to October 30, 2013 to: (i) allow for the completion of contracts already entered but which had not been completed; (ii) provide much needed higher
                         education reform, civil works, goods and equipment; and (iii) complete ongoing activities necessary to achieve the PDO. The last restructuring took place in May 2013 in order to
                         cancel the civil works activities under the project and to recommit these funds to the ongoing Mauritania Skills Development Project (118974, Credit 4921-MR). This is the last ISR as

                         As of September 15, 2013, more than one-quarter (27.3 percent) of the credit had been disbursed, amounting to SDR 2,789,403.54 (US$ 4,277, 242) of the original grant amount of
                         SDR 10.2 million (US$15 million equivalent); most of the non-disbursed funds were related to construction activities (civil works). Project disbursement rate following the cancellation

                         of funds in May 2013 stands at 86 percent. Many planned activities were implemented satisfactorily, including: improvements in the quality of the learning environment and the
                         relevance of academic courses to the needs of the labor market; the introduction of comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks for higher education; restructuring of academic
                         programs, by introducing a new system of Bachelors, Masters and Doctorate (Licence, Maîtrise, Doctorat -LMD) degrees; and in developing plans and coordinating efforts for setting
                         up higher education infrastructure. The process of developing LMD was also enabled by the training university teachers received in the context of the twinning arrangements on
                         specific issues related to curriculum, programs and pedagogy. Over 200 faculty members benefited from this training. This laid the groundwork for (i) greater autonomy for higher
                         education institutions; (ii) a more favorable environment for the development of private sector providers; (iii) setting up standards for academic programs; (iv) establishment of the
                         national commission for higher education; and (v) clarifying the status and career paths for all employees in the Higher Education sub sector (faculty, library staff, directors, etc.) that
                         is specific to higher education.

                         There have, however, been significant delays in the construction activities (e.g., University of Nouakchott Administrative Building, Central Library and Distance Learning Center)
                         which resulted in the Government’s request in October 2012 to the Bank to cancel the civil works aspect of the project (in the amount of SDR 5,766,103.4 (US$ 8,953,028.7
                         equivalence) and to recommit these funds to the ongoing Mauritania Skills Development Support Project as an Additional Financing. The Government has already started funding the
                         completion of those activities which were partially completed under the project and has confirmed that it has secured funding to cover these costs.

                         The Project is set to close smoothly. There is one outstanding contract for the purchase of equipment for the new University of Science and Technology of Nouakchott which is
                         expected to be completed prior to project closing. In the case that the equipment contract is not delivered in full, the Government has agreed to pay for this last contract (costing
                         approximately US$170,000) using its own funds. If this contract is delivered in full, and paid by Bank funding, the project funds will be entirely disbursed.
