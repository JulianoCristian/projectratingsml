                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project is designed to help the Government of Mauritania to implement its strategy of producing qualified graduates with the skills needed for increased productivity
                         and diversification of its economy. The project aims at:(i)improving the quality of the learning environment and the relevance of courses to the labor market; and (ii)
                         establishing pedagogic, administrative, and financial management systems in the IHEs.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress has been achieved in the introduction of a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for higher education and restructuring of academic programs through the
                         introduction of the Licence, Masters and Doctorate (LMD) systems. Now the higher education system is better aligned with that of neighboring countries in Africa and Europe.
                         Strengthening of pedagogical methods has led to a significant increase in the number of qualified teaching staff and successful twinning arrangements with foreign universities;
                         twinning contracts with Universities in Morocco, Canada and France are currently being implemented with the goal of training faculty to upgrade Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral
                         programs. Over 380 faculty members have been trained and 51 programs have been upgraded.

                         Little progress, however, has been achieved in the construction of university buildings (administration and libraries) and the purchase of information technology (IT) systems that will
                         support the full implementation of quality reforms. The Government has requested that the civil works activities be cancelled and the project is being restructured to address these
                         difficulties.
