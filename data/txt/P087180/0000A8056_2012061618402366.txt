                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There has been some progress in terms of sector reform including related to the implementation of the higher education reform program with the new Higher Education (HE) Law
                         approved, and to the strengthening of pedagogical methods with an impressive increase in the number of qualified teaching staff and successful twinning arrangements with foreign
                         universities. There has also been a strong move towards increasing the relevance of higher education with the introduction of License, Masters and Doctorate (LMD) programs.
                         However, little progress has been made in the construction of the university in support of the reform. The Bank is very concerned about civil works.

                         Quality and relevance of higher education: The project supported training/internships of university staff. To this end, 119 Senior Lecturers and 379 faculty member were trained in
                         three-month internships to meet or surpass minimum qualifications. This is an impressive result as it tripled the number of qualified Senior Lecturers and almost doubled the number
                         of qualified faculty members.
