*Rather than re-establishing the baseline values of the time of the restructurings in 2012 and 2013, the Project team
used the values from 2003/2004 as the baseline values. The team’s justification for doing this rested on the
assumption that the introduction of the indicators was meant to effectively document and analyze what the Project
had actually accomplishment since its inception.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.    Located in Western Africa, Mauritania is part of both the Sahel and Maghreb and has
four ecological zones (Saharan zone, Sahelian Zone, the Senegal River Valley and the Coastal
Zone). In 2004, at the time of project appraisal, the country had a population of just under
three million (40 percent of whom were living in urban areas) and the population growth rate
was approximately three percent. The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US$1,800
and the economic growth rate was 2.6 percent (2003-2004). The country was the second
largest exporter of iron ore in Africa and the mining sector was, as it continues to be, a
mainstay of economic growth. Mauritania’s other key exports included gold and copper while
the country was also a modest offshore oil producer. In addition, Mauritania produced a large
number of livestock with its waters having some of the most abundant fish stocks in the world.
Mauritania was also showing significant potential for irrigated agriculture along the Senegal
River under the regional Senegal River Basin Organization (Organisation pour la Mise en
Valeur du fleuve Senegal – OMVS).

2.    In 2004, at the time of appraisal of the Higher Education Project (P087180), the
country’s labor market was characterized by a low-skilled labor force and a mismatch between
the profiles and the skills of labor market entrants and those workers needed by a rapidly
diversifying economy. The capital city of Nouakchott dominated the labor market accounting
for 25 percent of all employment with the Government being the largest employer, especially
of university graduates. Though the Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) were producing
graduates, often jobs went unfilled as a result of the mismatch between skills obtained by the
graduates and those needed by employers. Furthermore, requirements of the labor market were
changing with office, clerical and accounting jobs requiring significant post-secondary
technical skills. At the time, the University of Nouakchott was the only university in the
country with approximately 10,000 students and 250 teachers.

3.     During project preparation and appraisal, Mauritania was characterized by political
stability and major shifts in the political landscape were not foreseen. There were, however,
over the course of the Project various periods of political instability beginning with the first
coup d’état under the Project in August 2005 which introduced major changes in the political
leadership and also, in turn, resulted in the merging of two of the ministries of education.
Three years later, in August 2008, another coup d’état resulted in further political shifts and
resulted in the Bank’s decision to disengage for a period of 15 months. 2 This had significant
implications for the Project, diverting needed attention away from ensuring its successful and
smooth implementation and the activities designed to strengthen the institutional and legal
frameworks which would introduce important reforms within the sub-sector.

4.   Sector context.    In 2001, a ten-year Education Sector Development Program
(Programme National de Développement du Secteur Educatif – PNDSE) was established with
the support of a number of development partners (DPs) active in the education sector.
However, there was no specific strategy in place for the sustainable development of higher
education. Two major challenges facing the sub-sector were identified in the project appraisal
document (PAD): (i) the poor quality and relevance of instruction; and (ii) a physical


2
 The coup d’état occurred in August 2008 and the Bank did not formally reengage in the country until November
2009.

                                                      1
environment which was not conducive to learning and research. These identified issues echoed
those challenges highlighted in the PNDSE.

5.    Poor quality and relevance of instruction were evidenced in: outdated syllabi that were
poorly aligned with international standards; a predominance of formal lecture-based teaching; a
lack of library facilities and pedagogical aids (e.g., computers, laboratories, reference materials,
journals); outdated laboratory equipment; limited pedagogical training of faculty; limited
opportunities for professional development among faculty; poor responsiveness of training to
labor market needs; limited dialogue between IHEs and productive sectors of the economy; and
high repetition rates. Other aspects of the system prevented greater participation in higher
education including: highly demanding admission criteria; a registration fee; and a lack of
dormitories (which limited enrollment primarily to those girls whose families were living in
Nouakchott). The physical environment was also challenging with facilities scattered
throughout Nouakchott. Moreover, many of them were in a state of severe disrepair. In fact,
only two of the facilities used for higher education (Ecole Normale Supérieure—ENS and the
Ecole National d’Administration—ENA) had been constructed for the purposes of higher
education. Overcrowding in IHEs was common and conditions were considered, in many
cases, unhealthy and unsafe.

6.    Project context. In order to address the challenges facing the higher education sub-
sector, the Government’s strategy was to: modernize the syllabi and align them with
international standards (in the context of the emerging Bologna Process 3) and standardize the
Bachelor’s, Master’s and Doctoral (Licence, Maitrise et Doctorat – LMD) degree; diversify
program content; increase enrollment in science and technology (S&T); develop short,
occupationally-oriented (professional) programs (filières professionalisantes) which were
aligned with labor market needs; and develop new regulatory and governance frameworks to
increase autonomy and accountability at the University. In addition, the Government aimed to
build a new campus for the University of Nouakchott in order to provide an improved learning
environment. Together, these interventions would strengthen the higher education system in
Mauritania by modernizing programs, upgrading skill set of faculty, and improving the
physical environment conducive to learning and research. 4

7.    The World Bank’s support to the country was founded on the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) which highlighted the importance of the development of human resources and
improvements in access to education and health to address poverty in Mauritania. The Higher
Education Project (P087180) development objectives (PDOs) and planned activities were well-
aligned with the approach and objectives of the Government and DPs as laid out in the PNDSE.
Indeed, the third pillar of the PRSP indicated that the Bank would assist the Government in


3
  The Bologna Process is named after the Bologna Declaration which was signed in Bologna on June 19, 1999 by
ministers in charge of higher education from 29 European countries. Today, the Process unites 47 countries - all
party to the European Cultural Convention and committed to the goals of the European Higher Education Area.
The overarching aim of the Bologna Process is to create a European Higher Education Area (EHEA) based on
international cooperation and academic exchange that is attractive to European students and staff as well as to
students and staff from other parts of the world.
4
  At the time of project appraisal, the IHEs were: the University of Nouakchott, the higher education teacher
training school (Ecole Normale Supérieure — ENS), the National Administration School (Ecole National
d’Administration — ENA), the Higher Technical Education Center (Institut Supérieur d’Enseignement Technique
— CSET), the Higher Institute for Islamic Studies and Research (Institut Supérieur d’Etudes et de Recherche
Islamique — ISERI), and the National Institute for Medical Studies (Institut National des Spécialités Médicales —
INSM). Only the University, ENS and CSET were under the Ministry of Education (MEN); the others were under
the authority of other ministries.

implementing the PNDSE which aimed to “improve the relevance and external efficiency of
the vocational technical and higher education levels.” It also reflected aims in the sector as
highlighted in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2003-2005. 5 At the time, the African
Development Bank (AfDB) and the International Development Association (IDA) were the
lead donors in the higher education sub-sector. 6

8.    The Higher Education Project was designed to complement the Mauritania Education
Sector Development Project (ESDP) (IDA Credit 3573-MAU). Initially, the Bank planned to
provide support to higher education through a separate component in the ESDP (US$49 million
IDA-funded project that closed in 2010). However, during preparation of the ESDP, the team
realized that support to higher education (which included construction activities) would require
a time-consuming and in-depth environmental assessment. It was, therefore, decided that the
Bank would provide its support through a stand-alone project (The Higher Education Project)
rather than a component so as not to delay the start-up and implementation of the ESDP/IDA’s
support to the PNDSE. The environmental assessment was completed in 2003 which cleared
the way for processing the Higher Education Project in the amount of SDR 10.2 million
(US$15 million equivalent). The Project was approved on August 3, 2004 by the Bank’s Board
of Executive Directors and became effective on January 12, 2005. The original closing date of
the Project was December 31, 2009.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
9.     According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the objectives of the Higher
Education Project were to “assist in the implementation of the higher education reform to
improve the quality and relevance of instruction; and institutional development of the
University and the IHEs, through the reinforcement of their pedagogical and financial
management.” In the PAD, the PDO was “[designed] to assist the Government of Mauritania to
implement its strategy of producing qualified graduates with the skills needed for increased
productivity and diversification of its economy.” In order to achieve this, the Project aimed at:
“(i) improving the quality of the learning environment and the relevance of courses to the labor
market; and (ii) establishing pedagogic, administrative, and financial management systems in
the IHEs.” As there are slight differences between the PDO as described in the DCA and the
PAD, this report will largely measure the project’s achievements using the PDO as written in
the DCA. 7

10. The PDO-level indicators (as stated in the main text of the PAD) included: (a) the
proportion of students in occupationally oriented (professional) programs increases from 7
percent in 2003/2004 to 12 percent in 2008/2009; and (b) pedagogic, administrative and
financial management systems are operational by 2008. The Results Framework and
Monitoring Annex in the PAD (Annex 3) states only one portion of the PDO “[to] improve
quality and relevance of higher education to the labor market” and includes only one PDO-
level indicator – “the proportion of students in occupationally oriented (professional) programs
increases from 7 percent in 2003/2004 to 12 percent in 2008/2009”. In addition, there are


5
  The CAS was extended to cover FY06.
6
  The AfDB was financing studies on the development of new legal and regulatory frameworks for the sub-sector
aimed at the promotion of private-sector participation and introduction of management and budgetary autonomy
for the Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs).
7
  As the DCA is the legally binding document, common practice in cases such as this is to place greater emphasis
on the PDO as written in the DCA. Although there are differences in wording, both the PAD and the DCA
highlight the Project’s objective of supporting the Government in its efforts to improve the quality and relevance
of higher education as well the overall management of the sub-sector.

                                                        3
seven intermediate results (with 19 associated indicators) presented in this Annex. In the DCA,
by contrast, there are 9 key performance indicators (KPIs) (with no distinction made between
those that are PDO- from those that are intermediate-level). The list of PDO- and intermediate-
level indicators as well as the KPIs listed in the DCA can be found in Annex 10 of this report.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
11. The PDO was not revised during the life of the Project. Indicators were, however, revised
under the second and third restructurings in 2012 and 2013, respectively. A complete list of
the original, revised, and dropped indicators can be found in Annex 10 and a description of
changes to the RF under each restructuring can be found in Annex 2 of this report.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
12. Though the main beneficiaries of the Project were not explicitly identified in the PAD,
the Project’s main beneficiaries included: (i) university/IHE students who would benefit from
better and more relevant courses and an improved learning environment; (ii) university
teachers and researchers who would benefit from training and improved research conditions;
and (ii) staff/administrators of the higher education system as a result of greater autonomy and
improved management conditions.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
13. The Project consisted of two components: (i) Quality and Relevance; and (ii) Institutional
Development. 8

14. Component 1: Quality and Relevance of Higher Education (At Appraisal: US$11.52,
Actual Expenditure: US$4.91 (42.6 percent of appraisal estimate). 9 10 This Component was
designed to support the Government’s strategy of modernizing university instruction by
making it more relevant to the needs of the economy. This Component aimed to facilitate a
shift in higher education towards: more occupationally-oriented courses; a greater focus on
science and technology (S&T) and demand-driven and modernized course offerings; and a
move from lecture-based instruction to one which placed greater emphasis on individual study
and research.

15. Component 1 comprised three Sub-Components: Sub-Component 1.1 – Program
renewal, faculty upgrading and accreditation; Sub-Component 1.2 – Modern Central Library
and Distance Learning Center; and Sub-Component 1.3 – Use of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) in teaching, learning and research. Sub-component 1.1
focused on supporting the development of professional links with key employers in several
economic sectors to identify priorities on course content and objectives as well as twinning
arrangements with overseas research universities designed to facilitate the transfer of skills and
programs and provide individual and institutional mentoring. Sub-Component 1.2 would
finance the construction and equipment of a new Central Library and Distance Learning Center,
including ICT training for key staff and training for all faculty and students in the use of library
and electronic resources. Under Sub-Component 1.3, financing would be used for the

  This corresponds to Part A (Quality and Relevance) in the DCA.
10
   In the main text of the PAD, the costs per Component include project management costs as well as physical and
price contingencies.

                                                       4
provision of equipment, software and systems upgrading for high-speed internet access and a
system-wide Intranet, thereby enabling access for faculty and students to the latest knowledge,
accredited course materials, and electronic periodicals. 11

16. Component 2: Institutional Development (At Appraisal: US$2.15 million; Actual
Expenditure: US$0.90 (41.8 percent of Appraisal estimate). 12 13 This Component aimed to
support reforms which would grant autonomy to the University of Nouakchott and other IHEs
in the areas of strategic goal setting, budgets, instructional programs, and personnel
management. These reforms would allow IHEs to manage performance contracts negotiated
with the Government, along with indicators which would provide the basis for continued
financing from the Government. Further, as a result of these reforms, the University and other
IHEs would also be able to generate revenue through training and consulting services and
prepare institutional development plans. These institutional development plans would then be
submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development (MAED) – and used in the
development of the MAED’s three-year sub-sector strategy.              Tuition fees for the
occupationally-oriented (professional) courses would also be introduced.

17. Component 2 comprised three sub-components 14 in support of these reforms: Sub-
Component 2.1 – Staff development (managerial and administrative); Sub-Component 2.2 –
Pedagogic, administrative and financial management systems; and Sub-Component 2.3 –
University Administrative Center. Under Sub-Component 2.1, support would be provided to
staff development for managerial and administrative staff in the areas of planning, student
services, financial and personnel management. Under Sub-Component 2.2, the establishment of,
and related training for, an integrated management information system (MIS) would be
financed. This system would include information on and tracking of admissions and
scholarships, student records, financial management (FM) and inventories for physical plants
and equipment. It would also include a quality assurance system covering pedagogic, financial
and administrative functions. Sub-Component 2.3 would finance the construction and
equipment of a new university administrative center that would have strong ICT capabilities
(e.g., video-conferencing, servers, data storage capacity, etc.) 15




11
   This corresponds to Schedule II, Part A (Quality and Relevance) of the DCA, points 1-3 in the DCA (as
follows) correspond to sub-components listed in the PAD: (i) Services for the modernization of programs, faculty
upgrading and the introduction of self-evaluation and accreditation procedures, with mechanisms for follow-up of
university graduates performance in the market place; (ii) Provision of a wide range of instructional services
through the construction and equipment of a modern central university library and a distance learning center, with
training for the library executives and technicians and for a faculty and students on the utilization of these
resources; and (iii) Enhancement of the instructional environment through equipment, training and operating costs
related to provision of internet access and the development of a system-wide intranet.
12
   This corresponds to Part B (Institutional Development) in the DCA.
13
   In the main text of the PAD, the costs per Component include project management costs as well as physical and
price contingencies.
14
   As described in the PAD.
15
   This corresponds to Schedule II, Part B (Institutional Development), points 1-3 in the DCA (as follows)
correspond to sub-components listed in the PAD: (i) Implementation of university reforms through the training of
leaders, managers and technical staff; (ii) Adaptation or development of an integrated management information
system for student services, student records, personnel and financial management and for plant and equipment
inventory, together with institutional development plans; and (iii) Construction and equipment of a new
administration building for the University and training of relevant staff.

1.6 Revised Components
18. The Project was restructured three times. The first restructuring was on November 19,
2009, the second on March 26, 2012 and the third on June 5, 2013 prior to the Project’s closure
on October 31, 2013. The first restructuring aimed to compensate for the Bank’s inactivity
(disengagement) in Mauritania which had occurred as a result of a coup d’état in 2008.
Specifically, this restructuring extended the Project’s closing date by 21 months from June 30,
2010 to March 31, 2012. As a result of the increased costs of building materials during the
period of the Bank’s disengagement, proceeds were reallocated and additional funding was
budgeted for equipment and operating costs while the unallocated category was reduced (see
Table 1). The PDO and project components remained unchanged.

19. The second restructuring in March 2012 extended the closing date by 19 months from
March 31, 2012 to October 31, 2013. This was to allow for the completion of civil works
activities and a number of ongoing activities (especially the twinning contracts) which were
deemed essential for fully achieving the PDO. Once again, the PDO and project components
remained unchanged though changes were made to project indicators and associated targets.
There was no reallocation of funding under the second restructuring.

20. In June 2013, the project was restructured for the third time following the findings of a
technical assessment that only about 40 percent of the civil works activities planned under the
Project had been completed. This restructuring canceled civil works activities (and other
related interventions) and the remaining unspent funds dedicated to these activities (SDR
5.76 16). Specifically, the activities (and indicators) dropped included: (i) the construction of the
Central Library, Distance Learning Center, and the University Administrative Center; (ii) the
development of distance learning modules in conjunction with the twinning programs; and (iii)
the establishment and approval of a functioning financial and accounting management
system. 17 Table 2 shows the revised disbursement schedule.

  Though this indicator was formally dropped, the Project was supporting the development of an integrated MIS
which planned to include FM and accounting systems. The indicator for the Integrated MIS remained part of the
Project’s RF.

21. As a result of the 2013 restructuring, the overall financial scale of the Project was
diminished by about 57 percent (from SDR 10.2 million to SDR 4.43 million). In large part,
the restructuring and cancellation was the result of significant and persistent delays in the
implementation of civil works activities. Moreover, the Government and Bank decided, on the
basis of a recently completed audit and a thorough review of possible options, that since
activities could not be completed by the Project closing date, the remaining funds would be
strategically reallocated to the ongoing Skills Development Support Project (P118974).
Further, the Government committed to supporting continuation of those activities initiated (but
not completed) under the Project with its own funding. The Mauritania Higher Education
project closed shortly thereafter on October 31, 2013.

1.7 Other significant changes
22.    There were no other significant changes.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
23. Project Preparation and Design. The Project benefitted from strong alignment with the
strategies supported by the Government and other DPs, including the Bank. The Project was
aligned with the Government strategy as embodied in the PNDSE which had been developed
collaboratively with various stakeholders. This secured a high-level of buy-in and coordination
among stakeholders and DPs active in Mauritania. Moreover, the strong policy focus of the
Higher Education Project had been articulated in the PNDSE with the Project’s components
and sub-components derived from this 10-year plan. The objectives of this Project also
reflected the institution’s broader development aims as outlined in the CAS (2003-2005) and
Pillar III of the PRSP – Development Human Resources and Ensuring Access to Basic Services
and Infrastructure.

24. The Project’s design reflected priorities of key actors in the sector 18 and was consistent
with contemporary thinking by focusing on the following: (i) supporting greater university
autonomy; (ii) ensuring closer linkages between course offerings and labor market needs; and
(iii) diversifying course offerings and providing, in particular, occupationally-oriented


18
  Although the PAD does not explicitly describe project preparation, it does refer to visits made by higher
education staff to foreign universities and university institutes of technology that led to the decision to integrate
occupationally-oriented courses (filières professionalissantes) into the existing university structures and to use the
University as an instrument for upgrading and retraining higher level technical personnel.

                                                          7
(professional) programs. In addition, the plan to construct one consolidated university campus
(University of Nouakchott) with important upgrades was necessary given the generally poor
teaching and learning environment. Furthermore, the construction of a new administrative
center within the University aimed to facilitate management across departments. By
supporting the modernization of the higher education system in Mauritania through the
introduction of major legislative reforms and important upgrades to the teaching and learning
environment, the Bank aimed to lay the foundation on which the entire sub-sector could
develop and grow. The Bank, as such, envisioned and aimed to promote the future engagement
of other DPs in this process.

25. The Project design also drew on available analytical work in the sector. 19 Moreover, a
number of lessons from other higher education projects in Africa and operations in Mauritania
were considered including, in particular, the benefit of strengthening linkages between higher
education curricula/courses and labor market demands and the important uses of ICT in both
teaching activities and in management/administration of the University and IHEs. One
important lesson was that the policy reform process in Mauritania was time-consuming and
could pose challenges to timely project implementation. While this lesson was considered in
the design, the implications of any delays in the reform process were not fully appreciated,
particularly as the achievement of the project objectives was contingent upon the timely
enactment of the legislative reforms. The sequencing of activities in the Project design was
paramount as the transfer of autonomy to universities relied on the successful enactment of this
legislation. Another lesson highlighted was the importance of having a sound M&E system to
ensure achievements under the Project are properly measured and assessed.

26. The decision to undertake a stand-alone project rather than providing support through a
separate component within the ESDP was sound since it allowed the Bank to have one
operation which focused exclusively on the higher education sub-sector. Indeed, there was
significant complementarity between the Higher Education Project and the ESDP which also
provided broad support to the PNDSE. A number of activities that were important in achieving
the goals of the Higher Education Project were financed by the ESDP, including: the
architectural studies for the new university campus; initial twinning arrangements;
enhancement of the job-related content of university short courses; study tours to France,
Canada and the U.S. focusing on public financing of higher education, the lessons of which
were incorporated into the 2010 law on university governance and contributed to the
introduction of the LMD programs; and a research fund. There was some discussion as to
whether the Bank’s support to the sub-sector should be included as supplemental financing or
as a separate component of the ESDP, but these options were rejected for a number of valid

  Annex 12 of the PAD (“Documents in the Project File”) identifies seven sector related studies; five of which are
dated between 1992 and 1995; two others are dated 1999. None of these studies are found in the operations portal
project file, where the oldest document dates from November 15, 2003 and are not otherwise available. The PAD
mentions a 1999 World Bank study which collected data on various aspects of the University through interviews
with faculty, students and the general public. Findings from this study pointed to the urgent need to modernize the
university system in Mauritania.

                                                        8
reasons 20 as were other proposed options. 21 Together, the ESDP and the Higher Education
Project constituted IDA’s support to the education sector.

27. Given the Project’s intention to support the introduction of major reforms in the sector
and to implement a series of activities which depended on these reforms, the design was highly
ambitious for a five-year operation. Though the risks identified at appraisal were generally
appropriate, they were insufficient. A few additional risks might have been considered and
factored more prominently in the development of the project concept: (i) the real possibility
that major political shifts and/or political instability would arise and persist; and (ii) the
challenges associated with the expedient implementation of activities given capacity
constraints, competing priorities, and shifting actors within the Government. It appears that the
difficulty and complexity of enacting legislation and carrying out institutional reforms was
underestimated in a context of political instability and shifts which occurred at various stages
of the Project. 22

28. Quality at Entry. The project design was well aligned with the Government’s strategic
objectives and priorities of the Bank and other DPs which ensured a high-level of coordination
and harmonization. The design was also consistent with approaches used at the time to
modernize the higher education sub-sector and also took into account lessons learned from
other relevant operations. Despite these positive features, the design: (i) was guided by an
overly optimistic assessment of the time needed to enact key reforms in the sector; (ii) did not
take into consideration the ramifications of such delays on the completion of key project
activities; and (iii) was characterized by a results framework (RF) which presupposed and
relied upon a functioning M&E system which did not exist at the time. Each of these
negatively impacted the Project’s Quality at Entry. Although the risk assessment highlighted
important issues and put forth appropriate mitigation measures, a few important risks were not
explicitly mentioned and/or identified. Key among these were: (a) the potentially negative
consequences of delays in the early stages of the Project (e.g., delays in architectural studies,
enactment of legislation, etc.) on the completion of project activities which were central to the
full achievement of the PDO; and (b) the potential negative impact of political shifts and
instability were they to occur (and re-occur, as they did) during the project life. Quality at
Entry is, therefore, rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

29. Revised design. The Project was restructured three times as described earlier in 2009,
2012 and in 2013. In light of political shifts and perennial delays in construction, the first two
restructurings were meant to provide additional time to complete activities which were
considered central to the achievement of the PDO. Under the first restructuring, no formal

20
   As the planned support to higher education required an environmental study, this would have delayed the start
up of the ESDP. Indeed, the ESDP became effective in 2002 and the required environmental study (related to the
Bank’s support of higher education) was only completed in 2003. The environmental assessment was entitled
“Evaluation environmental du future campus de Nouakchott”, Studi Internationale, 2003. In addition, the option
of supporting this operation as supplemental financing to the ESDP was rejected since the ESDP was in its early
stages of implementation (and level of disbursement still low) and the justification for additional resources for the
improvement of higher education quality in Mauritania did not fulfill any of the specific conditions in the
operational policies for supplemental financing.
21
   Consideration had also been given to creating a stand-alone short-course, occupationally-oriented structure
modeled on the French Institut Universitaire de Technologie (IUT). This was rejected for two reasons: (i)
offering occupationally-oriented courses through the university better reflected Government’s desire to change the
university’s culture to being more open to the world of work; and (ii) a stand-alone IUT would not be cost-
effective as compared with the optimized use of the planned university facilities (labs, libraries, networks) whose
utilization could be maximized by appropriate scheduling.
22
   In 2003 and 2004, there were reported attempts to overthrow the country’s leadership.

                                                         9
changes were introduced to the RF. Under the second and third restructurings, however, the RF
was modified. Under the second restructuring, a number of indicators were added to better
capture achievements under the Project while others were simplified and/or dropped as they
could no longer be achieved by project closing. Under the third restructuring, a few indicators
were dropped, primarily those related to civil works activities. The intent behind each of the
restructurings was consistent with the challenges faced at the time (e.g., rising costs of
construction, delays in construction, and delays in enactment of legislation) and the assumption
that with additional time, all project activities could be completed satisfactorily. However,
given the difficult political context, the slow pace of the reform process, and the weak technical
capacity of the firm hired to carry out civil works activities under the Project, project
extensions were insufficient in ensuring the timely completion of activities and full
achievement of the PDO. In the end, the decision to cancel funding for civil works under the
Project was strategic given both the Government’s willingness to complete these civil works
activities using their own resources and the Government’s desire to use Bank support to
finance activities in the TVET sector.

2.2 Implementation
30. The following section provides an overview of project implementation across three
phases of the Project. These phases are defined in relation to the three project restructurings.
These phases provide a useful framework for analysis and those factors which had an important
impact on project implementation.

Phase I: January 12, 2005 (effectiveness) – November 19, 2009
31. During the first phase of the Project (from project effectiveness on January 12, 2005 to
just prior to the first restructuring on November 19, 2009), progress was made in a number of
activities, including: the training of lecturers abroad; the establishment of a consortium of
universities; the set-up of LMD in various IHEs; capacity-building for university staff in
management and administration; signing of twinning contracts; completion of a major study on
the sub-sector; and program upgrading (renewal) at the IHEs. In addition, a university
president had been selected and TA for both capacity-building within the Ministry and for the
development of the M&E system was underway. While progress was made in terms of the
design of the university new campus, Central Library and Distance Learning Center, the
architectural studies (financed under the ESDP) were significantly delayed which stalled the
bidding process for construction under the Project. Other delays in activities supported under
the Project were observed. While executive orders for the Higher Education Law were issued
in 2006 laying the groundwork for reforming the sub-sector 23 and decrees were issued
regulating the organization and procedures of the University, their approval and actual
implementation was delayed as the law was only passed in July of 2010. While these were
significant steps in the reform process, their delay prevented the Project from making progress
in other key areas which were contingent on the full enactment of legislation. Key among
these activities was the transfer of autonomy related to strategic goal setting, budgets, and
personnel management within the University and other IHEs. Further, the disbursement rate
lagged behind schedule and stood at 9 percent in 2009. This was largely a result of the delays
in construction (accounting for a large portion of funding under the Project) and as a few



23
  The Higher Education Law (which was passed in full in 2010) laid the groundwork for greater autonomy for
IHEs, a more favorable environment for the development of the private sector, setting up standards for academic
programs, establishing a management body of public IHEs and clarifying the status and career paths for
employees in the Higher Education sub-sector.

                                                      10
activities during this phase (e.g., studies related to civil works including the university master
plan and architectural studies) had been financed under the EDSP and, therefore, did not utilize
funding from this Project.

32. Delays in project implementation (including adoption of legal frameworks) during this
period were largely attributed to weak implementation capacity at the University, a lack of
leadership within the Ministry and major political shifts and instability with coup d’états in
2005 and 2008. In order to gather detailed information on issues facing the Project, an
assessment was undertaken by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in 2008 (prior to the coup
d’état). On the basis of their findings, the QAG highlighted the need for the Project to: (i)
focus more explicitly on improving gender equity; (ii) strengthen institutional and FM systems;
and (iii) strengthen alignment between the activities being implemented and the indicators
being used to measure performance. As a result of the coup d’état in 2008, however, the Bank
suspended its activities for a period of 15 months. When the Bank did eventually formally re-
engage in November 2009, little progress had been made in the areas that had been highlighted
by the review.

Phase II: November 19, 2009 to March 26, 2012
33. On November 19, 2009, the Bank approved a first restructuring of the Project which: (i)
extended the closing date by 21-months (to March 31, 2012); and (ii) introduced a reallocation
of credit proceeds (amounting to 19 percent of the total credit amount). The reallocation was
needed given the significant increase in costs of the planned civil works activities since project
appraisal and the shifting priorities under the Project. Further, it was expected that the
extension would allow for the completion of all activities planned under the Project. The
restructuring did not, however, introduce changes to the PDO, RF or Components which had
been recommended by the 2008 QAG review.

34. During this period, progress was made in: the roll out of professional programs;
upgrading (renewal) of academic programs; training of university staff; provision of internship
opportunities; updating the regulatory framework for the sub-sector; the enactment of decrees
related to institutional reforms; and the establishment of twinning arrangements. As noted
above, the Higher Education Law in its entirety was passed in July 2010. Further progress was
also made in determining the technical specifications and requirements of civil works activities
to be supported under the operation.

35. Delays, however, persisted in a number of areas. Although the relevant studies had been
completed for civil works activities, actual construction of these structures (Central Library,
Distance Learning Center and University Administrative Center) was stymied. The non-
completion of these structures, at this point in the project life, was consequential as it prevented
other key activities from being undertaken and/or completed in a timely manner. During this
period, construction activities were even interrupted for many months due to technical issues,
delays encountered by the construction company and contract disputes. In 2011, the Bank was
informed that construction had come to a complete standstill due to problems with the
contractor. Further, despite repeated requests from the Bank the M&E system remained
inadequate while institutional capacity in terms of planning, management and governance of
the sub-sector also remained weak.




                                                11
Phase III: March 26, 2012 to October 31, 2013

36. On March 26, 2012, the Bank approved a second restructuring which extended the
Project closing date by 19 months (bringing the cumulative extension of the Project to 40
months). Specifically, the justification provided in the restructuring request highlighted the
need for additional time to complete the construction and set up of the University
Administrative Center, Distance Learning Center, and Central Library and procurement of
relevant equipment (considered instrumental in fully achieving the PDO). It also underscored
the need for additional time to design and carry out a labor market tracer study in order to
gauge whether activities under the Project including the implementation of the LMD, the
upgrading of programs had had a positive impact on the labor market insertion rate among
graduates. 24 Though the PDO was not revised, a number of project activities were scaled down
or dropped, for example, the training of staff for the Distance Learning Center and Central
Library. The RF was modified to better reflect outputs, outcomes and objectives of the Project.
Disbursement was still lagging behind schedule.

37. During this period, twinning arrangements continued to be supported and programs were
further upgraded. The number of faculty members doubled and senior lecturers tripled.
Despite continued efforts to speed up implementation, there were persistent delays particularly
related to construction. In addition to high staff turnover (three project coordinators over a six-
month period), the delays in civil works persisted since the selected firm continued to
demonstrate insufficient technical capacity to complete the agreed upon structures. As had
been the case up until this point, these important delays impeded the successful completion of
other project-related outputs including the establishment and installation of an integrated MIS
and the set up of an ICT network for teacher and student use. As funding allocated for
construction accounted for the largest portion of the credit (and for more than one-third of the
disbursements up until that point), disbursement under the Project remained low. 25

38. On the basis of an audit and discussions with the Bank, it was concluded that the civil
works activities could not be fully completed by project closing. Under the third restructuring
on June 5, 2013, the Bank and the Government made a strategic decision to cancel project
funds related to civil works activities and associated outputs and to reallocate this funding to
the ongoing Skills Development Support Project (P118974). Approximately SDR 5.77 million
(US$8.95 million equivalent) representing around 57 percent of initial cost estimates was
cancelled as a result of this decision. In this context, the Government agreed to complete the
construction (adhering to Bank Safeguards policies) that had been planned under the Project
with its own funding. The Project closed shortly thereafter on October 31, 2013.




24
   Slow implementation, particularly of civil works due to the weak capacities of the construction firm, aggravated
by its particularly low financial bid, led to the second restructuring that sought a 19-month extension of the
closing date (to October 2013).
25
   While, project expenditures on the three incomplete buildings accounted for 39 percent of all disbursements The
soft inputs, which were successfully implemented, amounted to 61 percent of all actual, end-of-project
disbursements (including: vehicles for the university which amounted to 2.8 percent of total disbursements; books
and other bibliographical materials amounting to 4.4 percent; scientific equipment amounting to 15.7 percent; and
management-related equipment for the USTM amounting to 1.7 percent of disbursements).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design
39. Original M&E Design. The original M&E framework included PDO- and intermediate-
level indicators to track progress made under the Project. The main text of the PAD included
two PDO-level indicators while the RF in the Annex of the PAD included one PDO-level
indicator. In the RF, there were also 7 intermediate results areas and 19 intermediate-level
indicators. By contrast, the DCA included seven KPIs making no distinction between those
that were PDO-level from those that were intermediate-level (Annex 10 provides a list of
indicators specified in key project documents during the project life). This lack of consistency
in indicators carried over into the project and implementation status reports (PSRs and ISRs)
where indicators (from the project documents and other new indicators) appear on a relatively
ad hoc basis. Moreover, some of the indicators were not explicitly defined nor was their
method of calculation specified. 26 The PDO-level indicator(s) under the original design were
not fully able to capture progress related to the achievement of the PDO. Despite these
limitations at the PDO-level, the intermediate-level indicators were more properly aligned with
the scope of the Project and better formulated to measure project-supported activities and
envisioned outputs and outcomes. However, the timeframe for achievement was somewhat
unrealistic and was reflective of the overly ambitious project design.

40. The M&E system design relied on the University and the IHEs to collect data that would
be consolidated to measure some of the project indicators. Although these requirements were
not overly cumbersome (relying on University and IHE to collect and transmit data regularly to
the DPEF), collecting these data in a systematic way proved to be a challenge given that the
Universities and IHEs did not already have a functioning and robust M&E system in place.
Although the overall M&E system was expected to be strengthened during the Project, it was
never fully developed. The shortcomings of the RF combined with the challenges associated
with building a robust M&E system and integrated MIS impeded full tracking of the inputs,
outputs and outcomes achieved under the Project.

41. Revised M&E Design. As noted above, the first restructuring in 2009 did not introduce
any modifications to the Project’s RF. In light of the findings and recommendations of the
2008 QAG review, modifications at this time would have been beneficial in ensuring proper
alignment between project activities and the indicators used to measure project performance.
By contrast, the restructuring in 2012 included important changes to the RF, including
indicators (new and revised) that could better and more fully capture progress made under the
Project while also reflecting changes in the project scope and design. Despite these
improvements, there were inconsistencies in the revised RF (e.g., some indicators were
“dropped” or “revised” that did not appear in the original RF, etc.) (For more details related to
changes in the indicators over the Project life see Annexes 2 and 10). While the M&E system
did improve during project implementation, it was continually highlighted by the Bank team
(and management) as an area warranting further action and improvements. Under the third
restructuring in June of 2013, all indicators linked to the completion of civil works envisaged
under the Project were dropped given that the funding for these activities would no longer be
provided by the Bank.




26
  One example of this shortcoming is a measure of “the internal efficiency of higher education” which is not
explained in the first ISR and when the calculation is provided it is not entirely clear.

                                                    13
Implementation and Utilization

42. Data for the quantitative indicators were difficult to attain and this difficulty persisted
over the Project life as statistics were not compiled in a systemic and easily available manner
by the University and IHEs. It was particularly challenging to measure the employment/labor
market insertion of graduates as there was no tracking mechanism in place. This indicator, as
was the case with many others, relied on data provided by the institutions themselves.
Furthermore, the above-mentioned inconsistencies and variations in terms of indicators across
project documents prevented a full picture of progress towards achieving the PDO from
emerging. Greater consistency and continuity in the RF would have been useful in measuring
project performance and adjusting activities and approaches on an ongoing real-time basis.
Moreover, implementation status reports (PSRs and ISRs) did not systematically track and
report on all of the indicators as Bank teams had some flexibility in determining which
indicators to include in these reports (as this was common practice during the early years of the
Project). The inconsistent reporting of indicators in the status reports persisted over time, but
showed moderate improvements during the last phase of the Project. 27

43. By project closing, the M&E system had improved somewhat. Data on the number of
students and faculty were available upon request; faculty training information could be
obtained from reports (of the twinning universities); and the university could provide
information on its course offerings and current enrollments (although in an ad hoc manner). At
the same time, neither the University nor the Ministry published a statistical yearbook for
higher education which had been planned under the Project. Furthermore, since regular
surveys and tracer studies were not undertaken as planned, it was (and is still) difficult to
systematically track employment patterns, labor market insertion, and graduates’ earnings. An
integrated MIS which was envisaged under the Project is not yet fully functional, although a
number of discrete systems now exist to collect and track data on various aspects of the sector
and institutions. The Government has reported that an integrated MIS is currently being
piloted and will soon be operational.

44. Based on the information discussed above, M&E design and implementation/utilization
is rated Modest.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
45. An environmental assessment was undertaken prior to project appraisal which identified
a number of issues related to the proposed construction (of the new campus) including: its
proximity to the coastline; potential groundwater contamination; and the possibility of needing
to move sand dunes, etc. Mitigation measures to address these potential issues were taken into
account by the architectural plans for construction. There were no major safeguards issues
raised during the life of the Project until the last phase of the Project. In 2013, it was noted that
proper documentation related to safeguards compliance was lacking. Specifically, the
restructuring paper noted that monitoring of the implementation of the Environmental Impact
Assessment was not explicitly addressed in the reports submitted by the consulting firm which
had been hired to monitor the construction.




27
     The last few ISRs reported on the same 11 PDO-level and 19 intermediate-level indicators.

                                                         14
Fiduciary compliance

46. An assessment of the FM arrangements of the Project included a review of the systems of
accounting, reporting, auditing, flow of funds and internal controls. Basic fiduciary controls
were in place at the beginning of the Project. At the same time, some weaknesses were noted
including limited knowledge in using the accounting software and preparing FM reports.
Though issues were identified at different points during project implementation (e.g., related to
reporting procedures, compliance with bookkeeping standards, etc.) many of the
recommendations provided by the Bank/steps agreed with the DPEF were implemented in a
timely manner. Although there were no serious issues identified during project implementation,
there were some delays in the submission of audit reports by the DPEF.

Procurement compliance

47. Though it was agreed that the procurement capacity of the DPEF was adequate (with the
capacity to manage procurement transactions and having a good record-keeping system), an
assessment in 2004 also highlighted that the Ministry’s capacity in procurement and FM
needed further strengthening. Steps were taken to support capacity-building within the DPEF
through the provision of training, hiring of additional staff and establishing a dedicated
procurement commission within DPEF which was responsible for procurement under activities
financed by at least five DPs. From the beginning of the Project, there were persistent delays
in procurement which, in turn, impeded the timely implementation of other planned activities.
It was noted in a 2007 procurement report that limited capacity in this area was negatively
affecting the portfolio in the country. It appears that in the context of this Project delays in
civil works activities were primarily a result of procurement issues. Procurement issues
encountered under the Project are also highlighted in the Government’s completion report
(Annex 7), specifically related to the challenges associated with the firm hired to undertake
civil works (whose bid amount was too low to cover the costs of the actual construction). This
posed a significant challenge and resulted in major delays in construction of these key
structures which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of funds for civil works activities under
the Project. 28

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
48. Although no official IDA-funded operations are planned for higher education itself, the
Bank continues to be an active partner in sector dialogue and is providing support to the TVET
sector through the ongoing Mauritania Skills Development Support Project which received an
additional financing (AF) in the amount of US$11.3 million in April of 2014 (a large portion of
these resources were reallocated from the Higher Education Project). The momentum created
by the Higher Education Project has attracted a high level of donor funding for the sub-sector
(which is several times greater the amount of funding provided through the Higher Education
Project). 29 The Government has also committed resources for the completion of a number of
activities (e.g., civil works, integrated MIS) which were supported under the Higher Education
Project and many of these are currently underway. With the increased level of funding, the
Government has advanced its agenda for the sub-sector and continues to support improvements



28
   Similar issues (for desks and books) are raised in the ICR of September 2012 for the FTI project in support of
basic education.
29
   According to Government, it is estimated that the current level of donor (non-IDA) funding to the sub-sector is
around US$100 million.

                                                       15
in the quality and relevance of higher education while also promoting institutional development
both within the Ministry and within the university and IHEs themselves.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives
49. The Project objectives were highly relevant as they responded to key challenges facing
the higher education sub-sector at appraisal and needs identified by the Bank, Government and
other DPs at the time. These challenges included: a lack of adequate facilities for students and
faculty; weak institutional capacity; lack of a functioning and integrated MIS; a mismatch
between course offerings and labor market needs; a professorial corps (teaching faculty and
administration) with significant training needs; low quality teaching and a lack of appropriate
pedagogical and didactic materials; limited research capacity; and a weak policy and regulatory
framework to guide the sub-sector. The reforms the Project aimed to support were well-
aligned with Government strategy since their specific objectives were derived from the
Government’s ten-year education sector plan (PNDSE). The Project also fit squarely with one
of the main pillars of the country’s PRSP and was aligned with the Bank’s overall strategy in
Mauritania as described in the CAS (FY03-FY05).               Further, the Project objectives
corresponded with the need for developing countries to strengthen higher education (improving
its quality and relevance) in order to meet labor market demands and compete in a globalized
economy.

50. The objectives remain highly relevant today given the strategic importance of building
the technical skills among the country’s labor force as it continues to pursue economic growth
and development. Further, similar to other countries in the region, skills development features
prominently on the current Government agenda which is supported by the Bank (i.e., Skills
Development Support Project) and other DPs.

51. The PDO remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project although the various
restructurings impacted the scope and design of the operation. The relevance of the objectives
is High both under the original and revised designs following each of the project restructurings.

Relevance of Design

52. The design of the Higher Education Project was relevant in light of the country context.
By supporting a separate stand-alone project, the Bank was well-positioned to direct its focus
towards supporting major reforms in the sub-sector. Given the Bank’s visibility, its
commitment to the sub-sector likely played a role in mobilizing resources from other
development partners to build on the achievements of this Project. Further, given the Bank’s
experience in Mauritania and the available options, the selection of the DPEF as the Project’s
implementing agency was appropriate and pragmatic. The DPEF was playing an important role
in the implementation of other DP-funded projects 30 which promoted some level of
harmonization. Moreover, the DPEF had several years of experience working on Bank-funded
projects and was able to provide a reasonable level of managerial stability throughout the


30
  AFD, IBD, the Kuwaiti and Saudi Funds, and the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and
Development (Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional Para el Desarrollo – AECID). Apart from
AECID, all of these DPs are supporting activities in the higher education sub-sector.

                                               16
project life. This was particularly relevant given the political instability related to ministerial
changes and reconfigurations which occurred during the project life.

53. As one of the main donors to the sub-sector, the Bank’s continued support to far-reaching
reforms was appropriate in fostering institutional and systemic changes within the higher
education sub-sector. However, because many of the project activities relied on the enactment
of specific laws and decrees, and strengthened institutional capacity, which often take a long
time to materialize (particularly in a context of political shifts/instability), the design appears to
have been overly ambitious for a five-year operation.

54. Though the PDO was not changed during the life of the Project, the various
restructurings did, to some extent, affect its scope and design. Under the first restructuring, the
Bank’s decision to redirect resources across expenditure categories (including the allocating
increased funding for civil works activities) was appropriate given increased construction costs
and the view that the completion of civil works was critical in improving the learning
environment. The second restructuring of the Project provided additional time for completion
of civil works activities and the RF was modified – both at the PDO and intermediate levels
with the inclusion of additional indicators to capture progress on achievement of the PDO and
to ensure adherence with new Bank requirements. Moreover, new indicators were also added
to more fully measure the status of important activities under the Project including training
(e.g., number of senior lecturers) and the transfer of autonomy to the universities. Though the
various changes introduced were appropriate, since IHEs were not regularly producing data
and data were not centralized, the large number of indicators were not properly measured and
reported on. Finally, given the persistent delays in the construction planned under the Project
despite a cumulative extension of 40 months, the Bank and the Government’s strategic decision
to redirect Bank funds to the ongoing Skills Development Support Project was sound. This
decision was based on an informed assessment which concluded that project activities related
to civil works could not be accomplished before the Project closing date. As a consequence,
construction and related activities (e.g., training of library staff) were, therefore, dropped which
greatly reduced the scope of the Project. In light of the positive features of the design as well
the shortcomings described above, the relevance of the design across the life of the Project
(which included three restructurings) is rated Modest.

55. Despite these limitations in design and implementation, the Project did effectively attract
additional resources from other DPs to the higher education sub-sector. In this way, the Project
appears to have had its intended catalytic effect. 31 It appears that the Project played some role
in mobilizing approximately US$100 million from other DPs for campus construction
(including a student dormitory) and equipment. 32 The leveraging effect of the Project design
was, therefore, considerable. Further, the Government’s decision to provide support to
activities initiated under the Project with its own resources when the Project funds were
cancelled points to the significant momentum which began under the Project. Based on
interviews conducted during the preparation of this evaluation, it was widely believed that
without the Bank’s initial financing and commitment to campus construction, this level of




31
   Stated in the Concept Note but not in the PAD.
32
   It appears that the Project may have planted a seed that initiated a process: (i) that brought other DPs into the
financing of higher education, construction and equipment of the new campus in particular; (ii) that provided
analytical and material support for the policies and objectives articulated in the PNDSE; and (iii) where there was
extensive stakeholder ownership and Government commitment.


                                                        17
ownership and coordinated buy-in from other donors and Government may not have been
realized.

56. Given that the relevance of the Project objectives is High both before and after the
restructurings and that the relevance of the Project’s design is Modest both before and after the
restructurings, on balance, the overall relevance of objectives and design is rated Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

57. The overall rating for the achievement of the PDO is Moderately Unsatisfactory. Since
the PDO itself did not change throughout the course of implementation, the Project’s
performance is analyzed as a continuum. To this end, the first section describes achievements
under the Project in relation to PDO- and intermediate-level indicators. This seeks to provide a
holistic picture of what was achieved and not achieved under the Project. This section is
followed by an analysis of the Project’s performance by phase of implementation (before and
after the Project’s restructurings). The overall outcome ratings by phase are then graphically
summarized in Section 3.4.

Achievement by PDO-level indicators

58. Progress made in achievement of the PDO-level indicators is as follows: (i) students in
professional programs reached 22.5 percent (exceeding the end-of-project target of 12 percent);
(ii) students enrolled in science and technology (S&T) reached 25.5 percent (also exceeding the
end-of-project target of 12 percent); (iii) four public IHEs had transformed their programs into
LMD programs; (iv) three university departments (including 379 faculty) in the University of
Nouakchott participated in twinning arrangements with institutions in France, Morocco and
Canada; however, since they were not accredited the end-of-project target was not met; (v) the
number of faculty (teaching) staff meeting minimum qualifications reached 619 (exceeding the
end-of-project target of 400); (vi) the proportion of students repeating in IHE not enrolled in
LMD decreased to 10 percent (exceeding the end of project target of 25 percent); and (vii) the
percentage of students employed six months after graduation reached 50 percent (exceeding the
end-of-project target of 40 percent). In addition, although with some delays, (viii) the Higher
Education Law was approved and all ministerial decrees issued (achieving end-of-project
target). Moreover, the number of project beneficiaries reached 22,693 exceeding the end of
project target of 16,000 beneficiaries. At the same time, however, the gender balance was not
achieved – with only 31 percent of beneficiaries being female which was short of the project
target of 34 percent. Although these positive trends were documented in official reports, the
failure to develop a robust M&E system and the absence of a tracer study makes it difficult to
cross-check the accuracy of some of the trends and to validate some of the reported figures. 33




33
  In particular, in lieu of a tracer study, the figure reported for the percentage of students employed six-months
after graduation, for instance, cannot be validated since it is sourced from the University of Science, Technology
and Medicine itself.


                                                       18
Achievement by Intermediate-level Indicators

Component 1: Improving Quality and Relevance of Higher Education

59. Project achievements under this Component by the end of the Project were as follows 34:
(i) the number of faculty trained reached 200 (exceeding the target of 100); (ii) a total of 34
programs were upgraded (renewed) and 29 professional programs were launched (far
exceeding the original target of 17) 35; (iii) three university departments (those participating in
twinning programs) included distance learning modules in their courses 36; and (iv) 119 senior
lecturers were trained (exceeding the end-of-project target of 65). At the same time, (v) an ICT
network was not installed/used (though computers were purchased and wiring installed in the
old campus); and (vi-vii) the Distance Learning Center and Central Library were only partially
completed (not achieving end-of-project target of fully completed).
60.   Many of the achievements under this Component are likely to have positively impacted
the quality and relevance of higher education in Mauritania. As a result of the twinning
arrangements, professors from these foreign universities traveled to Nouakchott and worked
with the Mauritanian faculty in the development of the LMD approach with the faculty in
Mauritania adapting their teaching methods accordingly. The University has experienced
improvements in the quality of programs in the areas of law, economics, science, and
economics – though the institutional settings necessary for the accreditation of the new
professional courses have been developed, they are still awaiting official approval before
course accreditation can be actualized. Further, as a result of training and internships under the
Project, there was a three-fold increase in the number of qualified senior lecturers and almost a
two-fold increase in the number of qualified faculty members. In addition, with the number of
programs begun (28 professional programs) and upgraded (34 general academic programs)
students now have greater flexibility in choosing a career path. Furthermore, the LMD
programs currently exist in all four of the targeted university departments. Though distance
education and library staff training was not provided under the Project, it will be undertaken
with support from the Kuwaiti Fund.
61.    Project achievements which aimed to improve the learning environment in higher
education were more limited. As a result of significant and persistent delays in civil works
activities, the structures envisaged under the Project were only partially constructed. These
works figured prominently in the PAD as well as the first and second restructuring papers as
they were considered instrumental in achieving the PDO since they were strongly tied to the
constraints facing the sub-sector when the Project was conceived. In addition to their non-
completion, a large number of other important activities were also abandoned or only
completed in part (e.g., use of ICT equipment for teaching, learning and research; training of
library staff, etc).




34
   The indicators which were dropped included: proportion of students using internet and computer-assisted
instructional material at the University; and three indicators related to hiring and training of staff for the planned
infrastructure (university administrative center, library and distance learning center).
35
   This indicator was not tracked following the 2012 restructuring, but rather the number of professional programs
having been established or upgraded was tracked.
36
   Though the target was not specified correctly in the 2012 Restructuring paper with the error carried over into
the last ISR, it appears that the target value could not have exceeded three – as these were the envisioned number
of university departments having participated in twinning programs.

                                                         19
Component 2: Further Institutional Development

62. Progress made under the Project in supporting institutional development was as follows:
(i) committees for pedagogic autonomy were created and trained in nine IHEs in 2008/2009
(achieving the end-of-project target); and (ii) of the 9 IHEs, three generated financial resources
in 2008/2009 and 5 in 2011 (achieving the end-of-project target). However, at the same time;
(iii) institutional development plans (IDPs) are not in place (therefore, not achieving target); a
model IDP – the basis of which each IHE will prepare its own institution specific IDP – has
however been approved and is being used on an ad hoc basis; (iv) transfer of autonomy to the
University (budgets, programs and administrative personnel) was only partially achieved
(everything except for the hiring of permanent university staff); (v) progress was made in the
development of procedural manuals for administrative autonomy though these were not
approved and operational under the project (thus not achieving the stipulated target); (vi) a
quality assurance system was partially launched which included tools and procedures (not
achieving end of project target); (vii) progress was made in terms of developing an integrated
MIS for student services, finance, human resources, planning and monitoring but this is not yet
operational (falling short of achieving the end-of-project target) 37 ; (viii) financial and
accounting reports, student tracer study reports, and plan of operations based on the MIS were
not produced and audited under the Project (not achieving the end-of-project target); and (ix)
the University Administrative Center was not fully completed. The Government estimates that
the University Administrative Center was 75 percent complete by the end of the Project.
63. While many of these outputs and outcomes were only partially achieved (and are, in
some cases, pending approval), together they have laid the foundation and have initiated the
process of further strengthening institutional development in the sector. The introduction of
legislation to reform the sub-sector is a major achievement under the Project and will be
critical in maintaining and strengthening achievements observed under this operation.
Notwithstanding achievements under this Component, the poor performance of the civil works
activities (e.g., construction of the university administrative center) has been a constraint to
achieving other component aims in full (without budgeting and planning offices, the required
equipment could not be procured and an integrated MIS could not be set up. 38


Achievements of the Project by Implementation Phase

64. Although the PDO did not change over the life of the Project, there were changes
introduced in the scope and design of the Project particularly under the second and third
restructurings. It is, therefore, useful to review the Project’s performance by implementation
phase (following effectiveness and subsequent restructurings).
65. During the first phase of the Project (from effectiveness up until the first restructuring in
November 2009), progress was made in a number of activities, including: the training of


37
   For example, the MIS was largely contingent on the completion of the university administrative building and
procurement of the necessary MIS equipment. Although the investment in development of the integrated MIS has
yet to bear fruit, the process has revealed the complexity of developing such a system. Although the integrated
MIS has not yet been developed, the university has developed its own, locally programmed systems for financial
management and the management of student flows and examinations. Here we have an example where the project
did not deliver its expected output, but the intended outcome has been partially (even largely) attained.
38
   Though this has not yet been achieved, the Government has made progress in this regard working closing with
AUF to develop a data collection framework and software, and to provide training so that implementation could
start as soon as the equipment is available. With AUF's support training was also provided on data collection and
the use of the software for seven staff of the universities.

                                                       20
lecturers abroad, the establishment of a consortium of universities, the set-up of LMD in
various IHEs, capacity-building for university staff in management and administration; signing
of twinning contracts; completion of a major study on the sub-sector; and program upgrading
(renewal) at the IHEs. Furthermore, progress had also been made in relation to the design of
the university new campus (including architectural studies which were completed though with
significant delay) as well as the Central Library and the Distance Learning Center. A
university president had been selected in a transparent manner. Additionally, TA for capacity-
building in the Ministry as well as for the establishment of an M&E system was being
formulated. Though legal frameworks and decrees were developed and adopted, there was
some delay in their approval. The disbursement rate remained low during this phase due to the
aforementioned delays (which, in turn, prevented the start up of construction activities which
accounted for the bulk of project funding). Moreover, disbursements failed to gain momentum
since a number of preparatory activities were funded by the ESDP rather than with resources
under this Project.

66. During the Project’s second phase (from the first restructuring in 2009 to the second
restructuring in March of 2012) progress was observed related to: the roll out of professional
programs; the upgrading (renewal) of academic programs; the training of/internship
opportunities for university staff; updating of the sub-sector’s regulatory framework including
the approval of the Higher Education Law in July 2010 and decrees supporting major
institutional reforms to promote transfer of autonomy to the university and the establishment of
fruitful twinning arrangements. Progress was also made in the completion of relevant studies
and defining technical specifications of civil works. However, there were notable delays in
civil works activities as a result of limited capacity of the firm contracted to complete this work.
As of end-October 2011, the structures to be built under the Project (Central Library,
University Administrative Center and the Distance Learning Center) were only partially
completed. Limited progress in civil works activities impeded other activities planned under
the Project from being fully undertaken (e.g., establishment of the ICT network or procurement
of necessary equipment). An integrated MIS and functional M&E system had still not been
established (though the integrated MIS depended in large part on the construction of the
relevant buildings, particularly the university administrative center).

67. During the third and final phase of the project (from the second restructuring until project
closing), a number of activities (particularly those related to civil works) were dropped.
During this period, progress was made in terms of continued success with twinning
arrangements and training activities with the number of faculty members doubling and number
of senior lecturers tripling. In addition, a large number of academic programs had been
upgraded. Despite efforts to speed up implementation (with the Government taking steps to
proactively work with the firm contracted to carry out civil works), construction was again
delayed. Again, these persistent delays impeded the start up of other activities planned under
the Project.

Overall achievement of PDO

68. The Project appears to have had a positive impact on the quality and relevance of higher
education while it has also supported institutional development within the sub-sector. Through
the development of occupationally-oriented (professional) programs, the introduction of the
LMD structure, the expansion of course offerings, the establishment of twinning partnerships,
and staff training, the University and IHEs are better equipped to prepare students with skills
that correspond to labor market needs. The Project also initiated a number of activities,
including the piloting of an integrated MIS and the development of a model institutional


                                                21
development plan. The legislative reforms introduced under the Project constitute a significant
achievement having set the stage for: (i) greater autonomy of IHEs; (ii) a more favorable
environment for developing linkages with private sector firms; (iii) establishment of standards
for academic programs; (iv) setting-up a management body for public IHEs; and (v)
professionalizing the status of faculty and school administrators in the sub-sector. 39


69. Despite these achievements, the Project did not achieve many of its envisioned activities.
Though progress was made in terms of construction of key facilities, none of the buildings
were completed under the Project. This was a missed opportunity to make needed
improvements to the teaching and learning environment which characterized the sub-sector. In
addition, other related outputs were also not achieved including the training of staff for these
structures, inclusion of distance learning modules in course materials, the set up of an ICT
network and the establishment of an integrated MIS. Though these were important
shortcomings, the Project appears to have played a catalytic role in mobilizing other donors to
provide financial resources to support the sub-sector making it likely that the project objectives
will be achieved (beyond the life of the Project). Taken together, the quality and relevance of
higher education has improved, institutional development has progressed as a result of the
Project’s emphasis on supporting the reform agenda, while the teaching and learning
environment – an area which was identified at appraisal as one which warranted significant and
continuous support – did not improve as much as had been envisaged under the Project though
these achievements are close to being realized in its aftermath. 40

3.3 Efficiency

70. The total and marginal returns to education provide a strong economic justification for
public investment in higher education and administrative capacity-building within the sub-
sector in Mauritania. Data analysis shows that a male worker with higher education earns, on
average, 37 percent more than his male counterpart who only attended secondary school. The
gender gap in earnings is also significant with females earning 40 percent less than males with
similar levels of education. Regression analyses controlling for other important individual
characteristics (e.g., sector, region and rural/urban) show that, on average, relative to “no
education”, higher education increases wages by 61.5 percent versus 24.4 percent for
secondary and 5.2 percent for primary (Education Country Status Report (2010) – Rapport
d’état sur le système éducatif nationale – RESEN). The World Bank 2010 Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) estimates are higher: the overall rate-of-return to tertiary education is
estimated at 100 percent (111 percent in the private and 83 percent in the public sectors) and as
high as 128 percent and 137 percent for graduate degrees in the manufacturing and
construction sectors, respectively. 41

71. Efficiency of Implementation. Despite delays at various points, the activities related to
institutional development including the introduction of LMD programs, training of faculty and



39
   In this context professionalization of status of faculty and school administrators implies establishing profiles
and salary scales for University personnel.
40
   According to the PAD, “the current physical environment of the university was not conducive to learning and
research. University buildings were scattered throughout the capital and most were in disarray… library facilities
were almost nonexistent and internet access was limited to a privileged few.” (p. 4)
41
   Although the report uses the term “returns to education,” the dependent variable in the regression is log of
annual wages. The results should not be interpreted as a rate of return on investment.

                                                        22
staff and provision of internship opportunities, among others, were well implemented and
showed notable progress under the Project. Though there were delays in the adoption of the
Higher Education Law and relevant decrees in the first phase of the Project, the needed
legislation was ultimately enacted and adopted. These legislative reforms were a major
achievement under the Project and have provided the framework for further improvements in
the quality and relevance of higher education in Mauritania. Despite these significant
accomplishments, the implementation of major civil works activities was delayed and
ultimately abandoned (University Administrative Center, Central Library and Distance
Learning Center) as was the establishment of an integrated MIS. Though these activities were
not completed under the Project, the Government agreed to support their continuation and
completion with its own resources during the post-project period. Moreover, the Government
was able to leverage IDA assistance to attract additional funding (worth approximately US$100
million) from other major donors including AfDB, IDB, and the Governments of China and
Kuwait.

72. Cost-effectiveness of Twinning Arrangements. Twinning partnerships were an important
part of the reform strategy. Three foreign universities provided support and training
(Humanities and Social Sciences in Morocco; Law and Economics in France; and S&T in
Canada). These relationships were reported to have had a significant impact on the program’s
successes both directly (in providing guidance on planning and pedagogy for LMD programs)
and indirectly (in providing leadership and encouragement beyond the terms of the initial
contact). This success was achieved at a reasonable cost and implemented in ways that led to
cost savings. The proposed budget for the three partnerships, which included training for 379
faculty members, was US$1.0 million. Although actual spending by sub-component is not
available, an audit showed that a single partnership cost US$0.32 million. The Project had
budgeted US$1.0 million to cover the cost of three twinning arrangements, and so the there
was no budget overrun for this activity. Grouping services (TA, training, study visits and
scientific exchanges), rather than contracting for each individually, helped to drive down
expenses. Given the specific nature of these arrangements and the novelty of twinning in
higher education, it is not possible to compare them to other outside partnership programs.

73. Beginning in 2009, funding was reallocated towards civil works. Consequently, actual
Operating Costs were substantially lower than those anticipated at appraisal (SDR 158,349
versus SDR 680,000), as were Training and Consulting Services & Audits. The ratio of
Operating Costs to total disbursements also fell during this time from 6.8 percent to 3 percent.
In this sense, the Project can be seen as having been managed efficiently. It is important to note
that these operating costs were linked to the overall management of the Project and were not
for civil work activities. The awarded civil works contracts included budget lines to cover
operating costs and, therefore, the reduction in operation costs observed under the Project
suggests that some efficiency gains were realized.

74. Cost-effectiveness of construction. Civil works contracts were awarded through a
competitive bidding process which was heavily based on cost (rather than quality)
considerations. As a result, suppliers were often poorly equipped to meet deadlines. Delays
coincided with rising costs of material and impacted other project activities, such as the
development of distance learning programs and the training of library staff, which were
ultimately canceled. In this sense, the construction activities, despite the initial efforts to
contain costs, were inefficient and remained incomplete at project closing. At the same time,
however, the Project galvanized interest in the higher education sector on the part of the
Government and other donors. After the Project closed, the Government agreed to finance the
completion of the civil works activities (with a new firm), a clear indicator of its commitment

                                               23
to and ownership of the project. Other donors also entered the sector with a significant level of
investments (on the order of US$100 million).

Sustainability

75. Key reforms, including the establishment of the LMD system, autonomy of IHEs, and the
standardization and/or upgrading of academic programs laid the groundwork for continued
improvement in this sector. Coordination and investment by the Government and DPs has
increased and shows much promise for the future. Overall, these changes are likely to have a
positive long-term impact on the way in which the higher education sub-sector functions and
grows.

76. In light of the above (and as described in further detail in Annex 3), efficiency is rated
Modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

77. The Project contributed to the ongoing improvements in the relevance, quality and
management of higher education as its objectives were and remain Highly Relevant to the
Government’s higher education strategic agenda as laid out in the PNDSE and the sector plan
which followed (PNDSE II). The relevance of both the original and revised designs was
Modest. Despite its support of key objectives in the sub-sector, the Project’s design was
overly ambitious particularly for a five-year operation. This became particularly evident given
the shifting and difficult political climate in the country at the time. The Project’s support to
far-reaching reforms, major civil works activities, and a number of interventions which
depended on the completion of these was a significant undertaking. It proved to be particularly
challenging given the context which was characterized by political shifts and limited capacity.

78. As documented in the ICR and detailed in Annexes 2 and 3, a number of achievements
were observed under the Project, in particular, those pertaining to: the adoption and enactment
of legislation; the introduction of the LMD approach; the establishment of fruitful twinning
arrangements; and the upgrading of professional programs, among others. Over the project
period, there was an increase in the number of students enrolled in both professional and S&T
programs while the regulatory framework for the sub-sector is now in place. The analysis
provided above (and detailed in Annex 3) provides evidence that efficiency was Modest. On
the one hand, the Project was able to introduce legislation that will likely reap important gains
to the sub-sector in the longer-term, at the same time, persistent delays in project-supported
activities led to the failure to complete a number of envisioned outputs and to the cancellation
of the majority of project funds.

79. Despite the achievements of important outcomes and the completion of a number of key
activities, the Project failed several activities which impeded the achievement of important
outcomes and outputs that were envisaged under the operation, including: civil works activities
which were only partially completed; an integrated MIS that was not established; IDPs were
not fully developed; the accreditation of twinning arrangements has not yet been formalized;
and an ICT network has not been installed, among others. A number of these activities,
especially the construction of the Central Library, Distance Learning Center and University
Administrative Center and the establishment of an integrated MIS were deemed important to



                                               24
the full achievement of the PDO, and it was on this basis that the various restructurings were
requested and approved by the Bank.

80. Ultimately, these delays and implementation capacity constraints resulted in the decision
to cancel almost 60 percent of project funds. The Government did, however, demonstrate its
commitment to the sub-sector by continuing to implement activities which had been formally
dropped from the Project and currently remains actively engaged in advancing efforts to
improve the delivery of high quality education in Mauritania. Taken together, the overall
outcome rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

 Although this is not made explicit in the Guidelines, it can be deduced by reviewing the example on page 43.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

81. The Project was largely equitable with 31 percent of beneficiaries being female, though
this was lower than the target value of 34 percent. The proportion of girls benefitting from the
Project was smaller than expected in part as a result of the delayed construction of dormitories.
Without secure residence quarters for females, families outside of Nouakchott were likely
hesitant to send their daughters to school (perhaps explaining why almost all of the female
students in higher education are from Nouakchott). It is expected that the proportion of female
students should increase once the dormitories are completed.

                                                     25
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

82. Institutional capacity was an initial concern under the Project and addressing such
weaknesses was an objective of the Project. As a result of the Project’s emphasis on capacity-
building through project-level training and support to training of staff working in the sub-sector
as well as its support for the introduction of major institutional reforms (including the transfer
of autonomy to universities), it is expected that the higher education system will be able to
maintain and continue to strengthen its relevance and ability to attract and train students and
high-caliber faculty. In addition, the Government demonstrated its commitment and capacity
to support the completion of civil works initiated under the Project. Not only did the
Government agree to adhere to safeguards guidelines in completing these activities but it has,
since project closing, sought to ensure that the achievements observed under the Project are
sustained and scale-up in the future.

 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative); financing from
others

83. The Project appears to have fostered a high level of collaboration among DPs and set in
motion a series of structural reforms that awarded the university increased autonomy. The
Government was able to leverage IDA assistance for architectural works and construction plans
to attract funding (worth approximately US$100 million) from other major donors, including
AfDB, IDB and the Governments of China and Kuwait. Though the Project aimed to have a
catalytic effect in mobilizing donor funding – the magnitude of the support which was actually
provided was not foreseen in the PAD. In part as a result of the Bank’s commitment and
investment in the sector (as a credible and visible partner in the education sector), the
Government was able to attract these DPs to finance construction and equipment of the new
campus. By strengthening HEIs, strengthening the faculty and promoting a degree program
that adheres to international standards, the Project has likely spurred increased economic
activity in the capital in the short- and long-term and will result in important improvements in
basic infrastructure (e.g., potable water system, electricity, as well as a sanitation system).
During the ICR mission, many individuals indicated that without the Bank’s willingness to
invest in university infrastructure in the country, it would not have been possible to secure the
level of financial support put forth by the various DPs.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

84. The risks identified in the PAD were largely appropriate. The overall risk rating was
Marginal 42 at the time of appraisal; and in retrospect, this appears to have been astute. Table 2
provides a summary review of the risks and mitigation measures identified at appraisal while
also providing an evaluation of these same risks at the time of preparation of the ICR. This
section also includes an assessment of the Risk to Development Outcome in the post-project
period.

     Marginal is equivalent to Moderate in the current Risk to Development Outcome rating scale.

Rating scale: H=High; S=Substantial; M=Modest/Marginal; L=Low or Negligible
*Risk rating with mitigation

  85. The Risk to Development Outcome following the end of the Project is rated Moderate.
  The Government’s commitment to this sub-sector is evidenced in its decision to fund the
  completion of activities started under the Project with its own resources. In fact, since project
  closing, important progress has been observed in the civil works activities (e.g., construction of
  Central Library and Distance Learning Center) and in other project-supported interventions
  such as the development of an integrated MIS. The Government has made its commitment to
  the sub-sector explicit in its PNDSE II and in available action plans. For example, the
  Government has committed in its action plan to continue to provide funding to support
  twinning arrangements which were supported under the Project. Further, the approval of the
  regulatory framework for the sub-sector provides the legal underpinning and impetus for
  continued support to the sub-sector by the Government, particularly in terms of securing and
  promoting the autonomy of IHEs, supporting the LMD structure, and maintaining the
  established management body for public IHEs. In addition to this favorable legal environment,
  both the economic and political outlook for Mauritania remains favorable. 43 In addition to the
  Government’s strong commitment to the sub-sector, the donor community has provided a
  significant level of financial support to the education sector in Mauritania.

    According to recent IMF estimates, the rate of growth in terms of real GDP is projected to reach 6.5% in 2014
  thus maintaining the strong economic performance in recent years.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
86. Bank Performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
Project’s objectives and design reflected the Government’s strategy for the higher education
sub-sector as laid out in its 10-year sector plan (PNDSE) which was widely endorsed by DPs
active in the sector. The design also fit squarely with the Bank’s aim to support the
Government in achieving its objectives which focused on human resource development and
economic growth as outlined in the PRSP and the CAS (2003-2005). Since this Project and the
Bank-funded ESDP were prepared at around the same time, they complemented each other in
tackling the challenges faced by the education sector in the country. The high-level of
collaboration and consensus-building among stakeholders in the sub-sector followed by visible
Bank support to higher education laid the foundation for donors’ increased support to the sub-
sector in the years to come. In this context, Government reports and interviews with key
stakeholders indicate that donors plan to continue their financial and technical support in order
to further strengthen the country’s education sector.

87. At the same time, a number of shortcomings affected the Project’s quality at entry,
including: (i) an RF which was not able to measure progress related to all aspects of the PDO
and relied on a functioning and coordinated M&E system that did not exist at the time; (ii) an
overly optimistic assessment of the time needed to enact key reforms, particularly in the
context of limited institutional capacity; (iii) limited appreciation for the potential negative
impact that any shifts in the political context might have on project implementation; and (ii)
insufficient consideration of the challenges associated with the expedient implementation of
activities given capacity constraints and competing priorities within the Government. Together,
these shortcomings in quality at entry were consequential insofar as they prevented the full
implementation of envisioned activities and, in turn prevented the full achievement of the PDO.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
88. Bank Performance in terms of quality of supervision is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Apart from the 15-month period of Bank disengagement following the 2008 coup d’état, the
Bank team held regular supervision missions and was comprised of staff with appropriate
expertise. Further, there was continuity in the team composition which boded well for
continuous dialogue with the Government. Regular supervision reports were submitted to
management on a regular basis. Though they contained some important information –
highlighting challenges that were being faced by the Project team – they did not provide
concrete recommendations on how challenges could be effectively addressed and/or
appropriate follow up (particularly the case in terms of civil works activities and the
establishment of an integrated MIS). These status reports also did not provide sufficient
information on project-supported activities that were being successfully implemented under the
Project as well as those activities which were not undertaken (e.g., production of the statistical
yearbook, tracer studies, etc.) This prevented, therefore, a systematic, comprehensive and
evidence-based assessment of overall implementation progress and progress towards achieving
the PDO.



                                               30
89. Though the Project was restructured in 2009 (following the Bank’s reengagement in the
country), the Bank did not use this opportunity to make needed changes (that were highlighted
in the QAG review) in the RF and did not adequately re-evaluate the realism of completing the
civil works activities and its associated outputs during the remaining project period. In
addition, though the Bank voiced concern as to the lack of a functioning M&E system, this was
never fully addressed by either the Bank or the Borrower. Important revisions were only
introduced to the RF under the second restructuring undertaken in 2012.

90. The decision to restructure the Project for the third time in 2013 (which resulted in the
cancellation of Bank funding for civil works activities) was a proactive and appropriate step
following a period of monthly supervision visits to project sites by the TTL and Country
Manager and the findings from an audit. The Bank showed flexibility and acumen in
strategically redirecting cancelled funds to support the Government’s expressed commitment to
strengthening the TVET sector.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

91. Based on the Bank’s performance in terms of Quality of Entry and Supervision and the
Project’s overall outcome rating, the rating for Bank Performance is Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
92. During the preparation and design of the Project, the Government ensured that the
Project objectives and activities corresponded to the challenges faced and needs of the sub-
sector highlighted in the PNDSE. Further, the Government demonstrated its commitment to
the difficult reform process despite the major political shifts and instability which characterized
the country at the time. The Government also showed that improving the education sector was
a major priority by taking on both the Higher Education and the Education Sector Development
Projects at around the same time as well as other activities supported by the DPs. This required
substantial coordination and alignment of the interventions supported within the sub-sector.
Though there were delays in the adoption of the Higher Education Law and relevant decrees in
the first phase of the Project, the needed legislation was ultimately enacted and adopted. The
adoption of important legislation and its initial implementation was a major achievement of the
Project and has provided the framework to further improve and strengthen the quality and
relevance of higher education in Mauritania.

93. As described earlier, however, the Project design underestimated the time required to
complete the process of developing and enacting new laws and policies particularly since other
project activities were in large part contingent on their completion. This was particularly the
case with regards to the legal framework/instruments related to the transfer of autonomy to
IHEs. Unfortunately, as described above, some exogenous factors including political instability
as well as shifts in Government (key personnel, merging/establishment of ministries, etc.)
challenged the Government’s ability to steer, direct and coordinate the timely implementation
of the project-related activities. In terms of civil works activities, the Government did,
however, enter into a contract with a firm with insufficient capacity and a proposed bid which


                                                31
was unrealistically low and could not cover the costs of activities to be covered under the
contract. This led to further delays in completion of civil works under the Project. To remedy
issues related to performance of the contractor, the Government took a number of important
steps – creating a committee to undertake regular site visits, requesting a letter of commitment
and detailed implementation plan from the contractor and receiving confirmation from the
company supervising the construction that the civil works could be completed by December 31,
2012. Finally, when the Project funds were cancelled, the Government committed itself to
completing activities which had been initiated under the Project with its own resources.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance 44

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

94. The DPEF was selected as implementing agency for the Project given its experience with
Bank-financed operations (including its role as implementing agency for the ongoing ESDP)
and the findings of an implementation capacity assessment (updated in 2004) which indicated
that the Project’s proposed institutional arrangements were satisfactory. At the same time, the
assessment also highlighted that the FM and procurement capacity still needed strengthening.
Notwithstanding these capacity gaps, the DPEF was regarded as the most suitable entity to
implement the Project. 45 Though the capacity of the DPEF appears to have somewhat
improved over the life of the Project, its limited procurement capacity negatively impacted the
Project’s achievements. Specifically, the selection of a firm which was ill-equipped to
complete the civil works activities resulted in major delays in construction activities which
were tied to a number of other project-supported activities which together were of high
importance in terms of achieving the PDO. The DPEF also experienced some FM issues
though these were largely addressed in a timely manner. Though the DPEF was responsible
for data collection under the Project, a functioning and robust M&E system was never
established despite repeated requests from the Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

95. On the basis of the ratings above, as well as the Project’s overall outcome rating,
Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
96. Policy reform is a complex undertaking and this awareness should be reflected in
the project design. The path to achieving broad reforms is complex and can be influenced by
a number of endogenous and exogenous factors such as: Government commitment, political
will, political shifts/instability, institutional capacity, and a country’s bureaucratic processes.
This awareness should ensure realism in terms of the activities and objectives that can be
successfully completed and achieved within a specific time frame.




44
   During the life of the Project, the DPEF was a unit established by the Government and staffed with civil
servants. The Government assigned DPEF with the responsibility of managing all externally-financed education
projects in Mauritania.
45
   Further, the choice was made on pragmatic grounds as this was the Government’s own entity responsible for
implementing education projects in the country.

                                                    32
97. The visibility of Bank support should not be underestimated as it can act as an
important catalyst in mobilizing resources from both the Government as well as other
development partners. As a result of its visibility and demonstrated commitment to the sector,
through this Project the Bank was able to leverage funding and additional support from other
DPs to the country’s higher education sub-sector. The Bank’s influence in this regard should
not be underestimated and should be effectively used in attracting other financiers to support
attainment of sector-wide objectives.

98. Bank teams should ensure the establishment of a robust M&E system in order to
properly document the achievements and shortcomings of a Project. On the Bank-side, the
lack of consistency in the results framework across key project documents made tracking
achievements under this Project difficult. This may have prevented the Bank and the
Government from identifying issues in a more timely manner and in turn, from providing
concrete recommendations to address the identified issues. Careful and thorough consideration
of each indicator including its description, timeline and targets at the design phase can best
ensure that data monitoring and reporting is both clear and useful in measuring achievements
under the Project. If inconsistencies are identified in a Project’s RF, the project team should
take the necessary steps to address these expediently. Support to the development of a
functioning M&E system (in instances where a system is not already in place) should always
be a priority at the design stage.

99. The Bank should ensure that procurement processes applied during
implementation enable the Project to effectively evaluate the quality and adequacy of
proposals and their associated bids. By ensuring this, the Bank can reduce the likelihood
that a firm is competitively selected solely on the basis of having the lowest bid (with little
consideration for its technical capacity and the proposal’s feasibility). The competitively
selected firm must be chosen on the basis of the quality of the proposal and the
accuracy/realism of the proposed bid to undertake the activities specified in the contract.
Under-pricing by the firm that was awarded the contract to construct the three project-financed
buildings, combined with its weak implementation capacity, led to the cancellation of
approximately 60 percent of project funds.

100. The cost of an intervention may not be directly proportional to its impact. Although
the main civil works activities were not completed under the Project (for which a large of
portion of project funds were committed), the Project did achieve a number of important
outputs and outcomes related to institutional development. In particular, the enactment of
legislative reforms and establishment of successful twinning arrangements were important
achievements in this area. Though these activities were less costly than the planned physical
construction, they have provided the groundwork for continued improvements in the quality
and relevance of the higher education in Mauritania.

                                   Annex 2. Outputs by Component
1.       According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) the Project development
objective is “to assist in the implementation of the higher education reform to improve the
quality and relevance of instruction; and the institutional development of the university and the
institutions of higher education (IHEs), through the reinforcement of their pedagogical and
financial management.” 46 In the main text of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), two
project development objective (PDO)-level indicators are listed: (i) the proportion of students
in professional programs increases from 7 percent in 2003/04 to 12 percent in 2008/09; and (ii)
pedagogic, administrative, and financial management systems are operational by 2008. 47 In the
Results Framework (RF), however, only the former is listed as a PDO-level indicator. In the
DCA, seven key performance indicators (KPIs) are listed with no reference to indicators being
either PDO- or intermediate-level. There were 19 intermediate-level (or results) indicators
listed in the PAD.

2.    This Project was designed in the broader context of the ten-year Education Sector
Development Program (PNDSE) that covered the entire education sector and training system
and received support from a number of development partners (DPs) (French Development
Agency (Agence France de Developpement – AFD), Spain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Islamic
Development Bank (IDB), African Development Bank (AfDB), United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF), and World Food Programme (WFP)). Like the ESDP, which was being
prepared at around the same time, the Higher Education Project aimed to build on and
complete interventions being implemented under the PNDSE. Furthermore, it was expected
that IDA financing of the university campus in the context of this Project would have a
“catalytic effect on other donors and encourage their support for the Government’s strategy.”

3.    The rationale for the Project provided in the PAD highlighted two challenges facing the
higher education sub-sector that the Project would aim to address: (i) poor quality and
relevance of instruction; and (ii) a physical environment that was not conducive to learning and
research. Poor quality and relevance were evidenced in: syllabi which were outdated and
poorly aligned with international standards; a predominance of formal lectures; and a lack of
library facilities and pedagogical aids (e.g., computers, laboratories, reference materials,
journals). In addition, faculty lacked pedagogical training and opportunities for professional
development; course content did not respond to needs of the labor market as there was little
dialogue between IHEs and productive sectors; and there were high repetition rates. Facilities
were scattered throughout Nouakchott and many were in a state of severe disrepair or were
inadequately equipped. Overcrowding was common and conditions were, in many cases,
unsafe. Library facilities were nonexistent and there were few laboratories.




46
   In the main text of the PAD, this is described a little bit differently with the PDO to: (i) improve the quality of
the learning environment and the relevance of courses to the labor market; and (ii) establish pedagogic,
administrative, and financial management systems in the IHEs. The PDO in the Results Framwork and
Monitoring Annex (Annex 3 of the PAD) states only one portion of the PDO “(to) improve quality and relevance
of higher education to the labor market”.
47
   The main text of the PAD presents these two indicators. However, the Results Framework includes only one
PDO-level indicator. See further description of indicators below.

                                                         35
4.    The PDO remained constant over the life of the Project while the PDO- and intermediate-
level indicators varied across project documents (including PSRs and ISRs). 48 Changes were
introduced to the Results Framework in the second and third restructurings in 2012 and 2013,
respectively. These changes are described in detail below (and a table showing evolution of
indicators over the Project life can be found in Annex 10).

5.    Under the 2012 Restructuring, the project closing date was extended 19 months and a
number of changes were made to the PDO-level indicators. A 19-month extension was
requested, rather than a shorter extension, as this would provide adequate time for a number of
key activities to be completed (e.g., civil works, reform process, development of institutional
plans and performance contracts). First, the original PDO-level indicator measuring the
proportion of students in occupationally-oriented programs was revised to “[proportion of]
students in professional programs” and another PDO-level indicator was added: (ii) [proportion
of] students enrolled in science & technology (S&T). The second PDO-level indicator
included in the main text of the PAD (“pedagogic, administrative, and financial management
systems are operational by 2008”) was not indicated as a PDO-level indicator in the 2012
restructuring paper. However, under the 2012 (second) restructuring, a number of PDO-level
indicators were added to the RF, including: (iii) number of public IHEs have transformed their
programs into Licence, Master’s and Doctorate (LMD) programs; (iv) the Higher Education
Law approved and all ministerial decrees issued; (v) university faculties having participated in
twinning are accredited; (vi) number of faculty (teaching) staff meeting minimum
qualifications; and (vii) number of project beneficiaries (proportion female). In addition, a few
PDO-level indicators were informally adjusted at this time but had not been formally included
in the PAD, DCA, or the in the 2009 Restructuring documents. These included: (viii)
proportion of students repeating in IHE not enrolled in LMD; and (ix) students employed six
months after graduation.

6.    A number of intermediate-level indicators were also dropped, revised, or added in the RF
under the 2012 Restructuring. Those indicators that were dropped included (i-iii) indicators
related to the hiring and training of staff for University Administrative Center, Distance
Learning Center and Central Library. An indicator on the (iv) establishment of a management
information system (MIS) to support pedagogic, administrative and financial autonomy was
indicated as dropped, however, it was not an indicator in the original documentation or the
2009 restructuring paper but a sub-component title in the PAD. The following intermediate-
level indicators were revised: the indicator which measured the number of professional
programs introduced and general programs upgraded (renewed) was disaggregated into: (a)
number of general programs converted into professional programs after introduction of LMD;
and (b) number of professional programs started. In addition, (c) the indicator for “at least 100
faculty trained by 2009” was modified to “at least 100 faculty trained”; (d) the indicator for “an
ICT network installed and used by 2008/2009” was modified to “an ICT network installed and
used”; (e) the indicator measuring the “proportion of students using internet- and computer-
assisted instructional material at the University reaches at least 25 percent by 2008/2009” was
modified to exclude the date and value (though it was not indicated as revised); (f, g, h)
indicators related to construction of civil works (University Administrative Center, Distance
Learning Center and Central Library) were revised to be “completed” rather than “completed
by and/or operational by” a specific date. Finally, (i) the indicator “at least 50 percent of new


48
   The number of indicators reported in the ISRs varied across the project life from one PDO-level and one
intermediate-level indicator in the first project status report (PSR) to 11 PDO-level and 19 intermediate-level
indicators in the last three ISRs (with the sixteenth ISR (of a total of 20 ISRs) reporting only on one indicator
(PDO-level).

                                                       36
programs have modules for distance learning in 2008/2009” was revised to “university
departments having participated in twinning programs include distance learning modules in
their courses.”

7.    In terms of Component 2 indicators (in addition to dropping the indicators related to the
construction of the university administrative center and training of its staff, as described above),
a number of additional changes were introduced: (i) the indicator on “institutional development
plans established by 2006 and performance contracts with the Government implemented by
2007” was disaggregated into two separate indicators – “performance contracts with
Government implemented by 2007” and “institutional development plans are in place” (this
was included as a PDO-level indicator in the restructuring paper, even though it is more of an
output measure). In addition, an indicator “transfer of autonomy to the University (budgets,
programs, administrative personnel” was added to the RF. A number of indicators were also
revised: (i) “structures responsible for pedagogic autonomy are created and trained in at least 9
IHEs in 2008/2009” was revised to “Committees in charge of pedagogic autonomy are
established in 9 public IHEs in 2008/2009”; (ii) the indicator “at least 3 IHDs generate
financial resources in 2008/2009 was revised to “Out of the 9 IHEs, at least 3 have generated
financial resources in 2008/2009 and 5 in 2011”. Small revisions were made to the indicators
on: (i) the quality assurance system (though still indicated that it would be launched in 2005,
the indicator specified that the procedures and tools would be operational in 2007 rather than in
2006/2007); (ii) the indicator “financial and accounting reports, student tracer studies, plans of
operations produced and audited in 2007/2008 was modified to indicate that this would be
“Based on MIS”.

8.    Under the 2013 restructuring, no changes were made to the PDO-level indicators.
However, a number of changes were made to the intermediate-level indicators. All
intermediate-level indicators related to civil works planned under the Project were dropped,
including: (i-iii) the construction of the Central Library, Distance Learning Center and
University Administrative Center is completed; and (iv) educational facilities built or
rehabilitated (this was also considered redundant). The indicator, (v) “university departments
having participated in twinning programs including distance learning modules in their courses”
was also dropped. In addition, the following indicators were absent from the RF: (vi)
“Proportion of students using internet and computer-assisted instructional material at the
university”; and (vii) “Based on MIS, financial and accounting reports, student tracer study
reports, plans of operations produced and audited in 2007/2008.”

9.    In addition to limited consistency of indicators across project documentation at appraisal,
indicators tracked in ISRs over the project life varied widely and were not necessarily
consistent with either the PAD or DCA. As description above, the RF has a number of
inconsistencies with some indicators: (i) listed as original, revised or dropped but not included
in the original project documentation (PAD or DCA); (ii) revised but not listed as revised;
and/or (iii) listed as a different level of indicator. These modifications and inconsistencies are
observed in the tables below and are presented in detail in Annex 10. These inconsistencies
made monitoring and tracking progress difficult both under the Project and in the end-of-
project evaluation.

10. The following section provides an overview of achievements by Component. Rather
than re-establishing the baseline values of the time of the restructurings in 2012 and 2013, the
Project team used the values from 2003/2004 as the baseline values. The team’s justification
for doing this rested on the assumption that the introduction of the indicators was meant to

effectively document and analyze what the Project had actually accomplishment since its
inception.

Component 1: Quality and Relevance of Higher Education

11. This Component aimed to support improvements in the quality and relevance of higher
education. The Component had three sub-components: (i) Program renewal, faculty upgrading
and accreditation (Sub-Component 1.1); (ii) Construction of a modern central library and
distance learning center (Sub-Component 1.2); and (iii) Use of ICT in teaching, learning and
research (Sub-Component 1.3). This Component was allocated the largest portion of funding
under the Project, with Sub-Component 1.2 allocated the largest portion of funding of the
Component’s three sub-components.

12. To achieve the aims of Sub-Component 1.1, the Project would support the renovation
(upgrading) and development of new and more relevant academic programs and curricula that
would respond to the needs of employers with an emphasis on strengthening the applied
aspects of academic subjects. This meant allowing more time for laboratory work, independent
study, and group projects and included the introduction of new courses. Support under this
Sub-component for training of staff and faculty would draw on a consortium of universities and
research and training institutions under “twinning” arrangements which would facilitate the
transfer of skills and programs and foster interfaculty cooperation and mentoring. This
consortium would also assist the faculty in implementing the accreditation process in addition
to providing training in self-evaluation techniques.         Under Sub-Component 1.2, the
construction and equipment of the central library and distance learning center would also be
financed – so as to become focal points for internet access and university-wide distribution of
information with the Sub-component also supporting the provision of training to faculty and
students in the use of library and electronic resources. Sub-Component 1.3 would finance:
equipment, software and systems upgrading for development of high speed internet access and
for a system-wide intranet, giving faculty and students access to the latest knowledge in their
field, to accredited course materials including distance learning modules and to electronic
periodicals in various subjects. It would also finance training of faculty and students in basic
IT skills.

13. Specifically, this Component planned to support achievement of the following: (i)
establishment of new occupationally-oriented [professional] programs; (iii) upgrading
(renewal) of general programs; (iv) training of teachers in partner universities; (v) increase in
the number of senior lecturers; (vi) installation and use of an ICT network and system used by
teachers and researchers; (vii) use of internet and computer-assisted instructional material by
students; (viii) construction of a Central Library; (ix) training of staff for the library [and
beginning work]; (x) construction of a Distance Learning Center; (xi) training of staff for the
Distance Learning Center [and beginning work]; and (xii) the use of distance learning modules
in the courses taught by universities participating in twinning programs.

14. Achievements under Component 1 are highlighted in Tables 1A and 1B below which
shows progress made on each of the PDO-level and intermediate level indicators specified
under the Project.

 15. Progress made in achievement of the PDO-level indicators which focused largely on
 quality and relevance of learning, by the end of the Project was the following: (i) students
 enrolled in science and technology reached 25.5 percent (exceeding the end-of-project target of
 12 percent); (ii) students in professional programs reached 22.5 percent (exceeding the end-of-
 project target of 12 percent); (iv) three university departments (including 379 faculty) in the
 University of Nouakchott participated in twinning arrangements in France, Morocco and
 Canada (though these were not accredited and therefore the end-of-project target was not
 met)49; (v) the number of faculty (teaching) staff meeting minimum qualifications was 619
 (exceeding the end-of-project target of 400); (vi) the proportion of students repeating in IHE
 not enrolled in LMD decreased to 10 percent (exceeding the end of project target of 25 percent,
 though these data cannot be validated in the absence of a robust M&E system and an integrated
 MIS); and (vii) the percentage of students employed six months after graduation reached 50
 percent (again exceeding the end-of-project target of 40 percent, though this figure refers only
 to one institutions (USTM) and the figure cannot be validated in the absence of a tracer study).
 The number of project beneficiaries (and the percentage of female beneficiaries) reached
 22,693 (and 31 percent)—exceeding the end of project target of 16,000 beneficiaries but

   Since these were not accredited, the end-of-project target for three university departments to participate was not
 achieved.

missing the end of project target of 34 percent female beneficiaries. As shown in Tables 1A
and 1B, a number of important activities have been implemented and outcomes achieved
related to Component 1.

16. Progress made in achievement of intermediate-level indicators under Component 1 by
the end of the Project was the following: (i) the number of senior lecturers trained reached 235
(exceeding the end-of-project target of 65); (ii) the number of faculty trained reached 200
(exceeding the target of 100); (iii) a total of 34 programs were renewed (upgraded) and 29
professional programs were begun (far exceeding the original target of 17) 50 ; and (iv)
university departments having participated in twinning programs (total of 3) included distance
learning modules in their courses. 51 However, (i) an ICT network was not installed/used
(though computers were purchased and wiring installed in the old campus); and (ii-iiii) the
construction of the Distance Learning Center and Central Library were only partially
completed (not achieving end-of-project target of fully completed).

17. Many activities and achievements under this Component have had an important and
positive impact on the quality and relevance of higher education in Mauritania. As a result of
the twinning arrangements, professors from these foreign universities have traveled to
Nouakchott and worked with the Mauritanian faculty in the development of the LMD approach.
The University has experienced improvements in the quality of programs in the areas of law,
economics, science, and economics (though the institutional settings necessary for the
accreditation of the new professional courses have been developed, they are still awaiting
official approval before accreditation of the courses could start). Further, as a result of training
and internships under the Project, there was a threefold increase in the number of qualified
senior lecturers and almost a twofold increase in the number of qualified faculty members. In
addition, with the number of programs begun (29 professional programs) and upgraded (34
general academic programs) (this included: the adoption of curriculum adhering to the LMD
structure, establishment of research groups, the concept and development of doctoral training
with research focus). Students now have greater flexibility in choosing a career path. Further,
the LMD programs now exist in all four of the targeted university departments. Though
distance education and library staff training was not provided under the Project, it will be
undertaken with support from the Kuwaiti Fund. 52

18. Project achievements which aimed to improve the learning environment in higher
education were more limited. As a result of significant and persistent delays in civil works
activities, the structures envisaged under the Project were only partially constructed. These
works figured prominently in the PAD as well as the first and second restructuring papers since
they were considered instrumental in achieving the PDO since they were strongly tied to the
constraints facing the sub-sector when the Project was conceived. In addition to their non-
completion, a large number of other important activities were also abandoned or only
completed in part (e.g., use of ICT equipment for teaching, learning and research; training of
library staff, etc).


50
   This indicator was not tracked following the 2012 restructuring, but rather the number of professional programs
having been established or upgraded was tracked.
51
   Though the target was not specified correctly in the 2012 restructuring paper with the error carried over into the
last ISR, it appears that the target value could not have exceeded three – as these were the envisioned number of
university departments having participated in twinning programs.
52
   During the first phase of the project – the Government adopted a number of legal texts related to national and
international scholarships, defining the role of teacher/researcher, the creation of the organization ISET and
ISCAE, creation of national centre of university works, etc.

 Component 2: Institutional Development
 19. The objective of this Component was to support the implementation of the new policy
 framework for higher education. The main thrust of the reform was the transfer of autonomy
 to the University and other IHEs in strategic goal setting, budgets, instructional programs and
 personnel management. The IHEs would require these institutions to manage performance
 contracts negotiated with the Government, along with indicators which would provide the basis
 for continued financing for the Government. These IHEs would also be able to generate
 revenue through tuition fees for occupationally oriented (professional) courses as well as
 through training and consulting services.

 20. The component was comprised of three sub-components: (i) Staff development
 (managerial and administrative) (Sub-Component 2.1); (ii) Pedagogic, Administrative and
 Financial Management Systems (Sub-Component 2.2); and (iii) University Administrative
 Center (Sub-Component 2.3). To achieve the aims under Sub-Component 2.1, the following
 activities would be supported: (i) staff development for managerial and administrative staff in
 the areas of planning, student services, financial and personnel management with high priority
 given to the development of new leaders. Under Sub-Component 2.2, the following activities
 would be supported: (i) the establishment of, and related training for, an integrated
 management information system (MIS) that would include admissions and scholarships,
 student records, financial management (FM) and inventories for physical plant and equipment.
 The Sub-component would finance the adaptation or design and development of systems,
 related technical support services and user training. It would also fund the establishment of a
 quality assurance system covering pedagogic, financial and administrative functions coherent
 with international norms to include different mechanisms for M&E. Sub-Component 2.3; to
 achieve its aims, the Project would finance: the creation of a university administrative center
 (financing its construction and the purchase and installation of necessary equipment) and (iii)
 the construction and equipment of a new university administrative center that would have
 strong ICT capabilities (video-conferencing, servers, data storage, etc.) The largest portion of
 funding under this Component was allocated to the construction of the University
 Administrative Center.

 21. Progress made in achievement of the PDO-level indicators which focused largely on
 institutional development under Component 2 included four public IHEs had transformed their
 programs into LMD programs (missing the end-of-project target); and the Higher Education
 Law was approved and all ministerial decrees issued (achieving end-of-project target).

     22. Under Component 2, the status of achievement of intermediate-level indicator targets is:
     (i) committees for pedagogic autonomy were created and trained in nine IHEs in 2008/2009
     (achieving the end-of-project target); and (ii) of the 9 IHEs, three generated financial resources
     in 2008/2009 and 5 in 2011 (also achieving the end-of-project target). At the same time; (i)
     institutional development plans are not in place. However, a model IDP – the basis of which
     each IHE will prepare its own institution specific IDP – has been approved and is being used
     on an ad hoc basis; (ii) transfer of autonomy to the University (budgets, programs and
     administrative personnel) was not fully achieved (as autonomy in hiring of permanent
     university staff has not been transferred to the university); (iv) development of procedural
     manuals for administrative autonomy were not approved and did not become operational under
     the project; (vi) a quality assurance system was partially launched which included tools and
     procedures (this not achieving end-of-project target); (vii) and an integrated MIS for student
     services, finance, human resources, planning and monitoring was not established though there
     are separate systems and an integrated system is being piloted in one location 53; (viii) financial
     and accounting reports, student tracer study reports, and plan of operations based on the MIS
     were not produced and audited under the Project; and (ix) the University Administrative Center
     was not completed.

     23. There were some important achievements under the Project, including: the introduction
     of the LMD structure and the approval of the Higher Education Law and relevant legislative

     greater autonomy of IHEs; (ii) a more favorable environment for the development of the

       For example, the MIS was largely contingent on the completion of the university administrative building and
     procurement of the necessary MIS equipment. Although the investment in development of the integrated MIS has
     yet to bear fruit, the process has revealed the complexity of developing such a system. While the MIS has not
     been developed, the university has developed its own, locally programmed systems for financial management and
     the management of student flows and examinations.

  private sector; (iii) establishment of standards for academic programs; (iv) the setting-up of a
  management body for public IHEs; and (v) clarifying the status and career paths for all
  employees in the sub-sector (i.e., faculty, library staff, directors, etc.) 54 Some additional texts
  (decrees) focused on the organization of scientific research, scholarship programs and the
  introduction of fees for professional programs. Certain regulatory bodies were introduced,
  including the establishment of the National Advisory Board for Higher Education. Despite
  these achievements and progress made on various aspects of institutional development
  (development of a model IDP, etc.), many envisaged targets of the Project were not achieved.
  The poor performance of the civil works activities (e.g., construction of the university
  administrative center) has been a constraint to achieving other component aims in full (without
  budgeting and planning offices, the required equipment could not be procured and an
  integrated MIS could not be set up, though separate systems for FM, student flow, etc. exist
  there is no integrated MIS). 55

     Though this has not yet been achieved, the Government has made progress in this regard working closing with
  AUF to develop a data collection framework and software, and to provide training so that implementation could
  start as soon as the equipment is available. With AUF's support training was also provided on data collection and
  the use of the software for seven staff of the universities.

                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      This annex explores the economic rationale for investment in higher education in
Mauritania and the effectiveness of the Higher Education Project through an analysis of the
macroeconomic framework, external and internal efficiency, and costs. The rate of return to
higher education is also examined. The economic and financial analysis in this ICR draws on
all available data that could be gathered. This includes both Project-specific and sector-wide
data.

2.      The Mauritania Higher Education Project (2003-2013) took place within a context of
broader educational reforms and was based on the four pillars of Mauritania’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which focused on human resource development and
improving access to education and health. The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
(2003-2005) indicated that the Project would assist the Government in implementing the
national education strategy (PNDSE) with an aim to “improve the relevance and external
efficiency of the vocational technical and higher education levels.”

3.      The Project was initially designed to be one component of the larger Education Sector
Development Project (P071308) (2001-2010) which focused on increasing access to basic
education while providing teaching materials. It was decided, however, as a result of
Safeguards requirements that more time would be needed to prepare this Component – and in
order not to delay the ESDP – the Bank decided to finance it as a separate project. The Higher
Education Project overlapped with the ongoing Skills Development Support Project (P118974)
which began in 2011. The Government requested that unspent funds from the Higher
Education Project (nearly 60 percent) be reallocated to the Skills Development Support Project
and this was done just prior to closing in 2013.

4.       The project appraisal document (PAD) emphasizes the two primary goals of the Project,
to: (i) increase the quality of the learning environment and the relevance of the courses to the
labor market; and (ii) strengthen the institutional development framework, through the
establishment of pedagogic, administrative, and financial management (FM) systems. The
PAD does not identify a “primary target [beneficiary] group”. However, the project
beneficiaries included: (i) all university students who benefit from an improved physical and
pedagogical environment and an improved quality and relevance of higher education; (ii)
university teachers and researchers who have benefited from training and improved research
conditions, including twinning arrangements with international universities; and (iii) the
university (as the major institutional beneficiary).

5.       The PAD points out that a formal cost-benefit analysis with a rate-of-return estimate is
difficult given the lack of data on graduates’ employment rates and wages. Instead, it provides
a calculation of opportunity costs, benefits and net return based on salary differentials across
education levels. No assumptions were made about the changes in employment demand and
salaries which might be observed as the oil sector becomes increasingly developed. In addition,
the primary analysis in the PAD relies on a pre- post- comparison of anticipated project
benefits. This approach is somewhat limited, as it lacks a valid counterfactual; that is, a
realistic understanding of what would have happened without the project. This is particularly
relevant given structural changes (for example, investment in extractive industries) that
characterize Mauritania’s economic experience over the past decade. Few labor market studies,
especially those related to higher education, are available. Therefore, the analysis presented
below is based primarily on the Government of Mauritania’s 2010 Rapport d’état sure le


                                               51
système éducatif national (RESEN), which provided the basis of Country Status Report (CSR)
and other World Bank reports. 56

Macroeconomic Framework

6.      Macroeconomic performance was satisfactory for the period from 2003 to 2013 despite
variability. Growth rose in the early part of the decade, hitting a high of 18.9 percent in 2006
before falling to below regional averages for several years due to technical difficulties related
to oil exploitations, the global economic recession and political instability (the country suffered
a coup d’état in August 2008, after which the World Bank suspended its operations for 15
months). During this time, the non-oil sector experienced increases of 4.1 percent in 2006 and
5.9 percent in 2007, yet rising consumer prices related to food prices triggered social unrest in
2008.

                                Figure 1: GDP Growth (annual %)

7.     This high growth period coincided with an annual 11 percent rise (on average) in net
foreign direct investment (FDI) as a percentage of GDP (with peaks of 37 percent in 2005 and
29 percent in 2012). Mineral rents also grew steadily as a percentage of output from 10 percent
in 2003 to 47 percent in 2012 (an average of 29 percent). The country’s largest gold mine
began operating in mid-2007 with an investment of US$80 million, followed by an additional
investment of US$50 million in 2009 57.

Labor Market

8.      The most recent and reliable labor market figures come from the 2004 National
Household Survey, which was analyzed in World Bank Policy Research Paper (No. 4954) 58.
The report notes low overall rates of labor market participation (50.7 percent, versus 70 to 85
percent in neighboring countries). While poor and non-poor people are equally likely to work,
women are largely absent from the labor market (72 percent do not work outside of the home).
Non-participation is particularly high among young people, even those who are not in school.
More than one-half of youth age 15 to 24 remain outside the labor force – a trend that persists
in the group aged 25 to 34. Those with a higher education are generally more likely to
participate in the labor force and to be employed – the only exception is that 25-34 year olds

   A more recent household survey was conducted in 2012-13, but labor market analysis is not yet available

with no education typically work more than their educated peers. One of the primary aims of
The Higher Education Project was to address the slow entry of graduates into the workplace.

                  Source: RESEN (2010)

9.      At the time of project preparation, the labor market was characterized by a low quality
of labor and a mismatch between the profiles and the skills of those entering the market and the
skills needed by a rapidly diversifying economy. Many young Mauritanians entered the labor
market lacking marketable skills. This was illustrated in the 2006 World Bank Enterprise
Survey which found that 3.9 percent of the 237 firms identified ‘skills and education of
workers’ as the main obstacle to business. Among large firms (100 employees or more), this
figure rose to 19.8 percent, making it the second most important factor influencing business
success (behind access to finance). In manufacturing, one in three firms rated skills as a severe
obstacle to growth. The World Bank 2010 Country Economic Memorandum (based on analysis
from the 2006 Investment Climate Survey) found that this mismatch was most notable in
technologically-advanced, open and innovative firms where there existed significant demand
for those trained in engineering, accounting, mechanics, architecture and agronomy, rather than
the traditional concentrations of higher education such as law, geography and economics.

10.     Based on these data and analysis, the project goals of tailoring teaching to meet labor
market goals and improving the quality of instruction were – and continue to be – Highly
Relevant. Course offerings in occupational areas and the sciences and technology grew over
the project period. This observed trend is directly linked to the interventions supported under
this operation.

Efficiency Analysis

External efficiency

11.    Data from the EPCV 2004 provides evidence of the positive impact of investment in
education in Mauritania 59. The table below also illustrates the relationship between average
wage earnings by level of education and gender.

12.     The total and marginal returns to education provide a strong economic justification for
public investment in higher education and administrative capacity-building within the sub-
sector. A male worker with higher education earns on average 37 percent more than his male
counterpart who only attended secondary school. The gender gap in earnings is also significant.
Females earn 40 percent less than males with similar levels of education. Regression analyses
controlling for other important individual characteristics (e.g., sector, region and rural/urban)
show that, on average, relative to “no education”, higher education increases wages by 61.5
percent versus 24.4 percent for secondary and 5.2 percent for primary (RESEN). The World
Bank 2010 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) estimates are even higher: the overall
rate-of-return to tertiary education is estimated at 100 percent (111 percent in the private and
83 percent in the public sector) and as high as 128 percent and 137 percent for graduate
degrees in the manufacturing and construction sectors, respectively. 60

13.     Figures used in the economic and financial analysis in the PAD are slightly different,
but fall within the two other estimates: the earnings differential between incomplete university
studies and completed secondary school presented was 48.8 percent with completion of
university studies adding another 24.8 percent. Further, projections in the PAD (taking
opportunity costs into account) of 30-year salary differentials between university leavers (with
or without diplomas) found an 86 percent benefit for university graduates and a 64 percent gain
for those leaving with no degree 61.

14.     The University of Nouakchott enrolled more than 12,000 students in 2007-2008, up
from 8,567 in 2003-2004, with the greatest number entering the faculties of Technical Science
(1,162), Social Science (3,370) and Legal Sciences and Economy (7,065). There is no reporting
on the breakdown of these figures between two- and four-year programs or information
pertaining to the location of the new occupationally-oriented courses. The results indicators
indicate that over 29 new occupations programs were created and 34 general programs were
converted into occupational programs after the introduction of LMD.




60
   Although the report uses the term “returns to education,” the dependent variable in the regression is log of
annual wages. The results should not be interpreted as a rate of return on investment.
61
   The difference in wage differential results from methodological approach and the limitations of available data.
For example, RESEN notes that the EPCV (2004) data excludes daily or weekly (rather than monthly) earnings,
which may lead to underestimates of earnings in the self-employed sector. There is also confusion about net salary.
The PAD reports average annual income of UM 487,000 (US$ 1,600 approximately) for higher education, but
later changes the label to monthly salary. Given that RESEN cites an average monthly rate of UM 56,100 for the
same group and the average GDP per capita is currently around US$ 1,100, the later seems more likely. A 64
percent gain is noted for those with incomplete university education. The basis for this calculation is unclear, but
seems to be one without a formal education.

                                                        54
15.      Rates of return in the PAD are based on two different estimates of graduate
unemployment; one founded on past experience, the other on projections of a “better fit” with
the labor market. Reliable data on the exact number of graduates, their earnings, and costs
(both public and private) are unavailable; it is therefore difficult to establish a valid
counterfactual and otherwise extend this analysis. This is particularly true given the need to
differentiate between the return to traditional degrees (such as law, economics and the
humanities) and the new, occupationally-oriented programs (notably, the two-year programs).
It is also relevant in the sense that the program focused on the quality of education, rather than
just enrollment or even graduation rates. The assessment is thus based on the data that are
available.

Internal efficiency

16.     A key element of the project was to increase the quality of higher education along with
its relevance of course offerings to the labor market needs. After an initial decline, access to
tertiary education increased from 2003-2011 (although it remains below levels seen in other
areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, as evident below). This is also true to a lesser extent in the case of
female enrollment.

                       Figure 2: School enrollment, tertiary (% gross)




                      Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators (2014)

17.     Enrollment data disaggregated by IHE are still not readily available or produced on a
regular basis (in the form of a statistical yearbook, for example). The best estimates are from
2008 and even they lack critical information on internal indicators such as students repeating
courses and retention rate on an aggregate level – not to mention for the individual programs or
the type of occupational courses. Although this was recognized as an issue during project
preparation, it was never adequately addressed during the Project life since the integrated MIS
to be created and supported under the Project did not materialize in full. Further effort is
needed to ensure that this system is fully developed to guide policy decisions within the
broader education sector in Mauritania.




                                                 55

                          Source: RESEN (2010)

18.     The project indicators show that the proportion of students in occupationally-oriented
programs rose from 7 to 22.5 percent, while those in the sciences and technology (S&T)
increased from 7 percent to 25.5 percent. This is not entirely evident in early statistics from
RESEN, where overall enrollment increases during the period 2001-07 can be traced largely to
the Faculty of Legal Sciences and Economics and Islamic Studies. Either the growth in the
sciences and technology courses took place later, or the courses are located within different
departments (such as FLSH, for example). Again, the lack of accurate program and course-
level enrollment data hampers analysis in this area.

19.     The proportion of students repeating in IHE not enrolled in LMD fell from 32.6 percent
to 10 percent (though in absence of a robust M&E system, this figure cannot be cross-checked).
In addition, the results show that four new LMD programs were established. These are signs of
positive performance, though more detailed data are needed to assess other trends in internal
efficiency and to assess the linkages between teacher qualifications, equipment, training and
program design on repetition and program quality.

Cost Effectiveness and Efficiency of Implementation

20.        The Higher Education Project focused on the following two components:

     (i)   Quality and Relevance of education, notably the modernization of course offerings,
           which included developing professional “twinning” relationships with other universities,
           management and administrative reforms, the construction of new buildings, and
           expansion of on-campus internet availability; and
 (ii)      Institutional Development designed to support a reform aimed mainly at transferring
           autonomy to the university, establishment of an integrated MIS and administrative staff
           development.

21.      Efficiency of Implementation. Despite delays at various points, the activities related to
institutional development including the introduction of LMD programs, training of faculty and
staff and provision of internship opportunities, among others, were well implemented and
showed notable progress under the Project. Though there were delays in the adoption of the

  Faculty of Social Sciences and Arts / Faculté des Lettres et des Sciences Humaines (FLSH); Faculty of Legal
Sciences and Economics /Faculté des Sciences Juridique et Economiques (FSJE); Faculty of Medicine (FMED);

and Research, Institut Supérieur d’Etudes et de Recherche Islamiques (ISERI); L'Ecole Normale Superieure
(ENS).

                                                      56
Higher Education Law and relevant decrees in the first phase of the Project, the needed
legislation was ultimately enacted and adopted. These legislative reforms were a major
achievement under the Project and have provided the framework for further improvements in
the quality and relevance of higher education in Mauritania. Despite these significant
accomplishments, the implementation of major civil works activities was delayed and
ultimately Bank funding for these activities was cancelled (University Administrative Center,
Central Library and Distance Learning Center). Further, an integrated MIS was not established
during the project life. Though these activities were not completed under the Project, the
Government agreed to support their continuation and completion with its own resources during
the post-project period. Moreover, the Government was able to leverage IDA assistance to
attract funding (worth approximately US$100 million) from other major donors including
AfDB, IDB, and the Governments of China and Kuwait.

22.     Cost-effectiveness of Twinning Arrangements. Twinning partnerships were an
important part of the reform strategy. Three foreign universities provided support and training
(Humanities and Social Sciences in Morocco; Law and Economics in France; and S&T in
Canada). These relationships were reported to have had a significant impact on the program’s
successes, both directly (in providing guidance on planning and pedagogy for LMD programs)
and indirectly (in providing leadership and encouragement beyond the terms of the initial
contact). This success was achieved at a reasonable cost and implemented in ways that led to
cost savings. The proposed budget for the three partnerships, which included training for 379
faculty members, was US$ 1.0 million. Although actual spending by sub-component is not
available, an audit showed that a single partnership cost US$ 0.32 million – just within the
US$1.0 million budget for this activity. Grouping services (TA, training, study visits and
scientific exchanges), rather than contracting for each individually, helped to drive down
expenses. Given the specific nature of these arrangements and the novelty of twinning in
higher education, it is not possible to compare them to other outside partnerships programs.

23.      Beginning in 2009, funding was reallocated towards civil works. Consequently, actual
Operating Costs were substantially lower than those anticipated at appraisal (SDR 158,349
versus SDR 680,000), as were Training and Consulting Services & Audits. The ratio of
Operating Costs to total disbursements also fell during this time from 6.8 percent to 3 percent.
In this sense, the project can be seen as having been managed efficiently. It is important to note
that these operating costs were linked to the overall management of the Project and were not
for civil work activities. The awarded civil works contracts included budget lines to cover
operating costs and, therefore, the reduction in operation costs observed under the Project
suggests that some efficiency gains were realized.

24.      Cost-effectiveness of construction. Civil works contracts were awarded through a
competitive bidding process, with greater consideration given to cost than quality. As a result,
suppliers were often poorly equipped to meet deadlines. Delays coincided with rising material
costs and impacted other project components, such as the development of distance learning
programs and the training of library staff, which were ultimately canceled. In this sense, the
construction components, despite their initial focus on containing costs, were inefficient and
remained incomplete at project closing. At the same time, however, the Project galvanized
interest in the higher education sector on the part of the Government and other donors. After
the Project closed, the Government agreed to finance the completion of the civil works
activities (with a new firm), a clear indicator of its commitment to and ownership of the project.
Other donors also entered the sector with a significant level of investments (on the order of
US$ 100 million).


                                               57
Sustainability

25.     Key reforms, including the establishment of the LMD system, autonomy of IHEs, and
the standardization and/or upgrading of academic programs laid the groundwork for continued
improvement in this sector. Coordination and investment by the Government and development
partners has increased and shows much promise for the future. Overall, these changes are likely
to have a positive long-term impact on the way in which the higher education sub- sector
functions and grows.

26.    In light of the above, efficiency is rated Modest.

      Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.    The original document — the Borrower’s ICR — is 46 pages long and in French. It
includes six annexes:

       (i)     Details on project procurement activities and commitments/expenditures as of
       December 31, 2013.
       (ii)    Details on all project-financed training activities
       (iii) Higher education statistics
       (iv)    Four photographs of the buildings under construction (date not specified)
       (v)     Details on project financing; the financing schedules taken from the
       Development Credit Agreement, the 2010 reallocation, and the 2013 restructuring
       (vi)    The recommendations of the “audit” of the civil works which led to the
       restructuring

2.    The following is a summary of the main text of the Borrower’s ICR. The full report has
been archived in the Bank’s archiving system (WBDocs).

3.   Project objectives were clear and relevant for Mauritania. The demand for formal
education increased rapidly, with a gross enrollment rate in basic education going from 40% to
85.6% in 15 years and the admission rate in the first year of basic education increasing from
78% in 1991/92 to 93% in 1998/99. Upwards pressures on secondary and higher education
grew accordingly.

4.   The situation with higher education and training at the time this project was appraised
(2003-04) could be characterized as follows:
   • Low quality and relevance: course contents were out of line with international norms;
       there was little practical work in the curriculum; lack of decent library resources meant
       that students relied on course materials; internet access was rare; teachers lacked
       pedagogical training and had almost no opportunities for professional development; and
       there was little-to-no articulation with the world of work.
   • The physical environment was seriously degraded: there was no central campus;
       buildings were spread over Nouakchott and most were seriously dilapidated; library
       facilities were almost inexistent; there were very few laboratories; and all but two
       institutions (ENS, ENA) were using facilities built for other purposes.

5.   For these reasons, higher education was a priority in the ten year education development
program (PNDSE) adopted in 2001.

6.  Project components are summarized with associated budgets, followed by the following
comments on the project’s consistency:
   • The project design, its mix of investments and accompanying measures, was relevant to
     the intended objectives;
   • The weight given to improving quality (80% of the project’s costs), particularly
     construction and equipment of the library and the DLC (77% of the component’s cost)
     was appropriate;
   • The weight given to institutional development was also appropriate. Although not a
     large cost to the project, the measures associated with this component had strategic
     importance. The administration building (50% of the component’s costs) was justified


                                              63
         given the need for modern administrative infrastructure and to complement the
         investments of other DPs in university infrastructure.
     •   Note that civil works amounted to 42% of total project costs. However, the underlying
         architectural plans were financed by another IDA project. The question should be
         asked if this approach was a potential risk, insufficiently taken into account when the
         project’s design stage.

7.   Project costs and financing. Total project costs amounted to 10,200,000 SDR, or
1,819,215,609 MRO. IDA covered 95.68% of costs; Government 4.32%. In order to take into
account price increases of building materials, there was a reallocation within the project’s
budget without affecting the total cost. In October 2012 part of the financing was canceled
upon Government’s request in order to improve its IDA portfolio and transfer the canceled
funds to the technical and vocational training sub-sector. The following table shows these
budgetary changes.

8.      Incidents during implementation. Five incidents are specified:
     (i)    Delays due to those of the architectural plans/studies which were financed by
      another IDA project.
     (ii) Regime change following the 2008 coup d’état, which led to suspension of project
      financing for more than one year. Because of this, tenders for civil works were launched
      in December 2009, five years after credit effectiveness and six months before the original
      project closing date. As a result, the closing date was extended to March 31, 2102.
     (iii) The weak capacities of the firm that was awarded the construction contract led to
      further delays. Five months before the new closing date, construction was estimated at
      20% for the library, 7% for the administration building, and 3% for the distance learning
      center. This led to a new closing date of October 31, 2013. In addition to its weak
      capacities, the contracting firm had bid a price that was much too low, thereby having a
      negative effect on its implementation capacities.
     (iv) Canceling of the credits for civil works following an audit commissioned by the
      World Bank that was performed in August 2012. This audit ascertained that completion of
      the civil works would be impossible by the end of the project and proposed several
      scenarios, one of which was retained by Government and the World Bank and led to the
      restructuring.
     (v) A consequence of the initial delays in launching the civil works tenders was the
      increase in the costs of building materials, which led to a reallocation of the budget. Civil


                                                64
      works were increased by more than 60% which entailed reductions for equipment (25%),
      operational costs (13%) and unallocated (22%).

9.    Project results. Even though the realization of project outputs appears to be mixed, they
could be seen as rather satisfactory given the success of institutional and pedagogical reforms.
Clearly, not all planned activities have been fully implemented, However, Government is
committed to financing the completion of these activities whose implementation appears to be
moving forward (estimated at 55% as of January 2013).

10. Activities other than civil works have been satisfactorily implemented. This is
particularly the case for the renewal (upgrading) of course programs associated with LMD
which benefitted from the twinning arrangements.

11. The project had an important ripple effect on the development of higher education thanks
to its contribution to institutional development which led to the mobilization of other DP
financing (BID, Saudi and Kuwaiti funds, China) which amounted to around US$100 million.
This way, in addition to its direct outputs, the project contributed to attaining:
    • Creation of the new campus, which includes three faculties and dormitories;
    • A regulatory framework which gave rise to: (i) autonomy, which means that university
        presidents, deans and department heads are elected transparently; (ii) application of the
        LMD reform; (iii) creation of the National Council for Higher Education; and (iv)
        adoption of a dedicated status for teachers in higher education.

12. This progress is sustainable. There is, nonetheless, a possibility that these gains could be
eroded if Government does not take measures to capitalize and sustain these advances.

13.       Component 1 results are as follows:
      •    Objectives related to curriculum development have been attained. Thanks to the
           twinning arrangements with LMD universities, the project supported the creation of 26
           occupationally-oriented programs and the upgrading (renewal) of 47 general course
           programs. The Faculties of Science and Technology, Letters and Humanities and Law
           benefited from the twinning. In addition, the twinning arrangements yielded the
           following results: curriculum restructuring based on an LMD system; creation of a
           master’s program in research; research structures; doctoral programs linked to future
           research units.
      •    The new or upgraded programs received didactic materials, including laboratory
           equipment.
      •    100 teachers were trained, 96 of whom in overseas’ universities.
      •    Even though credits for the DLC were canceled, the project did contribute to greater
           use of ICT in higher education. WiFi has been installed through the university and
           students and teachers now can connect to the university’s web site. The library has set
           up a computer room for students.
      •    The Francophone University Agency (Agence Universitaire pour la francophonie) also
           contributed to availability of ICT.
      •    Even though reliable data are not available, it is estimated that almost all students are
           using ICT.

14.    Component 2 results are as follows:
      • Study tours for 20 staff to the USA, Canada, France, Senegal, Belgium and Burkina
        Faso

                                                  65
   •   Concerning the integrated MIS, the university chose the program “ScolariX” which is
       used in numerous francophone universities. However, it turned out to be poorly
       adapted for Mauritania’s bilingual (Arab, French) context. The University has
       contracted with a French firm to adapt and install the program which is currently being
       piloted.
   •   The administration building has been canceled from the project. Government has taken
       over its financing. Construction is proceeding more or less satisfactorily.

15. It is important to stress that in spite of the poor performance of the physical aspects of the
project, institutional results are highly satisfactory and go beyond expected objectives.
Outcomes include the 2010 law on higher education and adoption of formal norms concerning
all aspects of university governance and operations. This enabled the establishment of a robust
regulatory framework and strengthening of autonomy.

16. However, the performance contracts have not been systemized and operational
procedures for quality assurance have yet to be set up. Nonetheless, financial reports are
produced and verified and the ministry is working with the International Institute for
Educational Planning on quality assurance.

17. The project also provides support to the DPEF, picking up the salaries of three
consultants.

18. Important modifications in the project concerned its initial coherence and design. In spite
of its mixed results, there are reasons to be satisfied. Civil works were not completed and
Government took over these aspects of the project. Interventions concerning curricula
performed beyond expectations. The modern legal framework for the institutional aspects
brought the university up to international norms. Nonetheless, several objectives were not
realized, notably the performance contracts.

19. However, overall timing shows a delay of 3 years and 4 months. The project lasted 9
years and 1 month instead of 5 years and 9 months. The project was extended twice for a total
of 40 months. These delays caused substantial cost increases for civil works that had no
impact on total project costs. Large savings resulted from the cancelation of civil works.

20. Procurement. Selection of consultants, suppliers and firms took place according to the
procedures stipulated in the credit agreement. Six consultant contracts were implemented on
the basis of short lists approved by IDA. Construction was carried out following international
competitive bidding that led to one contract. All equipment was acquired by open ICB, based
on IDA guidelines; five contracts for books, laboratory material, vehicles for the university,
furniture and equipment were executed. These contracts led to no additional costs.

21. Note that the selection of suppliers and firms was based on the costs of the offers at the
expense of quality. This meant that the lowest cost bid was usually awarded the contract.
However, in Mauritania where the capacities of firms and suppliers are often limited, quality
criteria should be as important as cost criteria.

22. Procurement was executed more or less satisfactorily, with the exception of civil works.
This contract was inclusive (forfaitaire) and did not allow for cost revisions. As a result, the
contractor’s weak capacities along with numerous defects led to stoppages. Great difficulties
in the management of this contract led to the funder’s withdrawal.

          23. Costs. The disbursement rate at the end of the project was 92% of the budget after
          restructuring. All payments have been effected. The unspent part of the budget (8%) was
          mostly for training for library and DLC personnel which was linked to completion of the civil
          works. The following two tables show the budgetary changes and annual disbursements.

          24.      The report then provides an analysis of these two tables.

          25. Borrower’s Performance was moderately satisfactory. Not all activities were realized,
          even with the successive extensions. The DPEF performed its mandate for coordination and
          financial management satisfactorily. The ministries collaborated more or less effectively,
          especially for the twinning. However, measures for monitoring the civil works did not give the
          expected results. Consultants performed satisfactorily and according to their Terms of
          Reference. Suppliers respected their contracts, with the exception of civil works.

          26. IDA performance was satisfactory. Project identification, preparation and appraisal were
          done in reasonable time and focused on national strategic priorities as stated in the PNDSE.
          IDA furnished the support needed for this process. Supervision missions and annual reviews
          took place on a regular basis, an average of two per year. Often, these missions were done
          jointly with other DPs involved in the PNDSE. Each aide-memoire gives the status of project


                                                                                  67
implementation, constraints and recommended solutions. However, missions were suspended
as a result of the 2008 institutional circumstances.

27. One risk was not sufficiently taken into account: that the architectural plans/study was
financed by another IDA project.
28. Project outcomes. Shortcomings notwithstanding, most of the indicators show positive
trends over the life of the Project: (i) proportion of students enrolled in S&T; (ii) proportion of
students in occupationally-oriented programs; (iii) proportion of students employed following
graduation; (iv) number of direct project beneficiaries; (v) number of teaching staff meeting
minimum qualifications; (vi) number of senior lecturers; (vii) teachers trained in partner
universities; (viii) occupational and general programs reformed (upgraded); and (ix) number of
occupational (professional) programs started.

29. As for the binary (yes/no) indicators: the institutional development plan is effective;
autonomy has been transferred to the university (note that the finance ministry creates
permanent positions which transfers the budget to the university with a nomenclature of three
headings: salaries, operations, investment; resources are not fungible between these
categories); the universities create their pedagogical structures (faculties, departments);
financial reports and operational plans are produced and verified.

30. Social impact. Opening of the new campus should bring urban development to its
vicinity and make that zone more attractive. The campus will become increasingly integrated
into the urban fabric of Nouakchott. In the longer term, the new campus should improve the
quality of human capital through improved learning opportunities that it will afford.

31. Conclusions. Several factors outside of Government control had an impact of
implementation: the capacities of the Mauritanian construction firm; price increases; credit
suspension. Factors that were under government control were: delays in the architectural
plans; monitoring the implementation of civil works. The DPEF performed well, but was not
able to get Government to take needed decisions. No particular observations concerning the
credit agreement.

32.     Lessons from implementation. The following lessons are drawn:
      • The project concept was good; objectives were relevant and aligned to government
          priorities as articulated by the PNDSE.
      • The project complemented support from other DPs involved in the PNDSE.
      In spite of the problems, thanks to the extensions, the results are more or less satisfactory
      given the objectives, and Government took over the costs of completing the civil works.
      • The poor performance related to delays meant that the project was dependent on:
          activities not financed by it; unexpected institutional circumstances; and important
          delays in civil works. Future projects need to take these factors into account when
          setting up a project schedule that involves civil works.

33. Inefficiencies during implementation include: delayed start of civil works because of
delays linked to the architectural plans; complexities and delays related to national
procurement procedures when linked to those of the DP; and weak capacities of national
suppliers and contractors.

34.    Recommendations
      • Strengthen pedagogical training for university teachers;


                                                 68
•   Create leverage for the development of research, including continuing partnerships with
    the twinning universities, the development of doctoral programs with the faculty from
    twinning universities, and the creation of centers of excellence in areas of innovation
    for the region;
•   Strengthen administrative personnel concerned with student flow management and
    establishment of administrative twinning arrangements;
•   Improving the skills of technical personnel concerned with maintenance of laboratory
    equipment and technical facilities;
•   Create conditions to ensure improved sustainability of the outcomes, particularly
    ensuring that the university has adequate funds to maintain its infrastructure;
•   Mobilization of financing for the second phase of the science faculty which concerns
    research laboratories for master’s and doctoral programs; architectural studies have
    been completed.
