Some of the key lessons learned are: a) The\n            use of the Adjustable Program Loan should be considered for\n            similar future operations. b) In terms of the Shuikou\n            resettlement, factors which might be replicated elsewhere\n            include: 1) the enlightened policies of central and\n            provincial governments, supplemented by the preferential\n            policies and incentives established by the provincial\n            government in the reservoir area; 2) the strong\n            institutional framework for resettlement; 3) the planning\n            process which commenced well ahead of the project, in\n            consultation with local government down to village level; 4)\n            the open, fair, participatory, and flexible approach adopted\n            during implementation; 5) the flexibility shown by\n            government agencies in adjusting resettlement budgets for\n            inflation, more detailed planning and unforeseen\n            circumstances, and the strong support of Fujian Provincial\n            Electric Power Bureau in obtaining additional funding; and\n            6) the independent evaluation of resettlement, which\n            provided early feedback on the successes and weaknesses of\n            the resettlement process. The report also includes lessons\n            for room of improvement in the process."}, "docdt": "1999-02-17T00:00:00Z"}
