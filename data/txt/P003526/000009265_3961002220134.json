These are: (a) construction of a concrete\n            gravity dam with associated spillway, powerhouse and\n            navigation lock; (b) provision and installation of seven\n            generating sets; (c) environmental management and\n            resettlement of approximatly 67,000 people; and (d)\n            consultancy services for design, procurement and\n            construction management.  In addition, the second-phase\n            project will include: (a) increased capacity of navigation\n            facilities by constructing a shiplock; (b) provision of an\n            automated control system for the Fujian power grid; (c)\n            implementation of an action plan for tariff reform; (d)\n            provision of technical assistance and training for planning,\n            commercial and financial management, and project-related\n            technology and management; and (e) a study to explore\n            hydro-based seasonal energy storage options in the Fujian\n            Province and completion of studies on system planning and operations."}, "docdt": "1992-08-10T00:00:00Z"}
