INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit to the Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$7.5
million on standard IDA terms for a second highway project.
PART I:  THE ECONOMY
2.        A report on the current economic position and prospects of Senegal
was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 10, 1970 (Report AW-15a).
A Bank economic mission visited Senegal in March to assess the current economic
situation and prospects. The following paragraphs reflect the findings of that
mission. Country data are given in Annex I.
Economic Potential
3.        Endowed with few natural resources, Senegal has only limited possi-
bilities for economic development. Ecological conditions are generally poor
particularly in the northern groundnut basin where the bulk of the population
lives. The south and southeast offer better prospects for development of a
varietv of other agricultural products, but Senegal can still be called a
one crop economy, as groundnuts account for the cash income of most of the
rural population and for nearlv half the country's export earnings.
4.        Apart from agriculture, the main possibilities for economic develop-
ment are fisheries, touirism and manufacturing. Thanks to rich resources off
the coast, fish production has been growing rapidly.   International tourism
to Senegal has started to develop only in recent years, but prospects for
further expansion of this sector are promising. Senegal developed its
industrial sectors earlier than other West African countries and its
industrial labor force is one of the best in Africa. However, although
there are certain definite possibilities for development of new crops and
new sectors, diversification will take a long time. The economy will for
some time continue to be affected by the vagaries of the weather and by
fluctuations in the world market price of groundnuts.
Past Development
5.        During the early 1960's, Senegal's economy remained stagnant.
The growth of CDP in real terms was minimal (1 percent a year) and per
capita income mav have declined though at about US$250 it is higher than in most
other African countries. Two factors were primarily responsible for this



-2-
slow growth.  First, independence caused Senegal to lose its privileged posi-
tion as the center of French West Africa.   This resulted in the loss of
export markets for manufactures as domestic industries developed in other
W4est African countries.  At 'he same time, departure of most of the French
civilian and military personnel resulted in declining demand for services
and locally produced goods. Second, the Government was slow in attacking
the country's difficult adjtustment problems.  The heavy administrative
apparatus could not respond quickly to the new situation and government
policies stressed administration rather than development. The First
Development Plan (1961-64) concentrated on investments for social and
transport infrastructure, including housing, urban water supply and ad-
ministrative buildings; investments in rural sectors accounted for less
than 20 percent of total development outlays.
6.        The second half of the 1960's saw more energetic development
policies by the Government. There was a considerable increase in the public
investment program, made possible by substantial improvements in absorptive
capacitv of the public sector. The program became more directly development-
oriented with the share of investments in productive sectors increasing from
24 to 45 percent during the Second Plan. Rural investments improved in qual-
ity, and tripled between the First and the Third Plan. Rural diversification,
mainly for cotton, rice and tomatoes, was successfully started.
7.        The change in the Government's development policy, however, came
too late to have a significant impact on the economy in the late 1960's,
when a combination of bad weather and falling export prices led to a 50
percent decline of groundnut production, and when even production of millet
and other maior food crops remained insufficient to cover local demand.     In
the modern sector, though, the Government did succeed in stimulating import
substitution, and this partly offset the loss of export markets. In an
otherwise static economy, annual growth of manufacturing output amounted to
6 to 7 percent.
S.        A number of factors combined to bring about a sizable growth of
CDP in the last four years after about seven vears of virtual stagnation.
Between 1968 and 1971, GDP increased by over 8 percent a year (at current
prices). First, the Covernment's agricultural diversification efforts
started yielding important benefits. In addition, at the beginning of 1971,
effective measures were taken to stimulate grcundnut output.    Sharp in-
creases in world market prices after 1968 made possible a 25 percent increase
in producer prices, and this, combined with favorable weather conditions,
helped restore the level of groundinut production.   Finally, the modern sector
of the economy continued' to expand.  There was a marked increase in exports
of manufactured products, averaging 14 percent a year and reflecting Senegal's
improving competitive position. At independence, the country had been
plaguee, with a high cost structure which seriously hampered economic growth.
Since then, however, Government nolicies have been aimed at curtailing price
and salary increases, which in turn allowed local indcustries (e.g., manufac-
turing of textiles and shoes) to start competing successfully in export markets.



-3-
Public Finance and Foreign Aid
9.        These overall economic trends are reflected in the condition of
public finances which deteriorated throughout most of the 1960's. By 1968/69,
public savings had declined slowly but continuously to virtually zero. Reve-
nues stagnated because of the decline in imports, the most important element
of the tax base. Thus, keeping the tax ratio at roughly 20 percent of GDP
was quite an achievement. But current expenditures grew, albeit moderately,
at some 3 to 4 percent annually thus eroding the current account surplus.
10.       After 1968/69, a recovery of public savings was made possible
because of better tax collection, increased tax rates and substantial sur-
pluses of the groundnut stabilization fund following the rise in grotndnut
export prices. In 1970/71, public savings represented scme 7 percent of cur-
rent revenues. Yet locally-financed public investment continued to exceed
savings by a wide margin, as it had throughout the 1960's, and this resulted
in a steady decline in Treasury deposits.
11.       Senegal has been benefiting from a large inflow of foreign aid,
mostly on concessionary terms. Between 1966 and 1970, foreign aid financed
about 65 percent of the public capital program and averaged US$30 million
per year. This corresponds to US$8.0 per capita annually, mainly financed
by the European Economic Community (40 percent) and France (30 percent).
The World Bank Group and Germany contributed, respectively, 13 and 10 per-
cent of the total. Foreign aid programs concentrated on infrastructure and
on directly productive projects in the rural sector. Of importance also was
the technical assistance, mainly in education, which amounted to US$29 mil-
lion annually, and which was mostly financed by the French Government.
Prospects
12.       In coming years the economy will probably grow faster than in the
past decade, largely as a result of on-going efforts to diversify agricul-
tural output and to expand fisheries, tourism and industrial exports. Medium
term prospects would be more favorable, were it not for the fact that ground-
nut prices are expected to fall from their present level of over 100/long
ton to E80/long ton by 1975, which is expected to erase the surplus of the
stabilization fund within two to three years.
13.       The government is determined to keep the expansion of current
expenditures to a minimum and to improve the financial performance of public
enterprises. However, since tax rates are already relatively high, the
urgently needed revenue increases will have to come from a combination of
better collection and overall economic growth.
14.       Considering the need to diversify the economy, it appears essential
that public investment be increased from US$60 million annually during the
Third Plan (1969/73) to US$80 million during the Fourth Plan. However, while



such a program is in line with the recent improvement in the government's
capacitv to prepare and implement projects, the slow increase in public
savings, together with the limited possibilities of deficit financing with-
out endangering the difficult foreign exchange situation or restricting
credit to the private sector, make financing of the Fourth Plan difficult.
To offset the expected shortfall in local resources associated with the
deterioration of terms of trade, foreign lenders will have to increase
their share in the financing of the Fourth Plan to about 85 percent of
total development expenditures. Foreign aid is expected to continue to
expand rapidlv, based on the progranis of the Euromean Comnunities (Third
FED Program), hilateral aid donors (Canada, Italv, Belgiu.m, and oil produc-
inrg countries in the Arab world) and the- World Bank Group. In view of Senegal's
improved economic performance and absorptive capacity, increased external
assistance is warranted.
15.       External aid will have to continue to be on relativelv soft terms
if it is not to create serious debt service problems. The proportion of
grant aid has declined from 85 percent in 1964-66 to 55 percent in 1969-71
and is likelv to drop to about 40 percent of total foreign financial aid
during the period of the Fourth Plan.   Although the foreign debt service
ratio is still low at 5 percent, financing of the remainder of foreign
aid on conventional terms would soon lead to unmanageable balance of pay-
ments and budgetary difficulties.   Projections indicate that at least half
of non-grant aid should be extended on concessionary terms if an excessive
increase in the debt service ratio is to be avoided. Budget constraints
are even more serious, as debt service charges are already projected to
absorb one-half of gross public savings by 1980.    Any substantial harden-
ing of the blend could result in negative public savings.
PART II: BANK GROITP OPERATIONS
16.       The Bank Croup has had twelve operations in Senegal to date.    Total
lending amounts to USS55.45 million (net of cancellations), including eight
IDA credits, three Bank loans and one hlencd of Bank and IDA funds.   The Bank
Group is now Senegal's third largest aid donor (after France and the European
Economic Communities) providing ahout 13 percent of Senegal's external capi-
tal assistance. IFC has invested USS3.25 million in two projects in Senegal.
Annex II contains a summarv statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC in-
vestments as of December 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
17.       Initially Bank Group lending in Senegal was limited to the trans-
port and groundnut sectors. The implementation of a railway project financed
in 1966 (Credit 96-SE) was delayed and there were shortfalls in the railway's
financial performance. However, the project eventually succeeded in strengthen-
ing the railway authority which, with the assistance of a second project ap-
proved in FY 72 (Credit 314-SE and Loan 835-SE) should soon be showing an
operating surplus. A loan for the Dakar port (Loan 493-SE) had more immediate



success and helped improve the finances and administration of the Port Authority.
The Bank Group's first operation in agriculture (Loan 584-SE and Credit 140-SE)
was a project to improve groundnut and millet cultivation. It suffered at first
from a sharp fall in groundnut output (paragraph 7) which caused a drop in
demand for credit and which led to the cancellation of the loan, In 1971,
a combination of the Government's strong action, and good weather conditions,
permitted the recovery of groundnut production; funds for the lending program
to farmers will be fully disbursed shortly but those for technical assistance
will continue to be disbursed until the end of 1974 (para. 4, ANNEX I). A
1960 credit for construction and maintenance of feeder roads in the groundnut
basin (Credit 198-SE) has been satisfactorily implemented.
18.       The Government and the Bank both emphasize now the diversification
of agricultural production and development of new productive sectors.   The
Casamance Rice project (Credit 252-SE) approved in 1971, the Terres Neuves
project (Credit 254-SE), also of 1971, and the Rtiver Polders project (Credit
350-SE), all aim at developing new crops and opening up new agricultural re-
gions. Hiowever, in view of Senegal's limited agricultural potential, we are
actively exploring with the Government other avenues for diversification.
Perhaps the most promising of these is tourism, for which Senegal's pleasant
climate and attractive beaches are important assets. A Bank mission recently
reviewed the prospects for Senegalese tourism within the context of the over-
all development of the sector in W4est Africa. The Dakar airport project
(Loan 867-SE) approved last November will facilitate tourism development.   Other
possibilities for diversification currently being examined by the Bank include
fisheries and manufacturing.  The Government has also asked the Bank to take
the lead in assessing the viability of a large tanker repair project, and we
are considering the possibility of a project preparation loan.
19.       Other areas in which the Bank is involved are urbanization, for which
a Site and Services project (Credit 336-SE) was recently approved, and educa-
tion, for which a general education project is being prepared following a
credit in 1971 (Credit 253-SE) for teclhnical and agricultural education. In-
stitution-building and improvement in the performance of public enterprises and
services will continue to be important themes in Bank Group lending in Senegal.
Examples of these include the telecommunications project (Loan 866-SE) approved
last Ilovember, and a DFC and water/sewerage projects being prepared.
PART III: TiHE TRANSPORT SECTOR
20.       Senegal possesses a relatively well-developed transport system, in-
cluding some 9100 km of roads, 1032 km of railways, and a modern deepwater
port and airport at Dakar. Transport has consistently ranked high among the
Government's investment priorities since independence. The First, Second and
Third Four-Year Plans allocated roughly 25, 30 and 15 percent respectively
of the public investment program to transport. Roads accounted for roughly
half of the total, railways for one-fifth, the rest being split between ports
and airports. The transport sector has contributed on average 5.0 percent to
Gross Domestic Product since 1964, reaching a peak of 5.6 percent in 1968.



- 6 -
21.       Possible inland competition between road and rail in Senegal is
limited, since eighty percent of rail traffic is either in bulk freight which
is more economically carried by rail or in captive international traffic to
and from Mali. There are however areas of transport policy which deserve
more attention and coordination, such as investment planning, truck licensing,
and, where competition does exist, pricing. The Government has decided to
strengthen the institutional framework for decision making on transport co-
ordination, with the assistance of consultants to be financed under the
Second Railway Project (Loan 835-SE and Credit 314-SE).
22.       W;hile past policy has succeeded in providing a well developed trans-
port system, insufficient emphasis has been given to maintaining the road net-
work.  The relatively large stock of road maintenance equipment available at
independence has been allowed to deteriorate, to such an extent that the state
of repair of the road network has suffered. Out of 9,100 kilometers about
5,000 kilometers are being maintained.   This 5,000 kilometers comprises the
paved and gravel/earth road neltworks, while the rest of the network is of
sand tracks not justifying regular maintenance. The First Highway Project
(Credit 198-SE) financed the most urgent requirements for secondary and
feeder road maintenance equipment, as well as a study of the needs for road
maintenance and improvement. This study led to the project now proposed which
would finance a comprehensive program of highway maintenance and the rehabil-
itation of 110 kilometers of paved road that has seriously deteriorated.
23.       In general the network provides adequate access to most parts of
the country, though some need for feeder roads persists. The Government is
now remedying this shortfall. The Bank's first Highway Project (Credit 198-SE)
financed four feeder roads totalling 78 kilometers in the Sine Saloum region
in central Senegal, and other feeder road requirements are being handled in
the context of agricultural projects. In this respect a further 244 kilometers
will be constructed under the Bank's first Terres Neuves project (Credit 254-SE)
and 69 kilometers under the Bank's Casamance Rice Development Project (Credit
252-SE). Several studies have been made into feeder road requirements in
the recent past, though the approach to planning feeder road development is
not entirely systematic. There is a need to coordinate the studies which
have been made and to establish future priorities for feeder road construc-
tion.
PART IV: TIE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "Senegal, Appraisal of the Second Highway Project"
(37-SE) is being circulated separately to Executive Directors. A credit
and project summary is provided at Annex III.
25.       The road improvement and maintenance study, financed as part of the
first Highway Project (Credit 198-SE), was completed in October 1971. The
consultants' recommendations served as a basis for a government request for



-7-
Bank Group financing of a second highway project. Bank missions in July and
November 1971 assisted the Government in reviewing the conclusions of the
consultants, and in completing project preparation. The project was appraised
in June 1972. Negotiations with the Government delegation led by Secretary
of State for Planning, Mr. Ousmane Seck, took place in January 1973.
26.       The proposed project includes:
(a) pavement strengthening of six sections of road totalling
about 110 km;
(b) a four-year program for improving highway maintenance by
(i) the reorganization of maintenance operations and
equipment repair, including training all levels of Direct-
orate of Public Works' personnel; and (ii) the purchase of
equipment and spare parts;
(c)  preinvestment studies.
27.       The total capital cost of the project is estimated to be US$10.5
million including duties and taxes of US$1.7 million. The proposed IDA
credit would be equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange component of
US$7.5 mmillion. The Government of Senegal would contribute the remaining
US$3.0 million equivalent. Equipment and spare parts would be procured on
the basis of international competitive bidding. A preference of up to 15
percent on equipment would be permitted in respect of equipment (trucks) on
which the proportion of value added locally is more than 20 percent. The
strengthening works would be carried out by contractors under unit price con-
tracts awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. The pro-
posed IDA credit would be disbursed against the CIF price of imported equip-
ment and 91%, being the estimated net of tax cost, of locally procured equip-
ment; 62 percent of total expenditure under the construction contracts for the
strengthening of paved roads; and 100 percent of foreign expenditures for
scholarships and consultantst services.
28.       The recurrent costs of highway maintenance will amount to US$19.3
million from 1973/74 to 1976/77. Over the project period, this will repre-
sent an average annual increase of 6.3 percent in the recurrent budget of
the Directorate of Public Works in line with predicted traffic growth.
Project Execution
29.       The Directorate will be responsible for the execution of the pro-
ject with the assistance of consultants to be provided under the proposed
project. Although the Directorate has faced staffing shortages at the upper
and middle levels, the Government has encouraged entrance into technical
fields through various programs. W4ith the technical assistance envisaged,
and as new Senegalese graduates gain experience, the requirements of the
Directorate in design, construction and maintenance work will be adequate.



-8-
Pavement Strengthening
30.       Under the road improvement and maintenance study, consultants
identified about 1,000 kilometers of primary roads on which the pavement had
deteriorated to such an extent that normal maintenance would not assure
adequate operating conditions and have proposed instead a long-term rehabili-
tation program. As the first stage of the rehabilitation program, six
sections totalling about 110 km, will be strengthened under the project.
These paved roads were built 10 to 20 years ago and are structurally inade-
quate for present traffic volumes, ranging from 500 to 5,500 vehicles daily.
Even with present high maintenance expenditures on these roads, their con-
dition is deteriorating, resulting in high vehicle operating costs. The
economic returns from each section of road proposed are between 11 and 42
percent. The economic return on the total strengthening work is 25 percent.
Improvement of Maintenance
31.       The proposed project includes a comprehensive program for improving
higawav maintenance operations. The maintenance study revealed that 60 per-
cent of the fleet was no longer serviceable. One-third of the equipment has
since been renewed under the First Higlhway Project. To meet future mainten-
ance needs, new equipment would be purchased and some of the fleet would be
reconditioned with spare parts financed by the proposed project. The project
also includes financing for needed improvements to the Directorate of Public
Works' storage facilities, the purchase of new workshop equipment, and the
purchase of radio equipment for subdivisions not served by the telecommunica-
tions project recently approved by the Bank Group. The project would finance
one permanent and two mobile weighing stations to assist in the enforcement
of vehicle weight regulations.
32.       The proposed project would also finance 273 man-months of technical
assistance to assist in the reorganization of the Directorate of Public Works.
Four experts in the Central Maintenance Division would plan and supervise
maintenance operations and accounting, and four more in the Central Equipment
Division would organize the central and regional workshops. In addition, an
expert would be provided for a few months to assist in defining a training
program. The consultants would be responsible for training counterpart staff
as well as maintenance personnel at all levels of the organization. During
negotiations the Government agreed to assign the required counterpart staff
to the consultants team. No suitably qualifiedl mechanical enginieers are
available among the Directorate's staff, but it was agreed that three mechanics
will be upgraded with foreign training. In addition, one civil engineer will
be sent overseas for practical managerial training.
33.       The project would assure that the Directorate of Public Works has
sufficient capacity to maintain properly the 5,300) kilometers justifying
regular maintenance: these are the most important roads in the country, with
the 2,000 kilometers of paved roads carrying an average 900 vehicles per day,
and the 3,300 kilometers of gravel and earth roads carrying an average of
75 vehicles per dav.



-9-
Preinvestment Studies
34.       A recently completed feasibility study of the 85 kilometers road
between Louga and Lake Guiers, the source of Dakar's water supply, indicated
that upgrading would yield an economic return of 12 percent. Consequently
detailed engineering of this route would be included in the project together
with feasibility studies and detailed engineering for a second phase of the
pavement strengthening program, comprising 190 kilometers of paved road.
The proposed project would also provide 10 man-months of consulting services
to establish a priority list for feeder road improvements and extensions
based on several recent studies.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
35.       A draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association and
the Republic of Senegal, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Development Credit
Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for highway projects.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   Projects in Execution-/
Cr. No. 96      First Railway Project, US$9.0 Million
Credit of September 29, 1966; Closing Date; June 30, 1973
1.        The project was designed to put the Railways (Regie) on a sound
technical and financial footing. All project items, mainly track material
and some rolling stock, have now been delivered and the project will be com-
pleted by the end of 1972, about three years behind the original schedule.
Due to the Regie's internal administrative difficulties, lack of qualified
staff to prepare and issue tender documents and also to labor problems, de-
livery of materials and equipment was delayed and, as a result, disbursements
were slow.
2.        The financial performance of the Regie during the first project
fell considerably short of expectation, principally because traffic did not
increase as expected at the time of appraisal. Furthermore, the Regie's
effort to cut personnel costs was largely offset by an increase in its mate-
rial costs. As a result, the Regie is still operating at a loss as compared
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

to a target rate of return for 1969/70 of 4 percent as agreed in 1966. The
shortfalls in the Regie's performance under Credit 96-SE must be viewed in the
light of the Senegalese and Malian economies' failure to move ahead as rapidly
as expected. The recent economic recovery in both countries will assist in
improving the financial situation of the Regie.
Ln. No. 493    Port of Dakar; US$4.0 Million
Loan of May 1, 1967; Closing Date: December 31, 1972
3.        The first port project, which was approved in 1967, was to improve
Dakar port facilities by extending the wharves, reconstructing quay walls,
and dredging various areas in the port. After slow but satisfactory execu-
tion, the project should be completed by the end of 1972. Special loan
covenants helped to improve the finances and administration of the Port Atu-
thority. The Port Authority, which has recently established a Master Plan
for its future development, is presently considering the extension of its
fishing port and ship repair facilities.
Cr. No. 140    First Agricultural Credit Project; US$6.0 Million and
Ln. No. 584    US$3.5 Million
Credit of February 10, 1969 and Loan of same date (cancelled);
Closing Date: March 31, 1974
4.        The objective of the First Agricultural Credit Project was to bring
about increases in farmers income and Government's revenues by an increase in
production and vields of groundnut and millet in Senegal's "Groundnut Basin"@.
The project finances 75% of the cost of animal drawn equipment purchased bv
farmers and varying percentages of the costs of management assistance to
marketing, extension and credit institutions. A sharp fall in groundnut out-
put due to lowq prices and poor weather caused a drop in demand for credi; ancl
led to a cancellation of the Bank Loan. In 1971 a combination of better
financial incentives and normal weather conditions permitted the recovery of
groundnut production, but as a result of drought conditions in 1972 the crop
for that year was the smallest of the last 25 years, as a result, actual
production levels have stayed well behind expectations at the outset. It is
felt, however, th;at the essential component under the first project, the
distribution of animal drawn equipment on credit, has benefitted the farmer
even under adverse weather conditions and that without equipment availability
overall production would have been even lower.
Cr. No. 198    First Highway Project; US$2.1 MIillion
Credit of June 19, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1972
5.        The first highway project provided for construction of feeder roads,
purchase of highway maintenance equipment and study on road improvement and
maintenance. Execution of the project has been satisfactory. Actual costs
are within appraisal estimates and surplus funds available are being used for
providing additional maintenance equipment.

Cr. No. 252    Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 Million
Credit of June_18, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
6.        Launched in early 1972, the project is about to complete its first
campaign. Targets for area un,der cultivation and production have been met
and the construction and marketing programs are on schedule. The quality of
management and extension services is good. There are some delays in the
channelling of funds to the Project Unit but a new arrangement is now being
discussed with the Government.
Cr. No. 253    Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: October 1, 1976
7.        Construction of all Project schools is expected to be completed
by January 31, 1975 in accordance with the appraisal schedule. Disbursements
are temporarily delayed due to a delay in signing an architects contract.
The project is progressing satisfactorily except for the Merchant Marine
School at Dakar, where there has been a delay in the selection of a fisheries
expert; it is expected that his appointment will be made within six months.
Cr. No. 254    Terres Neuves Settlement Project; US$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
8.        Despite a late start due to delays in the establishment of the
project entities, the 1972 first year targets have generally been achieved:
Forty-two families settled in April 1972 and cultivated 100 hectares. Agri-
cultural results are satisfactory and the settlers express satisfaction with
the project. The preparation of a second phase project is well under way
and the feasibility study shou:Ld be ready by the end of 1973.
Cr. No. 314
Ln. No. 335    Second Railway Project; US$3.2 Mil:Lion and US$6.4 Million
Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
9.        This project involves continuation of track renewal towards the
Mali border, modernization of workshops to increase efficiency and thus
improve availability of rolling stock, the purchase of locomotives, and the
modernization of freight cars to reduce maintenance costs, technical services
and training. The terminal date for effectiveness of the Loan and Credit
has been extended from November 1, 1972 to December 29, 1972 to permit the
Borrower to furnish the requisite legal opinions. However, specifications
and tender documents for the main items have already been prepared by the
Regie and it may be expected that the project should proceed normally and be
completed according to schedule.

10.       In order to achieve full potential benefits of the Investment
Program and to allow the Regie to reach financial viability by 1975/76 a
Plan of Action has been agreed upon with Government and the Regie. This
Plan outlines measures to be adopted by the Regie to improve operations,
reduce staff, and study certain branch lines which appear to be unprofitable.
Cr. No. 336     Site and Services Project; US$8.0 Million
Credit of September 25, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
11.       The Credit Agreement was not signed until September 29, 1972 and
is not yet effective.   However, the executxng agency, Office des Habitations
a Loyers Moderes is carrying out its reorganization and is about to begin
the detailed engineering for the first phase of the project.
Ln. No. 867     Airport Project; US$3.0 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
12.       This project was signed on December 19, 1972.
Ln. No. 866     Telecommunications Project; US$6.25 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date; June 30, 1976

Cr. No. 350     River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million
Credit of January 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
14.       This project was signed on January 9, 1973.
