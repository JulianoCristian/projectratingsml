Specifically, it has two\n            interrelated objectives:  strengthening the institutional\n            framework for the formulation and implementation of\n            agricultural policies and programs; and improving the\n            delivery of public sector services to agriculture.  To this\n            end, the project includes:  (a) the reorganization and\n            strengthening of MOA's work in policy formulation,\n            planning, monitoring and evaluation; (b) the preparation of\n            a national master plan for research and funding of research\n            on cotton and rice; and (c) the reorganization of MOA's\n            agricultural extension services in 3 regions on a pilot\n            basis.  In addition, the project entails (d) the\n            strengthening of the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority;\n            (e) logistical support for veterinary services; and (f)\n            studies of the agricultural credit system and food security.\n            Lastly, it includes a program for sector management."}, "docdt": "1987-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
