Project\n            had a ratings outcome of satisfactory.  The risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible and both the Bank\n            Borrower performance rating was satisfactory.  Lessons\n            learned include: (1) If project design entails\n            infrastructure investments, new land development, and final\n            foot print of all proposed investments is not known upfront,\n            as a precaution OP 4.12 should be triggered during project\n            design. (2) Countries like Romania (then an EU accession\n            country) may not so much need help in developing hardware,\n            but may benefit more from the Bank on the software side or\n            in creating systems and processes, and capacity through TAs\n            and transference of knowledge. (3) Beneficiary assessment\n            should be programmed during implementation for projects that\n            are designed with the objective of basic services delivery\n            such as water and wastewater. (4) Projects implemented at\n            lower level of Government (through municipalities) and in a\n            decentralized manner, demonstrate strong Borrower commitment\n            and ownership, resulting in higher counterpart contribution\n            even during a financial crisis. (5) Project lending in Euro\n            denomination could avert the currency-associated risk\n            adequately during implementation."}, "docdt": "2012-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
