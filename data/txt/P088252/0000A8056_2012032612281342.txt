                         coverage of water and wastewater services, mainly through: (i) support of infrastructure development in the municipalities of Bucharest and Arad to provide better water
                         and wastewater service and improve stormwater management; and (ii) preparation of priority water and wastewater projects in selected counties.

                         Component 1 (Bucharest) had been extended by nine months and will now be concluded at the end of March 2012. There is good progress in the implementation of all civil works.

                         June 30, 2009 and Contract B2 (Straulesti) some works are still ongoing but they are nearing completion.

                         Component 2 (Arad) and Component 3 (Project Preparation for EU Funding) were closed as scheduled on June 30, 2011 as the loan for Component 2 (Arad) was fully exhausted.

                         Delays persist in completing Contract A1 (Gai District) while the other two components are finished and are in their defect liability period. The Municipality of Arad undertook to
                         continue financing the project to fully complete all remaining construction works under Contract A1.

                         Component 3 is completed. Master Plans for 11 counties have been completed and adopted by the final beneficiaries. Based on these Master Plans ten full feasibility studies and
                         applications for EC financing have been prepared. All nine proposals were approved and will generate grant co-financing from the EU Structural Funds for about Euro 1 billions,
                         substantially contributing to the absorption of EU funding and helping Romania meet its targets under its accession obligations in Environment.
