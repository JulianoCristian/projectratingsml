Overall implementation of the\n            project is good and the project is likely to achieve its\n            objective. As of end-May 2011, a total amount of 98.74\n            million (93 percent of the total loan) has been disbursed. A\n            nine-month extension of component one is necessary to enable\n            the Bucharest Municipality to utilize its undisbursed funds,\n            complete the remaining civil works contracts and finance\n            supervision consultants under the loan. Delays were due to\n            the need for technical and design changes resulting from\n            complicated construction conditions which are now resolved,\n            problems with issuance of construction permits, and delays\n            in transferring counterpart funding from Sector one\n            Municipality to the General Municipality. To ensure the\n            achievement of the project objectives, agreement has also\n            been reached that the Bucharest Municipality will finance\n            all additional costs for civil works and consultant services\n            beyond December 2011, if the works were still not completed\n            by then. This will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
