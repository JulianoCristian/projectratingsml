                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to meet EU environmental directives in the water and wastewater sector, thereby improving the quality and
                         coverage of water and wastewater services, mainly through: (i) support of infrastructure development in the municipalities of Bucharest and Arad to provide
                         better water and wastewater service and improve stormwater management; and (ii) preparation of priority water and wastewater projects in selected counties.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is nearing its completion and progressing towards meeting its Development Objectives.

                         Component 1 (Bucharest) has been extended by nine months and will now be concluded at the end of March 2012. There is good progress in the implementation of all civil works,
                         with some delay in one sub-component due to delays in issuing construction permits.

                         Component 2 (Arad) and Component 3 (Project Preparation for EU Funding) were closed as scheduled on June 30, 2011. As the loan part for Component 2 (Arad) was fully
                         exhausted, the contracts for some civil works that are not yet completed have continued to be financed by the Municipality of Arad. This will ensure that the Project's development
                         objectives are met. Under Component 3, Master Plans for 11 counties have been completed and adopted by the final beneficiaries, and subsequently, nine full applications for EC

                         financing have been prepared. These nine proposals will generate grant co-financing from the EU Structural Funds for about Euro 1 billion and substantially contribute to the
                         absorption of EU funding and help meet Romania targets under OP Environment. Component 3 is also completed.
