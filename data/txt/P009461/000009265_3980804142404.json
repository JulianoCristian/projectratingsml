The main\n            objectives were clear, realistic and important for the\n            population affected by the water control infrastructure that\n            was to be rehabilitated and improved by the project.\n            However, the project was complex, involving several\n            components, the need for cooperation between many\n            institutions and four external financiers, and with a large\n            number of subprojects scattered around the country. The\n            project protected and increased agricultural production and\n            incomes and raised standards of living but not to the same\n            extent as estimated at appraisal. Key lessons learned\n            included: (i) Institutional change requires finding the real\n            cause of problems; (ii) Reform of BWDB requires a new\n            mandate, emphasizing tasks of national interest and\n            technical complexity, and provision of technical services to\n            other agencies, at local or regional levels, more suitable\n            to beneficiary participation and service; (iii) Establishing\n            a project as an enclave reduces its potential influence for\n            policy reform; (iv) Increasing involvement of beneficiaries\n            requires more time and careful planning of the roles,\n            responsibilities, and interactions of various stakeholders\n            within proposed beneficiary organizations; v) Realistic\n            project planning is essential, recognizing institutional\n            constraints, proposing solutions where possible, and\n            allowing adequate time for procedures that cannot quickly be\n            reformed; (vi) Government insistence on grant financing of\n            technical assistance, when it leads to complex multi-donor\n            and multi-consultant structures, can be very costly; (vii)\n            Routine maintenance by groups of the landless poor can be\n            very successful; (viii) Successful irrigation cost recovery\n            requires adequate rule of law; (ix) Future water sector\n            rehabilitation projects should be made conditional on\n            adequate reforms to ensure sustainability; and (x) The\n            success of a project in fostering dialogue on issues and a\n            recognition within government and the implementing agency of\n            the need for reform may be its most important long-term\n            contributions. (xi) Future rehabilitation projects should\n            routinely address environmental damages; and (xii) Future\n            rehabilitation project should ensure stakeholders\n            participation in all stages of the project cycle, starting\n            from identification through operation and maintenance."}, "docdt": "1998-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
