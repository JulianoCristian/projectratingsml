This would be accomplished\n            through rehabilitation and improved operation and\n            maintenance (O&M) of the Bangladesh Water Development\n            Board's (BWDB) existing flood control, drainage and\n            irrigation projects. The project's objectives would be\n            achieved through: (a) rehabilitation and improvement of\n            about 80 subprojects which have deteriorated due to\n            inadequate maintenance; (b) introduction of improved O&M\n            in BWDB's projects where infrastructure still is in\n            reasonably good condition, but not maintained properly; (c)\n            on-farm development works and improved O&M in two\n            subprojects with farmers' participation; (d) training\n            of BWDB staff and beneficiaries, particularly for O&M;\n            and (e) provision of technical assistance to assist BWDB in\n            planning, design and execution of rehabilitation,\n            improvement, on-farm development and O&M works and to\n            help strengthen its organization for O&M and staff\n            development. The World Bank Food Programme (WFP) would\n            provide food to finance part of the construction and\n            maintenance of earthworks to be carried out under the\n            rehabilitation and improved O&M components."}, "docdt": "1990-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
