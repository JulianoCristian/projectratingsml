areas. First, the fiscal and public\n            expenditure reforms of the KERL include a multi-year\n            framework for fiscal adjustment and reforms to improve\n            fiscal transparency, tax and expenditure policies, public\n            expenditure management, financial accountability, and\n            procurement transparency, with the objectives of restoring\n            the state's financial health, creating additional\n            fiscal space for high-priority expenditures, and promoting\n            more efficient and transparent management of the\n            Government's financial resources. Second, the\n            KERL's administrative reforms focus on civil service\n            reforms, freedom of information, service agency reforms,\n            anti-corruption initiatives, decentralization, and\n            e-governance, with the objectives of improving the\n            efficiency and transparency by which government conducts its\n            business and delivers services. Third, the private sector\n            development component focuses on improving the business\n            environment through deregulation and privatization/closure\n            of public enterprises. Finally, the KERL supports the\n            establishment of a poverty and human development monitoring\n            system to enable the state to better track the impact of its\n            services, policies, and reforms on poverty and social\n            indicators. The loan/credit will be disbursed in one\n            tranche, and is the first in a proposed sequence of about\n            four operations."}, "docdt": "2001-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
