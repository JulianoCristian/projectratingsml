The project includes the\n            following components: (a) developing new water supply\n            systems in 18 semi-rural centers with piped water; (b)\n            reinforcing the water supply of Likasi, an essential element\n            for the development of this mining town; and (c) technical\n            assistance and training aimed at strengthening sector\n            planning for REGIDSCO (Regie de Distribution d'Eau de\n            la Republique du Zaire). It also includes: (d) consulting\n            services; and (e) supply of essential operational and\n            training equipment to further strengthen REGIDESCO's\n            operational and managerial capabilities. Through these\n            objectives, the project would contribute to human resource\n            development and thereby foster economic development."}, "docdt": "1988-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
