MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Zaire
Third Water Supply Project (Credit 1939-ZR)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Zaire - Third Water Supply Project (Credit
1939-ZR) prepared by the Africa Regional Office, with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
Project objectives focused on institutional development and sector strengthening; a
learning by-doing approach was adopted in which the implementing agency (REGIDESO), was to
improve water supply services in 18 secondary towns over the four-year implementation period,
assisted through training and technical assistance inputs from consultants.
Although the project became effective in January 1989, civil unrest since 1991 severely
hampered operations. Disbursements were eventually suspended in July 1993 following the
Government's failure to meet debt service payments to the Bank. With only 8 of 18 water
systems completed at that time, the implementing agency is reported to have continued
construction operations on its own utilizing materials supplied under the project. This effort,
supported by frequent Bank supervision missions, delayed the adverse impact of the difficult
country situation on the project outcome. The result of technical assistance and other ID
components is limited, given the adverse implementation environment.
Project experience does not reveal much beyond the need for civil order during project
implementation. The Bank intensified supervision and reoriented project implementation towards
securing social benefits after late 1991 when contractors were forced to evacuate their personnel
and leave the country. This was, however, achieved at a great cost due to high local inflation in
1992-93. The project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory, and its institutional development impact
as negligible. The sustainability of project benefits is rated as unlikely.
The PCR provides a satisfactory discussion of early implementation experience. No audit
is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1939-ZR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Water Supply Project in
Zaire, which was approved on June 24, 1988, and for which Credit 1939-ZR in the amount
of SDR 32.6 million was signed on July 11, 1988. The Credit was closed on February 28,
1994, earlier than as originally scheduled (April 30, 1994). As of January 5, 1994, the date
of the final disbursement, 10 percent of the Credit remained undisbursed.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the South-
Central and Indian Ocean Department, Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary and Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started in Washington D.C. in December 1993, and is
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit and Project Agreements,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank
memoranda.

THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1939-ZR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    The project's major objectives were to: (i) improve and strengthen planning of
investments, expenditures and revenues in the water supply sector; (ii) formulate
policies and programs to address key issues in the sector, especially rural water
supply and community participation; and (iii) strengthen REGIDESO's capacity for
cost-recovery as well as its operational efficiency and financial position (para
3.01). REGIDESO, the state water supply utility, is the Project executing agency
(para. 4.03).
Implementation
2.    The loan was declared effective six months after Board Approval, and
implementation started three months later (para. 5.01). The chief components of
the project were: (i) the construction of drinking water supply for 18 semi-rural
centers, (ii) a strengthening of water production capacity in the city of Likasi; and
(iii) sector-wide measures including technical assistance, consulting services,
studies and training to strengthen the planning, management and operational
capabilities of REGIDESO (para 3.02).
3.    The civil unrest and riots in 1991 and 1993, and the ensuing steady deterioration of
the economic and financial situation in Zaire, called for the project to be
restructured both in its physical components and support activities. While the
reduction in scope was beneficial to the project's implementation, the major logistic
and financial difficulties hampered the day-to-day operations of the water schemes.
Following the Government's failure to meet debt service payments vis-a-vis the
Bank, the Bank suspended disbursements on July 15, 1993. Because of the lack of
external financial support, and of the worsening of economic conditions in the
country, the project's objectives could no longer be achieved. It subsequently was
closed in April 1994, as part of the country-wide portfolio cancellation actions,
after Zaire was declared in non-accrual status in November 1993.



- iii -
4.    Despite extraordinary difficulties related to country's conditions, REGIDESO has
showed all over the project implementation sense of responsibility and clear vision
on the sector development (para. 9.02). IDA staff also reacted promptly to the
deteriorating country's conditions and pursued actively the project restructuring
(para. 8.02).
Results
5.    As of the date when disbursements were suspended, only 8 of the 18 targeted
centers were equipped with drinking water supply. Most of the support activities,
however, were successfully carried out. REGIDESO is trying to continue works in
9 centers, by force account and with the participation of local communities.
However, Regideso's ability to achieve self-sustainability and effective delivery of
this vital service is eroding, as a result of the lack of economic and financial
stabilization policies by the Government.

2. Background
2.01  General. Amid widespread turmoil, Zaire's fragile economy and existing institutions are
rapidly deteriorating. Following independence in 1960, Zaire's economy expanded at an
average rate of 4.9 percent between 1967 and 1973 (in real terms) due to favorable terms of
trade and robust foreign investment. The current account balance was in steady surplus,
social indicators improved and inflation was under control.   During  1974-1982,
"Zairianization" and nationalization of foreign-owned businesses led to deterioration of
terms of trade and a substantial falloff in GDP growth. Expansionary fiscal policies and
budget deficits, heavy external borrowing and nonproductive public investment projects all
served to fuel inflation stimulating growth. The adjustment program launched at the end of
1983 covered the 1984-1989 period. Based on traditional market orientation, rational
public resource management, liberalization of prices and trade, and improved investment
and export incentives, the program initially held promise. During 1984-1986, GDP growth
averaged 3.3 percent per year compared with a 0.7 percent increase in the preceding three
years. By late 1986, however, Zaire was once again unable to contain budget deficits and
non-productive public spending, and had partially reversed previous progress in price
liberalization and exchange rate. During 1987-1989, despite higher exports and external
transfers, GDP growth reached an average of only 0.6 percent per year. Zaire's adjustment
effort essentially failed because of poor economic management, rather than inadequate
external support or natural resources.



- 2 -
2.02   Since early 1990, political gridlock and social instability has driven Zaire to unprecedented
social and economic deterioration. Production capacity, investment and fiscal mobilization
have been rapidly declining. The runaway government spending financed by monetary
creation has resulted in rampant inflation, raising current account deficits and mounting
external arrears. Recent years have witnessed a slide in a variety of economic indicators in
Zaire: creditworthiness and investor confidence; the condition of productive assets and
infrastructure; and living standards and social indicators.  The national railways have
completely ceased operation. During 1989-1993, GDP declined by more than 20 percent,
copper production by 70%, consumption of petroleum products by 50%, road and river
traffics over 70%. Inflation was estimated at 2700 percent for 1992 and at an even higher
rate for 1993. The local currency depreciated over 100,000 times between November 1989
and November 1993.  Comprehensive and realistic economic reforms and a strong
stabilization program are needed to arrest the declining trend and the rampant monetary and
economic erosion currently plaguing Zaire. In response to this dramatic changes in the
economical and political environment, IDA undertook a critical review of the portfolio, and
developed an action plan since March 1992 to cancel problem projects, and to reorient the
portfolio in order to focus on those services essential for economic recovery (infrastructure
maintenance, key social sectors, and survival of GOZ capacities and performing agencies).
The Third Water Supply Project was among the projects revised during this restructuring.
2.03  Sector Organization. In Zaire, the state water supply utility, REGIDESO, is responsible
for water supply in urban areas and piped water systems in rural and semi-rural centers of
about 10000 people.  Rural water supply in smaller centers is the responsibility of
hydrological brigades which come under the Ministry of Agriculture. Sanitation is the
responsibility of municipalities through their Roads and Sanitation Divisions.
2.04  Previous IDA Activities. In the urban water supply sector, IDA has since 1973 played an
important role in assisting in the development of REGIDESO. The first water supply sector
study was carried out in 1973 by the IDA/WHO Cooperative Program. IDA's First Water
Supply Project, for which a US$21.5 million credit was extended in 1976 (Cr. 625-ZR),
included extension and rehabilitation of water supply systems in six cities, engineering
services, and contribution to a training program. REGIDESO was the beneficiary and
implementing agency. The project was completed in December 1981, and the PCR prepared
in 1982 highlighted the need to continue to strengthen the sector planning and design
capabilities of REGIDESO.  Key activities between  1975 and 1985 included the
implementation of a tariff structure study under the IDA/WHO Cooperative Program in
1979; execution of the UNDP Project ZAI/78/004 in 1979-80, under which master plans
and feasibility studies for water supply and sanitation in three cities (Matadi, Bukavu and
Likasi) were completed; and financing in 1982 of the Second Water Supply Project (Cr.
1241-ZR of US$18 million) aimed at reinforcing and expanding the water supply systems of
Likasi, Kisangani and Mbuji-Mayi, and completed in 1986. The PCR for this project
prepared in 1989, concluded that (i) all its physical objectives had been accomplished
successfully, (ii) cost, disbursement and execution performance were good, (iii) the
institutional measures adopted were successful, (iv) lessons learned were incorporated into
successive IDA operations, and (v) the scope and reach of IDA's future involvement in



- 3 -
Zaire's water supply sector could be broadened. The Bank's particularly close supervision
of the second Water Supply Project enabled its timely execution within 4 years.
2.05  IDA has also been involved in rural water supply through the Small Holder Maize Project
(Cr. 1040-ZR) presented to the Board in June 1980. The Project included a US$1.2 million
component for rehabilitation of village water supply systems, which was successfully
completed in 1983.
2.06  Notwithstanding REGIDESO's good performance, the water supply sector in Zaire has
remained grossly underdeveloped. Investments have lagged behind urban growth and
coverage has been inadequate. Actions to be undertaken within the water supply sub-sector
and under a Third Water Supply Project were identified partly during the last supervision of
the Second Water Supply Project, by drawing on the lessons learned in preparing and
implementing that project. The pre-appraisal and appraisal missions of September-October
1987 and January-February 1988, also helped identify the needed elements of a future
project.
2.07  Initially, the project included in the lending program as FY88L was a "Water Supply and
Urban Development Project". As the two components differed as to the nature of issues
and the stages of preparation, the projects were separated into: (i) the Third Water Supply
Project; and (ii) the Urban Development Project.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.01  Project Objectives. The key objectives of the Third Water Supply Project were: (i) to
improve and strengthen investment and expenditure planning in the water supply sector, in
line with the yearly PEP overall review process and consistent with the current structural
adjustment program. The project also sought to develop and strengthen in-country project
selection criteria and improve the planning, preparation, appraisal and implementation
capacity of REGIDESO; (ii) to formulate policies and programs to address key water
supply issues, in particular rural water supply and increased community participation; and
(iii) to enhance REGIDESO's financial sustainability, through improved cost recovery and
operational efficiency.
3.02  Project Description.  The project included the following components : (i) technical
assistance and training aimed at (a) strengthening the sector planning as well as
management and operational capabilities of REGIDESO, which would extend its
responsibilities to supplying water to 18 additional semi-rural centers; (b) supporting
REGIDESO in updating sector policy strategy and studies; and (c) supporting REGIDESO
in preparing feasibility and final design studies, tender documents and works' supervision for
the waterworks to be implemented through the project; (ii) feasibility study/master plan
of the Kinshasa sewerage/environmental protection system, the medium and long-term
organization/management study of REGIDESO and feasibility study/master plan for future
water supply projects; (iii) the development of new water supply systems in 18 priority
semi-rural centers (17 "chefs-lieux de zone" and 1 "chef -lieu de sous-region"- Ilebo) which



- 4 -
are priority development poles for important surrounding rural areas, and would be serviced
through piped water supply systems which would strongly contribute to their further
development; (iv) reinforcement of the water supply system of Likasi, an essential
element for the development of this important city of the Shaba region whose economic
activity is dominated by the mining industry; and (v) supply of essential operational and
training equipment to further strengthen REGIDESO's operational and managerial
capabilities.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01  With input from Bank staff, the lessons learned in preparing and implementing the Second
Water Supply Project helped to develop the project concept. The feasibility studies and
hydro-geological investigations were carried out by CEMDAEP (Centre d'Etudes
Multidisciplinaires pour le Developpement de l'Alimentation en Eau Potable) within
REGIDESO, with the assistance of an expatriate engineer funded by the PPF. This project
preparation approach required close IDA involvement to ensure that project objectives
could be achieved. The project appeared to be well prepared, and timing and scope to be
appropniate.
4.02  Since 1986 REGIDESO had carried out investigations and studies on 25 semi-rural centers
deemed to be potential candidates for the Third Water Supply Project. Based on economic
criteria, REGIDESO selected 18 priority centers for which the project would implement
piped water supply systems.  Final design and tender documents were prepared by
CEMDAEP with the assistance of two expatriate engineers.
4.03  REGIDESO, which has been responsible for the implementation of the whole project, was
well organized, as recorded since 1976 by supervision missions under the three successive
water supply projects. Two reorganizations authorized by the Board of Directors on
January 16, 1982 and October 7, 1986 left the Central Administration in Kinshasa divided
into four departments, each headed by a General Manager the Finance and Administration
Department, the Technical and Development Department, the General Secretariat, and the
Department of Human Resources and Social Development.  On August 30, 1990,
REGIDESO's Board reshuffled again the organization of the Central Administration in
Kinshasa, dividing it into seven departments: the Commercial and Financial Department,
the General Management Control Department, the Maintenance and Operator Department,
the Research and Development Department, the Human Resources and Social Development
Department, the General Secretariat, and the Diversification Direction (CEMDAEP and
TRAFOR).
4.04  The President Delegate General was appointed as REGIDESO's Chief Executive Officer in
1972 and has proved to be a competent and efficient leader over a period in which the
company has developed considerably. Departmental, divisional and regional managers are
competent, some of them have held their positions for several years.

5. Project Implementation
5.01   Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up. The project was approved on June 24, 1988
and Credit signature took place on July 11, 1988. The date of effectiveness was January
12, 1989.
5.02  Implementation Schedule. The project was originally scheduled to be completed by April
30, 1994. Table 4, Part III compares the actual completion status of sub-projects with that
estimated at appraisal. The water supply works were disrupted in September/October 1991,
as a result of civil unrest in Zaire which forced the contractors to halt all activities and
secure their personnel and equipment.  In March 1992, the contractors resumed
construction of the waterworks, following a reduction in the scope of the contracts: the
number of new water supply systems to be constructed under contract in semi-rural centers
was reduced from 18 to 8, and deep bored wells were to be installed in 6, rather than 8,
centers. Progress remained slow, however, constantly hampered by major logistic and
financial difficulties related to country conditions. Ethnic disorders in Shaba at the end of
1992 and the ram sack of Kinshasa in January 1993 caused new delays. A last emergency
action was approved by I)A in order to provide REGIDESO, by the end of March 1993,
with 800 tons of alumina sulfate for the operation over a two-month period of the water
treatment plants of Kinshasa. Amendments to legal agreements to reflect the restructuring
of the project were not finalized because of the suspension of disbursements. On July 15,
1993, all disbursements were suspended following the GOZ's failure to meet debt service
payments vis-a-vis the World Bank; the country was later on declared in non-accrual status,
on November 15, 1993. Together with the worsening economic conditions in the country,
these developments precluded the further achievement of the project's objectives. The last
disbursement took place on January 5, 1994. By that time, 91 percent of the credit had
been disbursed.
5.03  Procurement.   The procurement process did not begin until three months after
effectiveness, owing to custom clearance difficulties. Then, it became increasingly difficult
to convey the materials on site because of: (i) progressively bad operation of public
transport companies (ONATRA and SNCZ); (ii) shortage of fuel; and (iii) continuous
deterioration in road conditions. The pipes and equipment which had been supplied for the
ten canceled water supply systems have been transferred to REGIDESO's warehouses.
5.04  Goods and works were procured under contracts awarded in accordance with Bank
guidelines.  The restructuring of the project in its physical components and support
activities, has resulted in the reduction or cancellation of several contracts. Consultants
have been engaged in accordance with IDA guidelines.
5.05  Project Costs. The comparison between appraisal estimates and actual costs of the project
is shown in Part III (Tables 5A and SB). At US$51,600,000 (SDR 37,346,000), the
appraisal cost compares with the final cost of US$44,425,000 (SDR 37,346,000).
However, the main component of the project, the construction of the water supply systems,
which represented 73 percent of the total cost, has been much higher than projected,



notwithstanding the reduction in the number of semi-rural systems from 18 to 8. The main
reasons of the cost overrun are the following: (i) the tender documents had been the
insufficiently prepared, in particular concerning the earthworks, resulting in extra work
amounting to 6% to 30% of the initial contract costs, according to the centers; (ii)
evacuation or departure of almost all expatriates following the civil disturbances of
September and October 1991 interrupted construction in all the work sites, and the
contractors' claims for payment resulting from the force majeure situation resulted in
significant additional cost; and (iii) when the works were canceled in the ten centers, the
pipes and equipment designated for those centers had already been delivered and paid for.
5.06  During project implementation, the US$/SDR exchange rate rose from  US$1.339 to
US$1.369 to SDR 1. The average for the period was US$1.367 to SDR 1, compared to an
appraisal estimate of US$1.380 to SDR 1, difference of less than 1%.
5.07  Disbursements. Disbursements were spread over more than five years, even though the
scope of the project had been reduced. This compares well with the Zaire profile of seven
years but exceeds the disbursement period of four and a half years estimated at appraisal.
The original closing date of April 30, 1994, was advanced to February 28, 1994, and
disbursements against expenditures for works carried out before July 15, 1993, or for
studies and technical assistance carried out before November 15, 1994, were made until
January 5, 1994. The outstanding balance of SDR 2,936,094 has been canceled as of
February 28, 1994. Actual disbursements by year from the Credit compared with appraisal
estimates and Zaire profile are given in Part III, Table 3.
5.08  Credit Allocation. The actual disbursements for category 1-A, rural centers, relates to
only 8 centers instead of the 18 initially projected; this highlights the large increase in the
cost of the waterworks resulting from factors cited in paragraph 5.05 above. For similar
reasons, disbursements for category 1-B, Likasi, were also much higher than estimated
allocations. On the other hand, the use of funds under categories 2 (equipment and
supplies) and 3 (consultants' services, training, and studies) amounted to only 77% and 67%
of respective allocations. By closing, 91 percent of the loan was disbursed. The original
allocations by category and the actual disbursements under Credit 1939-ZR are shown in
Part III, Table 5.C.
6. Project Results
6.01   Project Objectives. The main project objective, which concerned the supply of water to
18 semi-rural centers, was not achieved, since only 8 centers had been equipped before the
works were stopped. REGIDESO undertook, however, as early as September 1993, a
minimum program for the equipment of 9 of the 10 centers which had been withdrawn from
the project, making use of already delivered pipes and equipment, and calling for private
initiative of concerned local communities; encouraging preliminary results suggest that most
of this project's initial objective will ultimately be attained. The project's main support
activities were carried out successfully.



- 7 -
6.02   Physical Results. The contrat-programme signed by GOZ and REGIDESO on May 5,
1988, whose clauses are linked to the Project Agreement signed on July 11, 1988,
established, among other things, the technical objectives of REGIDESO for subsequent
years. Table 6A of Part III compares, for each year between 1989 and 1992, estimated and
actual performance. Results include the following: (i) water production capacity is 10%
behind the objective; (ii) declining since 1991, the amount of water distributed in 1992 was
at only 79 percent of the initial objective; (iii) volume of water sold began declining as early
as 1990 to represent only 69 percent of the objective in 1992; (iv) technical yield, which fell
sharply in 1990, improved up slightly in following years but still remains below 70 percent;
(v) the relative proportions of surface and ground water stood relatively stable; (vi) the
number of house connections exceeded estimated levels, but the percentage of "inactive
connections" remained high (16 percent) because of delays in the water meter replacement
program; and (vii) the rate of standpipes installation was higher than estimated.
6.03  Financial Results.  The financial performance of REGIDESO  from  1989 to 1992,
compared with the objective of the contrat-programme, is summarized in Part III, Table
6B. In spite of REGIDESO's considerable efforts to accelerate settlement of GOZ's water
bills in arrears, the situation could not be improved before 1992. As to private customers,
the situation was satisfactory in 1989 and 1990, severely worsened in 1991, and finally
bounced back strongly in 1992. Thanks to a very watchful tariff policy, and in spite of
galloping inflation, the volume of water sales helped the working ratio remain under the
limit specified by the contrat-programme. The internal rate of return remained above the
minimum rate of 7% set by the Project Agreement, except in 1990 (6%); but this rate was
calculated by retaining only a provision for depreciation of non revalued fixed assets,
inconsistent with the Bank's method. The debt service capacity of REGIDESO stood below
the minimum ratio of 1.5 required by the Project Agreement, but this is due to the
acceleration of inflation; the same ratio in constant Zaires was well over 1.5.
6.04   Steady deterioration in the country's macro-economic situation, particularly the massive
depreciation of the NZ (New Zaire), and the accompanying enormous increases in the prices
of goods and services, gravely compromise the general financial stability of REGIDESO.
Indeed, while changes in expenditures fully reflect movements in the parallel market rate of
exchange, the tariff updating formula allows revenue adjustments to incorporate only a part
of this exchange rate impact. The drawing up of budget estimates under such conditions is
practically meaningless. Financial analysis cannot realistically be based on accounts drawn
up in New Zaire and would require instead accounts converted to US$ or SDR.
7. Project Sustainability
7.01   REGIDESO has courageously undertaken to achieve the implementation of the water
supply project for the 18 centers, by force account (TRAFOR) and with the contribution of
local communities. But these efforts may be short-lived: as of January 1994, out of the 88
centers operated by REGIDESO all over the country, 29 centers had been stopped on
account of lack of fuel, chemicals and spares. Given the present suspension of practically all
external financial assistance, and the general economic and financial situation of the country



does not improve, a general breakdown of water supply systems as early as the second
semester of 1994 is not an unlikely prospect.
7.02  Project support activities helped REGIDESO to better manage internal operations as well
as customers and enhance the maintenance of its water supply systems. With the needed
resources at its disposal, but more generally because of the courage and ingeniousness of its
staff, REGIDESO has, until now, been able to survive the crisis. Without an important
Government contribution, and because of lack of international assistance, all these efforts
could have been in vain, and years of investment in human resources, organization and
infrastructure will be lost.
8. Bank Performance
8.01  Notwithstanding the experience of previous projects, IDA appears to have overestimated,
at the time of project appraisal, CEMDAEP capability to carry out hydrogeological surveys
and to prepare tender documents. The cost of waterworks construction was significantly
higher than projected, due in part to longer project duration as well as the impact of
contingencies.
8.02  The riots and lootings of September/October 1991 made it clear that implementation of the
project in its entirety would not be possible. IDA reacted promptly proposing and actively
pursuing the project restructuring and reduction in scope. Because the project was retained
in the core IDA program of assistance to Zaire, being considered essential for the
maintenance of basic infrastructure and key social services, it received continuous support
and intense supervision by IDA staff until the suspension of disbursement in July 1993.
8.03  The project involved a total of 249.5 staff-weeks, a significant figure which emphasizes
IDA's efforts to ensure project supervision under typically difficult conditions. The details
of staff input and missions are given in Part III, Tables 8A and 8B.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01   As mentioned in paragraph 8.01, hydrogeological surveys and tender documents carried out
and prepared by CEMDAEP included important deficiencies which had an impact on
project cost and duration. On the other hand, CEMDAEP, which was in charge of works
supervision, often lacked the independence from REGIDESO, needed to carry out its task
in an appropriate way.
9.02  Despite extraordinary difficulties related to the country's conditions, which steadily
worsened during project implementation, REGIDESO fulfilled most of its obligations under
the Project Agreement, as seen in Table 7 of Part III. REGIDESO has showed all over the
project implementation sense of responsibility and clear vision on the sector development.



-9-
10. Project Relationship
10.01 IDA's relationship with REGIDESO was consistently excellent and reaffirmed the climate of
trust which had developed between them during the two previous projects. Relations
between REGIDESO and GOZ were often strained, principally because of difficulties in
obtaining enforcement of GOZ's financial obligations. In terms of other relationships, one
of the contractors posed a problem for REGIDESO, while relationships with consultants,
generally, were good.
11. Consultant Services
11.01 REGIDESO did not use consultants to prepare detailed project design and tender
documents, relying instead on the staff of CEMDAEP, assisted by a few expatriate
specialists. A Consultants Company did assist CEMDAEP in works' supervision, however,
and gave full satisfaction.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.01 Except for the reservations mentioned above in paragraph 8.01, the original documentation
for the project was adequate and appropriate. The appraisal report provided a useful
framework for IDA and REGIDESO for project implementation.

REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1939-ZR)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
(this is an English translation of the document originally written in French)



- 11 -
PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.0    Performance of the Borrower
The main obligations of the Borrower and REGIDESO are set forth in Sections 3.01(b), 3.04,
3.05(a) and 3.06 of the Credit Agreement and 2.05(c), 3.04, 4.02, 4.03(a), 4.03(b), 4.03(c), 4.04(a),
4.05(a), 4.05(b), 4.05(c) and 4.01(b) of the Project Agreement. Performance of these obligations is
discussed in item 7 of the Status of Covenants section in Part IV of the report on statistical
information. In addition to the obligations indicated above, the Borrower carried out those stipulated
in the general conditions regarding:
-     Section 9.03. Insurance.
The Borrower took steps to insure the imported supplies financed under the Credit against all
risks related to procurement, transport and the delivery of such supplies to their place of utilization or
installation.
The performance bonds established by the Intertropical Comfina firm enabled REGIDESO to
have delivered the equipment that was found to be missing at the time of delivery.
-      Section 9.04. Use of Supplies and Services
All supplies and services financed under the Credit were allocated exclusively to project
execution.
For the ten centers that could not be equipped and for which some of the materials were
missing in January 1993, REGIDESO decided to continue the program for equipping these centers
with private partners from those centers. As such, REGIDESO is now in the process of transferring
the equipment to the various project sites. Work started up at Mushie, one of the ten centers on
March 22, 1994.
-     Section 9.05. Drawings and Schedule
The bidding documents, procurement and project progress reports, etc. were made available
to the Bank by REGIDESO in a timely manner.
-     Section 9.06. Financial Statements and Reports
*     Each quarter, a report was sent to the Bank reflecting project status, its cost,
expenditures made under the Credit and supplies and services financed under
the Credit. At project closing, sixteen reports had been sent to the Bank.
*     The various supervision missions sent out by the Bank were able to visit
project worksites with the assistance of the Borrower.
Section 9.08. Acquisition of Land.
Land was made available to the project by the Borrower.



- 12 -
Local Costs
Local costs, totalled US$3,868,478, as against US$6,551,000, i.e. 59% of project estimates.
At the time of this evaluation, actual disbursements made for local costs totalled US$968,919,
i.e. 20% of amounts due. This low payment rate is due to:
*     the difficulties encountered by REGIDESO in implementing its cash flow plan. The
Government, whose water consumption accounts for nearly 60% of REGIDESO's
sales, continued to pay its invoices by bank draft in an economy where checks were
no longer a currently accepted means for such transactions;
*     the fact that the Government's counterpart tranche to the investment budget paid in
1993 to REGIDESO through the banking system has remained unutilized.
Provision of Administrative Documents by the Enterprises
The enterprises submitted the remission documents (documents d'exoneration) three months
behind schedule. This resulted in additional costs that were absorbed by the Credit.
2.  PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK
Project Preparation and Organization
After the studies were done by REGIDESO's internal consulting body, CEMDAEP, the
World Bank project manager, was pressed to review the documentation prepared by that office;
nevertheless, several deficiencies were detected during project implementation. However,
REGIDESO was satisfied with the services provided by its consulting office with regard to works
supervision.
With regard to project implementation, World Bank supervision was outstanding. Seventeen
supervision missions were made. The project was restructured several times in order to adapt it to
current conditions (major cost overruns during the execution of works and financial impact on the
project owing to the riots and lootings in September-October 1991 and January 1993).
The cost overrun in the main component was nearly 30%, of which 16 percentage points are
related to the compensation of enterprises and 14 points to the additional costs attributable to design.
Disbursements under the Credit
No complaints were received from the enterprises or consultants with regard to disbursements
under the Credit, which bears testimony to their satisfaction.
3.    RELATIONS BETWEEN REGIDESO AND IDA
The aides-memoires signed following the various World Bank missions recorded the mutual
concerns of the two parties.



- 13 -
The World Bank missions took REGIDESO's requests into account. Thus, during the more
recent restructurings of the project, the supply of spare parts and chemical products was envisaged.
A first delivery of 800 tons of alumina sulfate was made in March 1993, before the suspension of the
Credit in July 1993.
4.    CONSULTANT SERVICES
The World Bank agreed that REGIDESO would use its own project unit, CEMDAEP, for the
Third Water Supply Project. The unit prepared the studies through to the bidding documentation
stage, with the assistance of two expatriate engineers, who helped with the supervision of CEMDAEP
engineers and preparation of the water supply study documentation for the centers of Kalima,
Kamituga, and Kapanga and the city of Likasi.
In Kamituga and Likasi, there were major overruns with regard to works execution:
Kamituga (35 %) and Likasi (29%). Those overruns would suggest that the technical assistance to
CEMDAEP did not fully achieve its objective.
5.   RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE
5.1   Project Implementation Period
In order to avoid running behind schedule, on the one hand, and the additional costs incurred
by those delays, on the other, in the future when the project implementation period is determined,
difficulties of transportation associated with the current condition of infrastructure and physical
resources in Zaire should be taken into account.
5.2   Studies
The studies made by CEMDAEP with the assistance of the experts made available as part of
technical assistance should be approved by their respective consulting firms.
5.3    Rehabilitation
Future participation of the World Bank in the water supply sector should focus on
rehabilitation of existing water supply infrastructure, especially in the larger cities, in accordance
with the new Master Plan now being completed.
5.4   Project Completion
In the future, if during project implementation the World Bank decides to adopt measures
against the Borrower, any projects in mid-stream should be exempted until they are completed.
5.5    Project Fin-ncing
All disbursable expenditures (charges decaissables) should be covered by the World Bank
Credit.
