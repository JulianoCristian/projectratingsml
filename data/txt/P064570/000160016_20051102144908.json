Several lessons are derived from this project:\n            1) Preliminary sector work in new areas like cultural\n            heritage is essential to ensure adequate project design,\n            implementation plan and operational arrangements. 2) In a\n            new area of development, simplicity of design and clarity in\n            the selectivity and logic of the packaging of activities are\n            essential. 3) Cultural heritage programs highly benefit from\n            partnerships with key institutions with comparative\n            advantages. 4) Institutional reforms cannot take place\n            without seed money and a sustained flow of resources over a\n            period of time. 5) A mix of public and private funds is\n            necessary to ensure sector sustainability. 6) The support to\n            living arts played an important role in social cohesion."}, "docdt": "2005-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
