cultural heritage. The project has\n            three components. The first finances research preservation\n            (museums, manuscripts), rehabilitates buildings and sites,\n            and affords training in preservation architecture and\n            archives. The project supports the conservation and\n            valorization of cultural heritage assets through restoration\n            and preservation of archaeological and historic sites,\n            ancient manuscripts and libraries. The second component\n            promotes cultural heritage developing the craft and tourism\n            industries. It contributes to the revitalization of economic\n            activity in these areas by creating small scale enterprises\n            and by capitalizing on tourism potential. Moreover, popular\n            events such as music festivals, presentations of oral\n            traditions, poetry contests, and traditional dance\n            exhibitions may be held and, together with the production\n            and sale of artisanal objects, could provide important and\n            sustainable links between cultural preservation and income\n            generation. The third component, the cultural heritage\n            management component, establishes an appropriate\n            institutional and financial framework to elaborate the\n            cultural heritage strategy and operationalize it."}, "docdt": "2000-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
