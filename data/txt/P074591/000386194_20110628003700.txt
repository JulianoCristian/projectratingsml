       SECOND ULAANBAATAR SERVICES IMPROVEMENT PROJECT

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
This restructuring paper is to propose (i) a reallocation of IDA funds and (ii) an extension
of the closing date until December 31, 2011. The Borrower requested the restructuring of
the project through a letter from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), dated June 8, 2011.


PROJECT STATUS
The project was approved on April 29, 2004 and has made steady progress towards its
project development objectives. As of April 2011, nearly all the original components had
completed. The remaining three activities, namely the Household Water and Sewerage
Connections in Dambadarjaa ger area, installation of a Telemetry System in Central
Source, and installation of control and mechanical valves in the water network, are
expected to be finalized by the end of June 2011. The project has benefited more than
300,000 residents of ger areas of Ulaanbaatar by improving both access to water and
quality of water supply. More than 50% of water kiosks in ger areas are now connected
to the water supply network and serve 300 to 500 customers per day per kiosk. The
project is expected to meet its development objectives of providing improved water
supply to poor residents of ger areas.

The project also contributed to improving the operating performance of the Water Supply
and Sewerage Authority of Ulaanbaatar (USUG). Unit consumption of electricity has
been halved through replacement of pump station equipment, which has contributed to
reducing the utility’s electricity cost by 30%. Unaccounted for water was also reduced
from 24% in 2007 to 20% in 2009 by installing more water meters, using water more
efficiently, and providing continual training and public awareness. Although USUG’s
financial status is not yet stabilized, it had a net profit of TG 3.9 billion for 2010, mainly
from a tariff increase in 2010 and foreign exchange gains from foreign currency
denominated loans.


PROPOSED CHANGES
   •   Financing

           o   Reallocation

       The project has savings of SDR 978,000 (about US$1.5 million) from Works and
       Goods (a). The remaining funds are proposed to be used to: (i) prepare of a
       feasibility study for the proposed Third Ulaanbaatar Service Improvement Project
                                              6
       (USIP3); (ii) purchase additional equipment for USUG training center to train
       maintenance staff to improve the efficiency of operations; (iii) provide funds to
       meet the Project Management Unit (PMU) incremental cost to manage the project
       during the extension; (iv) hire local consultants to improve project management;
       and (v) train the MOF, the PMU and the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB) staff
       on topics relevant for public financing and project management. These activities
       will allow full disbursement of the Credit.

       Based on the above-mentioned proposal, the IDA funds need to be reallocated as
       follows:

   •   Closing date
       The Borrower has requested an extension of the closing date from June 30, 2011
to December 31, 2011 with three months of grace period. The proposed extension is
necessary to complete the additional activities described above. The Borrower has
submitted an action plan to complete the project within the time line. This will be the
second extension of the project, with a total extension of 18 months.
