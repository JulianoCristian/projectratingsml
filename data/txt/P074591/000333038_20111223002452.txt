1.      The closing date for Mongolia, Second Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement
Project (Credit No 3890-MOG, P074591) will be extended from December 31, 2011 until
February 29, 2012.

2.      The project was approved on April 29, 2004 and has made steady progress
towards its project development objectives. As of December 2011, almost all the original
components had been completed, including the Household Water and Sewerage
Connections in Dambadarjaa ger area, installation of a Telemetry System in Central
Source, and installation of control and mechanical valves in the water network. The
project also financed preparation of a feasibility study for the proposed Third Ulaanbaatar
Services Improvement Project (USIP3, FY12), additional equipment for a training center
of the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority of Ulaanbaatar (USUG). The project has
benefited more than 350,000 residents of ger areas of Ulaanbaatar by improving access to
safe water supply. More than 50% of water kiosks in ger areas are now connected to the
water supply network and serve 300 to 500 customers per day per kiosk. The project is
expected to meet its development objectives of providing improved water supply to poor
residents of ger areas.

3.     The proposed extension is necessary to complete the feasibility study for the
proposed USIP3. The consultant service contract was signed in September 2011, with
some delay in mobilization and assignment changes. The proposed extension will allow
the consultants to complete the feasibility studies and prepare detailed designs and
bidding documents for the proposed investments for the first few years.

4.    This will be the third extension of the project, and the total extension would be 20
months.
