This restructuring paper is states (i) a\n            reallocation of International Development Association (IDA)\n            funds; and (ii) an extension of the closing date until\n            December 31, 2011. The borrower requested the restructuring\n            of the project through a letter from the Ministry of Finance\n            (MOF), dated June 8, 2011. The project was approved on April\n            29, 2004 and has made steady progress towards its project\n            development objectives. As of April 2011, nearly all the\n            original components had completed. The remaining three\n            activities, namely the household water and sewerage\n            connections in Dambadarjaa ger area, installation of a\n            telemetry system in central source, and installation of\n            control and mechanical valves in the water network, are\n            expected to be finalized by the end of June 2011. The\n            project has benefited more than 300,000 residents of ger\n            areas of Ulaanbaatar by improving both access to water and\n            quality of water supply. More than 50 percent of water\n            kiosks in ger areas are now connected to the water supply\n            network and serve 300 to 500 customers per day per kiosk.\n            The project also contributed to improving the operating\n            performance of the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority of\n            Ulaanbaatar (USUG). The project has savings of SDR 978,000\n            (about US$1.5 million) from works and goods the borrower has\n            requested an extension of the closing date from June 30,\n            2011 to December 31, 2011 with three months of grace period.\n            The extension is necessary to complete the additional activities."}, "docdt": "2011-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
