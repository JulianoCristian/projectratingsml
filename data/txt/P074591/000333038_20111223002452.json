The closing date for project will be\n            extended from December 31, 2011 until February 29, 2012. The\n            project has benefited more than 350,000 residents of ger\n            areas of Ulaanbaatar by improving access to safe water\n            supply. More than 50 percent of water kiosks in ger areas\n            are now connected to the water supply network and serve 300\n            to 500 customers per day per kiosk. The project is expected\n            to meet its development objectives of providing improved\n            water supply to poor residents of ger areas. The extension\n            is necessary to complete the feasibility study for the\n            USIP3. The consultant service contract was signed in\n            September 2011, with some delay in mobilization and\n            assignment changes. The extension will allow the consultants\n            to complete the feasibility studies and prepare detailed\n            designs and bidding documents for the investments for the\n            first few years. This will be the third extension of the\n            project, and the total extension would be 20 months."}, "docdt": "2011-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
