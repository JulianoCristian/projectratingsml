                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Second Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement Project is to provide improved water supply to the urban poor in a sustainable manner.
                         Key indicators are: (a) number of persons served by each kiosk in the project ger areas; (b) percentage of kiosks in the project areas which are connected to the piped
                         network; and (c) financial status of USAG.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The Project has satisfactorily met its development objectives of providing improved water supply to poor residents of ger areas, although with some delays. People in target ger areas
                         are receiving continuous drinking water closer to home as judged by the indicator of having only 940 people per water kiosk surpassing the project target of 1,124 per kiosk, and

                         from zero percent in 2004 to 100% as of June 2011, surpassing the target of 88% of the kiosks on the network. The project also improved the energy consumption rates of the water
                         supply system. Unfortunately, some of these achievements took 20 months longer than foreseen and the sustainability of these achievements is somewhat in question as the water
