Services Improvement Project for Mongolia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            was intended to provide improved water supply service to the\n            urban poor. It is now clear that the government should have\n            provided subsidies for this kind of project. However, the\n            true nature of the project was not fully documented in the\n            project appraisal document, or PAD, and hence the municipal\n            government did not take any action to provide such\n            operational subsidies. This issue should have been dealt\n            with at appraisal, and the role of the government should\n            have been more clearly defined upfront. Prior to project\n            implementation, it is important to have clear guidelines on\n            cost sharing and responsibilities of households. Where\n            feasible, customers should contribute financially to\n            investments to foster their ownership. It is important that\n            the project owner educate users more proactively to inform\n            them of their responsibilities to maintaining the system.\n            One of the major design flaws of the pilot private\n            connections in Dambadarjaa was the estimation of water\n            consumption. The standards in the urban area are not\n            applicable for the current situation of ger areas. It is\n            important to establish and apply standards that are suitable\n            for ger areas."}, "docdt": "2012-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
