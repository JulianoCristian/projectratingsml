The main objective of the project was to\n            raise agricultural production and farm incomes through the\n            expansion of irrigated areas and the efficient utilization\n            of available watersupplies in two sub-project areas located\n            in the poorest drought-prone areas of Andhra Pradesh.To\n            achieve this objective, the project was to assist with the\n            further development of the Sriramasagar (SRS) scheme;\n            initiate and complete the development of a greater part of\n            the Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) scheme and introduce\n            improved design and operation principles as pre-conditions\n            to a reliable and equitable irrigation service. Some lesson\n            for future projects in the irrigation subsector learnt from\n            the experience of this project are: the Bank should strictly\n            enforce its own guidelines on the quality of project\n            preparation and appraisal. At project appraisal, water\n            supply availability and reliability must be unambiguously\n            established and command areas sized accordingly, and where\n            the project design is changed at appraisal (such as\n            elimination of the Gorakullu and Owk Reservoirs in this\n            case), the appraisal should specificallydetermine whether\n            the capacity (and cost) of other facilities should be\n            reduced, or left unchanged to facilitate possible system\n            expansion at a later date. Detailed designs for major works\n            based on adequate field surveys and subsurface\n            investigations must be available, cost estimates should be\n            realistic and based on market prices, and introduction of\n            new methods of system design and management - such as\n            structured irrigation networks (SIN) and rotational water\n            supply (RWS) - should be fully documented to ensure their\n            understanding and application by the Borrower. Appraisal\n            missions should rigorously review the implementing\n            organization's ability to adequately control\n            construction quality and to include in the project\n            appropriate remedial measures to ensure efficient operation\n            and water management; particular attention should also be\n            paid to establish viable institutional arrangements for\n            involvement of beneficiaries in participatory irrigation\n            management, and particularly where water delivery rights and\n            allocation arrangements are to be changed, an appropriate\n            legal, regulatory and administrative framework must be in\n            place to implement the new system of water allocation."}, "docdt": "1996-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
