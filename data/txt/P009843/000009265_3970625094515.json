(SRBC) Schemes.  Toward\n            this end, the project will help to modernize and complete\n            the existing irrigation network in 165,000 ha under the SRS\n            scheme and extend its irrigable area by  163,000 ha.  It\n            also will help in the development of 65,000 ha in the SRBC\n            Scheme.  Improved design and operation principles will be\n            introduced under this project to ensure a reliable and\n            equitable irrigation service to farmers through:  (i) the\n            introduction of new planning and design concepts; (ii)\n            changes in irrigation system operation; (iii) improved\n            management and maintenance standards; and (iv) the provision\n            of training facilities for operation and maintenance staff\n            and contact farmers."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
