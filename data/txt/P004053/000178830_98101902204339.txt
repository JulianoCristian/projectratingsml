REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPC6ED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A FIRST PORTS PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan of US$80 million equivalent to the Republic of Korea to help finance
a Ports project. The proceeds of the loan would be lent to the Government
for a term of 25 years, including a 5 year period of grace, with interest
at 71¼ percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.          The economy of Korea is dealt with in paragraphs 2-7 of the
President's Report of May 16, 1973 on a proposed development credit and loan
to the Republic of Korea for a Second Education Project (Report No. R73-105;
IDA/R73-50). An excerpt of the relevant paragraphs is attached to Annex I,
the Country Data Sheet.
PART II - BANK GROUT OPERATIONS IN KCREA
3.          As of May 31, 1973, Korea had received 18 Bank loans and IDA
credits for 15 projects amounting to US$330.5 million in loans and $107.0
million in credits (taking into account cancellations, the refinancing of
one IDA credit in a subsequent Bark loan, and the loan and loan/credit
approved on May 29).
4.          Of the $437.5 million, $174.2 million has been for the trans-
port sector - $119.7 million for railways and $54.5 million for highways.
The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) has received $95 million
in Bank loans for relending to private industry. $110.5 million has gone
to agricultural projects and the balance of $57.8 million to the education
sector.
5.          IFC has made four investments in Korea and its holdings amount
to US$8.0 million in loans and shares. IFC made its first equity invest-
ment to KDFC, of $0.7 million or 14 percent of KDFC's paid-in capital, at
the time when the Bank made its first loan to KDFC. IFC's latest invest-
ment in 1971, was a purchase of $0.6 million of the shares of the Korean
Investment and Finance Corporation - a new institution whose function is
to assist in the development of the capital and money markets. Prospects
for further IFC investments in Korea are good.



-2-
6.          Of total Bank/IDA lending, $200 million remained undisbursed
as of April 30, 1973.  Of this amount, more than two-thirds is attributable
to loans and credits made during the past two years. Disbursements under
most of these loans and credits are now progressing satisfactorily, and
are expected to accelerate in the near future.
7,          Generally, the projects are progressing satisfactorily.
Delay in the provision of local finance has been a problem with the Pyongtaek-
Kumgang and Yong San Gang irrigation projects, but adequate provisions have
been made for this calendar year and the requirements for future years will
be discussed by a supervision mission this summer,
8.          Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of April 30, 1973, and. notes on the execution of on-
going projects. For a review of Bank Group operations planned for Korea for
the future, reference is made to paragraphs 14-17 of the President's Report
of May 16, 1973, on the proposed Second Education Project (excerpted and
attached to Annex II).
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
9,          Historically the railways and, to a lesser extent, coastal
shipping, have been the two major modes of transportation in Korea. In
1971, the railways handl-ld about 49 percent of total domestic freight
(ton-km) while coastal shipping carried about 30 percent - up from 5 percent
in 1962. In both instarces, bulk freight predominated. The railways' pre-
eminent position stems from the fact that domestic natural r'esources, e.g.
coal, iron ore and limestone, are located in the north, northeast and center
of the country and require bulk transport to the industrial areas located
in and around Seoul-Inchon and Busan. Coastal shipping is also concerned
with the movement of coal, fuel oil, cement, and limestone, particularly
to and from the major ports. Road transport, hampered by a relatively un-
developed road system, plays a much less important role in freight trans-
port but, in 1971, carried about 70 percent of all passenger traffic (pass-km).
10.         With the rapid expansion of the Korean econory, traffic has
grown rapidly. In terms of ton-kms, domestic freight increased 3.4 times,
from 4.6 billion to 15.8 billion, between 1962 and 1971. Railway traffic
nearly doubled, highway traffic increased 3.5 times while coastal shipping
grew to 20 times its 1962 volume in this period spurred by industrial
development in coastal areas and shortages of railway capacity. Passenger
traffic has also grown sharply, though less spectacularly, with the bulk
of the increase accruing to road transport.
11.          Investmeats in transport infrastructure did not keep pace
with requirements in the First Five-Year Plan period (1962-66) and severe
bottle-necks developed.   Tnis was remedied to a considerable extent in the
Second Five-Year Plan (1967-71) in which 26 percent of total capital form-
ation was allocated to transport.   The current Third Five-Year Plan provides



- 3 -
for further increase in transport investment. Road transport development
has been particularly hampered by relatively low levels of expenditure in
recent years. Most investments have been concentrated on the construction
of limited access expressways, leaving the bulk of the road system badly
aligned, poorly drained and either roughly surfaced with gravel or un-
surfaced; only 10 percent of the total network is paved. At the same
time, restrictions on the import of vehicles until 1967 severely limited
the expansion of the road transport fleet. Increased emphasis on road
development, in which the Bank is actively participating, and the greater
availability of vehicles, facilitated by domestic assembly, is responsible
for the substantial growth in road transport in recent years.
12.         With the rapid expansion of traffic and the consequent invest-
ment in all modes of transport, there has been an acute need for improve-
ment in transport planning and coordination. Substantive issues relating
to investment planning, and important policy measures, have not received
adequate attention. Part of the problem has been that transport coordi-
nation has not received sufficient support from senior Government officials.
The Bank has made a major effort over the past few years to convince the
Government of the need for proper planning and coordination. The Loan
Agreement for the Fourth Railway loan signed in November 1972 provides for a
review of the functions and work program of the Transport Planning Office
(TPO) in the Ministry of Transportation. This review is proceeding satisfac-
torilv. and will be further checked by a mission that will go to Korea this
month for supervision of the railway project.
13.         While all forms of transport have felt the impact of the fast-
growing Korean economy, the greatest pressure has been on the port facilities
which have had to handle not only very substantial increases in donestic coastal
shipping movements but also a spectacular growth in foreign trade. In 1962,
the total freight handled by the ports amounted to 7.5 million tons. In
less than a decade (1971) the total had become 51 million tons - a seven-
fold increase.
14.          Expansion in port capacity has not been sufficient to meet the
rapid growth of traffic, and cargo-handling is inefficient and costly, due
in large part to poor management of the ports. There has been a tendency
to spread expenditures among the various ports, and this has reduced the
effectiveness of the investments made.
15.          In recognition of the problems in the ports sub-sector - the
need for expansion of physical facilities and organizational changes - a
port development study financed by UNDP was initiated in May 1971 and
completed in November 1972. The Bank was executing agency for this study
which has led to a recommended investment plan for Korea's first class
ports and to the present project at Busan and Mukho. The study identified
the principal causes of the inefficiency of the ports and made specific
recommendations for major changes in the structure of port administration,
management and operating procedures and financial control of the ports.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
16.         Following the completion of the UTDP - financed consultants'
study, a Bank appraisal team visited Korea in November/December 1972.
Negotiations were held in April 1973 with a Government delegation headed
by Mr. S.K. Lee of the Economic Planning Board and including Mr. S. Chung
of the Ministry of Construction and Mr. S.H. Park of the Ministry of
Transport. Annex III provides a loan and project summary. The appraisal
report of the proposed project is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors.
17.          The proposed project, which is part of the Third Development
Plan (1972-76) has been designed to reduce cargo handling and shipping costs
of existing exports, imports and coastal trade, and to meet the requirements
for increased port capacity resulting from implementation of the Third Plan.
The project consists of improvements and new works at the ports of Busan
and Mukho. At Busan two new piers would be constructed, one for containers
and grain traffic including storage silos and specialized handling equip-
ment, the other for dry bulk traffic including coal, ore, minerals, scrap
and heavy steel, with appropriate mechanized handling systems. The access
channels to the two piers would be dredged. An international ferry terminal
with facilities for passenger and roll-on/roll-off traffic (principally to
and from Japga)is included as are coastal ferry berths. One existing pier
and part of a second one would be rehabilitated to improve operating condi-
tions for bulk cargo. Also, a new militarv berth would be constructed
(financed entirely by the Government) to free for commercial use existing
piers in the project area, now being used for military purposes.
18.          At Mukho two new coal piers would be built, new coal loaders
provided and the conveyor system improved; dredging and strengthening of a
breakwater would also be included. The project also includes consulting
services for detailed design and supervision of the proposed work; for a
Phase II development study; for technical assistance for the formulation of
policies and procedures for a Port Authority; and for on-the-job training
of personnel.
19.          A Korean Port Authority (KPA) would be established reporting
to the Ministry of Transport. It would eventually control all of Korea's
17 first class ports, but would be limited to the two project ports ini-
tially.  Pending the appointment of the Director General and setting up
of KPA (by June 1975) it has been agreed that elements of the Ministry
of Transport (MOT) and Ministry of Construction bureaus concerned with
port matters would be merged as the Busan-Mukho Project Unit under MOT.
It is expected that the nucleus of KPA staff would come from -the Project
Unit.
20.          Lyon Associa'es (USA) has been appointed by the Government
for final design and construction supervision,
2-           The project is scheduled for completion by June 1978.  The
estimate of total cost for the project is $131.0 million of which $87.5
nillion (including $7.5 million for the military berth provided by the



- 5 -
Government) is required in foreign exchange, and $43.5 million in local
currency. These estimates are net of import duties and taxes.
22.         The proposed Bank loan of $80.0 million would cover the entire
foreign exchange requirements of the project, except for the military berth.
The Government would provide the funds to cover the fuIl local currency costs,
plus the foreign exchange costs of the military berth.
23.         All contracts (except for the military berth) would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding. The Government has
indicated that import duties would not be levied on project items. Domestic
manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent or the
existing customs duty, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f price of competing
imports.
24.         Disbursement would be for actual foreign expenditures on equip-
ment and consultants' contracts, and 61 percent (the estimated foreign ex-
change component if all contracts go to foreigners) of total expenditures on
project civil works. If all civil works contracts were let to Korean con-
tractors, the foreign exchange component of project civil works would go
down from 61 percent to 50 percent. In that case, up to $7.2 million of the
proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against local currency ex-
penditures.
25.         The proposed KPA would be expected to operate on a commercial
basis and to be financially viable without Governmental subsidies. Following
the consultants' study, a financial rate of return for KPA as a whole would
be agreed among the Bank, the Borrower and KPA to enable KPA to generate
sufficient funds to cover operating costs, debt service and a reasonable
portion of its future capital investment requirements, including replacements.
To cover similar costs specifically at the project ports of Busan and Mukho,
it has been agreed that KPA would earn at Busan and Mukho by 1978 a 6 percent
financial rate of return on net fixed assets.
26.         The engineering consultants are expected to begin work in June
1973 on the basis of terms of reference and a contract satisfactory to the
Bank. No retroactive financing will be involved.
27.         The proposed project has been designed to meet the need for in-
creased port capacity and to reduce cargo handling and shipping costs of
present and future exports, imports and coastal trade. Project benefits
have been calculated as the difference in directly quantifiable port user
costs with and without the project. Indirect benefits that may be induced
within the non-port sector of the economy are not quantifiable and have
been excluded.
28.         Even after excluding the portion of the benefits to foreign
carriers that cannot be recouped by Korea through higher port charges and/or
reduced freight rates for its exports and imports, the rate of economic re-
turn is about 32 percent. It would still be about 26 percent if costs in-
creased by 15 percent.



-6-
29.        The project should have no adverse ecological effects.   Material
dredged from the harbor would be used in the construction of the piers. The
use of containers at Busan made possible by the project should increase the
average load per vehicle and thus reduce the number of vehicles that would
otherwise be required to serve the port.
30.        The introduction of bulk handling methods at Busan and the in-
creased efficiency at Mukho would reduce the manpower needed for certain port
work. Consultants will recommend how to achieve the staffing reduction.
Reduced employment in the ports is expected to be offset by employment oppor-
tunities created indirectly by the greater throughput of goods made possible
by the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
31.         The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans
for port projects.
32.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreemen- of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
33.          I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

THE ECONOMY
(Paragraphs 2-7 of the President's Report of May 16, 1973, on a proposed
development credit and loan to the Republic of Korea for a Second Education
Project, Report No. R73-105; IDA/R73-50.
2.          The latest economic report ("The Economic Situation and Prospects
of the Republic of Korea", EAP-33a, distributed under cover of R72-243,
dated November 9, 1972) comments on Korea's commendable achievement in
economic developmemt, particularly since the middle of the 1960's, and notes
that Korea's economy is in transition from a pattern of high investment and
growth to one of more moderate growth and greater stability. The most
important feature of the transitional phase has been a slowdown in ecanomic
activity since the middle of 1971, partly as a result of the Government's
stabilization policy. GNP growth in 1972 was 7.9 percent compared with the
average 11.4 percent in the previous five years. The 1972 growth rate was
the lowest since 1966, mainly because of slower expansion of industrial
production (16 percent, compared with the average 21 percent during the
previous five year period), and a downturn in investment (which was 5 percent
less tan in 1971).
3.          The Government's stabilization efforts, particularly the measures
taken last August to stop inflation and to moderate the disruptive financial
impacts of the slowdown on Korea's industrial sector, seem to be working
successfully to bring about a favorable environment for stable growth.
Prices have been stable since last August, compared to increases of 13 per-
cent in 1971 and 8½ percent in 1972. Recent international currency revalu-
ations may, however, cause some unavoidable upward pressure, but this
should not jeopardize basic price stabilization provided the Government
contimues to follow its stabilization program. Signs of recovery in
industrial production and investment were visible towards the end of 1972
and a somewhat..higher pace of economic expansion is expected for 1973.
The external trading environment also seems favorable and is expected to
accommodate expansion without a recurrence of balance of payments
difficulties.
4.           Two aspects of stabilization policy require continued emphasis in
the future. First, domestic savings mobilization which has emerged as a
major constraint on future economic development, must be pursued with vigor.
In the process of economic slowdown in the past two years the savings ratio
dropped from 18 percent in 1969-70 to 143½ percent. Undoubtedly it will
recover somewhat this year, as the pace of business activity accelerates,
but long-run improvement depends very much on further refinement of the
financial system, particularly the development of capital markets and, more
important, continued success in controlling inflation. The Government is
already making valuable contributions to this end through a restrained 1973
budget and through measures aimed at improving and diversifying savings
instruments. Second, in the light of the expected investment revival, it
is important to keep overall investment under restraint for some time to
come so that the objectives of the stabilization policies are not jeopardized.
The Government's investment policy for 1973 takes this into account and
emphasizes increases in agricultural and manufacturing investment while



ANNEX I
Page 4 of 4
restraining investment in social overhead and services. In view of the need
to strengthen further the industrial structure and also to correct urban/
rural income disparities through increased rural development, this investment
policy stance is appropriate and should be maintained.
5.          If the econoqy is managed along the lines discussed above, a
gradual but definite improvement in the balance of payments can be expected
in the coming years. With strong import demands from the United States and
Japan - Korea's major export markets - exports increased by about 40 percent
in 1972. They are expected to continue to expand rapidly in 1973, although
perhaps not at te   972 rate.  A larger and more diversified industtial
sector will be able to provide the needed export capability and to assist
import substitution efforts, particularly in intermediate industrial goods.
Although increases in imports also are expected as the economy recovers,
the trend towards closing the trade gap seems already established. With
some loss in exchange earnings related to the military establishment in
Korea and Vietnam and also with the increase in debt payments, external
borrowing requirements are expected to be particularly large in the next
two years, about $900 million gross a year. At this level they will remain
within manageable limits, both in terms of Koreats debt-carrying capacity
and the availability of external finance. Borrowing requirements could
begin to decline after 1975 and the debt service ratio, now at about 18 per-
cent, is expected to decrease gradually to the neighborhood of 14-15 percent
by 1976, due mainly t) the favorable export outlook.
6.           The Government's external borrowing policy aims at increasing the
proportion of external finance provided by official lenders to the agri-
cultural and social sectors with a view to improving further the average
borrowing terms. This policy is also intended to accommodate changing
resource requirements. Also, with more modest growth targets, increased
emphasis on rural works and a gradual shift towards producing its own
capital goods, Korea's reed for external loans to finance imported machinery
and equipment for large projects will be reduced, although the total amount
of industrial investment and the foreign exchange requirements thereof,
will remain high in absolute amounts.  Thus, lending for industrial
investment through development finance companies, as in the KDFC loan
also being presented today, will be a particularly appropriate way to
assist the Korean economy over the next few years.
7 .         At the same time, a higher proportion of official loans in total
borrowing will require greater efforts by the Government to prepare projects;
and official lenders will need to provide a larger proportion of their
financial assistance in a form usable for local expenditure. In these
circumstances, some local currency expenditure financing by the Bank Group
is appropriate.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
1.        Loan No. 600      Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project;  US$45.0 million
Loan of May 23, 1969
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This is the first major irrigation project constructed in Korea.    It
will irrigate 35,250 ha of land, improve drainage and roads, consolidate all
paddy fields, bench all upland and reclaim 4,400 ha of tidal land with the project.
The start of construction was postponed by a major reorganization of the executing
agency and delay in hiring consultants; the project is now one year behind
schedule.   Disbursement is 50 percent behind even when a one-year postponement
is applied to the appraisal report schedule.Construction, hoTwever, is now progress-
ing satisfactorily.   A well-planned agricultural develop-ment program is being
implemented.   Shortfalls and delays in Won appropriation caused some delays in
the past.   After strong Bank requests to the Economic Planning Board for correc-
tive action, adequate funds for 1973 have been provided and the requirements and
provisions for future years will be reviewed this summer.
2.        Credit No. 151   First Education Project;   US$14.8 million Credit of
June 4T, 1969
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project provides for the expansion and equipment of 27 technical
high schools, 5 post secondary technical schools and 4 university teacher training
departments.   It also includes 26 man-years of technical assistance, 20 man-years
of overseas fellowships to support developments agricultural and/or technical
education and to assist educational planning.    The project is about 18 months
behind schedule because, in the initial stages of project implementation, delays
occurred in organizing the project unit, selecting and appointing the consultant
architects and establishing equipment procurement procedures.    The project is now
progressing satisfactorily, but it is expected that, because of the initial delays,
it will be completed about one year later than estimated at the time of appraisal.
This may require an extension of the Closing Date by about six months to June 30,
1975.
3.        Loan No. 669      Third Railway Project;  US$40.0 million Loan and
Credit No. 183   US$15.0 million Credit of May 14, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 1972
The project finances part of the last two years of Korea National
Railroads'1967-71 investment program.    The bulk of the loan and credit was ear-

diesel locomotives, telecommunications and track maintenance equipment. Progress
is generally satisfactory except for delays in the procurement of some equipment
under the loan.
4.        Credit No. 234   Integrated Dairy Beef Development Project;
US$7.0 million Credit of February 11, 1971
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The development of about 700 small and medium dairy farms by pro-riding
long-term loans and the construction and operation of two dairy products processing
plants are the essential elements of the project.   There are also management and
technical services related to these activities.   The project is progressing
satisfactorily.   To date, nearly 200 Korean farmers are participating;  two
international purchases of 1,600 dairy heifers have been completed; international
competitive bidding for dairy processing equipment (close to US$1 million) has
been accomplished; planning and construction of civil works for two dairy
processing plants are well underway; technical services are being strengthened;
and applied research for livestock production is already bringing significant
results.
5.        Loan No. 622 &   Second and Third KDFC Projects;   US$20.0 and US$30.0
Loan No. 735     million Loans of June 26, 1969 and May 17, 1971
respectively
Closing Dates: June 30, 1973 and August 31, 1975
respectively
The second loan is fully committed and the third is almost fully com-
mitted. These projects are progressing satisfactorily.
6.        Loan No. 769     First Highways Project;  US$54.0 million Loan of
June 29, 1971
Closing Date: November 30, 1975
The project includes building approximately 230 miles of primary national
highway between Chonju and Busan; feasibility studies of about 870 miles; and
detailed engineering of an additional 680 miles.    A highway maintenance study
will also be undertaken and a national highway maintenance organization established
on a pilot basis in one of the provinces.   Construction in progress is on schedule
and within cost estimates.
7.        Loan No. 795     Yong San Gang Irrigation Project; US$33.0 million Loan and
Credit No. 283   US$15.0 million Credit of February 2, 1972
Closing Date:  September 30, 1977
This is the second major irrigation project financed by the Bank in Korea.

t aims at trans'rorming an area w`thi the highest drought frequency in Korea
in r,o one wJinth year-round irrigation and crop diversification. Also there
w-ili be iLc-eased production of high value crops.  Ihe L an/Credit became
effective on September 15, 1972.   Consultants are irn the field and detailed
survey-ing an_ designing are proceeding satisfactorily.  Cost estimates have
increased by about 40 percent mainly because more dam foundation grouting will
be required than expected at appraisal and major changes in designs have been
made.  About 1,h00 ha of additional land have been added to the project
through revision of original canal lines, thereby offsetting the increased
costs.  Construction is expected to begin in May 1973.   Insufficient funds
were budgeted originally for 1973, but the Government after Bank urging has
provided adequate Won financing for the year so that construction can proceed
on shedule. The provisions for future years will be discussed tUhis summer.

BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN KOREA
(An excerpt of paragraphs 14-17 of the President's Report of May 16, 1973,
on a proposed development credit and loan to the Republic of Korea for a
Second Education Project, Report No. R73-105 ITA/73-50.
14.          The two major emphases of Korea's Third Plan - correction of the
income disparities between the urban industrial sector and the rural agri-
cultural sector through increased agricultural investments and a program to
move from light to heavy industrial development - are supported by the Bank's
economic analysis and the Froposed lending program therefore concentrates on
the agricultural and lidustrial sectors. Also, infrastructure will need to
be developed concurrently. Even though the transport sector will receive
less emphasis than in the past, the absolute amounts of investment required
are large and thus there is also considerable support for the transport
sector in the program.
15.           Seven projects are tentatively in the operations program for
F11974. Three of these, a seeds production project, a tourism project and a
highways project, have already been appraised. The remaining four (an agri-
cultural products processing project, the Korean Development Bank project,
an industry project, and an urban development project) are expected to be
appraised before the end of calendar year 1973.
lc.          The annual level of Bank Group support through FY1976 is fore-
cast to be appreciably above the level of the past three years. As indi-
cated in Part I, the resource gap and consequently the necessary aid flows
may decline after 1976.  The Government has the option, however, to seek a
higher growth path based on continued net aid inflows.
17.          The Consultative Group in Korea continues to be active.  It
appears ftiat adequate official external finance will be available for the
next two years at least. The U.S. and Japan are expected to continue to be
the principal bilateral sources for external finance.
