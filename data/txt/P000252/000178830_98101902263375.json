(Fonds de\n            Development Rural -- FDR) for investment in small-scale\n            rural projects, the main purpose of which would be to\n            increase crop production and improve village water supplies.\n            Program activities have been tentatively determined and\n            would include: bottomland development (2,700 ha); erosion\n            control works (9,200 ha); small-scale irrigation and\n            improved bottomland development (500 ha); construction of\n            520 wells, 180 tubewells, 400 village warehouses and 20\n            village centers; provision of medium-term credit for\n            agricultural equipment, US$0.5 million equivalent; and\n            provision for unidentified projects. In addition, studies\n            for economic development of areas freed from onchocerciasis\n            would also be financed under the project."}, "docdt": "1976-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
