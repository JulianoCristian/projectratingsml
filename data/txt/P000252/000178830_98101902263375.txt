REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT Fo THI- -:iCLT[V\'L
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF
UPPER VOLTA FOR A SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Upper Volta for the equivalent of
US$9.4 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a second rural devel-
opment fund project. The Banque Arabe pour le Developpement Economique en
Afrique (BADEA) is contributing US$4.5 million to the project. The BADEA
loan is expected to be made for a term of 25 years, including 5 years of
grace, at an interest rate of 2% per annum. Technical assistance will be
provided on a grant basis by the Dutch Government French Aid (FAC) and the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
PART I: THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        The latest economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Development Prospects of Upper Volta" was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 7, 1975 (RN 564a-UV). Annex I contains country data.
3.        With a per capita GDP of about USS80 in 1974, Upper Volta is
classified bv the United Nations as one of the 25 "least developed coun-
tries." The country's economy faces serious growth constraints due to
harsh natural conditions and a very modest resource base. These disadvan-
tages also explain [Ipper Volta's relatively poor economic performance. For
the period 1964-73, annual growth of GDP was estimated at 2.2%, about the
same rate as annual population increase in the same period, and per capita
income has thus stagnated.
4.        The economic structure has undergone little change over the past
decade: agriculture and livestock provide a living for over 90% of the
population but account for less than half of GDP. The modern manufacturing
sector accounts for about 10% of GDP. Savings capacity and actual savings
performance of the economy are low, and consumption usually absorbs 95%
to 100% of GDP. Investment has therefore been mostly financed by foreign
capital. The country's external trade deficit has been widening in recent
years and reached a record level of about 15% of GDP in 1975.
5.        The basic problem facing the country's rural sector, apart from
low and irregular rainfall and distance from the sea, is an uneven popula-
tion distribution with respect to avallable resources. About 61% of the
total population (3.5 million people) live in the central region (Mossi Pla-
teau), which comprises only 34% of the total area and which is much less fa-
vorably endowed than the southern and southwestern regions from the viewpoint
of both rainfall and soil quality. The ocurrence of riverblindness in the
country's river valleys explains in part the concentration of population on the
Mossi plateau. An important component of the country's long-term development

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



strategy is to redistribute population, and the riverblindness control prograr'
which aims to destroy the vector which transmits the disease, is an important
aspect of this strategy. Meanwhile, the improvement of living and production
conditions on the Mossi plateau, through the financing of small projects,
remains a matter of high priority.
Recent Economic Developments
6.        The intensified drought of 1972/73 caused a severe setback in
agriculture and livestock. Production of food grains (sorghum and millet)
dropped by more than 20%, calling for emergency food imports of about
100,000 tons. Output of cotton, the most important cash and export crop,
fell by one-third. Drought-related herd losses were estimated at 10%.
With near-normal rainfall in 1974, crop production rebounded but, recovery
in the livestock sector is much slower.
7.         Inspite of a growing external trade deficit, the overall balance
of payments was in surplus until 1974 due to increasing inflows of foreign
capital and workers' remittances from the Ivory Coast. Over the past seven
years, the latter has represented on average between one-third and one-half
of the aggregate of private and public net transfers.      In 1975, the overall
balance of payments showed a deficit for the first time since 1968.
8.         Over the period 1968-74, Covernment's financial position has been
relatively strong as a result of a conservative spending policy, French budget
subsidies, and surpluses generated by autonomous public institutions, in par-
ticular the Price Stabilization Fund for Agricultural Products. At the end
of 1974, public sector deposits with the banking system stood at CFAF 9.3 bil-
lion (US$38.7 million), equivalent to about three-fourths of the correspond-
ing year's current revenue.
9.         To some extent this financial performance by Government had a neg-
ative impact on economic progress. Recurrent expenditures for a number of
essential economic services, such as, for example, agricultural extension,
have been kept very low, and the capacity of various Government agencies to
participate in the financing of externally-aided development projects has been
restricted. The need for a more aggressive, development-oriented expenditure
policy is recognized by the Government. An important manifestation of this
new orientation was the establishment in January 1975 of the Caisse Nationale
des Depots et des Investissements (CNDI) which is designed to mobilize savings
from both public and private bodies and to channel them into public infra-
structure projects and other economically and financially profitable under-
takings. During the first six months of its existence, this new institution
committed CFAF 2.5 billion (US$11.8 million) for various development proj-
ects. It aims at annual commitments of around CFAF 3.2 billion (US$15.1
million) for the next five years. Meanwhile, public sector deposits with
the banking system dropped dramatically in the course of 1975, mainly because
of special defense expenditures for the border conflict between Mali and Upper
Volta. It is too early yet to assess if this decline in public sector depos-
its will be temporary and how it will affect CNDI.



Foreign Aid
10.       During the period 1968-1973, Upper Volta received annual averaL- aid
inflows of about IUS$36.0 million from its major donors: France, the European
Development Fund, Canada, Cermany, USA, IL)A and the UNDP.    About 85' of all
aid has been in the form of grants, and, of the remaining 15%, 907, has been
loans on concessionary terms. Investment aid accounted for about two-thirds of
the total, followed by technical assistance (20%). In 1974 and 1973, annual
average aid inflows were double the annual average for the period 1968-73, the
sharp increase being due to drought-related relief operations and inflation.
11.       Public investment, which represents the bulk of all investment in
the economy, has been financed mainly by foreign aid. Donors accounted for
more than two-thirds of total public sector investment under the first Devel-
opment Plan (1967-70), and are expected to finance about four-fifths of total
investment under the current Development Plan (1972-76).     IDA is gradually
becoming one of the main sources of aid: its total commitments presently
stand at US$47.2 million.
12.        External public debt at the end of 1974 stood at US$138.0 million,
including an undisbursed amount of US$92.0 million. The ratio of debt service
payments to exports of goods and non-factor services was about 6% in 1973, and
1974. This ratio is expected to increase somewhat in the near future, but debt
service will remain manageable. The Association's share in Upper Volta's
public external debt at the end of 1974 (including undisbursed amounts) was
about 23%, but the Association's share in debt service is still relatively
insignificant.
Development Policies and Prospects
13.       Like the first Plan, the current Plan (1972-76) is well conceived
and essentially project-oriented; its targets are moderate but realistic (GDP
was expected to grow only 3.5% p.a.). The Plan assigns top priority to the
development of the rural sector.   H1owever, external factors such as the
drought and worldwide inflation have adversely affected the economy during the
plan period, and actual growth (2%) has been less than expected. Lack of
operating funds, limited administrative capacity, and shortfalls in project
preparation have also impeded achievement of plan targets.
14.       The Government has recently drawn up guidelines for the next Devel-
opment Plan (1977-81) conceived in a longer-term "perspective" for tackling
the country's structural problems. Rural development in the broadest sense,
including the resettlement of people in the riverblindness-freed zones, will
continue to occupy center stage. Education and emplovment will be given
higher priority than in the past, and close linkage between the two will be
actively sought in the form of a production-oriented education systen, the
content and form of which have yet to be determined. Increased mineral



- 4 -
developnent is also one of Governmient's objectives. It has been decided
in principle to go ahead witlh the Tambao manganese mining project, but
financing of the railway linking the proposed mine with the existing rail-
wav network has not vet been secured. Following a recent reshuffle of the
Cabinet (February 9, 1976), a separate Hinistry of Planning has been estab-
lished, which confirms the Government's intention to use the Plan as the
principal guide for the preparation and implementation of projects and pol-
icies.
15.       Foreign capital and technical assistance will continue to play a
vital role in the development of Upper Volta.    In view of the country's
poverty and limited growth potential, they should be provided on as conces-
sionary a basis as possible.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONiS
16.       To date, the Bank Group's contribution to Upper Volta's develop-
ment has consisted of ten IDA projects totaling US$47.2 million, of which
US$14.5 million has been disbursed as at April 30, 1976. Annex Il contains
a summary statement of these credits as at April 30, 1976, as well as notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Experience with ongoing projects has been good, apart fron the
rural education project, where there was considerable initial delay. The
Bank Group's strategy in Upper Volta is dictated by the extreme poverty of
the country and the need to raise productivity in agriculture and livestock,
on which the bulk of the population depends for a livelihood. Some basic
infrastructure is required for the operation of the economy, and the IDA
projects for telecommunications and road construction and improvement are
designed to help in providing this. For the rest, IDA lending is directed
primarily to projects in agriculture, education and rural development, and
although emphasis is given to operations which will favor movements of
people away from the overpopulated and ecologically disadvantaged central
plateau to the southwest where conditions are better, the proposed project
recognizes the need and the possibility to improve agricultural production
and village water supplies on the Mossi plateau through small agriculture
and rural subprojects.
18.       In addition to the proposed project, a number of other operations
are under consideration for IDA financing. A third highway project has been
appraised.    A follow-up to the West Volta Cotton project, which will take the
form of an integrated agricultural development project, will be appraised in
the fall of 1976. The appraisal of a joint Urban/DFC project, which will
enable Government to demonstrate the validity of its low-cost approach to
urban development and combine this approach with employment creation in urban
centers, is planned for late fall 1976.

19.       The campaign for the controL of tiverblindness in the Volta River
Basin is opening up new opportunities for investment in land settlement
and agricultural development. The proposed project provides for studies
for the economic development of areas freed fron onchocerciasis.
PART III: AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
20.       Upper Volta has a traditional and overwhelmingly rural economy:
the great bulk of its labor force is composed of self-employed farmers and
pastoralists and their families. Yet, farming is difficult because of erra-
tic rainfall and a prolonged dry season; poor or shallow soils; and farming
systems that generally have not evolved beyond shifting cultivation with
little use of cash inputs. Consequently, productivity is low in the agri-
cultural sector, and while agriculture and livestock provide a living for
96% of the population, the sector generates less than 45% of the GDP.
21.        Crop farming provides a living for almost 90% of the population,
accounting for about 31% of GDP and 45% of total export earnings. By con-
trast, livestock is the occupation of only 6% of the population but produces
a relatively high share of GDP (10% to 12%), and provides about one-third
to one-half of export earnings. However, in spite of the predominantly
rural economy, foodgrain imports are important and represent about 20% of
total import value in normal years and substantially more when drought
occurs. Average annual imports during the period 1969-71 amounted to
some 40,000 tons of grain. Of these, about 26,000 tons were wheat and
flour which cannot be grown in Upper Volta except with irrigation. At
the height of the Sahelian drought, as much as 100,000 tons of annual
grain imports were required.
22.       The 1971-1973 drought period caused economic growth first to
stagnate and then to decline. This disruption followed an already low
rate of growth in the preceding six years. In addition, the drought
exacerbated the existing disparities between the densely populated cen-
tral plateau lands (Mossi plateau) and the western and southwestern and
to a lesser extent eastern regions of the country, which because of river-
blindness are less populated but have more fertile soils and generally
higher rainfall.
23.       Approximately 2.2 milion hectares are under cultivation, with
cereals representing 80% of agricultural production. The most striking
feature is the sharp regional contrast: in the center and northern zones,
farming, basically the production of sorghum, millet and groundnuts, is at
subsistence level due to high populations, poor soils and irregular rain-
fall. Conversely, in the western and southwestern regions, production is



more diversified and market oriented as farming conditions and soils are
more favorable and population density is lower. Cotton, the most important
cash crop and a major export, is grown mainly in the western and southwest-
ern regions.
24.       Livestock constitutes one of the country's principal exports.
Annual milk and meat production is estimated at 100,000 tons and 54,000
tons respectively; and average domestic per capita meat consumption is
estimated at 8.6 kg, half of which is beef. On the Mossi plateau, farmers
are increasingly turning to fattening cattle with crop residues and by-
products. Most farmers keep small stock, including goats, sheep, pigs
and poultry which live by scavenging.
Agricultural Planning, Research and Project Implementation
25.       The country is divided into eleven Regional Development Organiza-
tions (Organismes Regionaux de Developpement-ORDs), public agencies admi-
nistered by their own boards of directors comprising appointed government
officials and representatives of local authorities and farmers. Except for
the valleys of the three Volta rivers, ORDs are responsible for planning
and implementing all agricultural operations in their regions; they are
supervised by the Ministry of Rural Development. An autonomous Volta Val-
leys Development Authority (Autorite pour l'Amenagement des Vallees des
Volta -- AVV) is responsible for all development activities in the valleys
of the Volta and is also supervised by the Ministry of Rural Development.
26.       Agricultural research is carried out by specialized French insti-
tutions, and Upper Volta is a member of the West African Rice Development
Association (WARDA). By and large, research has produced good technology
packages for cotton, groundnuts, rice and vegetables and, to a lesser extent,
for maize. However, an effective package has yet to be developed for the
traditional staples such as millet and sorghum.
Marketing
27.       Marketing is mainly in the hands of private traders, although
governnent involvement is increasing. Cotton, sesame and sheanut exports
are supported by a government agency, the Stabilization Fund, and official
minimum producer prices are set. In addition, reference export prices are
announced, and if actual prices obtained are higher than the reference price,
the difference is paid to the Stabilization Fund; in case actual prices are
lower, the exporters receive the difference from the Stabilization Fund.
Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles (CFDT) has
a monopoly for cotton exports and is presently the largest contributor of
Stabilization Fund surpluses. Vegetable exports are handled through a pro-
ducers' cooperative which has not been very successful in domestic marketing,
but which has developed an air-freight market for high quality exports to
Europe and the Ivory Coast. To improve cereal marketing and stabilize



- 7 -
domestic prices, OFNIACER (Office National des Cereales) was created in 1971.
However, this entity bas been primarily involved with distribution of relief
foodgrains. In 1974/75, Government set up an official grain marketing
system through the ORDs and OFNACER, but this has not been very effective.
Rural Development Strategy
28.       The recent Bank report on the economic situation in Upper Volta
(see para. 2) examines factors affecting long-term development perspectives.
These can be summarized as follows:
(1) the tlossi plateau is heavily populated: 61% of the
population lives on 34% of the available land, and in many
districts population density exceeds 40 inhabitants per sq
km which is too high to permit sustained and even moderately
high productive agricultural systems under presently
available techniques. Owing partly to population density,
efforts over the past 15 years to improve living standards
have failed. A reduction in population levels could
increase land availability and permit significant improve-
ments in income.
(il)  Upper Volta has large areas which are still relatively under-
populated, even empty, and which, because they have good
agricultural potential, could support satisfactory standards of
living. People could be attracted to these areas through settle-
ment projects, integrated rural development projects and possibly
irrigation schemes. Many of these potential settlement areas,
however, are in the valleys of the Black, Red and White Volta
Rivers where onchocerciasis (riverblindness) has been endemic,
and settlement of these valleys therefore depends primarily on the
control of the disease. In this respect, an internationally
supported campaign was started in 1974 which is designed to free
about 1,600,000 ha of potentially good land from riverblindness over
a 20-year period. An estimated 600,000 ha would be suitable for
agricultural development.
29.       Intensive settlement could be possible through developing irriga-
tion for which a potential of some 130,000 ha is estimated to exist. However,
given the high investment cost of irrigation and the severe lack of exper-
ienced personnel it would appear advisable to concentrate initially on rainfed
agriculture.
30.       While there does not appear to be any scope for a large-scale agri-
cultural development program capable of bringing about meaningful improvements



in the income of any significant numbers of people of the flossi plateau,
there is both the opportunity and need for implementing a variety of small-
scale projects designed either to take advantage of limited areas of land of
good potential, for example bottomlands, or of the needs of rural communities,
such as wells and village warehouses. Such opportunities have been success-
fully exploited under the First Rural Development Project and this would be
continued under the proposed second project.
31.       In sum, Government's principal effort should be to develop the
west and southwest where conditions could support reasonably productive
farming systems and, for the Mossi plateau, to implement a program of
small-scale spot improvements, both shown to be economically viable and
needed by the local communities. In general, Government has adopted this
approach.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Second Rural Development Fund
Project" (No. 1068b-UV) is being circulated separately. A credit and project
summary is contained in Annex III and the project area, covering the five
central ORDs of the Mossi plateau, is shown on the attached map (IBRD 11952).
The proposed project was prepared by RMWA in April 1975 and appraised by an
IDA mission in October 1975. It is essentially a continuation of the First
Rural Development Fund (Credit 317-UV) which has been successful in financing
small agricultural and rural subprojects, especially those geared to increase
crop production and to improve village water supplies. Negotiations were held
April 26-30, 1976. The delegation was led by H.E. Salia Sanon, Hlinister of
Rural Development.
Project Description
33.       The proposed project would be carried out over five years (1975/76
through 1979/80). Mlost of the activities would be executed over the last
four years, with 1975/76 being treated as a bridging year, financed partly
under RDF I and partly under the proposed credit. Based on past experience
and assessments, the program of activities for this second rural development
fund project would be as follows:
(a)  bottomland development, 2,700 ha;
(b) erosion control works, 9,200 ha;
(c)  small-scale irrigation and improved bottomland
development, 500 ha;
(d) wells, 520;



-9-
(e) tubewells, 180;
(f) village warehouses, 400, and village teaching and
meeting centers, 20;
(g) medium term credit for agricultural equipment,
US$0.5 million equivalent;
(h) provision for unidentified projects, US$0.6 mil-
lion; and
(i) studies for economic development of areas freed
from onchocerciasis.
(j) maintenance brigade for tubewells;
(k) staff, equiprment and operating expenditure incurred
by the Rural Development Fund in executing the
project, and some support for the Rural Development
Works Department (HAER) and the Regional Development
Organizations (ORDs);
(1) training of Voltaic staff; and
(m) expatriate technical assistance to assist in project
execution.
Project Execution
34.       First Rural Development Fund.    The idea of a rural development fund
originated with the Bank's first economic mission to Upper Volta in November
1969. An IDA appraisal mission (August 1971) pursued the matter further with
the result that Credit 317-UV to finance a rural development fund (RDF I) wlas
approved and subsequently signed (June 1972), becoming effective in October
1972. The basic arrangement was that the Fund would appraise proposals made
to it by the ORDs as and when suitable small-scale projects were identified
and prepared, rather than the more usual system of following a clearly defined
program of actions, the technical and economic viability of which is determined
in advance. An important criterion for the selection of subprojects under RDF
I was that they were perceived as a need by local people who were prepared to
participate, by providing free labor, in their construction.
35.       The main institutions involved in executing RDF I have been      the
Rural Development Fund, itself, a unit established within the National Develop-
ment Bank (BND) for the purpose of managing the Fund and to appraise the suit
ability of subprojects for financing; the Rural Development Works Department
(HAER) of the Ministry of Rural Development, responsible for designing and con-
structing subprojects; and the ORDs, responsible for identifying and preparing
potential subprojects and for their subsequent management once constructed.
All three institutions will continue to play the same roles under the proposed
RDF II project. The notable exception is that under RDF Il, responsibility



- 10 -
for engineering design and execution of simple works, such as bottomlands,
will be assumed bby the ORDs instead of HAER which will be able to con-
centrate on more complex works such as small irrigation.
36.       The Interministerial Technical Committee.     An Interministerial
Technical Committee was established under Credit 317-UV to "promote' the
goals of the IDA credit and to provide the necessary coordination and
supervision of RDF I. The second function was not executed in an entirely
satisfactory manner, however, as committee membership was too large and few
meetings were held. Accordingly, agreement was reached during negotiations
that the old interministerial committee would be abolished and a new one, with
membership satisfactory to IDA, would be established not later than September
30, 1976 to supervise RDF II (see Section 3.15 of draft Credit Agreement).
37.       Technical Assistance.    Multilateral and bilateral agencies will
assist in the execution of the proposed project by providing expatriate
technical assistance.   This would include the participation of:
(a) the Dutch Government, to provide three volunteer technicians,
with experience in topography, to supervise the land survey
brigades in the ORDs;
(b) French aid (FAC) to provide four expatriates to assist HAER
in project execution, including a senior rural engineer, a junior
rural engineer, a topographical engineer, and a well brigade
leader; and
(c) the UNDP, to provide two expatriates to assist the RDF in
appraising the subprojects proposals.
The three Dutch volunteers arrived in Upper Volta in December 1975; the
FAC-financed well brigade leader is presently working in Upper Volta under
RDF I and would continue under the proposed project; the senior rural engi-
neer arrived in January 1976, and FAC is in the process of recruiting the
junior rural engineer and the topographical engineer as well; a project
document for UNDP assistance has been prepared and submitted to UNDP head-
quarters which has given permission to the UNDP Resident Representative
in Upper Volta to finance the two evaluation officers fron his technical
assistance budget.
Special Features
38.        Agricultural Credit.   Medium-term credit for agricultural equip-
ment is almost non-existent; most agricultural credit (95%) provided by the
National Development Bank (Banque Nationale de Developpement -- BND), is
short-term for seasonal inputs and cotton marketing. Under the proposed
project, up to US$0.5 million would be provided as a revolving fund for
medium-term credit for agricultural equipment. The fund would be administered
by BND under conditions to be determined between BND and Government in agree-
ment with IDA (see Schedule 4 of draft Credit Agreement). Initially, this



- il -
credit would be channeled through RDF because, with its evaluation officers
and procedures, it is presently better equipped than BND to supervise the use
of the credit, but subsequently administration, recovery and relending of the
credit would be the responsibility of BND. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that BND would appoint, before December 31, 1976, a credit
officer to be responsible for management of this revolving fund (see Section
3.09 of draft Credit Agreement). The ORDs, assisted by the credit officer,
would appraise applications which would then be approved by the RDF. An
agreement would be signed between BND and the farmer, but the RDF would be
responsible for disbursements. A pro forma medium-term credit agreement would
be prepared by December 31, 1976 and submitted to IDA for approval (see Section
3.09 of draft Credit Agreement). Terms of credit would include interest at 8%
with a repayment period of five years, including one year's grace. Farmers
owning any draft animal or agricultural traction equipment would not be
required to make a cash down payment. Others would be required to make a
minimum cash down payment of 10% of the cost of the equipment to be purchased.
39.        Unidentified Projects.   The proposed credit would also provide
US$0.6 million to finance other types of projects which have not yet been
identified.   Possibilities include development of small livestock (poultry and
» ,.), snall agricultural processing units and reafforestation. Proposals for
such subprojects would be appraised by the RDF. It was agreed during negotia-
tions that full documentation for each unidentified project would be sent to
IDA for approval (see Section 3.08 of draft Credit Agreement).
40.        Studies.  On January 8, 1974, the Executive Directors approved a
proposal that the World Bank Group should make a contribution equal to 10%
of the estimated first-year costs of the onchocerciasis control program
in West Africa, an internationally supported riverblindness control cam-
paign which is now being carried out in the valleys of the Volta since
1974. The project, therefore, includes studies for economic development
of areas freed from onchocerciasis which would involve preparation of:
(i) an inventory of resources; (ii) a development plan which would identify
priorities for development in the oncho areas; and (iii) a number of specific
investment proposals within the framework of the development plan. Overall
responsibility for this component would rest with the existing Coordinating
Committee for Rural Development, however specific ministries would execute
the various studies: the Ministry of Rural Development would oversee the
inventory of resources and feasibility studies, and the Ministry of Planning
would handle the development plan. Although this component is executed sepa-
rately for practical purposes, disbursements will be channelled through the
RDF.
41.        Retroactive Financing.   Initially, the progress of RDF I was slow.
Through 1973, delays were experienced in the recruitment of staff, government
prefinancing of project expenditures and the procurement of equipment. By
1974, however, the project gained momentum, which accelerated through 1975.
Project funds have now been depleted due to the dollar devaluation and infla-
tion, the latter being higher than was estimated at appraisal. Consequently,
funds available under RDF I (Credit 317-UV) are insufficient to finance the
1976/77 campaign which began March 1, 1976. Accordingly, in order to allow



- 12 -
for a smooth transition and to avoid any financing gap between RDF I and the
proposed RDF II, it is recommended that retroactive financing of up to
$350,000 be made available by IDA to cover expenditures incurred between
March 1, 1976 and credit agreement signature.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
42.       Project costs are estimated at US$15.1 million net of taxes.
43.        The proposed IDA credit of US$9.4 million would finance 62% of pro-
ject costs net of taxes and would cover the estimated foreign exchange com-
ponent (US$7.9 million) and US$1.5 million of local costs. The remainder
of project costs net of taxes would be met entirely by other foreign donors:
Banque Arabe pour le Developpement Economique en Afrique (BADEA), US$4.5
million, covering 30% of net project costs ; Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation
(FAC), US$0.6 million, covering 4%; the Dutch Government, US$0.15 million,
covering 1%; and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), US$0.45
million, covering 3% of net project costs.
44.        The BADEA loan is expected to be made for a term of 25 years, in-
cluding 5 years of grace, at an interest rate of 2% per annum. The UNDP, FAC
and Dutch contributions would be provided as grants. BADEA's contr[bution,
financed in parallel with our own credit, would be for the following project
sub-components: wells, tubewells, the maintenance brigade for tubewells and
related supporting services.
Procurement and Disbursement
45.        Items financed under the IDA credit would be procured as follows:
vehicles, tractors, other equipment and supplies such as cement and steel,
valued at US$2.0 million would be obtained through international compe-
titive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines in the case of contracts
over US$50,000, and through competitive bidding in accordance with local
procedures acceptable to the Association in the case of contracts of less
than US$50,000. For contracts under US$10,000, direct comparative purchas-
ing would be employed. Domestically manufactured goods, including simple
tools, would be allowed a 15% preference or the applicable import duty, which-
ever is lower.
46.        The credit would be disbursed against:
(a) 89% of the cost of all project works and supporting services
for wells, tubewells and tubewell maintenance brigade components
of the project;
(b)  as concerns all project works and supporting services (except
those listed in (a) above), 100% of foreign expenditures for
directly imported goods and foreign consultants' services as
well as 89% of total costs of other eligible expenditures;



- 13 -
(c) as concerns studies for economic development of areas freed
from onchocerciasis, 100% of total expenditures for inter-
nationally recruited staff; 100% of foreign expenditures for
consultants' services; and 50% of total expenditures for such
items as vehicles, operating costs and local counterpart staff.
Benefits and Justification
47.        The major economic benefits of the proposed project include:     wet
season rice production from bottomlands; increased cereals, groundnut and
cotton yields from erosion control; saved labor inputs and increased cul-
tivated acreage per farm family from animal traction; improved storage, re-
ducing losses of both inputs and outputs and inducing greater use of inputs
from warehouses; and greater labor productivity and increased village live-
stock potential from well construction.
48.        In addition, the project will also provide important social and
institutional benefits. For example, village wells give an assured and
healthful water supply to the human population, which is otherwise depend-
ent upon small creeks which run dry for at least three months of the year
and which may contain waterborne diseases; and the ORDs, among other insti-
tutions, are strengthened in assuming responsibility for identifying and
proposing subprojects, greatly increasing their contact with farmers and
involvement in rural development.
49.       A cautious estimate would put the total number of farm families
likely to benefit under the project at around 15,000 (between 120,000 to
190,000 people). It is estimated that about 600 villages would be involved
in the project.
50.       The project provides a line of credit to the RDF for investment in
various subprojects. Therefore economic rate of return calculations can only
be tentative. Based on simple models, excluding overheads and assuming the
program indicated in paragraph 33 and the aforementioned benefits materialize,
the estimated subproject economic rates of return are: bottomlands (account-
ing for US$.5 million), over 50%; erosion control (accounting for US$0.6 mil-
lion), 30%; improved bottomlands (accounting for US$.2 million) 18%; small-
scale irrigation (accounting for US$.9 million) 16%; and agricultural equip-
ment (accounting US$.7 million), over 50%. The rate of return for wells and
tubewells (accounting for US$2.4 million and US$.7 million respectively)
would be 6%, excluding such benefits as improvements in health and water
supplies. If wells and tubewells were excluded, the overall economic rate
of return would be 21%. The investment package as proposed should yield an
economic rate of return of about 16%. Under the very difficult ecological
and human conditions of the central plateau, this can be considered quite
satisfactory.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Republic of Upper Volta, the recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
52.        The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the normal
pattern for credits for rural development.     The following are additional
conditions of effectiveness; (i) the appointment of a Coordinator to assist
the Director of HAER (see Sections 3.05 and 6.01 (b) of draft Credit Agree-
ment); and (il) the fulfillment of conditions of effectiveness under the BADEA
loan agreement (see Section 6.01(a) of draft Credit Agreement).
53.        I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
54.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   PROJECT IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 225: West Volta Cotton Project. US$6.2 Million Credit of
December 30, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project is part of a cotton production development program in
West Volta, which originally started with FAC financing in 1963. It consists
of expansion of cotton cultivation, improvements of yields, credit and exten-
sion services, and provision of better communications and processing facilities.
The project also includes funds for detailed engineering of secondary roads
and preparation of the Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project, both of
which have been completed. Due to favorable rainfall distribution, seed
cotton production for 1975/76 is estimated at 36,000 t. for the project area.
This is an improvement over the 1974/75 yield of 25,000 t. and the 1973/74
yield of 20,000 t. The appraisal mission estimated 40,000 t. by the end of
the project period. Because cotton production was lower than expected at
appraisal, no additional ginnery at Hounde was constructed as originally
envisaged. When the 40,000 ton production goal is reached, the existing
ginneries in Bobo-Dioulasso and Koudougou will work at full capacity. Al-
though the production goals set out at appraisal have not yet been reached,
the project is having a favorable impact on the rural population of the
project area, and therefore, a follow-up rural development project covering
the sane area is presently being preappraised.
Credit 316: Road Project. US$4.15 Million Credit of June 26, 1972
(As amended on March 25, 1974); Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Originally, the project comprised (a) the reconstruction of the
Solenzo-Koudougou (70 km) and the Hounde-Bereba (27 km) roads, and (b) feasi-
bility studies for about 400 km of primary roads, and engineering of those
sections found to have the highest priority. Construction of the Solenzo-
Koudougou road began in March 1974 and is now completed. Construction of the
Hounde-Bereba road was deleted from the project as cotton production did not
merit the construction of the ginnery at Hounde and without the ginnery there
was no justification for this road. Government has presented alternative
roads which are presently under review. Regarding part (b), out of four
proposed roads only two, from Bobo-Dioulasso to Hounde and Bobo-Dioulasso to
Banfora (a total of about 190 km) were selected for feasibility studies as
these were the only roads which showed a preliminary satisfactory rate of
return. Feasibility studies and detailed engineering have been completed and
i/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors on the pro-
gress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them.  Thev should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
tha! Lney do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 5
these form the basis for the road component in the Third Highway project
which will be submitted to the Executive Directors shortly. Due to currency
realignments and to cost overruns on the road construction part of the project,
the dollar cost of the project increased. Consequently, to enable completion
of the project, on March 25, 1974 the Association approved an increase in the
amount of the credit from US$2.8 million to US$4.15 million. It is expected
that the project will be completed and the credit fully disbursed by the
present closing date.
Credit 317: Rural Development Fund Project. US$2.2 Million Credit of
June 26, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1976
Execution of the project started slowly due to delays in project
prefinancing, staff apointments, and equipment procurement, but after these
were overcome, the project gained momentum. Experience to date has shown
that the project concept of financing small projects is sound and that
farmers are willing to co-operate by contributing their free labor. This
project will be continued under the proposed project.
Credit 430: Education Project. US$2.85 Million Credit of September 28,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Credit was approved on June 21, 1973, signed on September 28,
1973 and became effective on June 27, 1974. The project provides science
equipment for 21 secondary schools and promotes rural education in the
Dedougou, Koudougou and Kaya ORDs. It provides for 120 centers for the
training of young farmers (CFJAs). In school year 1975/76, ten pilot centers
will be started in each ORD. By the end of the project, 40 new centers will
have been built and equipped, and 80 existing centers will be equipped. There
are between 30 and 40 students between the ages of 15 and 18 years in each
CFJA who will receive classroom instruction and practical training. The
project also provides for 150 pre-cooperatives for young farmers. These
pre-cooperatives will have aproximately 15 members each, all of whom must
be at least 18 years old. As support to the pre-cooperatives, the project
provides credit and extension services. A similar FED financed project
covers the Yatenga and Banfora ORDs. The project director is assisted by
a FAC supported Bureau de Pedagogie which prepares program and teaching
material for the ttaining of young farmers under the Bank and FED projects.
The secondary education component of the project is about nine months behind
schedule; implementation of the young farmers' training component began in
January 1976, after twenty-one months delay in establishing a staff infra-
structure able to manage the project.
Credit 431: Second Telecommunications Project. US$4.5 Million Credit of
September 28, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Credit was approved on June 21, 1973, signed on September 28,
1973 and became effective on May 23, 1974. This credit, the second made to
Upper Volta for telecommunications, finances the major part of Upper Volta's
1974-77 telecommunications expansion program. The project comprises provi-
sion of automatic and trunk switching equipment, local distribution networks
and subscribers' apparatus, microwave links, auxillary construction and

equipment, consultants' services and training of personnel. The executing
agency for the project is the "Office des Postes et Telecommunications de
Haute-Volta" (OPT), as autonomous public entity. The Project execution is
on schedule. All contracts were awarded by the end of 1975, and the proj-
ect costs have increased only slightly, mainly for local costs, and the IDA
credit [s judged sufficient to cover the project's foreign exchange require-
ments. The financial results for the year ending December 31, 1974 were
satisfactory though the actual rate of return was 8% only, compared with
the appraisal estimate of 10.4%, and OPT's financial situation for the years
1975-77 is projected to deteriorate. OPT has received a loan from Govern-
ment to help it restore its cash flow position.
Credit 442: Drought Relief Project. US$2.0 Million Credit of December 7,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The Credit was approved on November 13, 1973, signed on December 7,
1973, and was declared effective on April 24, 1974. This is one of six
credits made available to the Sahelian countries to help people in drought-
affected areas to re-establish food self-sufficiency. In Upper Volta the
project is executed by the Rural Development Fund established under Credit
317-UV. The project originally envisaged four sub-projects; (i) construc-
tion and equipment of 150 tube wells; (ii) construction of three earth dams;
(iii) purchase of road equipment for repair of feeder roads; (iv) construction
of six seed storage warehouses. Procurement has been completed, but the exe-
cution of the tube-well drilling program, the most important component of the
project, began only recently. The delay of almost one year is due to default
by suppliers of vehicle parts and drilling pipes, which are essential to the
assembling of the drilling rigs. Except for the drilling program, the project
has been completed, but no dams have been built. The Association agreed how-
ever to allow purchase of equipent by HAER needed for dam construction. Proj-
ect completion will have to be extended by one year to allow for completion
for the tube-well drilling program.
Credit 496: Bougouriba Agricultural Development. US$8.0 Million
Credit of July 19, 1974; Closing Date: May 31, 1979
The Credit was approved on May 30, 1974, signed on July 19, 1974
and declared effective on July 18, 1975. Management, comprising a director,
a deputy director, a technical director, an accountant and a road technician,
arrived between August 1975 and February 1976. As a result of preparatory
measures taken well in advance of credit effectiveness, vehicles, motorcyles,
road maintenance and well drilling equipment have recently arrived and manage-
ment has now become fully operative.
The project, to be carried out over a four-year period, is the
first major effort to develop the natural and human resources of the
Bougouriba ORD. The project wiLl concentrate on the areas presently free
of onchocerciasis and includes food crop and cotton development, a program
for prophylactic vaccinations of livestock, provision of agricultural credit
and extension services, well construction, feeder road improvement, intensive
staff training, appiied research and road studies. It is too early to pre-
dict whether all project objectives will be obtained, but management [s com-
petent and the project should be successfully executed,

Credit 557: Livestock Development Project. US$9.0 Million
Credit of June 18, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The Credit was approved on May 27 and signed on June 18, 1975.
It was declared effective on November 24, 1975. The project, to be carried
out over five years, is a broadly based program to assist cattle production
in the Dedougou and Bobo-Kioulasso ORDs through group ranch development, the
improvement of veterinary services, livestock marketing, meat processing and
the provision of technical assistance. It will help about 300,000 tradi-
tional cattle procedures and, in addition, will introduce commercial ranch-
ing to the traditional sector. A detailed plan for the project period ending
August 1976 has been drawn up and approved by the Association. A vaccination
campaign, the first major operation carried out under the project, was car-
ried out successfully during November and December 1975. The recruitment
of key personnel was completed in Janauary 1976.
Credit 579: Rural Road Project. US$7.5 Million Credit of August 13, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The Credit was approved on June 26, 1975 and signed on August 13,
1975. It was declared effective on Feburary 11, 1976. The project, to be
carried out over four years, provides for the improvement and subsequent
maintenance of about 1,200 km of existing roads, the strengthening of the
Services d'Entretien des Routes Secondaires (SERS) through technical assis-
tance to the Ministry of Public Works, the implementation of the above road
program and procurement of highway equipment. It also provides for consul-
tant services to study the impact and effectiveness of road components in-
cluded in agricultural development projects financed by the Association
since 1970. Project implementation has only just started.

Financing Plan:            The proposed IDA credit of US$9.4 million would
finance 62% of project costs net of taxes and
would cover the estimated foreign exchange compo-
nent (US$7.9 million) and US$1.5 million of local
costs. The remainder of project costs would be met
by: Banque Arabe pour le Developpement Economique
en Afrique (BADEA), US$4.5 million, covering 30% of
net project costs; Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation
(FAC), US$0.6 million, covering 4%; the Dutch
Government, US$0.15 million, covering 1%; and the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) US$0.45
million, covering 3% of project costs. The financ-
ing plan is as follows:

Procurement Arrangements: Vehicles, tractors, other equipment and supplies
such as cement and steel, valued at US$2.0 mil-
lion, would be obtained through international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines
for contracts over US$50,000, and through com-
petitive bidding in accordancce with local pro-
cedures acceptable to the Association in the case
of contracts of less than US$50,000. For contracts
under US$10,000, direct comparative purchasing would
be employed. Domestically manufactured goods would
be allowed a 15% preference or the applicable import
duty whichever is lower. A large portion of proj-
ect costs would be for labor, salaries as well as
operating and training expenses valued at about
US$4.2 million, none of which would be suitable
for competitive bidding. The services of con-
sultants and expatriate staff, valued at about
US$1.4 million, would be obtained according to
procedures acceptable to IDA. A total of US$1.1
million would be for agricultural credit and un-
identified projects. An amount of US$1.8 mil-
lion would cover contingencies.
Economic Rate of
Return:                 The project's overall rate of return would be
16%, if the mix of subprojects does conform to
the assumed development program.
Appraisal Report:          Report 1068b-UV, dated May 3, 1976.
