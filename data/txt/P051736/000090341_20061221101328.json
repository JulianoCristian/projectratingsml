Lessons learned from the project:\n            Conducting extensive studies to ensure sound investment\n            decisions is very important for developing cost-effective\n            transmission systems. At the inception of the project, the\n            Bank indicated that the system required more investments\n            than envisaged under the project. The 500 kV river crossing\n            suspension tower bid package was technically complex in\n            nature and should have received greater attention during the\n            review and evaluation of the qualification of supplier and\n            its subcontractor. Having recognized the special nature of\n            the river crossing towers in the PAD, the Bank should have\n            insisted on prequalification of the prospective bidders\n            prior to the issuance of the bidding documents to the\n            qualified bidders. Qualification requirements should be\n            specified better and particular attention should be paid to\n            coordinating between commercial and technical aspects in\n            similar projects. The project confirmed the need to avoid\n            rigid and Bank mandated reform programs. It showed that\n            flexibility is paramount to adapt the agreed program to\n            institutional changes and revised reform objectives in the country."}, "docdt": "2006-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
