The East China (Jiangsu)\n            Transmission Line Project includes the addition of more than\n            993 km of transmission line, the construction of nine\n            additional substations, and the expansion of two existing\n            substations. The project has a rural component as well as an\n            urban component. Environmental impacts to water resources as\n            a result of substation construction along both rural and\n            urban components are expected to be both temporary and\n            minimal, since the planned substations are not located in\n            close proximity to water bodies. The project will require\n            the removal of more than 800,000 trees, comprised of fruit\n            trees and other planted varieties. Though trees in general\n            provide habitat for birds and other wildlife, the trees lost\n            for transmission line construction are domesticated\n            varieties in rural agricultural areas that have been\n            sufficiently fragmented to prevent their use as important\n            wildlife habitat, and similar habitat will be developed in\n            the new resettlement areas. Farmers will be compensated for\n            loss in agricultural production as a result of land acquired\n            for the project. Chinese law has strict regulations\n            protecting all persons being resettled. No significant\n            adverse impacts to wetlands are anticipated."}, "docdt": "1998-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
