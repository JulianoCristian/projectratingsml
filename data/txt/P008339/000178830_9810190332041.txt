APPRAISAL OF PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This reDort appraises a nroiect for the construction of a neut deep-
water port. at Limassol, and provision of cargo-handling equipment at
Famnusta. for which a Bank lonn of US$I1.A million is proposed. The econ-
ony of Cyprus is heavily dependent on foreign trade. The proposed port
will inrease Cyprsnmqt cargo_handl I4ng Gnacity And ennourage tourism.  This
would be the first loan to Cyprus in the transport sector.
ii.       The project consists of the construction of a harbor enclosed by

iii.      rrocurement will be in accordance with the Bank:s guide'lnes.
Disbursement of the loan would be against demonstrated foreign exchange
costs except that, in the case of the access road, water main and elect:ric
connection, disbursement would be on an agreed percentage of the cost.
iv.       Idmassol serves an important area in the western part of the
island of Cyprus, rich in mineral resources, agriculture and tourist at-
tractions. The present port operations consist of lighterage between
ships anchored at sea and a small lighter harbor. Cruise and other pas-
senger ships also anchor at sea and passengers are ferried ashore. As a
result, cargo is either subject to high costs of lighterage, double han-
dling and physical loss and damage, or is diverted at extra cost to the
main port of Famagusta, while cruise passengers are deterred from going
ashore by the cost, discomfort and time consumed.  Even so, each year
about 200,000 tons of cargo are .idadlet.at the port,while more than 20,1000
visitors land for a stay of less than one day and more than 40,000 passesn-
gers enter or leave the country through Limassol. It is expected that by
1978, with construction of the new port, cargo traffic will increase to
500,000 tons by normal growth and re-routing of cargo presently handled at
Famagusta; at the same time the number of less-than-one-day cruise visitors
will, grow to 127,000. The number of passengers entering or leaving the
country through Limassol will grow moderately.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
APPRAISAL OF PORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In January 1968, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus re-
quested the Bank to assist in financing the construction of a new deep-
water port at Limassol to replace the existing lighterage operation.
The public ports of the country are operated by the Department of Ports
in the Ninistry of Communications and Wlorks.  The project consists of con-
struction of a deep-water harbor enclosed by a main breakwater and a se-
condary breakwater, four general cargo berths and two passenger ship
berths, two transit sheds, and two produce inspection sheds, a passenger
terminal and other shore facilities. and provisicn of cargo-handling eonup-
ment, a tug and other floating craft.  Cargo-handling equipment is also to
be provided for the port of Famnuta.    The provision of engineering, oaoera-
tions, and accounting consultants is included, as are an access road to the
new port site at Limnssol and the necessary wTater mai-in and electricity -con-
nection.
1.02      This would be the first Bank loan to Cyprus in the transport sec-
tor.  Earlier loans. for electric power development, were made in 1963 0Ad
1967 for US$21.0 million and for US$2.8 million, respectively.

2. BACKGROUND
A. Country and People
2.01      fsyprus is the most easterly of the 1editerranean islands and the
third largest in area after Sicily and Sardinia. At the nearest coastal
points, it is approximately 40 miles from Turkey, 60 miles from Syria, 220
miles from Ezypt and 300 miles from the Greek islands. It has an area of
about 3,570 sq. miles, is 140 miles from east to west at its greatest
length, and 60 miles from north to south.  Its coastal perimeter measures
486 miles (Map 1).
2.02      The principal geographical features of Cyprus are two mountain
ranges in the north and the nomithwest separated by a broad fertile Dlainr
the Messaoria. The Troodos mountain range, in the southwest, is rich in
mineral deposlts; the highest ponint is i-)Loo feet ahnve sea level.  The
country's climate favors the cultivation of a wide variety of agricultural
Droduce sucGh Ps wheat.- npn1tez; q+.rmwhP_rriA.e grapes, citruns frui-its- oarobs
and bananas.
2.03      The population of Cyprus in 1967 iwas about 614,000, of which 80%
were of Geek extractior. and 18% Nr-kish   tA +et  thIAe cortm.lnl Aistu.rbances

2.05      The real rate of growth of GDP during 1962-1967 was about 7% per
annum and wouid nave been higner but ior tne Greek-lurk civii disturDances.
If the domestic political situation remains stable, the target rate of 7%
growth a year set in the Second Five-Year Plan (1967-1971) should be
achieved.
2.06      The economy of Cyprus is heavily dependent on foreign trade:  in
1967, the total of imports and exports was EC 81 million. The Import com-
ponent was EC 52 million constituting over three-fifths of the country's
requirements for agricultural and industrial products. The export compo-
nent of EC 29 million represented close to one-half of the country's output
in agriculture, industry and mining. Two-thirds of exports were agricul-
tural products.

on agricuLtural growth.  Cyprus will also have to rely more on tourism, and
the Government is righ.tly giving high priority to developing this traf:2'ic.
Cyprus is already popular as a tourist center and has scope for very sub-

clude fine beaches, mountains (summer and wfinter resorts), and scenery.
It~ a.Lso 1has owthLer tLoLursi1 a tractions sucn as ancient sites, monuments anu
monasteries.
C. Transport Facilities
2.08      There are no railways, coastal shipping services, domestic air
services or pipelines in Cyprus. internal transportation is dependent en-
tirely on roads.
HighwZys and Highway Transport
2.09      There is an old and dense road network totaling about 3,940 miles
('iap i), more than one mile per sq. mile of area, of which about 1,450
miles, or 38a, are paved. Of the paved roads about 60r% have only one 'Lane
while the other 40o% vary in paved width from 4 meters to 6.7 meters.  There
are, in addition, over 500 miles of municipal roads. In general, the :roads
are sub-s-tandard and inadequate to carry the growing volume of traffic.
Road jurisdiction is divided among three authorities. A Bank mission :ce-
viewed the Highway Program in 14arch/April 1967 and concluded that the Roads
Branch needed to be better staffed and equipped and that appropriate design
standards for highways were urgently required.
2.10      The number of motor vehicles in Cyprus was about 59,000 at the
end of 196S7, of wihich 49,000 were cars. 7,400 were trucks and 2,600 buses.
There were, in addition, about 14,600 motorcycles, autocycles, etc. The
ratio of motor vehicles to population is 1 to 10. as in Italy.
Air Transport
2.11      There is one commercial airport- at MicOSin, capable of hbnndling
most present medium-range jet aircraft, although with some penalties in
payload on long-distance nonstnp flights, e.g. to London.   A report on the
feasibility of extending the runway at a cost of just under EC 2 million
has recently been prepnred and is inde-rr consideratn inny the Governflrtn .
2.12      Nlore than 70% of international passenger traffic is by air.  Tr-
ing 1962-L966, air passenger traffic increased by over 6% a year, reachling
226.000 p;ssengers (a-rivals plus dep-rtures) 4n 1966   d ar CagO trf fic
by almost 18% a year to more than 3,000 tons.

SeaDorts (iaD 1)
2.13      Cvnrus has five Government-onerated zeneral cargo ports--FaIDa-
gusta, Iernaca, Limassol, Paphos and Kyrenia--and three privately-operated
nTneral re!iort-nn  ports--Knrnvasa+ssqi, Limnni nnd Vassiliko-Zvvi.  Of the
prilvate ports, the first two are on the northwest coast and the third on
the south coast beteen       eA and Tnaca.     A 'hrief description of the
general cargo ports is given below and more detailed information is given

.LI -L7U( *
2.15 La-rnaca, on the south coast, 26 mliles by road fromX Famagusta, -s
a lighterage port.  Its inportance as a general cargo port has fallen
Steadily and in 1967 it nandied only about 5,000 tons oI cargO and 8,()00
passengers. IJork will start shortly on construction of a new small port
protectedc by breakTaters, with two alongside berths, at a cost of bt-Lb
EC 1.7 million. Larnaca's main traffic at present is petroleum; tankers
anchor oi'fshore and discharge oil through submarine pipelines.
2.16      limassol, the project port, is second in importance to Fama;usta
for geneiml cargo and is an important port for tourists and passengers.
Although a lighterage port, it handled 176,000 tons of cargo and b6,UUU
passengers in 1967. It is the most southerly port in Cyprus, 54 mileS by
road frorn FamaguLsta and 50 miles from Nicosia.  It is the most conveniently
located port for MIediterranean shipping lines (N1ap 1).
2.17      Kyrenia is the only seaport on the north coast, but has very
little commercial importance. It has a small breakwater harbor but can
only handle small craft up to 3.0 meters draft. There are no plans for
developing it into a deepwater port.  It is suitable mainly for pleasLre
craft and fishing vessels.
2.18      Paphos, in the southwest corner of the island, has a shallowr-draft
pier suitable for small vessels about 50 meters long and 3.0 meters draft.
Cranes and warehouse facilities are provided. Total cargo handled averages
about 20,000 tons per annum. There are no plans for any major development
of this port.



3. THE PUBLIC PORTS OF CYPRUS
A. Present Organization and Administration
General.
3.01      T'he ports administration is a department of the Ministry of Com-
munications and Works. It is headed by a Director (responsible to the
Director General in the Ministry) assisted by an Advisory Board composecl
of shipowners' agents. merchnnts and Government reoresentatives. at each
main port. The department's functions include pilotage; navigation light-
ing1: bert.hi.ng nnd unberthing of vessels; conservnncy; the provision of
wharves, sheds, warehouses, open storage areas, roads and other shore
facilities; the provision of +ugs, a 60-ton floating cren-n  + Fnnnstn-
launches, mTobile cranes, fixed cranes, and some light cargo-handling equip-
ment;.    z r  v   Weguvl V v1Pn * ati ont of the prto- _; Q +   a * ..vA  A4 t+in+.an

also under the same Mqinistry, except for large projects which are dealt with
d4recty by the    --4-nis .  Fi-efigh-ng and policing  of the por4   - pro
vided by the Government fire service and police.
3.02      The Director and the headquarters' staff are located at Famagusta.
Regulation of thle idividual porbs is by the narbor masters in Fa-iarusta
and Limassol, the collector of customs in Larnaca, and the officer in charge
of customr in Paphos and  -yrenia. They work in consultation i.4th the PO:Ft
Advisory Boards in regard to shipping and port matters and with the Port
iLbor Board in regard to tne empioyment oI labor.   Customs oificers regulate
the private ports.
3Q03      The harbor masters are responsible for pilotage, berthing and
collecting diues. Pilotage is compulsory for large ships. For small ships
the harbor master decides whether or not pilotage is required.
3.04      The Ports Department employs no engineers.    haintenance of port
facilities and equipment is the responsibility of the Public works Depart-
ment. Maintenance dredging is carried out by the Public Wlorks Departmenit
in consultat-ion lath the Department of Ports.  Soundings are made by hand-
line; no sur-vey launch is available.
Operations
3.05      The Ports Department does not undertake cargo handling on ship
or shore, the stevedores and shore cargo-handling workers being engaged by
the ships' amd merchants' agents; the department employs no tally clerks or
checkers. Basically, the Ports Department provides the marine and shore
installations, floating craft and cranes. The port has no control over
cargo movements on shore, even in its owen sheds and stacking areas.

3.06      There is a shortage of transit sheds and warehouses, MLbile
equipment is insufficient and the few forklift trucks available are sup-

sents a modest 82_,000 tons per berth per year. * ithimprovemfients in opera-
tional methods, control by the port administration, additional cargo-
handlng equipmen-.t and better transit shed and warehouse accomomodation,
these figures could be substantially increased.
Labor
3.08      There is a one-shift system of working, totaling 39 hours per
week wich follows the hours of wiork of the Customs Department. Overtime,
for which additional charges are made, is worked as required.   The number
of docklworkers available is limited since there is very little unemployment
in Cyprus.
3.09      The Department appoints and controls licensed porters for
handling goods betwTeen ship's hook and shore facilities. This porterage,
together Tdth any attendant lighterage (which is privately operated), is
controlled by the Department under the Landing and Shipping Charges Law.
All other labor is engaged by the employers through the local Labour Ex-
changes and is controlled by the Port WJorkers (Regulations of Employment)
Law which operates under the auspices of the Labour Department and the
Port Labour Boards.
3.10      Relations between employers and employees in the port areas are
usually good and no serious labor disputes have been recorded in recent
years.
Accounting
3.11      There is no separate commercial accounting system for the ports
of Cyprus.  The cash receipts collected by the Ports Department are credited
to the national budget and include shipping dues, wharfage dues on cargo
and pilotage fees.  Storage charges. beyond the free period. are collected
by the Customs Department. Cash expenses incurred directly by the Depart-
ment are shovm in the national budget, and consist largelv of personnel
emoluments. Considerable expenditure relating to the ports is in- -
cluded in various other budget items, including repairs and] mantenance,
dredging, electricity and other services, pensions and other welfare costs.



- 7 -
There is no charge for depreciation, since no fixed asset accounts are
kept. The cash receipts reported by the Department show considerable
surpluses over its cash expenditures; for instance, in 1967 receipts were
EC 600,814, expenditure WC 80,354, cash surplus aC 520,,460; but this gives
no indication of the real profit earned. With the present primitive ac-
counting methods and in the absence of fixed asset accounting and deprecia-
tion charges, it is not possible to prepare commercial-type accounts to
assess the present financial return on investment in the ports.
Tariffs
3.12      The present tariff charges are arbitrary and unrelated to costs.
The largest item of receipts is wharfage dues on import and export cargo
amounting to about EC 425,000 out of a total of EC 600,000 in 1967, or more
than 70%, and does not include shorehandling.  The wharfaze tariff is ex-
tremely complicated but averages EC 0.438 per ton, which is high compared
with charges at other similar ports. The tariff structure for ships' dues
is sound in principle and covers port dues, berthage, anchorage, mooring
and cranag:e; the rates are generallv lom compared with other norts.

3.16      The Bank's past experience with a similar Authority, the Elect-
tricity Authority of Cyprus, which is efficient and conducts busImess irL
a satisfactory manner, has been good.
3.17      During loan negotiations, the Government agreed to submit to
the House of Representatives dt'aft legislation, acceptable to the Bankj,
to establish a National Port Authority, with adequate management and
financial autonomy. The Chief Executive will be appointed after consul-
tation with the Bank.
3.18      To improve the present productivity at Famagusta and other
ports in (Cprus, provision is made in the proposed loan for the appointi-
ment of operations consultants to recommend and install improved oper-
ating procedures. Famagusta should be studied first and the lessons
learnt applied at Limassol to ensure that the new port will be operated.
on modern and efficient lines from the beginning.
3.19      All fixed assets in use, for which the Department is responsible,
and which will be transferred to the new Port Authority, will be in-
ventoriedj, valued at current replacement cost, and effective economic
lives assigned. The inventorv will exclude only those assets to be
abandoned when the new ports of Limassol and Larnaca enter into operation.
3.20      The Government agrees that modern financial accounting systems
must be irnstalled, with cost accounting to establish the costs of the
various facilities and services, and that tariffs must be related to
costs. I*Le tariff structure eoncerning wharfage needs simplification.
The Government welcomes the assistance of consultants in these matters
and to he]p train the acounnting staff in the new syrstem X.

3.21      iuring loan negotiations the Government undertook: (a) to
appoint, krithin one year of signing the Loan Agreement, operations and
accounting consultants acceptable to the Banrk and (b) that the new
accounting systems will be in operation and new tariffs come into effect
upon creation of the proposed port authority. The accounting consul-
tants would be retained for a further period of about one year after
completiorn of construction of the new port of Limassols to review the
operation of the accounting systemzu The sum of KC 100,000 (US$240,000
equivalent) is izsluded in the cost estimates for operations and account-
ing consul]tants and for accounts staff training, of which US$192,000
would be foreign exchange and is included in the proposed loano

free time limit, the responsibility for this will be transferred from
the Customs Department to the new Port Authority with the revenues
accruing to the latter.

4. PRESEINT AND FUTURE TRAFFIC
A   C't..±
A. oriu.pping
4.        Ln 9yot7  a total Of 944 SnipS callea at Limassol, with a total
net registered tonnage (iRT) of 1.60 million. Of these, 646 were cargo
ships loading and discharging 176,000 tons of cargo, with an average of
270 tons per ship, and 298 were passenger ships handling about 60,000
passengers, of whom 21,000 were one-day visitors. During the same year,
1,531 ships with a total NRT of 1.74 million visited Famagusta.
4.02      After Iimassol is developed as a deep-water port, the number of
cargo ships calling in 1973 is forecast by Bank staff to be 550, with a
total of 383,000 tons of cargo, or about 700 tons per ship (about the pre-
sent level at Famagusta), and the number of passenger ships 500, handLing
about 140,000 pa-ssngers, including 94,000 one-day visitors. By 1978, the
number of cargo anvd passenger ships respectively is expected to be 700 and
625.
B. Present General Cargo Traffic
4.03      General cargo is handled almost entirely at the three genera:L
cargo ports.  In 1967 the total of 934,000 tons comprised 440,000 tons of
exports and 494,000 tons of imports. Of these. 176.000 tons (18%5) were
handled at Limassol and 754,000 tons (78/`) at Famagusta. Due to political
and other factors  the total trade decl1ined bet.weepn 1Q9A6 anrd 19Q66 bt+ bhy
1967 had recovered to the 1965 level. During 1960-1967, total
trade at the general cargo Dorts increased from 662;000 tons to 934,j00
tons, an average of 5,'S a year. Details of general cargo traffic (exclliding
oil) handled at the ports of Fnmngusta_ Lminassol nnd Tarnaca dulring 1965Q-
1967 are showsn below.

Famagusta has taken over part of the traffic previously handled through
the lighterage ports of Lmassol asd Lanaca. Thus, while the total t;r=
fic of all three ports was about the same in 1965 and 1967, Limassol's
traffic i 1967 was U,ouuo uons lnesL bnan iUn 1   alDhuugh ej'vrt weiU
up slightly.  Larnaca's general cargo traffic also dropped, and it is now
essentially a petroleum importing port.
C. Vuture Lota,l Generai. Cargo Traffic (Table 1)
4 o     rU Forecasts of future traffic have been made by Banki staff based
on an exarmiination of the Second Five-Year Plan targets, the possible rate
of growth of GNP until 1978 (assumed to be between 4 and 6% per annum) and
the prospects for industrial and agricultural development. These estimlates
are expected to total about 1.2 million tons in 1973 and about 1.4 million
tons in 1978. Th-, Government expects that imports financed from foreiEn
military expenditures wrill continue at approximately the present level for
the foreseeable future. It is expected that the general cargo exports and
imports will increase at the rate of 4.5/0 and 2.5'O per annum respectively
until 1978.
Traffic Distribution Amriong Ports
4.06      The construction of deep-water ports at Limassol and Larnaca will
result in improved traffic distribution among the three ports. At present,
owing to the high cost of handling cargo by lighters, the incidence of
damage to perishable goods in the process, and the above-average losses on
all types of goods (all reflected in increased insurance costs), a sub-
stantial part of the traffic to and from wiestern Cyprus passes through
Famagusta, despite the higher cost of land transportation over mountairLous
terrain. The construction of a deep-wiater port at Larnaca (for which the
contract has already been awarded). will offer an alternative to FamagLsta,
but it wi.ll not change costs substantially because: (a) the overland cLis-
tances, and consequentlv the land transport cost- from most points in wres-
tern Cyprus to Famagusta and to Larnaca are about the same, and (b) the
traditional conmmercial and financial facilities essential to foreign trade
are almost; totally absent in Larnaca.
4.07      For purposes of a more precise look at potential traffic, the
service areas of the ports of Famausta, Larnaca and Timassol have beerl de-
lineated on Map 2, on the assumption that all three wqill be deep-water
ports with iuniform charges. The service areas are largely established on
the basis of comparative land transport costs, influenced by both distaLnce
and to-ooranhv. especiallv the Troodon mount-ain ran,ge in the southTwe-st-
The differences are, of course, modest, but permit a division of traffic
for  nnrposn S of ev aluating the econroriciS of the proposed pro,ec.t at Linssol.



4.08         A hypothetical distribution of the traffic forecast among the
thr-ee ports is shown below.   It indicates that Faragusta will continue
to be the island's most important general cargo port, handling about 60<I
of the imports and 50u of exports in 1973; by 1978 its traffic volume wrill
again reach the present level of about 750,000 tons. Limassolls share in 1973
-will be about 30N; Of inPorts and 4u0, of exports, and Larnaca will handle
the balance.

production for export. The area near Limassol has substantial potential
for both agriculture and industry due to its abundant water sunnpv and
there are plans to improve the situation further by the construction of
more river dams. The imoort forecast is based prirarilyr on the eXPlected

L.10      After the ne-w deep-water port is built, export th-gh Tmas
are expected to be 225,000 tons by 1973 and 300,000 tons by 1978 (see

the proportion of divet-ed traffic is only about 20p in 1973, it would be
25% by 1978, mainly because of increased export diversion. Thus Limassol's
relative 1rimportance as an export port would increase as a result of the
proposed project.

E. Passenger Traffic
Present Situation
4.12      Passenger traffic in the IMediterranean has shown considerable
fluctuation in recent years, depending upon the political situation. The
number of one-day visitors to Cyprus by sea (mainly cruise passengers) in-
creased by 6% per annun in the period 1961-1966 and reached 55,000 in
1966. Passenger movements other than one-day visitors increased only by
2,i per annum during the same period.
4.13      At Liinassol in 1966, there were 21,000 one-dav visitors and
39,000 other passenger movements.   The numbers for the two categories at
Famagusta. were 23;000 and 10,000 respectivelv.

5. THE PROJECT
General Ikscription (NMap 3)
5.01      The project is mainly to build a new deep-water, alongside berth
port at Limassol, some 2 miles southwest of the existing lighterage port,
able to accommodate the forecast traffic.
5.02      The project at Limassol consists of (i) a main and a secondary
breakwater, the harbor entrance facing east with a depth of 12.0 m; (ii) twTo
passenger berths and four general cargo berths, with a total length of 800 m,
and 11 m depth of water; (iii) a passenger terminal that includes offices;
for Port Administration and Customs and a signal station; (iv) two transit
sheds and two produce inspection sheds; (v) the necessary roads, with
parking, Isorting and storage areas: (vi) dredging of the harbor basin and
turning c-rcle to a depth of 11 m; (vii) reclamation of additional areas
for shore facilities: (viii) careo-handling eoumnment: (ix) engineering ser-

Subsoil Conditions
5.06      Having regard to the sea bed contours and subsoil conditions,it
would have been preferable to locate the new port about one km south of'
the location finally chosen but this was not possible because the adjacent
land was not available.  Nevertheless, the site chosen is adequate and
provides mmple room for future development.
5.07      Extensive borings have been made at the port site and indicate
varying lyers of sand, silt, clay, gravel and soft sandstone.  lqo sand-
stone is located above dredged depth and the strata are generally suitable
for founding piles of reasonable length for the construction of the quays.
Model Studies
5.08      In the last few years, four engineering consultants have prepared
different layouts for the port of Limassol. There was no concurrence as to
the optimum siting of the entrance., t'bdel tests for different layouts were
carried ou1t in the U.X. to test the effects of storms from the northeast,
from wihere the most troublesome waves could be exDected. Satisfactory re-
sults were obtained for the chosen layout. The entrance faces east, taking
into account the prevailing westerly winds at Limassol; and provides the
most satisfactory approach for shipping from deep water some 1,000 m from
the shore line.  The entrance is open to the infrequent east-northeast
storms, but is fully protected from the prevailing southerly swells. The
adopted layout is the most suditable,
5.09      A model test is unnderway to determine the most suitable cross-
section of rubble mound type breakwaters, armored with precast concrete
blocks.

Construction and Procurement
5.17      RPT are preparing the designs and tender documents of the project.
All of the contracts for construction and equipment supply will be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's euidelines. The Ministrv of Communications and Works will be res..
ponsible for the execution of the project. Consulting engineers will
supervise construction. Proceeds of the loan would finance contracts
or purchase orders for foreign materials and equipment, the foreign component
of thA eonsts of engineerina and other consultative services, and of trainine
programs;  those for civil works would be a part of the periodic payments

as some equipment will need replacement in another three or four years.
Port Land Area
5.19      The land area will cover about 60 ha and no difficulties are ex.-
pected in its acquisition.  It will be ample for future extensions and for
warehouses, open storage, cold store and precooling store, grain silos, pro-
duce inspection sheds and a wine tank compound. The flat area just above
high tide level will. have to be raised to a reasonable working level free
from flooding.

6. ECONOQIIC EVALUATION
A. Introduction
6.01      The economic evaluation of the proposed new deep-water port in
Limassol was done in two stages: first, to establish whether construction of
the new nort was the most economic neans of handling the growing export-
import traffic of Cyprus, and secondly, if the first stage answer was
affirmative, whether the benefits of the new port would yield an adequate
economic return on the proposed investment.
B. Analysis of Alternative Port Development Schemes
6.02      To establish the most economic means of handling the growing foreign
trade traffin of CGypnru   three alternt1vp sehehmes of nort development were
considered, on the assumption that a new deep-water port will be built at;
Tm".nne- (ffor wiijfch tho ne%o-neat. hasz already  Aeon awarded):

might want to use it, on the assumption that the present

0.03      The economic co.stsi ol     thhese tihet  %teu rv i ( h sorn,e
variations of each), both capital and recurring costs, were discounted
by 10%, the assumed opportuniity cost of capital in C'ypus, to deterr4rne tLhe
most economic scheme. The calculations show scheme (iii) for the construc-
tion of a new deep-water port at Limassol as proporuu to ue the least
expensive (see Appendix 3).
6.04      The proposed investments in the passenger berths and other
passenger facilities in the new deep-water port in 'iLassol were separate'y
evaluated and found to have adequate economic justification (see para. 6.14).
C. Evaluation of Deep-Water Port at Limassol
6.05      The main quantifiable benefits derived from building a deep-water
port in Limassol would consist of substantial reductions in costs oI nandling
cargo by elimination of lighterage, damage to cargo and ships' servicing time
in port, and/or savings on inland transport cost, Since facilities for
passenger handling are included in the project, the number of one-day
visitors to Limassol is expected to increase fourfold by 1973, resulting in
further substantial economic benefits.



- 20 -
6.o6      The traffic forecast has been discussed in Chapter 4. The cargo
traffic forecast relating to Limassol has been divided into two comDonents --
normal and diverted. Limassol's normal traffic is estimated at 302,000 tons
and 352,000 tons respectively in 1973 and 1978 and diverted traffic at
81,000 tons and 148,000.
D. Benefits to Normal Traffic
6.07      T'he benefits to the normal traffic at Limassol would consist of
savings in cargo handling costs. careo damaLe and shins' servicing time._
These are discussed below.
a. Salvings in Cargo Handling Costs
6.08      T'he elimination of lighterage and the consequent productivity
mrrovement, compared with the presen.t situt±on., are expcted _ result in.
a reduction of cargo handling costs at Limassol of E;C 0.850 per ton. The

6.09      Based on th  pr-oportion of perishable and easily damaged goods Uin
the total cargo and the present estimated losses, the reduction in damage
to goods would be I13 of the value oI imports and exports handied in Limassol,
or about EC; 1.4 per ton. The savings on this account would be EC 0.h2
million in 1973 and DC 0.49 million in 1978.
c. Savings in Cargo Ships' Servicing Time
6.10      The savings in the actual servicing (loading and unloading) time
of ships is estimated at 530 ship-days in 1973 and 690 ship-days in 1978.
Based on statistics piflished by westinform Ltd. of London, an average
ship-day in port, for ships visiting Cyprus, could be valued at EC 400 and
the total savings would be EC 0.21 million in 1973 and LC 0.28 mia vion
in 1978.
E. Benefits to Diverted Traffic
6.11      The main savings on diverted traffic will be a relatively modest
reduction in inland transportation costs. These were estimated by comparing
the costs of transporting the diverted ca&ogo bewveen their origins!
destinations in western Cyprus and Famagusta and Limassol, and amount to
EC 0.940 per ton. These savings would amount to EC 0.08 million in 1973
and EC 0.l1u million in 1978. There will also be some savings on account. of
reduced congestion in Famagusta, valued at EC 0.01 million in 1973 and
EC 0.03 million in 1978.



- 21 -
F. Lase Ser Traffic
6.12      Because of its geographic location in relation both to centers of
tourist attraction inl Cprus and to !       fdit-erraneani countries; Limassol wouild
attract a large number of passenger liners and cruise ships.   At present,
a m aority of shi pfassengers do not come ashore bease the ships must
anchor offslhore. When a new deep-water port is built, the number of one--
da-y visitoras z'Y.1 increase suLb.sa-,Ol 1ni   and the grsse xpenditure by these
visitors is expected to be EC 0.30 million in 1973 and EC 0.40 million in
1978U. TLIe ne&IJ fooreign, excharige beneiLts 'tI o L  YprU' w-Lw.l1. be to.C  million
and SC 0.19 million in 1973 and 1978, respectively.
6.13      The construction of passenger berths may also encourage other
tourists, but it is not possible to quantify the likely benefits from thils
because of lack of data.
G. Economic Return
6.14      The benefits of the new port, discussed above, have been estimited
on the assuxw tion that 1973 would be the first year of operation and that;
by 1978 the optimum capacity of the port would be reached.   The total bene-
fits to cargo traffic would amount to EC 0.98 million in 1973 and EC 1.211
million in L978. Projected over an assumed average economic life of 30
years for the facilities, these benefits yield a return of 15% on the
investments in the breakwaters, the cargo quays, transit sheds, etc. (but
excluding passenger quays and terminal). The anticipated benefits from
passenger traffic yield a return of over l7% on the investments in passenger
facilities. The benefits to cargo traffic alone work out to a return of
close to )l%2 on the whole project. The overall return on the whole project
(including benefits from passenger traffic) is estimated at above 15%.
6.15      A sensitivity analysis was carried out by making different assump-
tions regarIine the total project costs, the growth rate of exports and
imports, average cargo handling costs per ton, savings in ships' servicirng
time. inlancl transport costs per ton, and reduction in damage. In addition,
a + 10% variation on the most probable estimate was tested.   Among the
elements to which the return is relatively sensitive are project construction
cost, reduction in damage to cargo, value of ship time and cargo handling
cost. Based on the various assumptions; the rate of return is still
expected to be adequate (see Table 4).

7. PORT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
7.01     T'he Government has earmarked the sum of EC 7.6 million for port
investment during the Second Five-Year Plan, 1967-71. The principal items
are the present project at Limassol and the new port at Larnaca, with Minor
construction and improvements at Famagusta, Paphos and Kyrenia. The
Government expected that, of a planned total development exnenditure of
about EC 67 million on all sectors, about three-fourths would be financed
by Government and public enterprise;_ and the rest by hnrrowing, mostlv
abroad. The total costs of Limassol (tC 6.6 million) and Larnaca (EC 147
million) exceed the nlan provision for nort development, but these proi£--ts
would involve an expenditure of only about EC 6 million up to 1971.
7.02      UJpon completion of construction of the new harbors at Limssol. and
Larnae-a all three deep-water ,rts will be capable o4f cor..iderable devcp-

should be Lnrit iJateU riu. later 'Ean 1978 to provide some 400 m of additional

B. The Financial Situation of the Proposed National Port Authority
8.04      Financial forecasts have also been prepared for the Port Authority
as a whole, excluding Paphos and Kyrenia,for the years 1973 to 1978, using
the same tariffs as estimated for Limassol.
8.05      Appendix 5 gives the assumptions used and discusses the forecasts
in detail. Table 8 shows the consolidated revenue account, Tables 9 and 10
the individual revenue accounts for Famagusta and Larnaca, Table 11 the
consolidated cash flow statement and Table 12 the consolidated balance
sheets. The assumptions include a return to the Government by way of in-
terest on the Government's investment.
8.o6      The consolidated estimated revenue Dosition is summarized as
follows:

8.07      The overall operating ratios for the port authority are higher
thLan for the new port at Limassol alone.  This is due partly to the
different traffic mix but largely to the fact that Larnaca by itself would
do litle more than cover operating costs.    However, these ratios are not
unduly high. On the assumption that a return to the Government on its
investments in port facilities would be warranted, total interest and debt
service coverage would be adequate, rising to 1.42 times and 1.64 times
respectively by 1978. mhe financial rates of return are very close to those
for Limessol alone increasing from 5.5% to 8.3% on average net fixed assets.



8.08      The cash flow statemient indicates a healthy cash position, after
allowing for a return on equity; the cash accumulations for the six years
would reach nearly EC 1.7 million, more than sufficient to finance the
expansion of facilities and plant replacements which might be needed at
that time (see para. 7.03).  The cash flow statement is suiwnarized as follows:

8.10      The broad outlines of all the financial forecasts were discusssed
with representatives of the Government of -Cypruis andL agreea upon auring
loan negotiations.
Capital Stnl*cture of the New Nletional Port Auth(orit.r
8.11      UJpon comxpletion of construction of the proj:ect, the assets,
excluding thie access road and the cost of the 'water mains and electricity
connections from Limassol to the port, will be transferred at cost to the
Port Authority. The Authority will assume a debt to the Government
equivalent to the Bank loan relative to the assets taken over, upon the
same terms and conditions. The existitng port assets wid-I be transferred
at a valuation based on replacement costs less depreciation (with adjustmiants
for facilitlas to be withdrawn from use at larnaca and Limassol). The termts
and conditionls ulpon which the Governunent's capital contribution will be
mad.      The esto the Authority will be settled at the time of drafting
the enabling legislation.

Taxation
8.12      ]t is not yet known whether the new Port Authority will be liable
to taxation on nrofits or nroDertv. This will be clarified in the
legislation.
Tariff Policy of the New Port Authority
8.13      Larnaca will be a relatively expensive port, considering the
berthing facilities now. be;ing prov-ded rel±Avt;  to the volu-mne of traffic
forecast. If port charges were to be set at Larnaca based on costs in
t.hat port, including a reason-able return on investment, they would prbal
be such as to drive traffic to Famagusta or Limassol, resulting in pro-
bable congestion a+ those ports and    dertilzation at        rnaca.  Ho er,
the new investment at Larnaca is relatively small compared with the tota:L
.    Uvine±nv in tLhe VhLr.e YVAJ po  nL& WYj.JUD UO an., as OAVWA. 4 .U LA4O analyi
any shortfall could be absorbed by an acceptable degree of cross-subsidization,
without maki ng the rates at Famagusta an.d Liassol excessive.  ThUere is,
therefore, no purpose in having different tariffs at the three ports and

.-L       Apa rt from providing funds for service of the Bank loan, plant
replacements and any necessary increase in operating working capital, the
tariff policy of the Port Authority will be inifuenced principally by
three considerations:   (a)  the amounts of reserves that should be created,
especially for future investments;   kb) debt service, ir any, on tne
Government's contributions to capital;   and (c)  the incidence of taxation.
it has been demonstrated above that the Port Authority, by adopting uniform
tariffs based on costs, can earn a return on investment from which interest
on the Bank loan and a reasonable return to the Government on its equity
can be paid and which will leave cash funds which, together with depre-
ciation reserves, will enable plant to be replaced, working capital to
be maintained, debt to be repaid, and reserves accumulated to cover
contingencies and to finance future investments. The Government has agreed
that tariffs will be set so as to enable the Authority to earn a return
on investment rising to not less than 7% on average net fixed assets for
1978 and to maintain an adequate cash position.
Audit
8.15      The Government has agreed that external auditors, satisfactory
to the Bank, will be appointed to the Port Authority upon its creation.
Insurance
8.16      The Government has agreed that the Port Authority will take out
and maintain with reputable insurers insurance cover for such risks and
for such amounts as are consistent with good commercial practice.

Existing Port Facilities
Famagusta
1.       FamaRusta is the only breakwvater deep-draft port in the island.
It consists of an inner basin constructed in 1905 and a new outer basin
completed in 1965. Ships 130 m lonz and of draft not exceeding 6.7 m
can enter the inner basin and berth alongside the main 530 m quay.

2.       The main hbraIktatpr offers gond protection against nrevailina
winds and use of the port is unaffected by weather.
3.       The 1160 m quays, all of concrete block, allow for berthing of
9 or 10 ships.  The r,uai,r pnron is nhnnt 22 m¶.ride in the inner hbqi n ,ri

the Hay-Juie peak season, wmen there is some congestion.
5.       There is a small lignter basin at the soutnern end of the inner
h'arbor whiere an adequate number of lighters and towing launches is
available.  Since const'ruction of the new quaysa, double-banking of vessels
has been practically eliminated and consequently there is not much use for
the lighters.
6.       There are no speclal facilities available for handling passenger
traffic. Fresh water can be supplied in reasonable quantities; fuel
and oil is providcd. by tank lorries from Larnaca. Midnor engine and hull
repairs can be undertaken.
7.       Equipment at Famagusta includes one floating crane of 60 tons
lifting capacitr, 10 mobile cranes of 2 to 15 tons, 13 forklifts of 1.25
to 3 tons, 17 tractors, 140 trailers, 10 barges of 35 to 50 tons, 2 tug-s

one open of 390 sq m, and two open sorting areas of 4,440 sq m are available.
9.       Lirnassol is the main passenger port in Cyprus.  Tugs, barges,
ponatoonus anj d lighters carry imports and expcrts between berths and ships.
10.    -Te site of Limassol has no outstanding natural advantages for
a port other than its overall central position in relation to the main
production centers of Cyprus. However, about 26.w,000 tons of- cargo,
about 40,000 arriving or departing passengers and 20,000 one-day transit
passengers use the existing shallow-draft lighter basin annually.
U.,      Equipment at Limassol includes one fixed hand-driven crane of
20 tons lifting canacity, 14 mobile cranes of 2 to 12.5 tons, 2 forkl:Lfts
of 2 and 4 tons, 5 tractors, 40 trailers, 44 barges of 20 to 80 tons,
22 motor launches of 18 to 253 h.p., 2 speed boats of 100 and 200 h.p.
for passengers, 3 pontoons of 100 to 300 tons oor cars and 2 hopper-
barges of 45 cu in capacity each.
Larnaca
12.      At Larnaca ships anchor in the open sea about one mile from -a
small Jetty.  The jetty has a wooden deck supported on steel piles. 'Joods
and passengers are transported to and from shore by lighters of 20 to 80
tons capacity. Larnaca is the third passenger port in Qyprus after Liimassol
and Fanagusta.
13.      Three warehouses totalling 2,450 sq m, one open shed of 216 .sq m,
and open stacking areas of 4,50o sq m are available. An oil tanker buoy
is used to unload tankers through submarine pipelines to Drivately-on-ied
tanks on shore, handling about 250,000 tons a year.
14.      The site of Larnaca has no outstanding natural advantage for
a port.  It is 26 miles from Famagusta and 40 miles from Limassol.
15.      :5auipment at Larnaca includes one fixed hand-driven erane of 7
tons lifting capacity, 5 mobile cranes of 2 tons each, 2 tractors, 25
trailers, 7 barges of 2  tons each and 4- tiigs nf 30 h-p. each.



APPENDIX 1

16.      In 1968, the Government entrusted Messrs. Bertlin and Partners
of the U.K. with the preparation of detailed engineering and contract
documents for a new breakwater port with 9.5 m water depth at Larnaca.
The contract has been awarded, and construction is scheduled to start
shortly; 2 berths of 326 m long, 2 transit sheds 30 x 100 m each and 1
warehouse 30 x 100 m will be provided. Additional berths can be
constructed within the harbor.
Paphos and Kyrenia
17.      Paphos, in the southwest corner of the island, has a shallow-
draft pier alongside of which small vessels of about 50 m overall length
and 3 m draft can berth. Cranes and warehouse facilities are provided.
18.     IKyrenia, on the north side of the island, is a shallow-draft
breakwater port that can handle small craft un to 3 m draft.   Tt is
suitable for sheltering small craft and fishing boats.
]IYineral Ports
19.      Karavostassi, timni and Vassiliko-Zyyi are mainly used for
mineral e-morts.  The first tvw. each have a pier and a sufficient ruber
of lighters to load ships anchored at sea. Although Vassiliko-Zyyi,
locatec between Larnaca and limassol, has a pier and lIghters which are
occasionally used, loading is mainly by aerial ropewfay.



APPOIDIX 2

CYPRUS PORT PROJECT
Port of Limassol
Berthage and Depth of Water Required
A. BErthage
1.       The numnber and length of berths req-ired for general cargo
depends upon several considerations, some of which are inter-related,
includinrg a) totnl tonnage of cargo, b) t-he volume of bulk or bagged .nd
baled cargo, c) the discharge or loading ra-te, d) availability oI labDr,
number of shi:--..s and -ro3activi+- , e) nVrk of ships andi f) average ship
time at berth.
2.       In 1975, the third year of operation of the neTw port, 615 general
caruo ship's  we"-- e=' ected  Lt0 load or UH schlarge a tot,=.. of 430,000 tons. I±n
1978, 715 ships will handle 500,000 tons. The average tonnage per ship
is ass,ed t-; beV 7.
G-eneral Cargo
3.*      The average length' of cargo ships calling at Cyprus ports is
about 120 meters and, with 10 meters spacing, individual berths would be
130 m.eters.  A reasonable average tonnage per meter of berth would be
900. On a cargo basis, the total length and number of berths would be:
1975        480 meters      3.7 berths
1978        556 meters      4.3 berths
This would give about 120,000 tons per berth, which is a reasonable figure
for this length of berth and for the types of cargo handled.
4.       To load and discharge an average of 700 tons per ship call, at
an average rate of 50 tons per hour, assuning multiple hatch worling,
each ship would work for 14 hours.  On the basis of one-shift working plus
approximately 50% overtime, it is estimated that each ship would occupy
a berth for an average of 1 1/2 days, excluding weekends and holidays.
Multiple shift working is unlikely because of a)lack of labor, b) the
necessity of conforming to Customs Department working hours, and c)
conforming to consignees' working hours.



APPENDIX 2
Page 2
5.       At the rate of 120,000 tons per berth and 700 tons per ship
each berth would accomnodate 175 ships a year. The number of berths
required to accommodate the forecast ships would be:
1975         615 ships     175  = 3.5 berths
1978         715 ships a   175  = 4.0 berths
These 1igures compare favorably with the number of berths required for
handling cargo. On the basis of 300 worKing days per annum (after
allowing for weekends and public holic'ays) each ship could stay at ber^th
1.7 days.  Tiis compares witn tne average time at bertn OL 1 1/2 days
calculated in para. 4 above.
6.       The conclusion, therefore, is that the port should have a
minimum of four cargo berths with a total length of about 520 meters I;o
handle thle traffic up to 1978, although some congestion in the later years
during pteak periods is foreseen.
Passenger Ships
7.       With regard to passenger ships, which would be largely on criLse,
the number is expected to be 550 in 1975 and 625 in 1978. On the whol2e
cruise ships would wish to be in port during day-light hours to enable
the passengers to have adeouate time ashore to visit places of interest.
It is therefore assumed that a berth wouLd accommodate one ship each 24
hours, a:Lthough in the case of cruise ships one could expect weekends and
holidays to be working days in the port.   Over the whole year, to handle
the forecast number of ships, 1 1/2 berths would be recuired in 1975 aMd
1-3/4 berths in 1978. Therefore, since about 75% or more of passenger ships
call frorn April to October, a minimum of two passenger ship berths is
required.
8.       The total minimum requirements to handle the traffic up to 1597a
are therefore:
)i nrnno berthst Q  130 mIters      = 52n mPters
2 passenger berths @ 140 meters    = 280 meters
800 meters
9.       At present very little cargo is containerized and importers acnd
exporters in Cyprus do not expect any rapid move towards containerization.
The required berthage has, therefore, been calculated on the basis of
normal mixed general break-bulk cargo, although provision is being madte
for one berth to be strengthened so as to handle containers.
B. Depth of W.ater
10.      During 1967  91% of ships calling at Limassol had drafts lesa
than 25 feet (7.62 ma and none exceeded 30 ft. (9.2 m). Moreover. since
Limassol is an intermediate port, many of these ships were not fully loaded.
None of the lines Dresentlv  antive   in the area contemnlate new shins



APPENDIX 2
Page 3
having drafts much exceeding the existing one.
11.      Nevertheless, the general trend of transportation development
makes it probable that the shipping pattern in the Eastern i'iedit-er ranean
will change during the coming decade, and fewer vessels will be carrying
larger cargoes. No record of the actual draft of snips now callirng is
available. Although, to a large extent, Limassol is an intermediate port,
it cannot be assumed that the use of Limassol as a port of final loading
will not increase i-n the future.  From this point of view a draft of
break-bulk general-cargo vessel of 32 ft. (9.8 mi), about the average of
the largest being built, should be provided for some of the berthage.
Such a vessel would be about 550 ft. long (168 m).
12.      The remainder of the berthage could have a lesser depth.   A
draft of 25 ft. (7.62 m), which could acconmodate 90% of present shipping,
might be a suitable maxiLmum for this portion.  The length of such a ship
would be about 450 ft. (137 m). However, it seems doubtful that the
savings derived from constructing part of the berthage with a reduced
depth w¢ould compensate for the resulting loss of operational flexibility.
13.      The only passenger ship with a draft of more than 30 feet which
called at Limassol in 1967 was the "France" (34h 6").   However, this
vessel was built in 1961 and will be obsolete by 1980.
14.      To maximnfze tourist trade earnings, Limassol should be able to
accept large "world cruise type" vessels as well as scheduled service
vessels and vessels normally cruising only the MPediterranean.  In view of
the foregoing, the fu-ture maximum draft of wiorld cruise -type vessels can
be reasonably taken as that of the Queen Eizabe+h II with 32' 7 1 /2"
(9.92 m) draft and 290 m length.
15.      The average length of cargo ships expected to use Limassol is
120n m and the average length of passenger ships _ is1/,0 m.  Suitable underkeel
clearance should be allowed alongside the berths, in the turning circle and
at the entrar.ce.

CYPRUS PORT PROJECT
Evaluation of Alternative Port
f Develop2Mnt Schemes
1.        The three alternative port development schemes evaluated by the
Bank mission are briefly described in Chapter 6    '. mThese scheres, with minor
variations in each of them, are reviewed in the following paragraphs.
A. Improvement of Famagusta, with continuation of present lighterage
facilities at Lizmassol
2.        Th.is scheme (para. 6.02 (i) J would be designed to handle all
general cargo traffic of Cyprus other than that which would use the new
dee.p-water port at larnaca and the present lighterage facilities at Limassol
(whose present capacity is estimated at about 250,000 tons a year). Under
this alternativte, on the assuption that Larnaca could operate at its opti-
mum capacity of 200,000 tons of cargo per year, the traffic handled at the
three ports would be as follows:
('000 tons)
1273     1278
Famagusta                          924      905
LLmassol                          250       250
Larnaca                            200      200
Total      1,174    1,355
3.        Since there is some congestion in Famagusta even at the present
traff±c lerel of about 750,000 tons a year, additional berths would be needed
for handlinig the traffic at that port around 1977-78. With three years re-
qu4red for- construction, constructimn should start in 1975.  The capital. cost
of this scheme would be about SC 2.75 milliai (A (i) in attached Table)).  If,
on the other hand, Larnaca were not able to operate at its estimated care-
city, additional capacity at Famagusta would be needed earlier, by around
.7194-75 / (i.i  ).
14.       hne recurring cost of this scheme would be the following:
(a) Handling costs on 250,000 tons of cargo continuing to use
the Limassol lighterage facilities in the form of lighter-
age and extra cargo-handling costs (EC 0.850 per ton: para.
6.08), damage to perishable goods that would result from
continued lighterage operation (1% of value or SC 1.400 per
ton:  para. 6.09); and additional ships' servicing time,
valued at EC 400 per ship-day in port (para. 6.10). These
together would amount to EC O073 million a year.

I:b) Additional overland transport cost on about 133,000 tons
of cargo in 1973 rising to 250,000 tons in 1978 for trans-
port from the Limassol area to Famagusta/Larnaca (about
EC Q.940 Der ton: para. 6.11). This would amount to
EC 0.13 million in i973 and SC 0.24 million in 1978 and
thereafter.
(c) Loss of net foreign exchange benefits arising from passenger
traffic amountlin to 2G 0.1L milion in 1973 and SC 0.19
million in 1978 and thereafter (para. 6.12).
The additional total recurring costs of this scheme would amount to EC 1.01
million in 1-971. ri8;in to Tfl 1 .1n millinn in 1978.

traffic benefits is considered or not.
B.  lmroer2ant of Famagusta to handle all general cargo traffic except
traffic lasing Larnaca
8.        under this scheme (para. 6.02 (i) )j, the present light1erage fac.i-
lities at Linmssol would be closed down and all traffic diverted to Farmagusta
or Larnaca. Since the overland transport cost differential as between Faragusta



APPENDIX 3
Page 3
and Larnaca from the Limassol area is negligible, and because of draft l:Lmi-
+ations at :Larnaca, it s assumied that Famaausta would be expanded to handle
the additional traffic, after allowting for operation of Larnaca to handle
200,000 -n +^.  TUr.d-er +hnee  qm,nqtions- the. traffic at Fanmagusta and Larniaca
would be as follows:
1973     1978
Famagusta                         974     1,155
Ir-a- ca                          200       200
This would req-Xu   two additionaU l berths in F agUSta byJ 1973 and a fur-t-her
two berths by 1978 at a total cost of EC 4,35 -million if construction is under-
taken in a single s1wge (B ( ' )   Ud nC 26 .  .ri  oII [U fol . wL Ur ± sa  L  ;-o 70Zr-UhS
and EC 1.9 million for the second set of berths if undertaken in two stages
(B (i) )J
9.        .mie additional recurring cOs'i uniuer  I sc     would be the e. a
overland transportation cost (EC 0.940 per ton) to Famagusta/Larnaca on cargo
(383,000 tolls in 1973 and 500,000 tons in l978) which  -uuld use a deep=w:ter
port in Lirmtssol if one were built, amounting to bC 0.36 million in 1973 and
EC 0.47 million in 19l8 and tnereafter. The extra overland tzrasportatioin cost
understates the true cost of diverting the Limassol lighter traffic to FanWL-
gusta since it does not reflect (a) the damage to perishables such as frtiit
which extra land transportation can cause and (b) the advantages to citrus
and grape growers of having a port within an hourts distance from their f'arms,
compared with a three-hour run to Fanmagusta. This scheme would also involve
foregoing benefits likely to accrue from passenger traffic at Limassol.
10.       Using a 101S discount rate, the present value of the capital anci re-
curring costs of this scheme ranges between SC 6.L4 million and Kc 7.9 million
depending on the tintng of new investments and on whether loss of passenger
traffic beneifits is taken into consideration or not.
C. Construction of deep-water port at Limassol
11.       This is the proposed project scheme, costing IC 6.01 million withAout
the passenger facilities (C (i) ) and EC 6.36 million including the pass,.n_er
facilities (C (iii) ). Exclusion of passenger facilities would involve fore-
going the benefits from passenger traffic amounting to SC 0.14 million in
1973, rising to EC 0.19million in 1978 and thereafter. Using a 10% discount
rate, the present value of this scheme is SC 5.0 million without taking into
consideration passenger facilities or benefits therefrom and SC 5.6 mill-lion
with passenger facilities.



12.       A variation of this scheme involving a two-year postponement of
construction of the deep-water port was also examined. The additional eco-
nomic cost would be the benefits foregone over a two-year period.    The pre-
sent value of the cost of this sceleme works out to SC 5.4 million withouit
passenger -facilities (C (ii) ) and EC 6.2 million with passenger facilities
(C (i).
D. Conclusion
13.       The results of the analysis are nresented in the attarhed table.    It
shows that the construction of a deep-water port in Limassol is the most eco-
nomic of the various alternatives nnnsidered-

CYPRUS PORT PROJECT
Financial Situation of the Iiew Port at Limassol
Additional Information Regarding Tariff Estimates
1.       IThe basic methods used by the Bank missi cn for establishin1g
tariffs are described in Chapter 8 - A of the report.
2.        The tariff rates arrived at are set out in Table 5, together with
the present rates (common to all pnrts of C' fl'us) approximated or averaged
where necessary.
3.        Having calculated tariffs, they were then compared, so far as is
possible, with rates at other ports in nearby countries, or at ports with
somewhat similar circumstances, to ensure that they would not be so high
as to iniure the trade of Cyprus in comquetition with other countries, e .g.,
Israeli citrus exports. Such a comparison is difficult because of differ-
ing tariff structures and methods ox charging and a general absence of
adequate costing systems and of tariffs related to cost in other ports.
However, the mission is of the opon that the assunmed rates for Limassol
would be well within the general scales of charges at similar or possibly
comneting ports.
4.        'rThe assumed t-ariffs weree then reviewed to see whether the in-
creases over the present charges would be likely to discourage cargo traf-
fic or the tourist trade, or result in ocean freight increases, in other
words, to consider Twxhat the traffic wvould bear. This was done by comparing
the additional ch-arges against ships, cargo and passengers, with the econ-
omic savings calculated in Chapter 6 of the report.
5.        Table 6 compares the assumed rates with the estimated economic
sa5vi1gs of the project. So far as cargo ships are concerned, the increases
in port charges would absorb most of the savings irn ship waiting time, leav-
ing a net saving per ship of about 3C 41, equivalent to bC 0.059 per ton of
cargo.  However, each ton of cargo will save fromr SC 1.2 to 2.5 in redluc-
tion of wh-afage charges and in savings in lighterage, double handling and
damage or diversion costs. There is margin to increase port charges on cargo
should it become necessary to raise tariffs generally above the estimated
rates. Regarding passenger ships and passengers (mainly cruise), each ship
would pay an average of about SC 2.450 more per passenger against which
each passengrer would save DC 1.300 in the cost of going ashore. The net;
increase of about SC 1.150 in port charges per passenger would deter neither
cruise ships from calling nor passengers from going ashore. Passengers,
other than one-day visitors, would save EC 0.400 at each embarkation or cis-
embarkation.

Financial Situation of the Proposed National Port Authority
Assuptions Used and Additional information
1.        In considering the future finarncial situation of *bhe proposed
National Port Authority, the minor ports of Paphos and Kyrenia have been.
ignored as being too small to have any material effect on the finances of
the Port Auth'ority as a wfhole. For simplification it has been assumed that
the Port Authority i-ll commernce operations on January 1, 1973, when the
new port at Larnaca will be completed and in operation and Limassol in opera-
tion and that expenditure on the Limassol project will have been fully dis-
bursed by that date.
20        Other assumptions used are:
a) that the Bank loan of US$115. million will be made to the
Goverrment, effective during the latter half of 1969, at 04
and ttlat amortization of the loan will be in 41 equal half-
yearly payments of interest and capital, the first being made
in June 1974, and that the equivalent of the loan in Cyprus;
currency will be lent to the Authority by the Government on
the same telrms and conditions as to interest and repayment;
b) that the Government's opening equity capital in the Authority
will consist of i) the local currency costs of the Bark project,
ii) the cost of the new port at Larnaca plus necessary plant,
iii) the wfritten down replacement cost, as estimated by Banrk
staff, of the fixed assets to be taken over at Famagusta, and
iv) working capital euivalent to about one month",s cash opera-
ting expenses;
c)  that the Port Authority would not take over the existing
lighterage operations;7
d) that there is no debt other thnn i,n respect of the propose
Bank loan;
e) that interest will be paid to the Government at 5% per annmu
on the orig-nal amount of its capital contribution on January 1,
1973 and that interest will be earned on cash surpluses at ',%
per annum. No provision is made for repayment of equity capital;
f)  that plant wil be replaced uo a value of bC 100,000 each yetar
(at Famagusta);
g) that uniform tariffs will be in effect at all three ports;



APPENDIX 5
Page 2
h) that productivity and ship time in port will be uniform
at all ports;
:1) storage charges and other miscellaneous revenue have
been conservatively estimated from figures suggested
by the Cyprus Government;
;) no provision has been made for income or other taxes.
3.        WrJith regard to e) above,, it became apparent that. in fixing tariffs
to earn a reasonable rate of return, cash surpluses would probably be gener-
ated in excess of the requirements for plant replacement and future invest-
ment, in addition to which additional revenue would be earned from investing
those surpluses, and that some return to the Government could be made o:a its
