production to replace mainly\n            exportable fuel oil and imported diesel and LPG. In\n            addition, condensate recovered from the gas would release\n            exportable crude oil. The resultant foreign exchange\n            earnings from increased exports and savings from reduced\n            imports would be substantial. The gas would be produced at\n            Abu Qir and supplied to industrial users in the Alexandria\n            area. The project would consist of: (i) a production\n            platform with 9 wells, a utility platform, ancillary\n            facilities, and 2 submarine pipelines; (ii) gas separation,\n            gas dehydration and condensate recovery facilities, a slug\n            catcher, an LPG plant, a flare system and supply and\n            distribution pipelines onshore; and (iii) technical\n            assistance, training, a seismic survey, and project related studies."}, "docdt": "1982-02-19T05:06:05Z"}
