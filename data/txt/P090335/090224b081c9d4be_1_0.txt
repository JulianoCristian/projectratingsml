                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Project development objective : Achieve a paradigm shift in China's urban transport and land-use policies and investments toward the promotion of public and non-
                         motorized transport, modes that are less energy intensive and polluting than those fostered by current urban land-use planning and transport systems in China.

                         Global Environment objective : Slow the forecast growth of urban transport greenhouse gas emissions in China's cities.

                         Since the last ISR, the project has continued to make progress in the procurement and implementation of a number of TAs, both at the national and pilot city levels. The national
                         level capacity development component has continued to perform well. At the city level, progress varies among pilot cities. Six city-level TAs have been completed, seven are

                         the grant closing date, all TA activities should be completed and the project is likely to achieve its development objective.
