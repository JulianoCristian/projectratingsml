                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Project development objective : Achieve a paradigm shift in China's urban transport and land-use policies and investments toward the promotion of public and non-
                         motorized transport, modes that are less energy intensive and polluting than those fostered by current urban land-use planning and transport systems in China.

                         Global Environment objective : Slow the forecast growth of urban transport greenhouse gas emissions in China's cities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation performance has been mixed, with the Local Component doing better than the National Component. The project implementation picked up pace during
                         the last two years, but not fast enough to complete all project activities, especially at the national level. The project received a 12-month extension last year to allow for the project

                         consultancy services had to be cancelled. The project is scheduled to close on June 30, 2014, but there are some discussion between the Bank and Ministry of Finance to possibly
                         restructure and extend the grant closing date.
