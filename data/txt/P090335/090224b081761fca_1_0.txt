                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Project development objective : Achieve a paradigm shift in China's urban transport and land-use policies and investments toward the promotion of public and non-
                         motorized transport, modes that are less energy intensive and polluting than those fostered by current urban land-use planning and transport systems in China.

                         Global Environment objective : Slow the forecast growth of urban transport greenhouse gas emissions in China's cities.

                         Since the last ISR, the project has made significant progress in procurement of a number of TAs, both at the national and pilot city levels. The national level capacity development
                         component has been performing well. At the city level, progress varies among pilot cities. Five city-level TAs have been completed, two are on going, and all remaining TAs except

                         submitted to the Bank, the disbursement ratio will increase. Despite previous delays in procurement processes, the project is on track toward the achievement of project development

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In the next few months, major effort is required for the National PMO and the pilot cities to complete the procurement of all remaining TAs. The processing of disbursement should
                         also be sped up by the MOF.
