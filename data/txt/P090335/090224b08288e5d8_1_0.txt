                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Project development objective : Achieve a paradigm shift in China's urban transport and land-use policies and investments toward the promotion of public and non-
                         motorized transport, modes that are less energy intensive and polluting than those fostered by current urban land-use planning and transport systems in China.

                         Global Environment objective : Slow the forecast growth of urban transport greenhouse gas emissions in China's cities.
