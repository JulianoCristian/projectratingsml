First, to\n            assure optimum utilization of the results of the TA\n            (Technical Assistance) measures of the project, further TA\n            (in the form of management consultants to implement the\n            results) should be considered in the follow-up projects.\n            Second, in the future, IDA should ensure that TOR (Terms of\n            Reference) for such a substantial institution building\n            effort are not beyond what the borrower and implementing\n            agency can accept. IDA should ensure the borrower and\n            implementing agency ownership of the proposed TA measure."}, "docdt": "1996-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
