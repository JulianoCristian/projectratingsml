Transport\n            Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project for\n            Benin will be to assist the Government in rehabilitating and\n            maintaining the country's priority transport\n            infrastructure (mainly in ports and highways), and to\n            support policy reforms to accelerate the deregulation and\n            liberalization in the sector. In addition, the project aims\n            at strengthening sector institutions, improving road\n            maintenance, limiting new road construction to economically\n            justified sections, and improving cost recovery and\n            maintenance funding. To reach these objectives, the project\n            consists of four components including: (a) a port\n            rehabilitation program; (b) a road maintenance and\n            rehabilitation program; (c) an institution-strengthening\n            program; and (d) a cost recovery program. The principal\n            benefits expected from the project will be protection of\n            previous investment in the sector, reduced transport costs\n            and increased efficiency of transport sector institutions."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
