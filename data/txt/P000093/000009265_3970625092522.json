In addition, the project aims\n            at strengthening sector institutions, improving road\n            maintenance, limiting new road construction to economically\n            justified sections, and improving cost recovery and\n            maintenance funding.  To reach these objectives, the project\n            consists of four components including (a) a port\n            rehabilitation program, (b) a road maintenance and\n            rehabilitation program, (c) an institution-strengthening\n            program and (d) a cost recovery program.  The principal\n            benefits expected from the project will be protection of\n            previous investment in the sector, reduced transport costs\n            and increased efficiency of transport sector institutions."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
