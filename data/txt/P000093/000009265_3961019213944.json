achievements of the project in road\n            rehabilitation and maintenance are expected to be\n            sustainable. A major factor in project success was the high\n            quality of dialogue, based on consensus building between the\n            IDA task managers, all experienced road engineers, and Benin\n            staff involved in project implementation. There was also\n            unusual continuity in task management throughout the\n            project's lifetime. Progress in implementing\n            institutional reforms had been limited prior to the\n            ministerial reorganization of 1992. Starting in early 1992,\n            both the Transport Ministry and the PAC were able to move\n            forward rapidly with works, programming, studies and\n            privatization activities which had previously been stalled.\n            The 1994 illness and death of the Minister of Public Works\n            and Transport left a vacuum in leadership for about a year,\n            which had a negative impact on the project management but\n            little impact on the project objectives' outcome thanks\n            to the continued dedication of key technical staff. The\n            assessment of outcome is rated satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: participatory preparation of a full sector\n            strategy document has led to the implementation of reform\n            measures, the harmonization of donor activities, and the\n            adoption of appropriate technical standards. The full-time\n            permanent technical assistance arrangements in the project\n            were very expensive and did not work well. A better\n            arrangement has been worked out for the follow-up program,\n            involving short-term technical assistance to achieve\n            specific objectives linked to performance indicators. A\n            combination of both local and international consultants will\n            offer the advantages of both costs reduction and local accessibility."}, "docdt": "1996-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
