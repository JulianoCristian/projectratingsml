MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TRE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 15.2 MILLION
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR A TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE RERABILITATION
AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed Development Credit to the Peo-
ple's Republic of Benin for SDR 15.2 m (US$ 19.5 m equivalent) is submitted
for approval. The proposed credit vould be on standard IDA terms and would
assist in financing a Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Mainte-
nance Project. A portion of the proceeds of the Credit (US$ 4.8 m equiva-
lent) vould be on-lent to the Cotonou Port Authority (PAC) , at an annual
rate of 8Z vith a repayment period of 18 years, including 3 years of grace.
*          The foreign exchange risk would be borne by FAC.
2.        Background.  Benin's transport systea provides both an essential
prerequisite for the country's development, and one of the main interna-
tional transit corridors for neighboring landlocked Sahelian countries.
The system is composed of a road network of about 7,500 km; a major port
run by an autonomous public agency (PAC) at Cotonou and a cargo handling
and stevedoring organization (OBENAP); a 430 km railvay, operated by an
autonomous agency jointly owned by the Governments of Benin and Niger
(OCBN); and an international airport at Cotonou. All of these svstem
components vith the exception of the international airport suffer, to
varying degrees, from inadequate maintenance.  The country also has an
airline company (Air Benin), nov under liquidation, and a shipping company
(COBENAM), financially weak and operating on a very small scale. Years of
extensive and tight Governaent controls over the transport sector have re-
sulted in low productivity and quality of service. As a result, a groving
number of international shippers have abandoned the Benin transit corridor
in favor of more efficient routes in other countries, and the Government
has been forced to reconsider its strategy in the sector.  It has nov em-
barked on a slow deregulation and liberalization process which to date has
gone the farthest in port-related activities.
3.        In the road subsector, the Government strategy aims at completing
paved links to the neighboring coastal countries (east-west), and land-
locked countries (north-south), rebabilitating and maintaining the network
properly, providing adequate funding and strengthening subsector institu-
tions. This strategy is generally rational, and it would nov be desirable
for the Governuent to de-emphasize recent efforts to pave new roads which
are at best marginally economical, to further shift its resources to main-
tenance, while relaxing its tight controls and regulations on private sec-
tor participation in transportation.  Concerning the railvays, the strategy
focuses on avoiding excess capacity by limiting investuents to those geared
to maintaining acceptable levels of service. Gradually, IDA's continued
dialogue vith the Governuent has contributed to gains towards these objec-
tives, a purpose which vould be further advanced under this project.



-2-
4.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the Project vould be
to assist the Government in rehabilitating and maintaining the country's
priority transport infrastructure (mainly ir port and highbays), and to
support policy reforms to accelerate the deregulation and liberalization in
the sector. The Project also aims at strengthening sector institutions,
improving road maintenance, limiting new road construction to econouLically
justified sections, and improving cost recovery and maintenance funding.
5.        Project Description.  The Project would include high priority
rehabilitation and maintenance programs for ports and highvays over the
period  1987-92 as vell as a program of institutional development and
strengthening, and is in conformity vith the sectoral policy dialogue vith
the Government. The Credit would finance civil works, equipment, technical
assistance and consulting services for PAC and the highway subsector.
6.        Project Cost.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at
US$ 70.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$ 50.9 million (72%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement,
as well as the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Benin are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps shoving proj-
ect locations are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6000-BEN.
dated April 30, 1987 is being distributed separately.
7.        Rationale for IDA involvement.  The proposed project would help
the Government to set up a coherent strategy for the transport sector and
to implement a development plan including a realistic package of policy
based measures, institutional development, and sector investments and main-
tenance based on agreed priorities and objectives. It would build on the
results already achieved with IDA assistance under four highvay and three
particularly successful feeder roads projects, and the Cotonou port pro-
ject.  Considerable progress has been made during project preparation on
strengthening weak sector institutions, correcting deficient cost recovery
and formulating adequate policy reforms. The main achievements have been
the opening up of freight forwarding activities to the private sector which
will enhance the competitive position of the Benin route to the landlocked
countries, the setting up of a Road Management Unit, the establishment of a
new organization for road maintenance execution, and the commitment to
adopt fiscal measures to raise the insufficient existing Road Fund reve-
nues.
8.        Agreed actions.  During negotiations agreements vere reached on
detailed action plans for sector institutions with the provision, inter
alia, that the Government shall seek annual Association agreement on its
proposed annual expenditure and investment plans for the entire transport
sector. The Government also confirmed its commitment to actions that vould
lead to adequate budgeting of road maintenance and efficient pricing of
port services.   It  further agreed to take all measures necessary  to
restructure the road user taxes in order to ensure adequate financing to
properly maintain and rehabilitate the country's road network.  The fol-
lowing conditions of credit effectiveness have been agreed during negoti-
ations: (a) the signing of the on-lending arrangement with PAC; (b) the



-3-
opening of a project account in a commercial bank and an initial deposit of
CFAF 50 million therein; (c) the increase by 10% of PAC's ship dues and
demurrage fees and by 5Z of other charges, except for dues levied on goods,
from their July 1, 1985 level; and (d) the fulfillment of conditions of
effectiveness of the co-financing agreements of the BOAD lo3n, EDF grant
and IDB loan.
9.        Justification and Benefits.  The principal benefits expected from
the project would be the protection of previous investment in the sector,
*         reduced transport costs and increased efficiency of transport sector insti-
tutions. The port rehabilitation component which yields an average ERR of
27% would make future high reconstruction costs unnecessary. The implemen-
tation of the road maintenance component, for which the average ERR is 43%
for gravel roads rehabilitation and 68% for paved roads resurfacing, would
reduce vehicle operating costs by 20% to 40Z and vould improve road safety.
Improvement in the efficiency of transport institutions should help to keep
up the competitiveness of the Benin route to landlocked countries and help
the Beninese economy to continue to derive the benefits of transit opera-
tions which othervise would accrue to other countries.
10.       Risks.  No physical risks or adverse ecological effects are ex-
pected from the project. The main project risks are the pressures to over-
invest in the sector, the social constraints to removing the redundant la-
bor force in road maintenance as well as in the port subsector, and the
possible misallocation of road maintenance funds. These risks will be min-
imized through the proposed conditionality and the action plan for road
maintenance.
11.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.
