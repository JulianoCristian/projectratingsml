sustainability is rated as likely, and\n            institutional development impacts as modest, given an\n            unsatisfactory Bank performance, though satisfactory\n            Borrower performance. It is stated that in spite of scope\n            reductions in the first (awareness raising) component, the\n            project made important contributions to improve the policy\n            environment for reproductive health activities. The project\n            experience reinforces a number of long-standing lessons.\n            These include: avoiding over-commitments for\n            \"hardware\" and infrastructure activities at the\n            expense of critical \"software\" investments in\n            training, behavior change, and institutional development;\n            the importance of establishing a monitoring and evaluation\n            system prior to project launch, including arrangements for\n            collecting, and analyzing data; the importance of setting\n            realistic targets for development outcomes; and, ensuring\n            that scope of planned, and timetable for project activities\n            are consistent with borrower implementation capacity. Other\n            lessons suggest that: improving demand for, and quality of\n            reproductive health services require sustained, long-term\n            efforts; in selecting lending instruments, consideration\n            should be given to the specific sector objectives, and the\n            overall institutional environment of the sector; the Bank,\n            government and partners may wish to consider whether\n            continuing the nongovernmental organization's financing\n            mechanisms - FAP (Fonds d'Appui a la Population) -\n            would permit consolidation, and deepening of NGO activities,\n            beyond the immediate realm of HIV/AIDS; and, access to, and\n            quality of emergency obstetrical services should be improved."}, "docdt": "2004-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
