phase of the Government's Program\n            on population and health issues, covering approximately 75\n            percent of the population, including 2 million adolescents\n            and young adults, and 1.8 million women of reproductive\n            ages, in addition to 1 million children under the age of\n            five. The project seeks to provide support in the\n            improvement of the population well being through the\n            prevention of risks related to reproductive health, the\n            reduction of illnesses among vulnerable groups, and\n            ultimately, the reduction in infant, child, and maternal\n            mortality rates. The major components of the project are as\n            follows: a) Promotion of safer reproductive health behavior,\n            by initiating an awareness of population issues, such as\n            slower population growth; b) Implementation of an improved\n            quality of and access to services in order to increase\n            utilization of priority reproductive and child health\n            programs; and c) Setting institutional capacity to improve\n            management and coordination of such population and\n            reproductive health programs."}, "docdt": "1998-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
