INDUSTRIL AND AGRICULTURAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 1571-ES)
PREACE
1.       This project completion report for the Industrial and Agricultural
Training Project In tl Salvador (Loan 1571-KS), carried out with the help
of a US$9 million Bank loan  at  a total astimated cost of US$12.7 million,
compares the project objectives stated at appraisal with actual achieve-
ments. It also presents an analysis of the project, including successes a*
well as drawbacks In implementation.    The  Board approved the loan on May
18, 1978. The loan was signed on June 23, 1978 and became effective on
October 27, 1978. The original closing date was set for December 31, 1981
but after two extensions was finally sot for June 30, 1985. The final
disbursement of the loan took place on February 25, 1986.
2.       The completion  report wvs prepared  by  the  Latin American and
Caribbean Regional Office following a mission to E1 Salvador between
October 6 and 10, 1986.1 Preparation of the report was based on:
(a) A draft project completion report prepared by the Project Sub-Unit
(SUP) on the agricultural training "spects of the project; and an
incomplete draft project completion report prepared by the Project
Unit (UP) on the industrial training aspects of the project, in-
cluding the Productivity Center. Both draft reports are available
in LAC Files.
(b) Bank files, including the Board Resolution (May 18, 1978) and
transcript of proceedingss the Loan Agreement; the Appraisal
Report (No.1339a-ES dated April 21, 1978); the working papers
prepared for the project, and the supervision and progress
reoorts; and
(c) the finditgs of the mission.
3.       In relation to point (c) above, the mission's task was subject to
the following constraints:
(a) an earthquake hit El Salvador on October 10, 1986, while the
mission was in the field.    This  prevented the mission from com-
pleting its task and gathering all the necessary information;
1/ The mission comprised Messrs. T. Ramos Saco (Agricultural Educator),
R. Hemingway (Technical Educator) and R. Etheredge (Architect), all
consultants.



- ii -
(b) the SUP in charge of the agricultural training part of the project
was dissolved prematurely, and its key *x-staff were unavailable
to provide full *asistace to the mission; and
(c) * new director of CENCAP, appointed shortly before the mission's
arrival, wvs unable to provide first-hand information on project
implementation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies  for  comments  in October 1987. No co-nents
were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EL SALVADOR
INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 1571-ES)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project was identified, prepared and appraised by two Bank
missions in February and June 1976.  This extremely tight upstream schedule
could, however, not  be  maintained:    four post-appraisal missions became
necessary and it was not before May 1978 that the project was presented to
the Board. Implementation lasted seven years (rather than four as expected
at appraisal), requiring two closing date extensions of first two years and
then one year.  The loan of  US$9 million equivalent was fully disbursed on
February 12, 1986.
Project Oblectives and Content
The project aimed at enhancing the productivity and incomes of
farmers and agricultural  workers  and  of  industrial  workers and foremen
through the creation of a network of nonformal training centers. More
specifically, the project was to provide eight rural training centers,
three industrial training centers, one ir.service training center and one
productivity center; ten mobile training units; and related adm'nistrative
facilities. This physical investment program was to be supplemented by a
survey of vocational training needs and technical assistance (PCR, para.
1.5). The Bank loan of US$9 million was to cover 71Z of the anticipated
total cost of US$12.7 million, and Government funds the remainder.
Implementation Experience
Project implementation was seriously affected by protracted civil
unrest which in 1981 led  to  a  half-year suspension of loan disbursements
(PCR, paras. 2.4 and 2.21) and which, together with rapid inflation and
severe budget constraints, brought about a significant reduction in project
scope: training centers in the most troubled areas had to be excluded from
the investment program (two out of eight rural training centers, two out of
three indust4ial training centers, and five out of ten mobile training
units (PCR, para. 1.6, Table 2 and Annex VI). Conditions in the country
also prevented a regular program of supervision missions to be carried out:
during the seven-year implementation a total of only seven supervision
missions could be fielded and during a period of almost two-and-a-half
years (December 1979 to  June  1982),  no  mission  at all could take place
(PCR, Basic Data and para. 2.20).    In addition, coverage by specialty was
very uneven:  while an  architect  participated  in  every one of the seven



_ viii -
supervision missions and a vocational training specialist in four of them,
only one agricultur&l educator ever supervised the most widespread project
component--clearly an unsatisfactory situation (PCR, para. 2.20).
Apart from civil unrest,  delays  du   to unfamiliarity of project
staff with Bank procedures, initial difficulties in setting up the proj-
sct's organizational framework, and inter-ministerial rivalries interfered
with project implementation.   The  last  problem  was deemed of sufficient
severity by the authors of the PCR to be singled out for closer scrutiny
(PCR, para. 2.6).
Because of the reductions in the scope of the project, total
project cost exceeded estimated costs only slightly (US$13.5 million vs.
US$12.7 mlllion). This reduced the loan-financed portion f the project
from about 71 to 671. In terms of unit cost, however, ov. .:uns were con-
siderables construction costs per training place, for example, amounted to
an average of US$7,704 equivalent, compared to an appraisal estimate of
US$4,364, a difference of more than 76Z (Annex XI).
Results
The PCR mission judged the design of the six agricultural training
centers adequate whereas the in-service training centers appeared slightly
overdesigned. By contrast, the one remaining vocational training center
(in San Salvador) has been constructed on an unsuitable site, with result-
Ing crowded conditions and unsatisfactory lighting and ventilation. The
training and administrative facilities for the national productivity center
constructed on the same site were not yet being used by the intended bene-
ficiaries at the time of the PCR mission because of transportation problems
(PCR, paras. 2.12-2.13).
With the exception of the dormitories (which are being occupied at
301 above nominal capacity), the rural training center facilities are
judged sufficient (PCR, para.  4.2).    However,  they  are used much less
intensively than was anticipated at appraisal (on average only 27 weeks per
year vs. 40). In addition, changes in program content have led to a very
low utilization of workshop facilities and equipment (PCR, para. 4.2 and
Annex XII, paras. 20-22).
For the industrial training center, utilization is even less
satisfactory (132) and appeared to be still deteriorating at the time of
the PCR mission; the mobile training units have never been used as ljanned.
The reason seems to be mainly in insufficient funding--Government budgets
are inadequate and the modern industrial sector appears to oppose financial
contributions through a wage levy (PCR, para. 4.5). In addition, it seems
that unsettled political and economic conditions in the past have created
economic and social problems of such dimensions as to overwhelm concerns
with marpower qualifications and industrial productivity.
In response to this situation, the Government has shifted the
focus of training from industrial skill acquisition to basic training to
help the poorest members of the community gain a livelihood. Upgrading of
industrial workers is still being carried out as a subsidiary activity,



-ix -
with the intake being arranged through contacts with enterprises and dimen-
sioned in line with budgetary resources (PCR, para. 4.6).
Sustainabilitv
The question of the longer-term prospects of the project institu-
tions hinges on future political developments  in the country.  At the time
of the completion  mission,  the  outlook was  not  very encouraging:  the
uncertain political situation severely affected the Government's budgetary
situation and  hence,  its  ability  to  finance  the  network  of training
centers.  Fortunately, the design of  the facilities was such as to require
only minimal maintenance (PCR,  para.  4.1).    However, even this level of
funding was not attained (PCR, paras. 2.14 and 2.19).
Insufficient allocation of funds for  the operation of the project
institutions is seen  as  a more  serious  shortcoming:   in 1985 training
courses at the National Productivity Center  reached only 302 of the levels
anticipated (PCR, para. 4.9). The very low utilization coefficient for the
vocational training center has already  been  discussed in an earlier para-
graph.  Th- rural  training  centers  are  better  off  in this respect, as
witnessed by the large number of trainees (more than double the appraisal
target in 1985) (PCR, para.  4.12).   Financial constraints are being miti-
gated by USAID  assistance  (PCR,  para.  5.3).    However,  the changes in
project content have led both to a shortening of courses and to the hiring
of additional instructors (PCR, paras.  4.13  and 4.15), both with negative
implications for internal efficiency.
,        ,~~FindinRts
It is ditficult to derive  generally applicable conclusions from a
project whose implementation and  operation  has  been  affected so much by
political and economic anomalies.   Given the difficulties encountered, the
achievements of  the  project,  particularly  of  the agricultural training
component, are creditable.  For  the  years ahead, adequate funding for the
operation and maintenance of project facilities would appear to be the most
important prerequisite- for the consolidation of the project's achievements.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EL SALVADOR
INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 1571-ES)
I. PROJECT GENERATION
Socio-Economic Development and Human Resources
1.1      The  main  problem  facing   the  Government  during  the  project
generation period (1976-78) was a high unemployment rate, resulting from
insufficient economic growth and a high population growth rate. Despite
the moderate growth of the modern sector, its employment opportunities were
insufficient to absorb the excess labor from the large agricultural sector.
The serious rural unemployment situation was attributed in part to the
structure of agricultural production, which in turn was partly due to the
concentration  of  land  ownership.       The  thrust  of  the  Government's
development strategy (1978-1982) was to change the structure of production
in the agricultural sector (which accounted for about half of all
employment) in the medium term,   and diversify the economy (mainly through
industrial development) in the long term.
1.2      Implementation of  the  Government's  development  strategy showed
that the most acute shortage was expected among skilled and semi-skilled
agricultural workers and farmers, and skilled and semi-skilled industrial
workers. At that stage, the first priority for human resources development
was to organize systematic, non-formal training programs to supplement the
formal eduoation system. It appeared that the formal system would not be
able to meet the requirements for newly trained manpower, let alone the
need  to  substantially   upgrade   existing   workers   to  enhance  their
productivity and mobility.   The  implications  for human resource policies
were  to:      (a)   reinforce   rural   extension  and  training  services;
(b) strengthen industrial training at the skilled and semi-skilled level;
and (c) extend management training to small-scale entrepreneurs and middle-
level supervisors in industry.
1.3      When the Project was appraised,  the following key training issues
and problems were identified:
(a) For agricultural training:
(i)   lack of organized inservice training programs;
(ii)   a tenuous linkage  between  agricultural  training and the
rural development process;



-2-
(iii)   little  emphasis  given  to  the  training  of small-scale
formers, agricultural workers *nd rural women; and
(iv)   lack of a systematic evaluation of programs and trainees.
(b) For industrial training:
(i)   the lack of training relevant to industrial priorities due
to the emphasis on programs for out-of-school youth;
(ii)   the lack of a national training system that allows for the
participation of employers and worker representatives in
the msnagement of  training;  the  poor coordination mong
the   agencien    providing    training;   low   financial
contribution toward training costs by employers; and
inadequate planring of training activities;
(iii)   lack  of  an  adequate  training  budget  provided  by the
Ministry of Labor;
(iv)   absence of relevant curriculum and teaching materials; and
lack of a national standards, testing and certification
system;
(v)   lack of adequately-trained  staff  and  instructors at the
Ministry of Labor; and
(vi)   inadequate supply of trained workers.
Prolect Conception and Justification
1.4      The lack of a  non-formal  training  system that would address the
inservice training needs  of  agricultural  services staff and agricultural
workers  was  a  constraint  to  implementing  a  technolog/  transfer  and
improving the quality of agricultural services, particularly to small- and
medium-size farm holders. On the industrial side, the establishment of a
self-financing training authority was expected to resolve the main issues
facing that sector: lack of financing, lack of coordination with the
industrial sector as well as  other  training agencies, and the low quality
and relevance of training.   In  this  respect, the project had two general
objectives: (a) to establish a nationwide infrastructure of non-formal
agricultural and industrial training; and (b) increase the productivity and
income of small- and medium-size farmers, agricultural workers, skilled and
semi-skilled industrial workers and their supervisors.

Proiect Amendments
1.6      On August 25, 1982, due  to  the shortage of counterpart funds and
the  location    of  some  of   the  project  centers  in  areas  of  civil
disobedience, two rural training centers located at La Union and Sta. Rosa
de Lima (items in a.(i) above) and two industr'al training centers (item b.
(ii) and (iii)) were cancelled. In other modifications of the project that
took place on May 29, 1984, five mobile units (item (iv)) were cancelled,
the classroom facilities of the Agricultural In-service Training Center
(item a.(ii) above) were expanded from a capacity of 40 to 80 students, and
the technical assistance program was increased by 103 man-months. Three
experts were dropped from the program.   No increase in Bank allocation was
made in either case, but there was a re-allocation by categories.

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implemntation Overview
2.1      Project implementation, envisaged  at  Appraisal  to be four years
(1978-1982), actu-lly lasted  about  seven  years  (1978-1985).   Delays in
implementation resulted from:    frequent  changes  in top-level government
positions, delays in selection and acquisition of construction sites,
shortages of counterpart funding, and  general  civil unrest in most of the
country.
2.2      During  Appraisal,  site  acquisition  was   not  felt  to  be  a
constraint.  No problems were encountered in obtaining sites for the CCRs.
Selection and  acquisition  of  most  Vocational  Training Component sites,
including re-zoning of the CFP site  in San Salvador, took 18 months longer
than originally envisaged. This delayed construction until the fourth year
of the project, and increased the cost of the civil works component by over
one-half.
2.3      Delay in  project  commencement  due  to  unfamiliarity  with Bank
procedures, delays in organization and continuing inflation caused an
increase in project costs, which could not be absorbed even by increased
counterpart funding.    Thus  a  reduction  in  overall  project  scope was
mutually agreed to by the Bank and the Government (para. 3 of Highlights).
2.4      The Bank discontinued  disbursements  for  the  period January 31-
June 27,  1981  due  to  civil   disturbances  which  prevented  safe  Bank
supervision of the project.   Further  financial constraints were placed on
the project when the Government froze project funds from February 1982
until nearly July 1982.   As  a  result,  the construction contract for CFP
facilities was not signed until October 1982, almost one year after bids
had been received and evaluated, and costs had to be readjusted. The CFP
construction  was  satisfactorily  completed   and  became  operational  in
December 1984, three years later than anticipated.
2.5      In spite of financial difficulties,  construction of five CCRs was
started in January 1981 and completed that same year. These CCRs became
operational in January 1982.    The  remainder  of the facilities under the
Agricultural Training Component were completed by June 1983.
Proiect Management Organization
2.6      Although the appraisal  envisaged  the  establishment  of a single
Project Unit (UP) assisted by a sub-unit for the agricultural component
(SUP), a satisfactory working relationship could not be developed between
implementation units in separate ministries because of inter-ministry
rivalries. As a result, two independent implementation units were formed
almost from the beginning, both units reporting directly to the Bank with
little, if any, coordination  between  the  two.    This  issue needs to be
addressed more carefully in future projects.



-5-
2.7      Staffing of  the  two  project  units  was  similar.    Each had a
Director, either an architect or engineer to direct the construction, and a
person in charge  of  procuring  furniture  and  equipment.   Support staff
included  secretaries  and  accounting   personnel.       The  continuity  of
implementation management was an important factor contributing to the
overall success of the project.   With  the  exception of one change in the
SUP Director slot, no changes were made in the leadership of the
implementation units during the life of the project.
2.8      The services of a  physical  planning  specialist to asoist the UP
were envisaged during appraisal,  but  records  do  not indicate that these
services were actually provided (with the exception of technical assistance
through the ILO in preparing equipment lists).
2.9      Monthly reports sent to  the  Bank  by  the UP/SUP would have been
more useful had they contained more detailed quantitative information
regarding contracts. Also, cost overruns and additions were not clearly
explained and justified in these reports.
2.10     Most UP staff continued to work  in the CFP component during this
mission. They were knowledgeable about the project and project files were
readily available to the  mission.    The  SUP  staff  now work for outside
entities and project  files  were  not  easily  accessible.    This made it
difficult for the mission to obtain information on the agricultural
training component while in El Salvador.
Physical Implementation
2411     Project  scope  was  reduced  to  compensate  for  the  effects of
inflation and cost overruns. The CCRs at Santa Rosa de Lima and La Union
and the CFPs at Santa Ana and San Miguel were deleted from the project (see
Table 2).

2.12     For the  vocational  training  component,  the  Ministry  of Labor
constructed and equipped facilities for manpower training and development
at San Salvador. On the same site, the Ministry of Economy constructed
offices and classrooms to be  used  by  CEWP.   However, these offices and
classrooms have never been occupied  by  CENAP because of the difficulty in
arranging transportation for participants.
2.13     The building design for  the  CCRs was adequate, while design for
the CCE located in San Andres could have been simpler and less costly. The
offices and shops at the CFP In San Salvador have been constructed on a
crowded site and natural light and ventilation in the instructional area is
inadequate.  The site limits future expansion of the teaching areas. These
inadequacies show serious design and construction deficiencies, which
should have been corrected during construction (see Annex XIII). Generally
speaking, construction of all CCR facilities was satisfactory.
2.14     Inventories of furniture  and  equipment  are not being adequately
kept by the agencies involved and some of the CCR vehicles have been
transferred to the Agricultural Regional Offices. Virtually no maintenance
is being performed on the CCRs physical facilities; only minor maintenance
of facilities and furnishing is being carried out at CFP facilities.



-7-
Specialist Services and Fellowships
2.15     A total  of  322  man-months  of  experts  and  261  man-months of
fellowships were provided.   This  is  in  excess  of the amount planned at
appraisal (Table 3).    During  implementation,  the  experts in standards,
tests and certification of employment services were canceled and the funds
redistributed to the other experts in the industrial component. The
specialist in physical planning was never contracted.

2.16     The technical assistance implemented by  the  ILO lost part of its
effectiveness  because  of  its   early   scheduling  in  relation  to  the
construction program. Better coordination would have increased the impact
and  ensured  better  retention  of   the  Salvadoran  counterparts.    The
assistance delivered by Tahal Consulting Engineers was considered effective
and was extended by 15 months in 1985.
2.17     The expert services  for  the  agricultural training component was
implemented by FAO under contract with UNDP, as part of a larger and
broader FAO assistance to the Government of El Salvador (see Annex III).
This arrangement made it difficult to identify and clearly separate Bank-
financed assistance from the services of the overall FAO program. In the
areas of marketing, agro-industries and evaluation, assistance provided was
different from what was set out in the terms of reference (contained in the
Bank working  documents).    Despite  some  discrepancies  in  the training
approach between FAO and CENCAP which occurred during the last year of
FAO's assistance, the Borrower considered FAO's program adequate and
helpful. An early clarification and redirection of the assistance approach
provided in certain areas, such as evaluation of outputs from the training
program, would  have  been  helpful.    The  benefits  received by national
counterparts from inservice training were an important contribution of the
assistance program.



2.18     The 70  man-months  shown  at  appraisal  for  the  FAO fellowship
program were surpassed with a total of 95 man-months, at nearly 60 percent
of the  appraisal  co3t  estimate.    The  fellowships  abroad  program was
complicated by constant changes in authorities and cumbersome procedures.
Therefore, the nuzrber of staff sent abroad was greatly reduced and the
number of local fellowships was increased.  Students were not able to study
in all the originally  planned  areas  of  study  because  of the change in
government agricultural policy. This also reflected in CENCAP's program.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
2.19     The Borrower complied  with  the  majority  of Loan Covenants (see
Annex IV), with the exception of: (a) the National Vocational Training
Centre to ensure coordination of project execution, because of the creation
of two Project Units; (b) the establishment of an effective monitoring and
evaluation system by CENCAP; (c) an annual CENAP evaluation of training
programs; (d) the establishment of a vocational training standards, testing
and certification system; (e) opening the facilities of the Vocational
Training Center to the productivity center staff and vice versa (since
CENAP  project  administration  and   training  activities  have  not  been
transferred to the project center); and (f) the adequate maintenance of
agricultural training institution buildings (for which no specific budget
has been allocated).    A  maintenance  budget  has  been allocated for the
industrial center, but maintenance is still inadequate.
Bank Performance
2.20     Bank supervision missions were not  carried out on a regular basis
due to civil unrest and the resulting lack of adequate security. More than
930 days elapsed between the third (12/10/79) and fourth (6/30/82)
supervision missions, at a time when implementation was affected by major
financial and political problems.    It  is  felt that during such critical
times some form of indirect supervision ought to be devised, such as
calling UP personnel to Headquarters or supervising through the UNDP
office. Moreover, during the entire implementation period there was only
one mission by an agricultural specialist and four by an industrial
training specialist. This is clearly inadequate.
2.21     Due  to  delayed  implementation   and  the  inability  to  safely
supervise the projects, disbursements were suspended by the Bank for about
five months beginning on January 31, 1981. This suspension was ineffective
because even after disbursements were reinstated, Bank missions wer-e unable
to safely supervise sites outside San Salvador and project implementation
did not accelerate.

III.  PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Proiect Costs
3.1      Even after a reduction In scope, the overall project cost (US$13.5
million) exceeded the appraisal estimate (US$12.7 million) by 6.3 percent,
or about US$0.8 million. More than 66 percent of this overrun occurred in
civil works and site development (see Annexes V and VI). Principal factors
which caused cost increases over appraisal estimates were: (a) higher than
anticipated inflation; (b) underestimates of unit construction and site
development costs; (c) unforeseen site difficulties; and (d) implementation
delays.
3.2      Table 4 below compares  the  expected  price increases used during
appraiaal with the actual consumer price increaser as listed in the
International Financial Statistics Yearbook.

3.4      There was an  apparent  *rror  in  the   praisal construction cost
estimates for the  vocational  training  componen.  (excluding the Manpower
Department) in San Salvador: the coat estimate per square meter for this
component was even less than that for the CCRs. Even discounting the fact
that the site development cost for the San Salvador CFP construction was
exorbitant (totaling about 37 percent of the total initial bid price), a
more realistic appraisal estimate of construction cost for the CFP should
have been around US$350 to US$375 (rather than US$268) per square meter --
a difference per square meter of about 35 percent (see Annex VII).
3.5      Since actual sites  were  not  clearly  identified  at the time of
appraisal, a physical contingency allowance higher than 10 percent should
have been included In the appraisal cost estimate for site development.
Future projects should ensure site selection by the time of appraisal, and
develop more reliable cost estimates.
Financing and Disbursement
3.6      Financing from the loan  (US$9.0 million) covered 66.7 percent of
the total project costs (US$13.5 million).    The remainder of the project
was financed from government funds.    (See Annex  VIII for a breakdown of
project financing and Annex IX for disbursement schedule.) The loan was
fully disbursed, with the final disbursement made on February 12, 1986,
four years later than anticipated.   A disbursement profile may be found in
Annex X, showing a comparison between the appraisal, disbursement schedule,
the actual schedule, and a compiled schedule for 11 'typical" projects in
the education sector of the Latin American Region of the Bank.
Unit Capital Costs and Space Allocation
3.7      The ratio  of  actual  CCR  construction  cost  per training place
varies from 21 to 35 percent higher than had been estimated at appraisal,
primarily due to inflation.    For  the  CFP  however,  this figure is much
higher -- 138 percent.    The  cost  overrun  for  this com.onent is due to
inflation, errors in estimated cost at time of appraisal, and excessive
cost overruns  in  site  development.    The  ratio  of  square footage per
training place actually constructed to that estimated at appraisal is very
favorable (see Annex XI for details.)
IV. OPERATIONAL OUTCOMES OF THE PROJECT
Physical Facilities
4.1      Physical facilities for the  CCRs  have been modestly designed and
constructed using local materials.    A  25-  to  30-  year useful life may
easily be expected from these facilities, with only minor maintenance. A
minimum amount of equipment and furniture has been purchased, and this will
need to  be  replaced  and  added  to  periodically.    These buildings are
functionally acceptable for training and may also serve as community
centers for periodic public activities.



4.2      With the exception of dormitories, most faOlities at the CCEs are
adequate.  Dormitories are presently being overutilized:  space constructed
for 40 in-service trainees Is being utilized by 52 students. Toilet
facilities in the dormitory are Inadequate  even for the original number of
people.
4.3      Trainees have not  been  allowed  to  use  the agricultural school
dining facilities as was envisaged during appraisal, due to a disagreement
between the ENA and CENCAP. As a result, food is being prepared and served
from the patio of the dormitoriest trainees are being housed and fed under
unsanitary conditions at present.
4.4      Facilities  for  the   CFP   are   adequate   and  generally  well
constructed, although land for expansion is limited. Structural provision
has been made for adding floors to the administration and classrooms
buildings. If CENAP does not occupy the space originally designed for
them, this space may be occupied by the Manpower Department and new space
may not be needed.
Educational and Institutional Outcomes
A. Industrial Training Component
4.5      Despite extensive technical assistance, the efforts to reshape tLe
industrial training system through the establishment of an autonomous
training agency which would raise funds through a levy on wages did not
materialize (because of the resistance of the modern industrial sector).
This, combined with the fact that training continues to be inadequately
financed by the Government, has resulted in a 13 percent utilization rate
of project facilities -- clearly much lower than expected. The Vocational
Training Center at San Salyadorl has only met 17 percent of the appraisal
target output and, in fact, utilization in 1985 fell to about one-third the
level of 1984 (see Table 1 of Annex XII). In an attempt -o alleviate the
situation, the center management has arranged contracts with an agency of
the European Economic Community (Cs. 400,000 per year) to finance a project
on the creation of training and the development of micro-businesses for the
displaced and marginal population. The in-plant training initiated in 1981
has had quite modest results and needs to be thoroughly reorganized. The
mobile units have never been used as originally planned.
4.6      During  the  project,  emphasis  at  the  General  Directorate  of
Vocational Training and Employment (DGFPE) shifted from providing services
for the industrial sector to assisting the poorest members of the
population to obtain employment. Target groups included unemployed out-of-
school youths, displaced persons and the physically handicapped. Although
employed workers are still trained, they have unfortunately been relegated
to a second priority.   In  preparing  the  Annual Training Plan, the DGFPE
1/ The other two centers were deleted from the project.



- 12 _
accessos tho training demand through contacts with employers and then
adjusts the amount of training to the available government resources*
About 90 percent of the graduates are placed in jobs through the DGFPE.
4.7      An instructor unit was satisfactorily  established at the DGFPE in
1981. But utilization of instructors is low and turnover is high (about 50
percent) due to the  low  salary  levels.    A training curriculum has been
developed satisfactorily on the basis of occupational analysis, and
teaching materials are produced by  the  instructors.   But the courses are
not modularized as envisaged at appraisal, and national standards have not
been established nor have trade tests either. The average recurrent cost
per trainee hour, equivalent to US$0.60, is low compared to other countries
in the region (US$1.5 to US$8.0).
4.8      The management of the  San  Salvador Vocational Training Center is
making efforts to resolve their financial problems through training
contracts. Formalizing and strengthening the training contract technique
might be an appropriate solution to the funding of operating costs.
However, such a Valicy would require a greater emphasis on the training of
employed wozke-s io the modern sector.   The present in-plant training unit
would be expeaded into a training department, organized by the industry
subsector and --.fed by training officers, some of whom would be recruited
from the relevant industry. The training department would maintain a close
relationship with the industry  subsector,  help to identify training needs
of  individual  companies,  and   group  companies  together  for  training
purposes.  The training  contracts  negotiated  between  the center and the
companies would specify the training to  be  provided by the center and the
share of the training cost to be paid by the companies.  The system has the
advantage of flexibility:  only  those  companies  that want training would
participate in the program.  In  addition to being effective and efficient,
the CFP should be instrumental in eatablishing a national trade standards
testing and certification system, and an evaluation and ex-trainee follow-
up system.
B. The National Productivity Center Component (CENAP)
4.9      Management courses  for middle-level  supervisors and small-scale
entrepreneurs were implemented at CENAP, as envisaged at appraisal. Courses
are mostly given in the evening.   However, CENAP is still operating in the
old buildings in downtown San Salvador and the transfer to the new project
building (at the site of the Vocational Training Center) was delayed
because cf transportation difficulties faced by course participants. It is
hoped, however, that the move will take place shortly. The output has
fallen since 1983-84, and in 1985 met only 30 percent of the 1982 appraisal
target because of low allocation of funds by the Government. Shortage of
Government funding still remains a problem. (Output figures are shown in
Table 2 of Annex XII.)

C. Aaricultural Training Component
4.10     With technical assistance  financed  by  the project, the Borrower
was able to meet a major objective of the project component by establishing
and developing CENCAP, a centralized institution responsible for the
coordination and execution of non-formal agricultural training, normative
functions and  follow-up  and  evaluation  of  ex-trainees.   This national
Agricultural Training Center would focus its activtties on training medium-
and small-size farmers and agricultural workers (in an attempt to improve
farming and agricultural  technology).    The  center  would also train the
necessary staff.
4.11     Two new Government policies, enacted after CENCAP was created, had
important  implications  for  the  CENCAP  role  outlined  above.    First,
enactment of the Agrarian Reform Laws in 1980 resulted in: increased
training demands; a shift of training priorities from technology and
technologically-oriented   areas   to   socially-oriented   areas   (social
organization,   cooperatives,   farm    planning,   farm   management   and
bookkeeping); and a switch in priority from internal (boarding) training
(at the  CCRs)  to  external  training  (outside  the  CCRs).   Second, the
administrative regionalization of the Ministry of Agriculture and the
granting  of  autonomy   to   the   regional   offices  had  the  following
implications:    CENCAP's  prerogative   as   a  national  institution  for
agricultural  training   was   weakened   as   the   regions   took  direct
responsibilities for regional training programs; CENCAP's coordination role
for agricultural training was weakened; and CENCAP's normative function,
not clearly defined from the beginning, was never properly clarified
(regarding its relation with the regions and with other agticultural or
agriculturally-oriented training agencies).    In  addition, CENCAP has not
implemented a program for the follow-up and evaluation of ex-trainees. The
Government, with FAO assistance, is expected to review the organization and
operation of non-formal agricultural training in order to establish an
improved system.   This  follows  an  evaluation  of  the current situation
undertaken with FAO assistance.
4.12     Despite the weaknesses outlined  above, CENCAP should be commended
for the great interest and motivation it created among farmers and staff,
and for the large number of participants it attracted. The annual training
goals established at appraisal -- about 7,200 farmers (1,200 per CCR) and
250 staff at the CCES -- have been surpassed by a wide margin. In 1985 the
actual number of farmers trained was more than double the appraisal target,
and in 1983 and 1984 the actual training figures for staff were 10 times
and four times higher, respectively, than the appraisal target. (Figures
for 1985 were unavailable.)    (See  Annex  I  and  Table  4 of Annex XII.)
Between 1982 and 1985 project facilities contributed to the training of a
total of 39,562 persons, an average of 11,300 persons per year. This
greatly exceeded the annual output target of 7,450 people set at appraisal
(7,200 farmers in six CCRs and 250 staff in one CCES). If non-project CCRs
are included, the  number  of  persons  trained  during  the 1983-85 period



- 14 -
increases to 54,291. A greater emphasis was put on the training of 36 855
farmers who are direct beneficiaries of the Agrarian Reform Decree 153. 
4.13     Internal training consists of boarding courses that last about one
week external training consists of two-day courses off the premises of the
CCRs. The CCES, rather than exclusively training staff as planned at
appraisal, is also offering  farmer  training  courses.   Curriculum of the
socially-oriented courses for farmers and staff are grouped into the major
groups indicated in paragraph 4.11.    They predominate, totalling about 82
percent of the courses (divided between associative business education, 73
percent, and business administration  -    9 percent).  Technology-oriented
courses reached only 13 percent of participants, and other courses
5 percent; although literacy reached a negligible proportion, it is gaining
in importance.
4.14     Although  the   importance   of  communitylenterprise  development
training ought to be recognized in a country such as El Salvador,
technological improvements in farming and agriculture can hardly be
expected unless courses oriented toward that purpose are given a greater
importance. (This importance was recognized at appraisal, which placed a
heavy emphasis on such courses.) Community/enterprise training should have
been incremental rather than in place of technical training. The training
of women in home economics has also not received the importance it deserves
although it has been shown that women are responsible for improving the
family's living conditions. In general, a greater use should be made of
audio-visual aids in the courses; a modular course system should be
considered; methodology should be more non-formal and more practically
oriented; and trainees should be supported after their training through
radio programs.    Existing  radio  program  facilities  at  the  CCES, and
practical workshops at the CCRs are grossly underutilized, and in some
cases barely utilized at all.
4.15     Fifty-six staff members  are  utilized  for  the operations of the
CCRs and the CCES (25 teaching staff and 31 administra..ive staff - see
Annex II) out of a total of 246 CENCAP staff members. (Over two-thirds of
these are paid from USAID-supported projects). In both cases, the staff is
much larger than was anticipated at appraisal. There are two major reasons
for this: the program inciudes project and non-project CCRs, since it is
much larger than anticipated at appraisal; and the switch in emphasis to
socially-oriented courses permitted the hiring of a larger number of
permanent CCR staff than the originally planned short-term technologically-
oriented staff. The reason for the large CENCAP staff does, however, merit
an in-depth study. The assessment should include the proportions of staff
in the Central Office compared to that in the field. The recurrent unit
cost per week of training has been established in 1985 at Cs. 151.25
(US$60.5). This is low compared to the 1978 appraisal estimate3 that
projected 1985 costs at Cs. 390 (see paragraphs 25 and 26 of Annex XII).
2/ As a result of this decree, production cooperatives were established,
consisting of workers from about 250 of the largest farms in the
country.
3/ The unit recurrent cost was estimated at appraisal on the basis of one-
week (five days, eight hours per day) boarding courses.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
A. Conclusions
5.1      Implementation of the project  was initially subject to management
-          problems (impossibility to keep one  single  project unit) and, later on to
unforeseen  events  of political   and  economic  nature,  which  required
government policies  to  be  adjusted  to  the  new  situation.   The civil
disturbances, inflation and shortage of government funds twice compelled
the Government to request a reduction of the scope of the project within
the Bank allocation. Moreover, shortage of operational governmental funds
and the lack of financial support by industry to the planned infrastructure
for industrial training made the establishment of such infrastructure
impossible.   As  a  result,  several  of  the  planned  activities for the
industrial training component failed to be implemented and the appraisal
output target was far from reached (17 percent). Utilization of project
facilities reached very low levels.
5.2      The management of the  San  Salvador Vocational Training Center is
making commendable efforts to resolve the financial problems through
contracts with  companies.    Under  these  contracts  the  companies would
specify the training to be provided by the center and the share of the
training cost to be paid by the companies. Only those companies that are
interested in the program would  participate.    However, a policy of this
nature would require that a greater emphasis be put on the training of
employed workers in the modern sector and an expansion and improvement of
present inplant training.
5.3      In the case  of  the  agricultural training component, legislation
creating a nationwide infrastructure for agricultural non-formal training
(CENCAP) already existed at the time of appraisal, and the project helped
consolidate  it.    The  Government's  shortage  of  operational  funds was
balanced with funds provided by USAID. The output targets .et at appraisal
- were surpassed, and project facilities were fairly well utilized. The
agricultural training component thus succeeded in meeting the first
robjective of the project, establishing a nationwide infrastructure for non-
formal agricultural  training.       However,  new  policies  adopted by the
*Government in response to the prevailing situation had some implications
for the implementation of the  component.   By enacting the Agrarian Reform
,Law, training emphasis switched from technologically-oriented to socially-
oriented courses in agriculture, and thus from boarding courses at the CCRs
I.to external courses outside the CCRs.   Decentralization of the Ministry of
Agriculture, which granted a great deal of autonomy to the regions, appears
to have reduced the nationwide role originally intended for CENCAP in
delivering non-formal agricultural education.



- 16 -
5.4      There  is  still  scope   for  improving  non-formal  agricultural
training in El Salvador and perhaps for its expansion. This would require:
(a) improvements in overall organization and management by carrying
out an analysis of the officiency of CENCAP's training activities.
In general, a better coordination of all training activities would
increase their efficiency and reduce costs;
(b) improvements in the quality and relevance of the training courses
to  agricultural   development,   giving  agricultural  technology
training a higher priority;
(c) a revision of teaching methodology and pedagogical training of
instructors, applying modular system of training, making more use
of audio visual aids and mass-media and establishing a system of
trainee evaluation and follow-up; and
(d) upgrading of the precarious facilities under which the non-project
training is taking place, after having assessed whether the demand
would justify the expansion of this training program, and the
financial feasibility of the expansion.
5.5      The  project-supported  study  on  vocational  training  needs was
carried out at too early a stage to be of significant value.
5.6      It is not possible to  assess  whether the second objective of the
project -- improving the  productivity  and  earnings of sma'l- and medium-
size farmers, agricultural workers, skilled and semi-skilled industrial
workers and their  supervisors  --  was  actually  met.   An evaluation and
follow-up system of former trainees has not been implemented.
B. Lessons
5.7      Following  are  the   lessons   that   can   be   .:;awn  from  the
implementation of this project.  Some  are  important in the case of future
projects in the same subsectors (e.g. management and organization).  Others
have already become a normal standard in new projects (e.g. site selection
and organization).
5.8      Financing. Management and Organization.
(a)  Due  to  the  fact   that  industry's  financial  contribution  to
industrial training programs is considered to be essential for the
implementation of these programs, it is necessary that a full
analysis be carried out at appraisal of the industrial sector, its
institutional characteristics and the feasibility of industry's
financial contribution.   If  relevant  legislation is required to
ensure such contribution, it should be enacted by loan approval.
In addition, a well established action plan should be part of the
project;



- 17 -
(b)  coordination  between   industrial   training   and   industry  is
essential.   Implementation  of  the  industrial  component of the
project would have been more successful had the coordination
between the CFP (San  Salvador)  and  industry  been stronger.  In
this case  it  is  likely  that  some  of  the  actions planned at
appraisal  and  that  failed   to   be  implemented  (para.  5  of
Highlights) would have been put  into  effect.   In any case, such
coordination would facilitate the implementation at the present
CFP's plans for generating funds, based on individual contracts
between CFP and the industry for the training of its workers.
This modality constitutes an alternative to the establishment of
an autonomous training agency as planned at appraisal;
(c) in the case of the agricultural component, CENCAP's initial role
as  the  institute  for   nationwide  coordination  of  non-formal
agricultural training is loosing ground and it should be restored.
This coordinating function is indispensable for better planning of
training and more efficient use of scarce resources;
(d) in projects that include two or more ministries or executing
agencies the choice of an implementation structure may lead to
susceptibilities or antagonisms.   In  El  Salvador this issue was
resolved by having two independent units, a procedure that worked
well. In some cases the establishment of a single project unit
may not be a viable solution, and the issue should be addressed
carefully and in a flexible manner.
5.9      Physical Implementation
(a) Implementation would be accelerated if final architectural plans
and specifications were  completed  at  the  very  latest by Board
presentation.   Preparation  costs  of  these  documents  could be
financed   retroactively.       As    a   result   of   accelerated
implementation, the effects  of  inflation on overall construction
would be reduced.
(b) A careful assessment of the transportation facilities available to
students  should  be  made  when   selecting  the  sites  for  the
construction of training facilities.
(c) Sites should become property of the Borrower as a pre-condition
for negotiations, or Board presentation at the very latest, to
avoid delays (in some cases substantial) in project start up.
(d) Bank supervision missions should be more forceful in inducing the
Borrower  to   adequately   maintain   facilities,  equipment  and
furniture and keeping adequate inventories.



- 18 -
5.10     Technical Assistance
(a) The timing of the technical assistance for the industrial training
component was improper.   Technical assistance should be scheduled
so as to coincide with key events in the implementation cycle.
The  use  of  fewer,   long   term  experts  and  more  short-term
consultants would increase flexibility and impact, and reduce
costs.
(b) In the agricultural component, Bank financed technical assistance
was part of a larger and broader FAO technical assistance program.
The terms of reference of the FAO program were not sufficiently
geared at the needs of the project because they responded to
partially different objectives.    Thus,  when  other agencies are
also providing T.A. for a project under a broader umbrella, a
careful examination of the relevance of this assistance to the
project objectives should be made before any Bank commitment to
include it in the overall project costs.
(c) The fellowships program should start as early as possible,
particularly in countries where the processing of fellowships is a
lengthy and cumbersome bureaucratic procedure.
5.11     Supervision
Supervision by Bank staff should be carried out more regularly,-
and missions should include the appropriate training specialists more often
than was the case in El Salvador. In the case where in situ supervision is
not possible, the Bank should devise alternative solutions, so as not to
leave long gaps in project monitoring.

EL SALVADOR
Industrial and Agricultural Training Proiect
Proiect Completion Report
A NOTE ON THE EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT
A. Industrial Training Component
Organization, Management and Services
1.       The strategy of the project was to reshape the industrial training
system through the establishment of an autonomous training agency which
would raise funds through a levy on wages. Despite extensive technical
assistance and prolonged discussion, the effort failed. This is mainly due
to resistance from the modern industrial sector, which already pays a high
payroll tax and has experienced a sharp decline in its fortunes since 1979.
Thus there is no formal linkage between the industrial training system and
the modern sector, and the DGFPE is isolated from other training agencies.
Furthermore, training continues to be inadequately financed by the
Government.
2.       The DGFPE operates in the administration building constructed with
project assistance, and has been reorganized with the help of project
technical assistance.  Departments for operations, training services,
placement, administration and planning were established with a complement
of 99 employees excluding instructors (84 estimated at appraisal).
(See Chart I ). In 1979, a manpow!'r survey was undertaken .nd the data
used to determine training needs. Unfortunately, the data rapidly became
obsolete because of no follow-up. At present, the Annual Training Plan is
developed through ad hoc contacts with employers to determine demand, and
then adjusting the amount of training to the available budget.
3.       The DGFPE has the responsibility for vocational guidance and job
placement, with about 90 percent of the ex-trainees being placed.
Dressmaking, shoemaking, carpentry and jewelry are trades where the
placement is easiest. The emphasis is on micro-industries in the non-
formal sector: wages are very low but the ex-trainee is offered a start
with further skill-training on-the job. There is no organized follow-up
system for ex-trainees.
Training Programs and Courses
4.       In-plant training was started in 1981 with the help of a
specialist under the technical assistance program. He trained two
counterparts and gave short courses in instructing techniques to 96 foremen
and supervisors from industry at CENAP. Due to low salaries, the
counterparts soon left and were replaced by others who were untrained.
Furthermore, the mobile units have never been used for in-plant training as



- 33 -
ANNEX XII
Page 2 of 8
planned at appraisal.   In 1985, only three employers were assisted, and
training was arranged for 135 secretarial assistants. This service needs
to be thoroughly reorganized.
5.       The Vocational Training Center in San Salvador is open eight hours
a day, on a single shift basis. Of the 17 workshops and one laboratory
constructed, nine are in regular use, five are starting courses in
November, 1986, and four are used for storage. Compared with the
utilization rate planned at appraisul (a 68 percent average with double-
shift operation), the present facilities show only about a 13 percent
utilization rate. Of the eight mobile units purchased, only two are in
use. The inadequate training budget impedes better utilization. In an
attempt to provide more training services, the Center management has
arranged training contracts with an agency of the European Economic
Community (Cs. 400,000 per year), to offer training at the rehabilitation
centers of the armed forces and several private entities. Under the
contracts, the entities undertake to provide censumable materials for
courses and the Center will train displaced persons and others, and promote
the formation of micro-enterprises.
6.       About 80 percent of the equipment has been installed and
inventories are being prepared.  Due to inflation, (all the planned
equipment was not ordered and some additional items will be required,
especially in the machine shop where some of the machines are too large-
scale for basic training. Upkeep of the equipment is satisfactory,
although upkeep of the buildings was not totally satisfactory; adequate
academic records are maintained; and the workshop instruction methodology
is appropriate. Academic inspection is the responsibility of a technical
pedagogical unit consisting of six supervisors.
Instructors
7.       An instructor training unit was satisfactorily established at the
DGFPE in 1981 with the assistance of an expert. Three counterparts have
been trained and sent abroad on fellowships. On return they have joined
the unit. A full instructor training course lasts 460 hours: in-service
courses for existing staff range from 60 to 120 hours. Skill upgrading is
also arranged as needed using the center facilities. Output from the
program is shown below.

8.       The output covers wastage and the needs of some other
institutions, including the Ministry of Education. No charges are made.
There are at present 62 instructors (appraisal estimate 33) working in the
DGFPE, divided between the new training center and the old rented

Page 3 of 8
facilities still in use in downtown San Salvador.  Utilization of
instructors is low, at some 400-500 hours per year. Turnover is high,
about 50 percent, due to low salary levels. Replacements are recruited
from skilled foremen or others possessing the requisite qualifications and
experience. All instructor staff have received some formal technical
education and instructor training, and have industrial experience averaging
10 years.
9.       Candidates for admission to the courses at DGFPE are at least
16 years old, and have successfully passed practical, theoretical and
aptitude tests.
Output
10.      The 1985 output at the Vocational Training Center in San Salvador
has only met about 17 percent of the appraisal target set in 1982 and, in
fact, is down by one third since 1974. See Table 2 below:

Recurrent Costs
11.      The actual DGFPE expenditures in 1985 were about Cs.1.1 million
which, spread across all the courses offered (including overheads) produced
an average cost per trainee-hour of about Cs.3.0 (US$0.60). This is low
compared with other countries in the region (US$1.5 to $8.0). But in order
to keep Government operating costs down, only nine of the 17 workshops are
functioning, and only on a single shift. To maximize the benefits of the
capital investment, utilization of facilities must be improved and
recurrent expenditure on training increased. However, it is doubtful if
the Government can find these extra resources at present.
B. The National Productivity Center Component
12.      The National Productivity Center (CENAP) is still operating in the
old buildings in downtown San Salvador. Transfer to the new building at
the site of the Vocational Training Center was delayed because of



- 35 -
ANNEX XII
Page 4 of 8
transportation difficulties faced by course participants. However, the
move will hopefully take place shortly.
13.      At CENAP, 10 tachnicians (appraisal estimate was 10) were sent on
overseas fellowships under the project to be trained as instructors. On
3their return they were incorporatetd into the team and worked as
counterparts to the experts. Seven are still with CENAP, and the other
three participate occasionally in instruction on a part-time bais.
14.      The Management Courses at CENAP were implemented as planned.
Problem-solving techniques at the trainees' own work place have been
adopted for both modern sector supervisors and micro-entrepreneurs.
Results have been very satisfactory, and numerous training manuals have
been prepared by the technical assistance experts and their counterparts.
CENAP has a technical staff of 42 trainers, seven of which received
fellowships under the project. Courses are mostly given in the evenings.
15.      The 1985 output at CENAP has met only 30 percent of the 1982
appraisal target, and has fallen since 1983-84 because of funding
shortages. The figures are shown in Table 3 below:

C. Atriculture Training Component
OrRanization, Management and Training Approach
16.      The Borrower met a major objective of the component by
establishing and developing a nation-wide 1-frastructure for agricultural
training, represented by the National Training Center for Agriculture
(CENCAP).
.17.      CENCAP was created as a centralized institution of the Ministry of
Agriculture responsible for the coordination and execution of non-formal
agricultural training. It also had normative functions and was responsible



- 36 -
ANNEX XII
Page 5 of 8
for follow-up and evaluation of the training product. Its activities were
expected to focus on the training of small- and medium-size farmers in
order to improve farming and agricultural technology, and train the
necessary staff.
18.      Two important new policies adopted by the Government after CENCAP
was created had important implications for CENCAP's originally-assigned
role and functions: (a) the enactment of the Agrarian Reform Law (March
1980) and the Law for transfer of land ownership (April 1980); and (b) the
regionalization of the Ministry of Agriculture's administration, which
granted to regions a great deal of autonomy. The implications of these
policy changes are indicated in par&. 4.11 of the body of the report.
19.      CENCAP was developed by the Bank project with FAQ assistance, and
was provided with assistance to build six Rural Training Centers (CCRs) and
one Inservice Training Center (CCES).   CENCAP oversees other non-project
CCRs. CENCAP's organization has three divisions (operations,
communications, and curricula development) with five departments.  It also
has supportive sections for planning administration and auditing. An
advisory committee operated only at the beginning of CENCAPs operations.
CENCAP's staff consists of 246 members (170 under contract from US AID-
supported projects, and 76 paid directly from Government sources), a much
larger staff than anticipated at appraisal. The operations division is
CENCAP's link with the regions.
The Trainina Programs and the Training Centers
20.      In the agricultural training program, the number of permanent
professional staff at each CCR was planned at two (one director and one
deputy director) whose duties largely consisted of coordinating the
training programs and administrative functions. During the implementation
of the project, the actual number has increased between two and four per
CCR. The explanation is that while at appraisal most of the training was
expected to be carried out by outside staff (given the emphasis on
technological transfer) the eimphasis actually switched to the socio-
economic area, which is more repetitive, requires less specialization and
could be carried out by permanent internal staff. For the technology
courses, the CCRs utilize external staff, with the cooperation of various
institutions. This cooperation has not been a problem, contrary to what
was expected at appraisal. The number of staff of project CCRs in 1985 is
shown in Annex II. It consisted of a total of 56 persons: 25 teaching
staff (professionals and technical) and 31 administrative.
21.      The CCRs operate both internal and external courses.  The former
are usually one-week boa;ding courses carried out at the CCR, while
external courses are usually two-day field courses. The Inservice Training
Center (CCES), instead of being dedicated exclusively to the training of
staff, is also being utilized for the training of farmers. This dual
objective is also applied at the CCRs. Because of the high demand for
courses at the CCES, the utilization factor in relation to appraisal is 120
percent, and the rate for the CCRs is 68 percent (a reasonable rate that
could still be improved). See Table 4 below:

a/ In these CCRs the programed number of weeks in 1985 was way below the
appraisal estimates, which explains the low utilization factor.
b/ The focus of the courses on the socio-economic area both in internal
and external courses has led to a low utilization of workshop facilities
and technical equipment at the CCRs and the CCES.
22.      The curricula of the courses was focused on the following major
categories: associative business education; rural administ.ation;
technology; literacy; and other. The selection of topics was carried out
with participation of the rural community and to- respond to the new
agrarian policy, the switch in emphasis to socially-oriented courses had to
take place. Printed material, graphics and videccassettes (in some cases)
were utilized to support the courses. The relatively low priority given to
technology courses and to courses for women on rural home improvement is
questionable.
23.      Output
The number of persons trained at the project CCRs and the CCES has
been steadily increasing from 2,735 in 1982 (second semester) to 19,642 in
1985, with a total of 39,562 people trained during a period of 3.5 years,
an average of 11,300 per year, compared to the appraisal target of 7,450
(7,200 farmers and 250 staff). (See Annex I). Although information on the
number of staff trained in the year 1985 is unavailable, the number trained
in the first 2.5 years (1982-1984) was 4,062: this would indicate an annual
average that is over six times the annual appraisal target (250). The



- 38 -
ANNt XII
Page 7 of 8
partial infon4mtion shown in Annex I indicates that for 1985, the number of
people trained in internal courses (6,628) met 89 percent of the appraisal
target.1  In 1985, the proportion trained in external courses vs. lnternal
courses was two to one. The increase of external training was due to the
reasons Indicated in para. 18. The summary on output shown in Table 5
below, supplemented by that given in Annex I, provides the full picture on
output presently available.

24.      CENCAP focused the training program on farmers sub4ect to the
Basic Agrarian Reform Law (Decree 153)2 , and on those included in a
broadening of that law through Decree No. 207.3   Including the project
CCRs, non-project CCRs and other training programs, a total of 54,291
persons were trained between 1983-1985 (36,855 beneficiaries of Decree 153,
and 9,910 beneficiaries of Decree 207, as well as 7,526 professional and
technical staff). The total population benefitting from Agrarian Reform is
estimated about 530,000 people. Farmers, farm leaders, technicians a*d
professionals have been trained in the following broad areas: associative
business education; rural administration, technology, literacy and other
types of activities. Only 13 percent were trained in technology:
associative business education reached 73 percent, business administration
9 percent, 'other" 5 percent, and the literacy training rate was very low
but gaining in importance.
1/ Adjusted to 7,450 because of the reduction of CCRs from eight to six,
plus the CCES.
21 This law established production cooperatives made up of the workers
from about 250 of the largest farms in the country.
31 Land not being directly worked by the owners is transferred to those
working on the land.

oRecurrent Costs
25.      In 1985, the total cost for operating CENCAP's training programs
(internal and external) vas Ca. 4.05 million (2.5 million from Public Law
nr480 revenues, 0.95 million from AID Loan Project No. 519-T-032, and 1.06
million from Government sources). The proportion of Government
contributions to operational costs have been steadily decreasing over
consecutive years as a proportion of total costs. Distribution of
expenditures in 1985 for operational costs is estimated as followns
personnel 72 percent; materials and supplies 23 percent; other non-
personnel expenses 4 percent; and current transfers 1 percent.
Improvements in the training programs appear possible by reducing the
proportion of central staff compared to field staff, and allocating more
funds for field operations and maintenance of buildings, as well as the
provision of equipment and materials.
26.      CENCAP's 1985 operational costs (Cs. 4.05 million) for training
38,920 people (about half from project CCRs and CCES end half from non-
project CCRs) represents an average cost per trainee of Cs. 104
(USS 41.62). This cost corresponds to 18,700 trainees in one-week boarding
courses (five days, each for a total of 93,500 trainee-days), and 20,200
trainees in two-day external field courses (40,400 trainee days). Overall
cost per trainee-day would therefore be Cs.30.25 (US$12.1) and coat per
trainee-hour would be Cs.3.78 (US$1.51). The cost per trainee-week
is Cs.151.25 (US$60.5). This cost includes about two-thirds of the
students learning in boarding conditions, and one-third as external
students. Information about the boarding cost was unavailable. The unit
cost at appraisal for one trainee-week at a boarding course was equivalent
to Cs. 150. This cost, projected to 1985 (see Table 4 of the body of the
report), would be about Cs.390. Even considering that about half of the
trainees participated in external courses and took only abo"t one-third of
the total number of training days set at appraisal, the actual unit cost
(Cs.151.25) appears quite reasonable compared to the project appraisal
estimate. The cost per trainee-hour of US$1.51 appears quite reasonable
considering the boarding conditions indicated above.
27.      The low cost indicated appears to be the result of several
factors: (a) the cost of one week courses at appraisal was based on 100
- percent boarding courses, while the actual cost reflects the real situation
where only two-thirds of the total number of training days occur in
boarding conditions; (b) socially-oriented courses, which predominates at
the CCRs, require proportionally less staff and less teaching materials
than technically-oriented courses, and are therefore cheaper; (c) actual
courses are shore of teaching materials and other operational expenditures;
and (d) the appraisal estimate appears to the modest salaries actually
being paid.

Notes on Physical Implementation
Designs of Educational Units
1.       The design of the CCRs included four main buildings: (a)
administration and staff living quarters, (b) cafeteria and kitchen, (c)
student dormitory, and (d) classroom building. The building design was
standardized *nd modest, utilizing locally-available materials and finishes
that minimized maintenance costs. Expansion of the training capacity from
40 to 60-75 places will be possible by increasing the size of the student
dormitory facilities: constructed areas for the other facilities are large
enough to allow for this expansion.
2.       The design of the CCES Center located in San Andres is
considerably more elaborate than that of the CCRs. This facility was
probably designed as a showplace, to harmonize with the surrounding
Agricultural Research and Extension buildings (CENTA) and the Agricultural
School (ENA). A stmpler design with fewer oversized hallways, planting
areas and patios p.uld have been more appropriate and less costly.
3.       Although functional, attractive and requiring minimal maintenance,
the offices and shops at the Vocational Training Center (CFP) in San
Salvador have been constructed on a crowded site and are situated too
closely together. As a result, natural light and ventilation in the
instructional area is inadequate. The site limits future expansion of the
teaching area.
Civil Works
4.       General contractors licensed to construct in El Salvador were
prequalified and evaluated in accordance with Bank guidelines. Sealed
competitive bids were received for construction of the proposed facilities.
5.       Generally speaking, construction of all CCR facilities was
satisfactory. Serious designlconstruction deficiencies which should have
been corrected during construction were noted in the CFP component in San
Salvador. In the CFP facility, improper flashing and installation of
roofing material allows rain water to leak into the training areas. Not
only does the roof leak, but rain also enters as a result of inadequately-
prote^-ted screened areas high on the outside walls.  Furniture and
equipment is being damaged. As a res.1t of what appears to be faulty
base/finish painting, there is a serious rust problem on almost all
structural metalwork and on metal doors. Corrections are being made by the
contractor, with final retention monies being held until corrections have

been satisfactorily completed.
Furniture and Equipment
6.       Furniture for the project was procured locally, utilizing
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Although international bids were not
required, the invitation to bid was distributed to all Embassies in El
i         Salvador and international companies were free to participate.
7.       Bids for equipment, including spare parts, were requested on an
international basis through manufacturers' legal representatives in El
Salvador. There was no prequalification of bidders. Only a minimal amount
of equipment still remains to be delivered and installed at various
centers. The Government has not yet resolved legally a dispute concerning
the quantity of some material received that was less than what shown on the
shipping documents.
