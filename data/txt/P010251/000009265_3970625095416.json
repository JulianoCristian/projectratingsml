deliver urban\n            services; (b) improve resource mobilization and cost\n            recovery; (c) demonstrate the feasibility of new approaches\n            to providing services to the urban poor; and (d) directly\n            improve basic urban services. These objectives will be\n            achieved through a series of subsectoral interventions, with\n            physical improvements combined with specific institutional\n            and financial measures in the area of water and sewerage,\n            flood control and drainage, transportation, katchi abadi\n            upgrading, solid waste management, resource generation, and\n            metropolitan management. The main risk to the project will\n            be the ability of some of the implementing agencies to\n            attract and retain capable staff."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
