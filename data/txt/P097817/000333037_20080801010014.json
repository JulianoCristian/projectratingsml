Management Project for China were as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: before sophisticated approaches to\n            planning and information management can be useful for\n            biodiversity conservation, protected-area managers first\n            need to have a strong understanding of the adaptive\n            management approach and skills in each of its steps;\n            defining outcomes, formulating measurable objectives\n            targeted to achieving them, collecting and analyzing data on\n            the relevant indicators with reliable methods to assess the\n            success of efforts, and revising approaches in light o f the\n            results. For greater effectiveness and relevance, projects\n            or components facilitating the development of\n            biodiversity-friendly, community-supported livelihood\n            schemes where borrower agencies lack experience with them\n            will need to: (1) provide for greater training, closer\n            monitoring and continuous technical support of staff\n            responsible for engaging with communities to identify and\n            plan sub-projects; and (2) demonstrate the biodiversity and\n            livelihood impacts of such schemes on meaningful scales,\n            particularly in countries where resource use pressures on\n            biodiversity is high. These steps will make it more likely\n            that capacity in this area will be sustained and extended to\n            other protected areas, and greater borrower ownership and\n            resources for biodiversity-supporting poverty reduction will\n            be generated. Programs to scale-down or close\n            resource-extraction enterprises in remote, rural areas for\n            the benefit of biodiversity, and to equitably transfer\n            workers displaced as a result to new livelihoods, can face\n            numerous challenges; weak, uneven and unpredictable markets\n            and opportunities, government economic policies, and the\n            skill-level and social composition of the displaced workers.\n            Such programs therefore need to carefully consider and be\n            tailored around these factors, including the viability of\n            alternate enterprises and existing opportunities in other\n            sectors in the region. Furthermore, it is important that\n            their design involves local government, as it has the\n            knowledge of local realities and hence of what would be feasible."}, "docdt": "2008-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
