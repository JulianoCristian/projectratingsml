environment, following\n            well-drilling activities, which will generate solid wastes,\n            and risk contamination of ground-water, suitable as drinking\n            water, and, potentially de-stabilize the area's\n            ecology, and geological formations, risking the intrusion of\n            geothermal water, and pipeline leakage onto the surface.\n            Noise, and air pollution, as a result of gas emissions are\n            further factors which will affect the environment. The\n            mitigation plan recommends that: 1) procurement documents\n            include the requirement for the drilling contractor, to\n            dispose of drilling wastes in an environmentally\n            safe-manner, following waste detoxing processes: 2) steel\n            casings (pipes) be grouted into the rock, to separate\n            drilling tools from fluids, preventing direct chemical\n            contact on ground-water, and sub-surface environments; 3)\n            site selection should exclude natural habitats as possible,\n            relocate protected species of trees as needed, and,\n            re-enforce fines collection in accordance with Polish laws;\n            4) exploitation of geothermal resources, require a seismic\n            reflection survey in the Podhale basin, to provide data on\n            geological formations; and, 5) the use of low nitrogen\n            oxides (NOx) burners, be used to reduce NOx formations,\n            preventing gas emissions during peak plant operations."}, "docdt": "2000-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
