Up-front geological\n            risks, linked with drilling of the first geothermal doublet\n            need to be mitigated by careful geological assessments.\n            Geothermal projects require integrated analysis of\n            geological, technical, environmental, economic and financial\n            aspects. Market demand is a function of relative costs of\n            geothermal heat relative to other heating options. Market\n            assessment should include evaluations of consumer choice\n            variables in selection of heating systems, current estimates\n            of heating costs from existing systems, and likely end user\n            efficiency improvements following conversion to geothermal\n            heat. The proposed financing plan will have to be designed\n            for debt service levels that the operating company can\n            support. A detailed implementation timetable, taking account\n            of the phasing of project components and re-assessment prior\n            to the next phase, is essential. Sound and experienced\n            project management is key for the success of a geothermal\n            project, as in any complex project. In particular, the\n            management should include an experienced top manager, who is\n            knowledgeable about major key aspects of geothermal projects."}, "docdt": "2005-10-11T00:00:00Z"}
