HEALTH TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:             Republic of Korea
Beneficiaries:        Private Hospitals
Amount:               US$60.0 million equivalent
Terms:                Repayable in 15 years including 5 years of grace at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:      The Government would on-lend the proceeds of the loan to
private hospitals at the same interest rate, maturity and
grace per' ds as the IBRD loan agreement. Sub-borrowers
would bear foreign exchange risk.
Project
Description:          The project would:  (i) expand the diagnostic and
treatment capabilities of NCD specialty units in large
referral hospitals; (ii) replace and add biomedical
equipment in hospitals located in large and medium-size
cities and distribute it more equitably; and
(iii) provide equipment to medium-size city hospitals
designated as emergency centers in the national Emergency
Medical Services network.  Agreed criteria would be
strictly applied to the selection of participating
hospitals and of equipment. The selection criteria for
hospitals would consider the hospital's financial status,
its location, its size, and the need for and potential
efficient utilization of the requested equipment. The
selection of the biomedical equipment would take into
consideration the regional distribution among the eight
medical regions, the relevance of equipment to medical
needs, training of equipment users, availability of a
recurrent cost budget for operating the equipment, and
sharing of equipment by several facilities. The
financing of high cost equipment would be excluded from
the project, partly because there is an active leasing
market for this type of equipment, and partly because
some procedures are not reimbursable by the national
insurance and would therefore not be accessible to the
poor.
Project implementation would be the responsibi-±ty of the
Bureau of Medical Affairs in MOHSA. Independent review
panels would be set up to select hospitals and equipment.



MOHSA staff would receive training to manage the on-
lending process and the subloans with the selected
hospitals.
Benefits & Risks:    As a result of the project, the geographical distribution
of biomedical equipment would be improved making it
accessible to more people in all eight medical regions of
the country. The equipment diffusion criteria would be
changed from a hospital size criterion to criteria based
on population to be served and their medical needs.
MOHSA would be strengthened in its ability to monitor
hospital performance and to develop cost containment
strategies. Finally, as transparent accounting practices
would be required from the participating hospitals, the
project would set the stage for the use of uniform
accounting procedures and stronger financial management
of private hospitals.
The principal risk would be defaulting by project
institutions and inappropriate selection of beneficiary
hospitals. To minimize this risk, procedures have been
established to investigate the creditworthiness of
recipients of loan proceeds, and one full-time staff
member with finiancial skills and a working knowledge of
hospital financing has been recruited by MOHSA to monitor
their financial performance during the life of the loan.
The Hospital Selection Committee and the Equipment
Selection Committee satisfactory to the Bank have already
been established and their respective members already
appointed. Criteria for selecting beneficiary hospitals
have been agreed and their strict application would be
monitored during project supervision.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT 1/
A. Population, Health and Nutrition Status
1.1       PoDulation Status.  Korea's 1990 population is estimated at 42.8
million, of which 70 percent live in urban areas. Population density is 431
persons per square kilometer, which makes it among the world's most densely
populated countries. The crude birth rate and crude death rates were,
respectively, 16.4 and 5.8 per 1,000 population, giving a natural population
increaso of one percent. Urbanization, industrialization and a successful
family planning program have had a major demographic impact. Age structure by
the three main age groups is as followss 0-14 years: 26.5 percent; 15-64
yearst 68.9 percent; 65 and over: 4.6 percent. The dependency ratio
therefore is 45 percent.
1.2       The total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.6 children per woman in
reproductive age in 1989, which is below the replacement level of 2.05.
Government policy aims at a zero percent population increase by 2020 at which
time the population would have stabilized at about 50 million. This goal is
clearly within reach. Widespread use of modern contraceptive methods and
increase in the age at marriage account for the low fertility rate. The
contraceptive prevalence rate is over 70 percent and the most popular family
planning method in 1987 was sterilization (41 percent) followed by IUDs (34
percent), condoms (20 percent) and oral pills (5 percent).
1.3       Health Status.  Conventional health indicators show that the health
status of Koreans has improved greatly in recent years. Life expectancy
increased from about 55 years in 1965 to about 67 years in 1989 for males and
from 58 years to 75 years for women. The national average life expectancy at
birth is 71 years. The infant mortality rate of 12.5 depths per 1,000 live
births compares favorably with most developed countries. The maternal
mortality rate is 30 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is low compared to
other developing countries but still three times higher than the average for
developed countries. Immunization rate is a high 92 percent, and 85 percent
of babies are delivered in a hospital setting. These advances result from
improvements in education, nutrition, public health services, housing and
personal incomes.
l/ A more detailed treatment of some aspects of the Korean health sector
can be found in World Bank Report No. 7412-KO: Korea Health Insurance
and the Health Sector, June 14, 1989.



-2-
1.4      The incidence of communicable diseases has diminishbd sharply and
many have been eradicated (smallpox, polio, typhus, malaria). Korea has had
successful communicable disease preventiu  programs through investments in
water supply and sewage disposal systems, low-income housing, aggressive
public health measures, and health promc ion and protection programs.
1.5      Rapid growth of the Korean economy - accompanied by industrializa-
tion and urbanization - has changed life styles and affected the health status
of Koreans. The mortality profile and the disease burden have shifted over
the last 30 years from a typical developing country's profile of high
fertility/high mortality and prevalence of infectious and parasitic diseases,
to a developed country profile of noncommunicable chronic and degenerative
diseases, and a rapidly increasing incidence of diseases resulting from social
and environmental factors. Personal behavior, food, and the nature of the
environment have become the prime determinants of health and disease in Korea
as in all developed countries.

1.6      The principal causes of death in the 1980s were cancer, heart
disease and stroke, accidents and violence, which together accounted for six
deaths out of ten in 1987 (Table 1.1). During the period 1981-87 death rates
for cancer and for accidents and violence increased consistently, but the
death rate for heart disease and stroke has started to decline since 1986, a
trend which is consistent with experiences of most industrialized nations.
The prevalence of these conditions has increased dramatically. Cancer rates
per 1,000 population increased fivefold between 1980 and 1988, and the rates
for heart disease and stroke, and for accidents and violence increased
sevenfold during the same period (Table 1.2). The number of deaths from
traffic accidents increased fourfold between 1970 and 1988 or an average 16?
per year, whereas they decreased in most industrialized countries. The number
of deaths per million population for Korea was 2.75 in 1987 compared with 0.77
for Japan. The number of deaths was 57 per 10,000 vehicles or thirty times
higher than Japan's 1.9.

1.7        Nutrition Status.  Undernutrition has decreased substantially.  The
overall percent of malnourished children under the age of five was reported by
WHO in 1984 as 7.6, with girls being slightly less well-nourished than boys
(8.9 versus 6.5). Small scale nutrition studies report pockets of under-
nutrition in some low-income rural and peri-urban groups. An increase in
obesity is a different type of malnutrition docur ted in one study. In 1988
the daily caloric consumption per capita was 2,814. The nutrition status of
the Koreans is generally satisfactory.
B. The Health Care System
1.8        The basic structure of the Korean health care system reflects the
influence of the Japanese system, which in turn was inspired by the German
Bismarckian social insurance model. After the Second World War Korea's system
was largely patterned after the United States. The Ministry of Health and
Social Affairs (MOHSA) has formal responsibility for policy making and
administration of the health system. The Economic Planning Board (EPB) has
important powers in overall plamining and resource allocation and directly
affects health policy decisions. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has
jurisdiction over city, county and provincial governments and is responsible
for the execution of MOHSA policies.
1.9        The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA).  MOHSA is
responsible for broad health policy coordination (see Organizational Chart,
Annex 1). Its programmatic responsibility is mainly for the maintenance and
promotion of traditional public health activities such as the control of food,
water, air and pharmaceuticals; immunization, family planning and MCH



-4-
programs; epidemiological surveillance, health education and disease control;
management of MCH centers, health subcenters and primary health care posts;
and for the administration of the social welfare system. Its share of the
national general account budget was 5.0 percent in 1990 up from 2.7 percent in
1983 (Table 1.3) and 3.8 percent in 1988. SoLial welfare expenditures
absorbed 83 percent of its budget in 1989 versus 61.52 in 1983. The major
factor behind the increase in social welfare expenses is the increase in
medical insurance payments which went from 12.5? of HOHSA's budget in 1983 to
372 in 1990.

1.10      The Private Sector.  As its role models  Japan and the USA, Korea
has a large and strong private sector. Provision of personal health services
is mainly in the domain of the private sector with concentration in urban
areas. Private clinics and hospitals account for 95 percent of all medical
facilities, employ 72 percent of physicians and 55 percent of nurses, and
manage 80 percent of hospital beds. Private medical schools account for more
than 71 percent of medical schools and 60 percent of the dental schools.
Traditional oriental medical schools are operated by the private sector.
1.11      The Social Security System.  Korea's social security system consists
of three components: (i) social insurance (medical insurance, pensions,
industrial accident compensation); (ii) public assistance (subsistence aid,
medical aid, disaster relief); and (iii) social welfare services for the
physically handicapped, elderly, women, children and the mentally
incapacitated.
1.12      The Medical Insurance System.  Participation in Korea's medical
insurance system became mandatory for all citizens from July 1, 1989. The



system operates largely through non-profit medical insurance societies which
are grouped into three org-nizations: (i) the industrial establishment medical
insurance societies (154 societies with 16.5 million beneficiaries or 37.4? af
the population) covering employees of industrial companies with five or more
workers; (ii) the regional medical insurance societies (254 societies with
18.9 million beneficiaries or 42.9Z of the population) covering self-employed
rural and urban residents; and (iii) the Korea Medical Insurance Corporation
with 4.4 million members or about 10X of the population which covers
government and private school employees. The 408 societies and the
corporation are members of the National Federation of Medical Insurance (NFMI)
organized as a special public corporation financed by membership fees and fees
for reviewing and processing claims. The insurance societies ere similar to
the sick funds in several Western European countries and in Japan, and perform
four functions: (i) review the qualifications of the insured and dependents;
(ii) collect contributions; (iii) pay the provider for services rendered to
the insured; and (iv) designate medical institutions for the care of the
insured. The large number of societies is inefficient and wasteful and lacks
the cost saving potential and bargaining strength of a more unified system.
1.13      The medical insurance societies do not include medical assistance
for low-income families, which is part of government paid public assistance
and covers 4.2 million people or about 10 percent of the population.
1.14      Medical insurance is financed by contributions from the insured and
the employer and by government subsidy. Contributions to thp industrial
establishment medical insurance societies are shared equally by employer and
employee and the rates are determined through a collective bargaining procezs
within a range of 3 percent to 8 percent of the insured's income. The
Government pays 50 percent of the cost of the regional medical insurance
societies, 50 percent of the insurance for civil servants as the employer, 20
percent of the contribution of private school employees, and most or all of
the contribution for the poor on public assistance. The insured pays part of
the cost of services received, i.e., 20 percent of inpatient services, up to
55 percent of the cost of outpatient visits, 30 percent of prescription drugs,
and 60 percent of non-prescription drugs.
C. Health Care Resources and Utilization
1.15      Hospital Beds.  The number of hospital beds has about doubled
between 1980 and 1988 and has reached a satisfactory ratio of 2.9 beds per
1,000 population (Annex 2). About half of these beds are in general acute
multi-specialty hospitals, about 25 percent are in community hospitals of
lesser clinical scope and another 25 percent are in clinics with fewer than 20
beds. Tax rates and reimbursement rates explain the proliferation of clinics.
Solo physicians incorporate as a clinic to receive a higher insurance
reimbursement rate for services provided and to qualify for lower tax rates.
Urban areas have 85 percent of the hospital beds and the bed/population ratio
per 1,000 is 3.4 versus 1.3 in rural areas. Not-for-profit hospitals have
about 60 percent of the beds and their average hospital size is 240 beds.
For-profit hospitals have about 22 percent of the beds and are smaller
facilities with an average bed capacity of 69. Public sector hospitals are
fewer in number. Many are specialty hospitals (tuberculosis, leprosy, mental)



-6-
and their average size is 300 beds. The strongest growth in hospital beds
occurred in the first half of the decade (Annex 3 but seems to have slowed
down considerably (e.g., a 5 percent growth in 1988 versus a 21 percent growth
in 1983). The national hospital occupancy rate in 1989 for all hospitals was
a satisfactory 81.52 (urban: 82.4Z and rural: 77Z), and the average length of
stay was a high 14 days (urban: 13 and rural: 23). Hospital admissions in
1988 were 67 per 1,000 population and the number of outpatient visits per
person per year was 3.3. These two figures are about half the corresponding
figures for developed countries but in line with middle-income country
utilization rates.
1.16      Medical Technologies.  In Korea there is widespread and increasing
demand by health professionals and patients for greater technological
sophistication in the provision of medical care, driven by an increase in
noncommunicable diseases and by the universalization of health insurance.
Comparative data are not readily available for all types of technologies but
limited information shows that Korea has ten times fewer CT scanners per
million people than Japan, five times fewer MRI's (Magnetic Resonance
Imaging), and four times fewer linear accelerators. In the process of
expanding medical technology, Korea needs to address several problems. First,
the uncontrolled introduction and diffusion of medical technologies could
drive up aggregate costs to an unaffordably high level. Second, geographic
maldistribution could lead to inequitable access to available equipment.
Third, additional inequity could result from the cost of procedures performed
on the more expensiive technologies not being eligible for reimbursement under
national health insurance and, therefore, only people able to pay would have
access. Finally, diffusion so far in Korea has been guided by the criterion
of hospital size (e.g. at least 700 beds for a scanner), favoring large urban
hospitals, instead of using population-based or needs criteria that would lead
to a more efficient and equitable distribution.
1.17      Health Manpower.  With 31 medical schools (and four more in the
planning stage) Korea has one of the world's highest medical school/population
ratios. The total number of physicians increased about 63 percent between
1980 and 1988, going from a ratio of 1,493 people per physician to a ratio of
1,005 (Annex 4), which is about double the ratio of developed countries. Each
year the percentage increase in physicians is higher than the previous year.
The most striking feature of the physician manpower market is the geographic
maldistribution of physicians. Seoul has 24 percent of the population but 42
percent of the physicians. Rural areas have 34 percent of the population but
only 7 percent of the physicians. In general, about 90 percent of the
physicians reside in urban areas, 3 percent are military doctors, and 7
percent live in rural areas. The most striking aspect of the shifting
physician marketplace is the growing supply of physician specialists. The
percentage of physicians that are specialists rose from 32 percent in 1980 to
49 percent in 1988. The high proportion and number of specialists creates
inflatio.:ary supplier-induced demand, and especially procedure-based demand,
above what can be justified medically. MOHSA has no manpower planning office
that could calculate manpower requirements to meet the country's health needs.
1.18      Between 1980 and 1988 the number of dentists more than doubled and
the ratio increased from one dentist for 10,500 people to one for 5,500



-7-
(Annex 5). Here, too, the annual percent increases are accelerating quickly,
going from a 9 percent yearly increase in 1981 to a 13 percent yearly increase
in 1988.
1.19      The nurse population has also expanded at an annual rate of about 8-
9 percent and the ratio of population per nurse was almost halved between 1980
and 1988, going from one nurse per 937 persons to an acceptable ratio of one
nurse per 545 persons (Annex 6). The number of specialized nurses represents
only about one percent of all nurses, but their number is increasing at a much
faster rate than that of general nurses, indicating a slowly increasing supply
of public health nurses, mental health nurses, anesthetists, and visiting
nurses.
1.20      Impact on Health Care Costs.  The increasing availability of
hospital beds and an ample and growing supply of physician specialists
financed1 by a national insurance scheme are the major ingredients for rapid
cost escalation (see next paragraph). Lack of regulations and the absence or
non-enforcement of macro level cost containment measures fail to stem the cost
inflation. Policymakers face critical questions on how to control costs,
promote economic efficiency (output per billion Won invested), promote
technical efficiency (output per employee or productivity), enhance
effectiveness (minimize unnecessary and inappropriate care), and ensure the
equitable distribution of resources.
D. Health Care Expenditures and Financing of Services
1.21      The Korean health economy is riding the tide of a cost explosion.
Health care spending as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product has expanded
from 2.8 percent in 1975, to 5.2 percent in 1985, to 6.6 percent in 1989, and
an estimated 7.8 percent in 1991. These figures put Korea at the high end of
the range for developing countries and in the middle of the range for
developed countries. In absolute terms health care expenditures would be
about US$ 290 per capita in 1989 or 23Z of Japan's and 14X of the US per
capita expenditures for health care.
1.22      Sources of Funds.  Direct patient payments have declined from 80
percent of health care expenditures in 1980 to 51 percent in 1990. The
expansion of national health insurance benefits may reduce patient payments to
49 percent of expenditures by 1992, but this figure is still higher than any
of the OECD countries because of the high rate of cost sharing in Korea. Cost
sharing is achieved through deductibles and co-payments, e.g., co-paymen-
rates for inpatient hospital care are 20 percent and for outpatient services
the rates range from 30 to 55 percent depending on the place of service. The
rates for drugs are 30 percent for prescription drugs and 60 perceat for non-
prescription drugs.
1.23      National and local tax revenues financed 24 percent of the US$12.3
billion health care expenditures in 1989 as compared to 11.5 percent in 1985.
The Korean Governnent pays half the premium and all the administrative expense
of the Regional Medical Insurance program, which covers 43 percent of the
population (18.9 million farmers, fishermen, the urban self-employed, and
pensioners). The Government provides facilities and 4,000 public health



-8-
doctors (serving in lieu of military service) under the Medical Aid program
for 4.3 million poor citizens (10 percent of the population). The Gn'='nment
also pays 50 percent of the premium for one million civil servants ar, j._neir
2.9 million dependents, and 20 percent of the premium for 165,000 private
school teachers.
1.24      Private insurance premiums are estimated to account for 13 percent
of sector financing, up from 4.5 percent in 1985. Adding industrial accident
insurance, the total of third-party payments is 17 percent. Other non-
specific and non-identified sources classified under miscellaneous account for
the remaining 8 percent of sector financing.
1.25      Uses of Funds.  Three major exper, iture categories accounted for 89
percent of total health sector spending: drugs, herbs and injections
represent 36 percent, hospital charges equal 29 percent, and medical fees
represent 24 percent. The miscellaneous category that makes up the remaining
11 percent includes construction, research funds and other non-specified
expenses. Private sector spending is estimated to be 76 percent of total
spending, down from 88 percent in 1985 and 91 percent in 1980. The extension
of health insurance to low-income groups (farmers, fishermen, pensioners, and
self-employed) required a substantial increase in the Government's
contribution, as it finances 50 percent of the insurance premium and assumes
the administrative costs.
E. Hospital Financing
1.26      Korean hospitals are reimbursed according to a relative value fee
schedule adopted in 1976. The fees have been inflated at approximately the
rate of the general inflation rate in the economy from 1979-89. New fees are
created for new items but items are only added slowly, especially for high
technology services, as utilization increases quickly as soon as the service
becomes reimbursable under the national insurance system. Inpatient and
outpatient services are reimbursed by a split system involving: (i) a fee
schedule plus reimbursement for treatment activities; and (ii) a fee schedule
for reimbursement for materials. The plus factor of the treatment costs
(1,720 items) includes labor time and is paid on a four-tiered system: clinics
(less than 20 beds) receive fee plus 7 percent; general community hospitals
receive fee plus 13 percent; multi-specialty hospitals receive fee plus 20
percent; and the 25 large university hospitals receive fee plus 30 percent.
Materials include 8,100 items reimbursed according to a fixed fee schedule:
6,710 items are drugs or injections- other items are medical supplies, and one
item is a fixed diagnostic fee for a first medical visit.
1.27      Financial information on the performance of Korean hospitals is very
limited and of unknown reliability. Based on a non-random sample of 20
hospitals that voluntarily participate in surveys by Seoul National
University, it was found that: (i) hospitals appear to be moderately
profitable; (ii) leverage is low; and (iii) liquidity is weak mainly due to
long delays in claims reimbursement by insurance companies. Patient direct
payments account for a large share of hospital receipts. The Government does
not subsidize private hospitals, and all private hospitals - whether for
profit or not for profit - pay income taxes, although at rates lower than



corporations (currently the tax rate for hospitals is 20 to 27Z).
Approximately the same bankruptcy laws apply to hospitals as to enterprises.
A very small number of hospitals are reported to go bankrupt every year and
they are mainly doctor-owned clinics with less than 20 beds.
1.28      Many large urban private hospitals are able to finance their capital
needs out of their own resources. Often these hospitals are part of a non-
profit foundation and excess income is channeled into plant improvements.
Equipment, especially the "big ticket" items, are either self-financed or
leased. The wealthiest foundations may secure credit from private banks on
the strength of their financial status or through personal relations in the
banking sector.   Commercial bankers however are reluctant to lend to
hospitals because they are unfamiliar with doctor-dominated hospital
operations. Hospitals located in less favorable socioeconomic areas and in
smaller cities and towns are more capital-constrained. Even though the
Government's policy favors the geographical dispersion of private sector
medical services, private hospitals have no incentive to move into financially
less desirable areas. Therefore, the Government has in the past provided
incentives on a selective basis to rural areas and priority programs. This
has been the case with an OECF loan to 67 private hospitals in medically
underserved rural and fisheries areas, an IBRD loan to ten hospitals for
financing MCH units, an ADB loan to a national hospital, and a KFW loan to
three hospitals. Furthermore, many private hospitals in Korea have not yet
reached the financial discipline of a mature business venture acceptable to
financial lenders. Except for well-funded foundations, many hospitals cannot
mobilize investment funding for specific social programs or in geographic
areas that are important to the Government's social development policy.
Through the proposed project the Government would on-lend directly to selected
hospitals to implement its social policy and by choosing this mechanism it
would avoid any distortionary effect on the financial system that might occur
if financial intermediaries were used.
F. Government Health Policies
1.29      The Government has made a number of policy decisions to make the
health sector more equitable and efficient. It has enacted legislation to
provide medical insurance coverage to the whole population as of July 1, 1989;
it has divided the country into eight large medical regions; it has created
and defined a referral system to assure an orderly flow of patients within and
among these eight regions; it has organized the country into 37 areas for the
purpose of handling medical emergency cases more expediently; and, most
important, it has expressed the political will and commitment to assure that
health care services are available and accessible to the whole population.
These policy measures are in line with the Government's determination to
develop Korea's social sectors more quickly, and, in the case of the health
sector, to respond to increased medical demand resulting from the universali-
zation of medical insurance, rising incomes, technological innovations, an
aging population structure, and the shift in the epidemiological profile from
communicable to noncommunicable diseases (NCD).
1.30      Korea's economic reforms promote local autonomy in economic activity
to achieve more balanced regional development. In the same spirit the health



-10-
sector has instituted a nationwide patient referral system that channels
patients to primary care physicians first and prevents patients from visiting
more expensive facilities and specialists for common problems. This nation-
wide referral system, however, is a recent development and its effectiveness
is still untested. It divides the country into 140 First Service Areas and 8
lecond Service Regions. Patient movement among second service regions
requires a physician referral slip and insurance company approval except for
emergency care. The medical technologies of the designated referral hospitals
in each of the eight regions are being enhanced to achieve a better balance
among regions; the proposed project would contribute to that purpose.
1.31      Achieving the policy of universal health insurance coverage in July
1989 after a 12-year period of gradual expansion was a major accomplishment of
the country's social development policy. Insurance has been accepted as an
appropriate mechanism for achieving the social policy of access to affordable
health care for all citizens, and access to health care is legally guaranteed
irrespective of income and location. The country now needs to correct
structural deficiencies of the sector which grew on the basis of providing
access to medical care based on income rather than need, and which
concentrated its medical facilities, technologies and staff in the major urban
areas. Policymakers are faced with three policy issues: (i) equity:
redressing the regional imbalances, and ensuring financial access for all;
(ii) Costs: containing escalating medical costs in an economic environment
where hospitals with an increasing supply of beds and a growing supply of
physician specialists are guaranteed under national health insurance the
reimbursement for services provided to an insured population demanding more
medical care; and (iii) quality: monitoring quality of medical care and the
medically justified use of medical resources in a financial environment where
the incentives are to provide more services ever if they are not necessary or
proven effective, to prescribe more drugs, to emphasize lucrative diagnostic
procedures, to prolong hospital stays, and to request numerous follow-up
visits.
G. Bank's Role in the Korean Health Sector
1.32      The Bank has assisted the Korean health sector with a population
project (Ln. 1774-5 KO) and a health sector report with special emphasis on
health insurance (Report No. 7412-KO, June 1989). The population project was
approved on December 12, 1979 and was supported by a loan for US$30 million.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1987 and was fully disbursed. The Project
Completion Report (PCR) was published on October 3, 1989 (Report No. 8114).
The Project Performance Au4it Report (PPAR) was issued June 29, 1990 (Report
No. 8895).
1.33      In December 1979 the Bank provided the Government with a loan of
US$30 million for a project expected to cost US$91.5 million to expand and
further strengthen the family planning and maternal and child health programs.
In March 1986, the Bank's Board approved a two year extension to use the
undisbursed balance of the loan to on-1 -d US$17.5 million to private, non-
profit hospitals to establish 'Comprehi..sive Maternal and Child Health
Centers". These hospitals were to serve as r 'erral points for the rural



- 11-
Maternal and Child Health Centers and to assist them in upgrading their
services.
1.34      The conclusions of the PPAR regarding relevant lessons deal with the
population and family planning activities of the project and not with
Phase II. With reference to private hospitals, the PPAR notes that Phase II
of the project was justified and that its primary value was the fact that it
on-lent to private hospitals to permit them to expand their operations and to
acquire more sophisticated equipment.
1.35      The purpose of the sector report was to study the effects and
implications of health insurance on the health sector, and to suggest reforms
that would help Korea meet its health care objectives in a cost-effective and
equitable manner. The intention of the study was to provoke consideration of
a wide range of options in the organization and design of the insurance system
and in the regulations governing public and private investments in medical
manpower and facilities.
1.36      The proposed project would build on the experience of the second
phase of the previous project by using on-'ending to address the capital needs
of selected hospitals requiring quality-improving investments. The rapid
development of the sector's institutions in the past decade justifies this
approach as well as the favorable experience with prior on-lending to private
hospitals. An on-lending approach is also deemed appropriate because it would
make MOHSA responsible for project implementation and it would be held
accountable for its performance by other ministries and by the Bank. It would
therefore also serve to strengthen the key governmental health sector
institution.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin
2.1       The Government included the project in its FY91 list of projects
suitable for external financing and formally asked the Bank for assistance in
November 1989. A Bank mission identified the project in December 1989 and a
Bank project preparation mission visited the country in February 1990. Most
of the preparation work was completed by the Government according to
guidelines formulated by the Bank. The project was preappraised in September
1990 and appraised in December 1990.
B. Project Rationale, Objectives and Scope
2.2       This project would be the means for the Bank to assist the country
in adapting and distributing more equitably and efficiently its medical
technology for early detection and opportune treatment of noncommunicable
diseases, and support the Government's equity policy of making affordable
quality medical care accessible to all citizens. Some larger private
hospitals in the major cities have been able to respond to the rapid
transition in the country's disease profile and to keep their technology up-



-12-
to-date through self-financing and leasing equipment. However, many hospitals
have not been able to make the needed technological adjustments, partly
because of constrained access to capital markets and partly because of their
location in medically underserved areas, especially outside the six major
cities. The project would strengthen the service delivery capacity of private
hospitals meeting qualifying criteria.
2.3       Experience gained by MOHSA in managing the project would give it a
better understanding of hospital and sector financing which would be
beneficial in performing its role of formulating health policies, developing
cost containment measures and defining injury control strategies. This is the
first health sector project where all proceeds from a sector loan are on-lent
to private institutions thereby providing the Bank with experience with this
project design and lending strategy. The proposed project would allow the
Bank to continue its policy dialogue with the Government on appropriate
strategies for the financing of the health sector, the impact of national
health insurance on equity, the cost and the quality of medical care, and for
the introduction and diffusion of medical technologies. These strategies for
sector development may be supported through another Bank project. Finally,
the Bank would also gain experience in helping a middle-income country adapt
to an epidemiological transition which could be utilized in similar countries.
2.4       The objectives of the project are to: (i) support the regionaliza-
tion of service delivery and the referral system by strengthening the
technology in key institutions in each medical region; (ii) improve access to
modern medical technologies through a better geographic distribution of
biomedical equipment; (iii) improve the efficiency of equipment selection and
purchase through a more rational population-based allocation process; and
(iv) strengthen the capability of MOHSA to manage the process of allocation
and diffusion of medical technologies and to monitor the financial performance
of the hospitals selected, thereby setting an example for improved financial
management of hospitals in the private sector.
2.5       The Bank loan would finance the purchase of biomedical equipment and
the beneficiary hospitals would finance complementary inputs (consumables,
transportation and installation, operation and maintenance costs).
C. Project Description
Project Components
2.6       The proposed project's objectives would be achieved through the
implementation, over 3.5 years, of the following three components:
Component A: Support Noncommunicable Disease (NCD) Units in Large Hospitals.
This component would add and replace equipment in existing NCD units in
specialized referral hospitals in the eight medical regions of the country.
Services to be supported would focus on the most prevalent diagnostic
categories, such as, coronary heart disease, cancer, stroke, and chronic liver
disease. The estimated baseline cost of the component is US$20.0 million and
the ceiling of equipment cost allowable to be acquired per eligible hospital
would be US$1.5 million.



-13-
Component B: Strengthen Secondary Care Hospitals for Preventing and Treating
NCD. This component would supply biomedical equipment to secondary level
hospitals in large and medium-size cities in the eight medical regions in
order to give them the capability to detect, treat and slow down the progress
of NCD in the most prevalent diagnoses, and to refer difficult cases to the
higher level tertiary care facilities. The estimated baseline cost of
Component B would be US$20.0 million and the maximum allowable amount of
equipment purchases per selected hospital would be US$1.0 million.
Component C: Strengthen the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in Medium-Size
Cities. This component would add and replace emergency care-related equipment
in secondary care level hospitals located in medium cities (minimum 50,000
population) in the eight medical regions and which are officially designated
as emergency centers in the national EMS network. The estimated baseline cost
of Component C would be US$20.0 million and the maximum of the equipment cost
that could be purchased for each selected hospital would be US$1.0 million.
2.7       A summary of the Guidelines for the Allocation of Loan Proceeds per
component and of the limits for each participating hospital is shown in
.Annex 7. A hospital can apply for only one of the three components. The
total amount of allocation for each component is indicative only. The final
figure could be slightly higher or lower within reasonable limits. Unused
amounts for one component could and should be used for another component.
Population-based ratios w^uld be applied to support the medical
regionalization policy of the Government and to distribute the loan proceeds
equitably across the eight medical regions (Annex 8).
Decision-making Criteria for Selecting Hospitals and Eauipment
2.8       The selection of hospitals and equipment would be guided by criteria
and procedures which have been prepared by HMD and LMD in MOHSA and are
satisfactory to the Bank. Eligibility criteria would be applied by a Hospital
Selection Committee (HSC) (para. 3.10) and by an Equipment Selection Committee
(ESC) (para. 3.11), and only hospitals meeting the criteria fully would
qualify for loan proceeds.
Hospital Selection
2.9       Eligible hospitals would be selected by the HSC which will apply the
general and the component-specific criteria stated in Annex 9 and follow the
procedures outlined in Annex 10. The potential number of candidate hospitals
in each component are, respectively, 85, 206 and 79. The selection criteria
take into consideration the hospital's financial status, its location, its
size and the need and potential efficient utilization of the requested
equipment. A hospital's application would require endorsement by the Office
of Mayor or Governor of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) which has
jurisdiction over the medical facilities in its administrative area. The
accuracy of the financial status of the applying hospital would be confirmed
by a certified public accountant and the CPA's judgment will be part of the
hospital's application. The CPA would be chosen by the hospital from a list
of CPAs provided by the national CPA Association or its regional branch as is
customary in Korea. In addition the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in



-14-
MOHSA would compute the financial ratios shown in Annex 11 from the hospital's
application and/or from the annual audited financial statements provided by
each hospital to MOHSA and would monitor continued compliance with these
ratios. During negotiations the Government provided assurances that for a
hospital to be eligible for receipt of loan funds under the project, it would
first meet the general criteria and then the criteria related to the
particular component for which it applies.  The Government also provided
assuranzes that no material changes in the criteria would be made without
first being discussed and agreed with the Bank.
Equipment Selection
2.10      The selection of the biomedical equipment to be procured under this
proposed project would be subject to the criteria (Annex 12) and follow the
procedures (Annex 13) proposed by LMD of MOHSA and which have been found
satisfactory by the Bank. Hospitals selected by the HSC as eligible for an
equipment loan under the project would submit their schedule of requirements
and technical specifications for approval by the ESC. Proposed equipment
would be assigned points according to three general categories mentioned below
and detailed in Annex 12 and priority would be given to those with higher
total points. Addition of the following large equipment would be excluded:
Computerized Tomography (CT) Scanners, Linear Accelerators, Extracorporeal
Shock Wave Lithotripters (ESWL), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Gamma
Cameras. Selection criteria will take into consideration:
(a) effectiveness in achieving project objectives;
(b) regional distribution and medical need; and
(c)  efficiency in equipment utilization.
2.11      During negotiations the Government provided assurances that the
equipment approved for purchase under this project would meet the agreed
selection criteria and that the selection process would follow the agreed
guidelines. The Government also provided assurances that no material changes
in the criteria would be made without first being discusze4 and agreed with
the Bank.
Project-Related Training
2.12      The project would include local training for MOHSA staff and for
hospital personnel. Training for MOHSA staff responsible for project
implementation would consist of 16 hours of training in principles and
procedures of banking, methods and procedures for security appraisal and
registration, IBRD currency pooling system, loan withdrawal and disbursements.
Seminars on loan management and domestic procurement would be conducted by KHA
in conjunction with MOHSA for representatives of the selected hospitals in
1991. Training assistance would be provided by the training offices of the
Korea Exchange Bank and the Korea Appraisal Board. Seminars would also be
conducted for the equipment managers of the selected hospitals in 1991 and in
1992 on the subjects of domestic procurement issues such as transportation,
insurance, customs clearance and surveyors clearance. Annex 14 shows the

sources.
III. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Costs
3.1       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$81.2 million
equivalent, net of taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange component of
US$68.2 million, or 84 percent of total costs. The estimated cost by project
component is summarized in Table 3.1 and by category of expenditure in
Table 3.2. Detailed costs by component and by category of expenditure are
given in Annex 15 and project expenditure by year and by component in
Annex 16.

3.2       Base costs are estimated in December 1990 prices. Equipment costs
are equivalent to the loan amount stated in Korea's Lorrowing program
excluding contingencies. Transportation and installation costs are based on
experience with other recent Bank projects in Korea. The initial supply of
consumables and the cost of operation and maintenance were estimated according
to standard procedures in use also in recent Bank projects in Korea. Duties
and taxes are estimated at US$4.9 million and are not included in the total
project cost.
3.3       The contingency allowance of US$8.6 million (about 12 percent of
baseline costs) includes contingencies for unforeseen physical conditions and
for estimated price increases. Physical contingencies were estimated at 5
percent of baseline costs for equipment, transportation and installation,
consumable materials and O&M expenditures. Price contingencies were
calculated for both local and foreign costs in accordance with the following
expected annual average price increase percentagest foreign cost at 3.6Z p.a.
and local cost at 52 p.a. throughout. Accordingly, aggregated price increases
are estimated at about 6.6 percent of baseline costs plus physical
contingencies.
,.-.



-17-
3.4       The foreign exchange component of US$68.2 million (about 84 percent
of total estimated project costs) has been calculated on the basis of the
following foreign exchange percentagess equipment, 100 percent;
transportation and installation, 10 percent; consumables, 10 percent; and O&M,
10 percent.
B. Financing
3.5       The proposed loan of US$60.0 million equivalent would finance about
88 percent of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project, or 74
percent of total project costs net of taxes and duties. The hospitals would
be responsible for the remaining US$21.2 million equivalent (Table 3.3). The
loan amount is limited to US$60.0 by Korea's fo.eign borrowing program and is
therefore less than the foreign exchange of the project. The loan would
finance 83 percent of the baseline cost of equipment. Equipment procured
under the project for the private institutions would be financed on the basis
of subloans from the Government to the hospitals on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. Major points of the terms and conditions are
outlined in Annex 17, such as: sub-loans would be denominated in Korea Won
and the sub-borrowers would bear the full exchange risk of the Won against the
World Bank currency pool; the maturity and the grace periods for the sub-
loans would be the same as the ones for the IBRD-GOK loan; and the interest
rate would be the IBRD floating interest rate for the currency pool plus 0.05Z
p.a.   All costs for transportation and installation of equipment, operation
and maintenance and consumable materials, including contingencies, would be
financed by the hospitals. During negtiations agreement was reached on a
model sub-loan agreement between MOHSA and a private hospital. The Government
provided assurances that the model sub-loan agreement will be applied to all
sub-loans under the project.

Recurrent Expenditures
3.6       When fully operational, the installed equipment would annually
generate recurrent costs for consumable materials, maintenance and spare parts
of about 8? and 72, respectively, of the equipment purchase price. These
additional expenditures constitute a very small percentage of a hospital's
annual operating budget and vherefore would be accommodated by the
institutions without difficulty.
C. Project Management and Implementation
3.7       Overall responsibility for project management would lie with the
Hospital Management Division (HMD) in the Bureau of Medical Affairs (BMA) of
the Ministry of Health (MOHSA)(Annex 1). HMD would coordinate its actions
with the Logistic Management Division (LMD) and the Community Health Division
(CHD) in MOHSA, and other related government agencies and professional
institutions which might be involved in project related activities or
policies. HMD would be responsible for the financial management and auditing
uf the project. It will assign one staff member to carry out the following
financial management tasks: appraising sub-loan proposal, drafting sub-loan
agreements and collateral, following up on mortgage registration, recording
sub-loans, collecting on sub-loans, following up on subborrowers' financial
performance and checking compliance with covenants, safeguarding collateral,
taking corrective actions against problem sub-loans, and foreclosing on
collateral if necessary.
3.8       A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) (Annex 18) has been established
under the Director General of the Bureau of Medical Affairs (BMA), who ip the
Project Director. Directly under the Project Director are the Hospital
Selection Committee (see para. 3.10) and the Equipment Selection Committee
(see para. 3.11). The Director of the Division of Hospital Management(HMD)
serves as Project Executive Director, and manages the work of the Planning and
Executing Team and of the Technical Cooperation Team. The Planning and
Executing Team consists of HMD's Sub-Director, one accountant and one full-
time health services management specialist who has already been recruited by
MOHSA to prepare the project proposal and assist in project implementation.
The Government has appointed an additional full time staff member with
financial and banking skills, and experience in hospital financial management,
who will have responsibility for the financial management of the project.
During the negotiations an understanding was reached with the Government that
the person will be retained for the duration of the project and paid out of
the regular MOHSA budget.
3.9       The Technical Cooperation Team would support the Planning and
Executing Team with its technical expertise in biomedical equipment and
emergency medical services. Its staff would be drawn from twe other divisions
within BMA and would consist of three members: two from the Logistics
Management Division and one from the Community Health Division. The Project
Implementation Unit has been formerly established by ministerial.



-19-
Hospital Selection
3.10      The Hospital Selection Committee tHSC) satisfactory to the Bank has
been established and its members appointed. It is chaired by the Project
Director, the Director General of BMA, and comprises a non-MOHSA vice-
chairman, the Project Executive Director as Secretary, and four non-government
committee members. Five of the HSC members come from outside the Government,
represent professional and academic institutions and are nationally
acknowledged experts in fields such as hospital financial management, medical
insurance, and emergency medicine. The HSC would be responsible for applying
the agreed hospital selection criteria (Annex 9) to the hospitals applying for
loan proceeds, for following the agreed procedures (Annex 10) and for
recommending to the Minister of MOHSA the list of hospitals that meet the
qualifying criteria. The terms of reference for the HSC are given in
Annex 19.
Equipment Selection
3.11      The Equipment Selection Committee (ESC) satisfactory to the Bank has
been established and its members appointed. It is chaired by the Project
Director, the Director General of BMA, and consists of a vice chairman (the
Director of LMD), a secretary (the Deputy Director of LID), and four committee
members from outside the Go,ernment.  The latter four were selected from an
already existing medical equiDment review panel in support of the Logistic
Management Division (LMD). Tne ESC would be responsible for applying the
agreed equipment selection criteria (Annex 12) to the schedule of requirements
and technical specifications submitted by the qualifying hospitals. To carry
out tbis responsibility it would follow the agreed procedures listed in Annex
13. The ESC would remain in existence for the duration of the project and its
Terms of Reference are contained in Annex 20. It may carry out additional
tasks as judged necessary by its Chairman, such as visiting the physical sites
where equipment is to be installed and determining their suitability,
providing the necessary approvals for importing medical equipment, and
providing recommendations on the efficient use of the equipment.
3.12      LMD would assist ESC by providing technical advice and data on the
availability of certain large equipment items, on utilization and maintenance
of equipment and it would also assist hospitals in making warranty claims.
Equipment procurement would be undertaken by the Office of Supply, Republic of
Korea (OSROK), the procurement agency of the Government which is highly
experienced in procuring equipment under the Bank's international competitive
bidding procedures. On the basis of equipment specifications provided by the
institutions, OSROK would prepare bidding documents, invite bids, evaluate
them in conjunction with the institutions and make contract awards with the
agreement of the institutions.
3.13      The hospitals are required to register ownership of equipment in the
name of the sub-borrower within two months after installation and to bring
warranty problems to the attention of the company directly or to LMD for
assistance.



-20-
Status of Project Praration
3.14      Project preparation is nearly completed and a number of activities
relating to the initiation of project implementation c 'e already underway.
The targets in the project implementation schedule (Annex 21) are judged to be
reasonable and are satisfactory to both HOHSA and the Bank. The physical
facilities required to house the equipment to be procured under the project
already exist in the hospitals; extra space requirements are expected to be
minimal.  Equipment lists and specifications will be prepared by hospitals as
soon as invitations to apply are sent out by MOHSA. The mechanisms for
selecting hospitals and reviewing the equipment lists and specifications have
been set up and are satisfactory to the Bank. As noted above the Hospital and
Equipment Selection Committees satisfactory to the Bank have been established
and members already appointed. Arrangements to act as procurement agency have
already been made with OSROK, which is very experienced in procurement under
the Bank's International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Project
management mechanisms satisfactory to the Bank have also been set up within
HOHSA, management authority has been defined and supporting staff have been
identified. The advanced stage of project preparation would allow full
implementation to commence immediately after loan signing.
Procurement
3.15      Procurement arrangements are shown in Table 3.4.  About 85 percent
of equipment would be procured on the basis of ICB procedures in accordance
with Bank Guidelines.  Equipment items in critracts valued at less than
US$200,000 may be procured through internkJo.nal or local shopping and direct
purchase up to an aggregate limit of US$9.3 m!llion. Local equipment
manufacturers would be extended a 15 percent preference margin, or the
prevailing customs duties, whichever is lo(er, on bid evaluation under ICB.
Costs of transportation and operation and maintenance would be financ?' by the
hospitals under local p,rocedures which are catisfactory to the Bank.
Installation costs and ,ost of consumables, w not included in the equipment
contracts, would also be financed by the hospiAals.
3.16      In view of successful procurement urd r ICB procedures in recent
Bank projects in Korea, OSROK would not be reqc li-ed to refer equipment
contracts to the Bank for prior review before making contract awards.
However, complete bidding documents including commercial terms, schedule of
requirements and technical specifications will be sent to the Bank for
reference and record before each invitation to bid. Bid evaluation reports,
documents and contracts will be retained by OSROK -or selected ex-post review
by Bank nissions. The large equipment items listed in para. 2.10 would be
excluded from the procurement process. An action pian for equipment
procurement is given in Annex 22.

Note: Figures in parentheses are the amounts to be financed by the loan
Disbursements
3.17      The proposed loan of US$60 million would be disbursed over a period
of 3.5 years (Annex 23).  This is about two years less than the period in the
standard profile for Korea for all sectors as a whole because of the quick
disbursing nature of the project. The completion date of the proposed project
would be June'30, 1994 and the Closing Date, December 31, 1994. Disbursements
would be made on the basis of (a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for
imported equipment or the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment;
and (b) 65 percent of the cost of other local expenditures for equipment.  All
reimbursement would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE) for which
full documentation would be retained in OSROK, Seoul, for review as requested
by visiting Bank missions. Administrative and accounting capability is
adequate to support the SOE procedure.
3.18      To facilitate disbursements, a special account, maintained in US
dollars would be set up at the Korean Exchange Bank (KEB) in an amount of
US$6.0 million to cover the estimated average amount required to finance
project expenditures for the next four months. Applications for replenishment
of the special account would be submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis, or
whenever the amount requested exceeds 50 percent of the initial deposit,
whichever comes first.



-22-
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
3.19      In order to monitor ongoing progress in the onlendi,ig of funds and
in equipment procurement under the project, the semi-annual reports
(para. 3.20) would include the following indicators for each year of the
project: number of hospitals that applied and that were approved by component
and by medical region; number of subloan agreements signed; number and type
and cost of equipment ordered, delivered and installed by component and by
medical region with corresponding dates; updates on loan allocations by
component; reports on the application of financial ratios according to the
model in Annex 11; number of persons trained and number of hours of training;
summaries of the decisions of the HSC and ESC committees; and an updated
project implementation schedule and an equipment procurement action program if
needed. The Bank would supervise the project twice a year and its missions
would review with the PIU the semi-annual progress reports (para. 3.20).
Supervision would be carried out by the Task Manager (Public Health
Specialist) accompanied once a year by a biomedical equipment specialist and
once a year by a procurement specialist. The project implementation schedule
is shown in Annex 21.
Accounts, Audits and Reporting
3.20      MOHSA would maintain project accounts in accordance witn sound
accounting practices. MOHSA would assign one of its staff or a certified
public accountant to audit the financial statements of the sub-borrowers
(Annex 17, Point 14). During negotiations, the Government provided assurances
that audited accounts and financial statements, including an auditor's opinion
on the Statement of Expenditures, would be sent to the Bank within six months
of the end of the Korean financial year. The Government also provided
assurances that it would submit semi-annual progress reports to the Bank on
about March and September, provide status reports for visiting missions and,
within six months of the Closing Date, submit Part II of the project
completion report.
D. Environmental Aspects
3.21      The proposed project would not have any significant negative impact
on the environment. The medical equipment supplied under the project will be
located in properly designed facilities which operate under standard safety
procedures.
E. Impact on Women
3.22      The equipment to be procured under this proposed project would be
available to diagnose and treat all citizens. The project is therefore gender
neutral.  There is no evidence in Korea of discriminatory practices in the
provieion of health services to women.



-23-
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
4.1       As a result of the project, the geographical distribution of
biomedical equipment would be improved making it accessible to more people in
all eight medical regions of the country. The equipment diffusion criteria
would be changed from a hospital size criterion to criteria based on
population to be served and their medical needs. MOHSA would be strengthened
in its ability to monitor hospital performance and to develop cost containment
strategies. Finally, as transparent accounting practices would be required
from the participating hospitals, the project would set the stage for the use
of uniform accounting procedures and stronger financial management of private
hospitals.
B. Risks
4.2       The principal risk would be defaulting by project institutions and
inappropriate selection of beneficiary hospitals. To minimize this risk,
procedures have been established to investigate the creditworthiness of
recipients of loan proceeds, and one full-time staff member with financial
skills and a working knowledge of hospital financing has been recruited by
MOHSA to monitor their financial performance during the life of the loan. The
Hospital Selection Committee and the Equipment Selection Commit:ee
satisfactory to the Bank have already been established and their respective
members already appointed. Criteria for selecting beneficiary hospitals have
been agreed and their strict application would be monitored during project
supervision. The experience with on-lending under the previous health project
was positive and there were no arrears.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.1       During negotiations the Government has agreed to the following:
(a) Hospitals would be selected and loan proceeds allocated according to
criteria and guidelines acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.9);
(b) Equipment would be selected according to criteria and guidelines
acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.11);
(c) The legal sub-loan agreement will be applied to all sub-loans
(para. 3.5);
(d) Audit reports would be submitted by the Government to the Bank
within six months of the end of the Korean financial year
(para. 3.20); and
(e) Within six months of the Closing Date, Part II of the project
completion report would be submitted to the Bank (para. 3.20).



-24-
5.2       During negotiations, understandings were reached that:
(a) The additional full-time person will be retained for the duration of
the project and paid out of the regular MOHSA budget (para. 3.8)
(b) Semi-annual progress reports would be submitted to the Bank around
March and September and status reports would be provided to visiting

KOREA
HEALTH TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
Sub-loan Agreement Between Private Hospitals and MOHSA
Maior Points of Terms and Conditions
1.   General Terms and Conditions
The sub-loan agreement is subject to all relevant terms and conditions of
the loan agreement between IBRD and the GOK and must be satisfactory to
IBRD.
2.   Sub-borrower
The borrowing entity must legally be the parent foundation of the
hospital(s) where the equipment .111 be installed. The borrowing entity
is called the sub-borrower.
3.   Sub-loan amount and denomination
The sub-loan is denominated in Korea Won. The amount of the sub-loan is
the upper limit of the expected equipment cost expressed in Korea Won
plus an adjustment upwards to allow for foreign exchange fluctuations
between the signing date of the sub-loan agreement and the disbursement
date.
4.   Currency exchange risk
The Government of Korea will not bear any currency exchange risk. The
sub-borrowers will bear the full exchange risk of the Won against the
World Bank currency pool. The sub-borrower borrows the Korea Won
equivalent of the pool of currency as determined by the World Bank at the
disbursement date.
5.   Payment
To keep sub-loan administration simple, the sub-loan payment dates will
be the same as those of the IBRD-GOK loan agreement minus a few days or
weeks (to be determined by HOHSA).
6.   Maturity and grace period
To keep the sub-loan administration simple, the maturity and the grace
period for the sub-loan will be the same as the maturity and the grace
period for the IBRD-GOK loan. If the interests accrued during the IBRD-
GOK loan grace period are capitalized, then the interests will also be
accrued during the sub-loan grace period.



-44-
ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 3
7.   Interest rate
The interest rate is the IBRD floating interest rate for the currency
pool plus 0.052 p.a.
8.   Commitment fees
The commitment fees are the same as IBRD commitment fees (presently
0.25X). The sub-borrowers will pay the commitment fees on the un-drawn
balance of the sub-loan irrespective of possible changes in the
purchasing schedule.
9.   Arrears penalty fees
The sub-borrower will pay a 0.052 penalty fee on arrears.
10. Pre-payment
If the sub-borrower wants to pre-pay the sub-loan, it must first request
approval from the Borrower. If agreed, the sub-borrower must pay the
pre-payment fee as stated in the IBRD-GOK loan agreement.
11. Collateral
The sub-borrower must provide a clean first mortgage. The Korea
Appraisal Board will appraise the value of the property. That value oust
exceed 125Z of the sub-loan amount. In addition, MOHSA may require the
owners of the foundation to provide a collateral on their private
property.
12. Restrictions on equipment
The sub-borrower must register the medical equipment in its books within
one month after delivery. The sub-borrower is not allowed to sell,
transfer or lease the medical equipment, nor use it for any other purpose
unless agreed by HMD.
13. Information
(a) The sub-borrower will advise MOHSA upon equipment installation.
(b) The sub-borrower must know the sub-loan procedures related to the
project.
(c) upon MOHSA's request, the sub-borrower must provide:
(i) annual reports on the operational status of the medical
equipment purchased under the sub-loan;
(ii) any information related to the project.



-45-
ANNEX 17
Page 3 of 3
14. Financial audit
MOHSA may ask one of its staff or an assigned certified public accountant
to audit the financial statements of the sub-borrower and/or the
hospital(s) where the equipment is installed. In such a case, MOHSA may
decide on the scope of the audit and may issue specific instructions for
the audit procedures.
15. Non-compliance
If the sub-borrower fails to comply with any of the sub-loan terms and
conditions, MOHSA may terminate the sub-loan agreement and immediately
claim the full payment of the sub-loan outstanding balance plus any loss
that the Government of Korea would have incurred as a result of the non-
compliance.

Terms of Reference for the Hospital Selection Committee (HSC)
1.        Purpose:  The HSC would be established in MOHSA to review and selcct
hospitals eligible for the loan proceeds of the Health Technology Project
(HTP)financed by IBRD.
2.        Tasks:  The HSC will apply the agreed selection criteria and the
procedures for the selection of participating hospitals as specified in
Annexes 8 and 9. It may perform other tasks related to the HTP as requested
by the Minister of MOHSA.
3.        Structure:  The HSC would consist of seven members as follows:
Director General, BMA, MOHSA, Chairman
One Non-MOSHA Committee Member as Vice Chairman
Director, HMD, MOHSA, Secretary
Four non-MOHSA hospital experts to be appointed by the Minister of MOHSA.
The HSC may, whenever necessary, co-opt for the discharge of its
tasks additional members but not more than seven. The co-opted members may be
hospital managers or financial analysts and would be selected for their
expertise needed for a specific purpose. The co-opted member may cast a vote
at a HSC meeting, one vote per co-opted member. The office of the co-opted
member terminates as soon as the need for his/her services does no longer
exist.
4.        Chair:  A Chairman is responsible for the timely completion of all
tasks of the HSC. In the absence of the Chairman and of the Vice Chairman,
the HSC members present at the meeting elect a temporary Chairman among those
present by a simple majority vote, and the temporary Chairman also has a
casting vote.
5.        Meeting and Decisions:  The HSC would meet as often as needed for
the selection of eligible hospitals as potential recipients of loan proceeds
for the HTP. The presence of four members (excluding co-opted members) would
constitute a quorum. Each member has one vote. The Chairman, in addition to
one vote as a member, has a casting vote when the number of votes for or
against a motion is equal. A motion is carried with a simple majority of
votes.
6.        Recordings and Reports:  The Secretary of HSC keeps the minutes of
the meetings and submits the minutes before an affixed deadline date to the
project director.

Page 2 of 2
7.        Panels:  The HSC may for specific tasks form as many panels as
necessary. Each panel is composed of not less than three and not more than
five members from one or more members of the HSC or from individuals outside
the HSC. Each panel would be chaired by a member of the HSC and will report
to the HSC on its assigned tasks. The panel has no voting power vis-a-vis
HSC. The HSC may delegate a part of its task to a panel duly formed in
accordance with this Article, as an assignment, and will act accordingly on
the Panel's report, to be submitted to HSC before an affixed deadline date.
The HSC may modify or reject a Panel's recommendation(s) but should document
the reasons fer this action.
8.        Selection:  The HSC's recommended list of selected hospitals would
derive from deliberations and decisions made on the basis of MOHSA's Hospital
Selection Criteria (Annex 8) and in accordance with MOHSA's guidelines for
Hospital Selection Procedures (Ann3x 9).
9.        Expenses:  Expenses for maintenance of the HSC will be financed from
the MOHSA budget.
10.       Amendment and Addition:  The terms of reference of the HSC may, from
time to time, whenever necessary, be amended by the project director, and the
