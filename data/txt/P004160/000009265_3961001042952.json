          referral hospitals; (b) replace and add biomedical equipment\n            in hospitals located in large and medium-size cities and\n            distribute it more equitably; and (iii) provide equipment to\n            medium-size city hospitals designated as emergency centers\n            in the national Emergency Medical Services network. Agreed\n            criteria will be strictly applied to the selection of\n            participating hospitals and of equipment. The selection\n            criteria for hospitals will consider the hospital's\n            financial status, its location, its size, and the need for\n            and potential efficient utilization of the requested\n            equipment. The selection of the biomedical equipment will\n            take into consideration the regional distribution among the\n            eight medical regions, the relevance of equipment to medical\n            needs, training of equipment users, availability of a\n            recurrent cost budget for operating the equipment, and\n            sharing of equipment by several facilities. The financing of\n            high cost equipment will be excluded from the project,\n            partly because there is an active leasing market for this\n            type of equipment, and partly because some procedures are\n            not reimbursable by the national insurance and will\n            therefore not be accessible to the poor."}, "docdt": "1991-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
