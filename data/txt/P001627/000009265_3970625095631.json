(INDEBANK) institutional capabilities, assist in\n            diversification of its role in productive sectors, and\n            expand its activities in the agricultural sector--the\n            mainstay of Malawi's economy; and (ii) fulfill the need\n            for term financing for agricultural estates to increase\n            productivity thereby improving the potential for\n            diversification. The proposed project consists of (i) a\n            US$3.0 million credit line to finance viable industrial,\n            commercial, transport and tourism investments; (ii) a US$4.5\n            million agricultural credit component to provide investment\n            credit to agricultural estates; and (iii) US$0.3 million in\n            technical assistance to INDEBANK to strengthen its\n            capability to promote, appraise and monitor agricultural projects."}, "docdt": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
