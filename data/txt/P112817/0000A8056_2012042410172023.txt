                         The PRSC program seeks to contribute to the Government’s medium-term development objectives as set out in its Interim Development Planning Framework (IDPF) and
                         the Growth Strategy aimed at addressing medium to long term issues to achieve sustained and shared growth as it seeks to mitigate the impact of the global financial
                         crisis on its growth prospects. The program will contribute to (i) strengthening the business environment and promoting economic diversification leading to broad-
                         based and employment-generating growth, (ii) enhancing the effectiveness of public expenditures and sharpening the strategic focus of the budget; and (iii) improving
                         service delivery in key sectors.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit and Grant (PRSC 2) was approved by the World Bank's Board of directors on March 30, 2010 after the completion of eight prior
                         actions. The operation became effective on July 22, 2010 after the conditions of effectiveness were met, including the issuance of a satisfactory legal opinion.

                         The operation achieved slow but continued progress towards the development objectives. Progress was slowed down by the fiscal crisis which the Government faced in 2010/11, and
                         by institutional and capacity weaknesses. In particular, delays in drafting enabling legislation and their approval by Parliament contributed to slow progress on some fronts.

                         A key element for promoting private sector led growth is macroeconomic stability. Government faced a fiscal crisis in 2010/11 after a sudden collapse of SACU transfers, its main
                         source of revenue. The operation, in conjunction with the IMF, supported Government in launching a fiscal consolidation program aimed at ensuring macroeconomic and fiscal
                         stability and an improvement in expenditure composition. The Government made good progress in 2010/11 in bringing down both the wage bill and the non-SACU deficit, but could
                         not sustain this in 2011/12 with increases in both these indicators. However it remains committed to fiscal consolidation, and this is reflected in the budget for 2012/13. The budget

                         projects strict controls on recurrent spending over the medium term, especially on the wage bill, despite an expected increase in SACU transfers. Capital spending has been
                         protected. The on-going fiscal consolidation along with the other reforms aimed at improving the business environment and delivery of essential services should help improve
                         Lesotho's long term growth and development prospects.

                         The operation supported reforms to regulatory burden involved in starting and operating a business. This was identified as a key constraint to private sector growth. The prior action
                         for PRSC 2 was bringing under the One Stop Business Facilitation Center (OBFC), the functions of approval of trading and manufacturing licenses, import and export issuances,
                         residency visas and work permits to facilitate administrative processes. The Government further aimed at bringing down the number of days required to start a business through
                         incorporation of Companies' registration into the OBFC. The legal basis for this reform was provided by the Companies' Bill that received Parliamentary approval in March 2011.
                         However delays in drafting the Bill meant that implementation could not happen within the time frame of the operation as originally envisaged. This consequently was taken up under
                         the next PRSC operation. The operation also sought to address another constraint, access to land. Government constructed a total of 9500sqm of new factory space to
                         accommodate potential investors. This was however less than the anticipated 20,000 sq m because of the fiscal crisis.

                         Progress was made on improving public financial management side. The Government undertook steps to strengthen the medium term expenditure framework. In 2011/12, Budget
                         Framework papers produced by all ministries were used to prepare a consolidated National Budget Framework for Cabinet, summarizing the competing priorities and bids of various
                         ministries. This was used to decide on budget ceilings for each ministry. Ministry BFPs produced for the 2011/12 budget were made available to the public on the Government's
                         website to improve transparency. The implementation of a new Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS) across Government was another achievement that
                         should help improve budget execution and monitoring. Government was also able to incrementally reduce the backlog in producing audited public accounts with the auditing of
                         accounts for 2007/08 and 2008/09 and their submission to Parliament, though this happened after the close of the operation. The passage of the Public Financial Management and
                         Accountability (PFMA) Act (passed in March 2011) is also expected to significantly improve management processes. Apart from other benefits, the Act provides for the establishment
                         of the procurement tribunal, key to improving procurement outcomes. However delays in the passage of the Act meant that its implementation had to be taken up in the next
                         operation.

                         In terms of improving service delivery, there was commendable progress in improving capacity within Government to provide anti-retroviral treatment (ART) to people affected with
                         HIV/AIDS. The percentage of eligible people receiving treatment going up significantly, despite a change in the eligibility criteria which increased the number of eligible people.
                         Similarly gains were made in the education sector, particularly in improving access to secondary education, with the implementation of the education sector strategic plan that was
                         supported by the operation. Progress in rolling out a support program for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) supported by the operation was initially slow reflecting the
                         Government's desire to get the registration process done well to improve targeting. After its completion in April 2011, however, Government increased the number of OVCs being
                         reached through the child support grant significantly to more than 27,000 in 2011 compared to 1500 in 2010.

                         At the time of closing of the operation, the Government met 6 of the 11 results indicators. These related to the areas of statistics, publishing MTEF documentation, roll out of IFMIS,
                         improving access to secondary education and increasing capacity to deliver ART, and fiscal consolidation. Another indicator related to the auditing of public accounts for 2007/08 and
                         2008/09 and their submission to Parliament was achieved after the close of the operation.

                         The remaining four were partially achieved after the closure of the operation. These were the incorporation of companies' registration into the OBFC, creation of enhanced industrial
                         infrastructure, roll-out of the OVC support program, and establishment of the procurement tribunal. The reasons for this have been elaborated above. Apart from the indicator relating

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The operation achieved slow but continued progress towards the development objectives. Progress was slowed down by the fiscal crisis which the Government faced in 2010/11, and
                         by institutional and capacity weaknesses. In particular, delays in drafting enabling legislation and their approval by Parliament contributed to slow progress on some fronts.
