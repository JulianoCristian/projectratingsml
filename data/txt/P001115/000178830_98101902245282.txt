REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of US$43 million to
help finance a project for road construction, pavement strengthening and
technical assistance. The loan would have a term of 20 years including five
years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast, Report No. 296 -
IVC "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of the Ivory Coast", April 11,
1974 which is based on the findings of an economic mission in April of 1973,
confirmed the country's favorable growth prospects and its creditworthiness.
It concluded also that the Government's development efforts required and
deserved continued external support. While recent developments in export
and import prices have led to substantial quantitative changes in the balance
of payments estimates from those made in the report, our revised calculations
still support these conclusions. Annex I contains basic country data.
3.        Throughout the 1960's the Ivory Coast's economic growth was rapid.
GDP grew at an annual rate of 7.5 percent in real terms and in 1972 per
capita income reached US$340. Although this growth rate could not be fully
sustained in the early 1970's because of deteriorating terms of trade and
adverse weather conditions, growth in 1971-74 still averaged 6 percent a
year, in real terms. Factors contributing to rapid growth were the Govern-
ment's liberal and pragmatic economic policies which have made the country
attractive to foreign investors, the availability of ample land and timber
resources, the existence of a large pool of labor including immigrants from
sahelian countries and, during the late sixties, rising commodity export
prices. Recognizing the country's vulnerability in its dependence on three
export commodities (cocoa, coffee and wood constitute about 75 percent of
total exports while exports are some 32 percent of GDP), the Government began
after 1965 to diversify agriculture by introducing or expanding oil palm,
coconut, pineapple, rice, rubber, cotton and sugar cultivation and by
placing more emphasis on other economic sectors such as industry, mining
and tourism. Although the full benefits of these diversification efforts
are still some years off, the prospects are that the Ivory Coast will grad-
ually become less dependent on its traditional exports.



4.        The Government's development objectives include, in addition to
broadening the production base, the extension of economic infrastructure in
such fields as transport and power, the improvement of urban facilities,
regional diversification, the development of secondary industrial centers,
the development of education and the Ivorianization of the economy. These
objectives correspond well to the needs and the possibilities of the country.
Past and ongoing development has laid a solid foundation for further growth.
5.        The Government's awareness of social problems is reflected in the
current (1971-1975) Plan's emphasis on the income effects of development,
regional balance and education. Thus, to reduce inequalities, recent salary
raises have been graded down from 26 percent for the lowest to 5 percent for
the higher paid workers. A number of projects, for instance, cocoa, rice,
oil palm, rubber, sugar and cotton are designed to narrow the gap between
urban and rural incomes and to reduce regional income disparities. In the
same vein, over the past five years, the Government has increased producer
prices for cocoa by 120 percent, for coffee by 60 percent and for cotton by
35 percent.
6.        However, the next Plan (1976-80) will need to focus more sharply
still on problems of urbanization, prospects for employment in both rural
and urban areas and income distribution. To assist the Government in these
directions a special Bank employment mission, which included ILO staff,
visited the Ivory Coast. The mission's report "Ivory Coast: Special
Report on Employment" (Report No. 279 IVC) was issued in July 1974, after
detailed discussions with the Government. The mission identified the em-
ployment problem as one of growing imbalances: while projected demand
for labor appears to be matched by manpower supply (including immigration)
shortages in rural areas and a surplus in urban labor markets will develop
in the absence of corrective action. The mission also singled out a number
of issues for further study, including the costs and benefits of creating
a better economic and social infrastructure in secondary centers combined
with a certain degree of industrialization and suggested changes in educa-
tional and training systems.
7.        To assist the Government in the orientation of its industrial
policy, a Bank mission, including a UNIDO staff member, prepared the report,
"Current Status and Prospects of the Industrial Sector in the Ivory Coast"
(Report No. 553-IVC), which was issued in February 1975 after detailed dis-
cussions with the Government. The mission calculated that local raw material
processing and import substitution industries contributed equally to the im-
pressive sectoral growth in real terms of 15 percent per year during the
1960-1973 period. As pursuing import substitution much further may be costly
to the economy, the mission supported the recent change in Government policy
encouraging industrial exports and recommended modification of the Investment
Code accordingly. The mission agreed with the Government that Ivorianization
in terms of capital and labor of the, at present, largely foreign-owned manu-
facturing sector should have high priority. Future growth prospects were
evaluated favorably by the mission, but with a lasting world-wide economic
slow-down a downward adjustment is probably required here.



- 3 -
8.        Our forecasts show that after the recent changes in the commodity
price structure successful implementation of the Government's development
program will more than in the past depend on the availability of foreign
funds. Until recently, most Ivorian export products have been in strong
demand. Therefore, in 1974, nigher export earnings more than compensated for
higher import outlays, resulting in a US$50 million balance of payments sur-
plus after three consecutive years of deficit. However, current Bank commodity
price forecasts point to a deterioration of the Ivory Coast's terms of trade.
In 1974, already, timber exports have dropped markedly as a direct consequence
of a slump in the European construction industry. Yet, the import bill will
continue to rise rapidly because of high inflation rates in supplier countries,
especially for investment goods, fertilizers and oil. The net oil import bill
went up from US$15 million in 1972 to US$80 million in 1974 and is expected
to reach US$85 million in 1975, an increase from 3 percent of 1972 commodity
imports to 7.5 percent in 1975. The Government has taken vigorous action to
limit the impact of higher imports on the country's balance of payments. For
instance retail prices of petroleum products, electricity, rice, sugar and
other consumer products have been increased sharply, while the producer price
for rice has been doubled to encourage local production. The country's first
sugar mill started operating in April 1975. Its production will replace
50,000 tons of sugar imports and roughly meet current domestic demand. These
and sim±lar efforts in other lines of production will permit a reduction in
the share of food imports from its present level of about 20 percent of
total commodity imports.
9.        Despite all this, the trade surplus is expected to dwindle and it
will no longer compensate for the deficit in non-factor services, as it did
in the past. Consequently, and in contrast to the 1965-1970 period when the
Ivory Coast enjoyed a resource surplus of US$35 million per year on average,
a resource gap of US$80-100 million per year in the second half of the 1970's
appears inevitable. This is equivalent to about 2.5 percent of projected GDP
or about 5.5 percent of projected exports and non-factor services in 1975.
As in the past, with interest payments, transfers of profits and workers'
remittances abroad, the factor services account will continue to be in def-
icit as well. Therefore, to maintain balance of payments equilibrium there
will have to be a substantial compensatory inflow of capital from abroad.
The Government may have to draw on the Oil Facility again as it did in 1974
for an amount of US$13.3 million. Indications of a possible discovery of
offshore oil are interesting in this respect, but too premature to be taken
into account at this stage. Central Bank reserves at the end of 1974 stood
at about US$65 million, which is equivalent to 3.5 weeks of 1974 commodity
imports.
10.       Based on past experience and assuming an adequate inflow of
capital, Ivory Coast's economy may be expected to adjust to changing world
economic conditions. Early in 1974, the Government established a task force
to advise on short term adjustments; the need for structural changes is being
given particular attention in the preparation of the new Five-Year Plan.
Good growth prospects in several sectors should facilitate the adoption of



corrective measures. For example, Ivory Coast has substantial potential to
increase electricity generation from hydro-sources. According to the Govern-
ment's program, an estimated 85 percent of Ivorian demand for electricity
would be met from hydro-electric plants by the early eighties against 40
percent at present.
11.       Structural changes will take time and imply the continuation of a
sizeable investment effort. In recent years gross investment averaged about
21 percent of GDP, and the proportion of the public sector in total invest-
ments increased from an average of 50 percent in 1965-70 to 60 percent in
1970-73. Public investments for 1975 are estimated at about US$500 million.
This amount would have to double in current prices between 1975 and 1980,
in order to maintain the investment rate necessary to achieve a growth of
GDP by 6 percent per year in real terms.
12.       Domestic public savings in the future are likely to cover a smaller
part of capital outlays than they did in the past, even assuming continued
good fiscal performance. With budget revenues already exceeding 20 percent
of GDP, future Government resources cannot reasonably be expected to increase
much faster than the economy as a whole. The Government has been quite suc-
cessful in generating budgetary savings but with rapidly increasing social
expenditures, for instance for housing and education, these savings will be
under heavy pressure. To some extent savings from public enterprises will
provide some relief to the budgetary constraint. Revenues of the Stabiliza-
tion Fund for agricultural products fluctuate with world market prices and
as it is the Government's policy to pass more of commodity export earnings to
farmers, this source of public savings is unlikely to expand. Therefore, it
will require considerable effort from the Government to continue to finance
out of local public savings after debt service--which in the past financed
40 to 50 percent of public investments--not less than 25 to 30 percent of
public investments in the next five years. Thus at least 70 percent of
.public investments will have to be financed from other sources.
13.       The chances that additional domestic private funds could be raised
to finance public investments remain low for two main reasons. First, tradi-
tionally part of the profits made by foreign investors has been transferred
abroad and this will continue in the future.   Second, non-Ivorian labor--it
is estimated that between 25 and 30 percent of the Ivory Coast population
is non-Ivorian--transferred about US$100 million to their home countries as
workers' remittances in 1974. Direct controls to limit private transfers are
not permitted within the Franc zone of which the Ivory Coast is the most im-
portant member in Africa; such controls would probably be counter-productive
as they would deter the inflow of foreign private capital, and they would
represent a serious blow to the Ivory Coast's much poorer neighbors, especially
Upper Volta, which receives about 40 percent of immigrant workers' remittances.
But these transfers, of course, mean a substantial drain on domestic savings
for the Ivory Coast.    Steps by the Government to raise interest rates, establish
a local stock market and place more emphasis on Ivorianization of the economy
are not likely to alter these flows substantially in the medium term. Govern-
ment bonds issued with a tax free return of 7 to 10 percent have had only
moderate success so far.



- 5 -
14.       Absorptive capacity in terms of projects to be financed in the
public sector is substantial. The inflow of foreign loan capital into the
public sector in 1974 was about US$215 million; in 1975 it may need to be as
high as US$325 million. Assuming that 40 to 50 percent of future foreign
capital requirements will continue to be provided by international organiza-
tions and foreign governments and the rest by more expensive sources like
suppliers credit and private banks, the debt service ratio would rise from
its rather low level of 6.6 percent in 1973 to around 15 percent in the
early 1980's.   We consider this level to be manageable.   If the capital
required cannot be obtained on appropriate terms, the investment program
would have to be cut back and overall growth would drop below 6 percent.
The projected average contribution of net public savings to the financing
of public investments (paragraph 12), will in many cases be less than the
local cost component of projects. Therefore foreign donors should be will-
ing to finance not only the foreign cost component of projects but also some
local costs in those projects where the foreign exchange component is low.
15.       A basic economic mission, which visited the country in June/July
1975, will evaluate the country's long-term prospects in the context of the
draft 1976 to 1980 Development Plan, and will undertake a thorough reexamina-
tion of our projections, the underlying assumptions and especially the conse-
quences for Ivory Coast's external borrowing and debt service. However,
there is little reason to believe that there will be much, if any, reduction
in the higher level of capital requirements now foreseen. The terms of
borrowing therefore become a more important consideration. If, for instance,
all supplementary needs for future capital were to be met on terms offered in
the Eurodollar market--to which the Ivory Coast has access--the debt service
ratio could substantially exceed the level of 15 percent projected for the
1980's. To keep debt service within manageable limits and to enable the
Government to implement its development policy, it is desirable that foreign
capital be made available on as concessionary terms as possible, including
long repayment-and grace periods. In view of the still low debt service
ratio, the good future growth potential of the economy and the expected
increase in export earnings, the Ivory Coast remains creditworthy for substan-
tial additional borrowing from the Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
16.       Since 1968 the Bank's lending to the Ivory Coast has expanded rapidly
and now includes nineteen loans totalling US$197.1 million and an IDA credit
of US$7.5 million. Half of these twenty operations have been for agriculture
for the development of cotton, cocoa, rubber, oil palm and coconut production
and the construction of two oil mills; there were four road projects; the
remaining six loans were for education, telecommunications, the Abidjan
sewerage and drainage system and tourism development. IFC's small partici-
pation in the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement Industriel (US$204,000) was
increased in 1974 by a 50 percent stock dividend. Annex II contains a summary



statement of Bank Group operations and uctes on the execution of ongoing
projects, with particular reference to those which are encountering problems
in execution and giving rise to delays in disburseme..ts.
17.       The agricultural sector, including forestry, remains the principal
foreign exchange earner and domestic employer. It continues to provide close
to 90 percent of exports, to employ a majority of the population, to help
stabilize an increasingly mobile population, and to bring development to
remote areas of the country.   Our principal efforts are, therefore, in this
sector. We have appraised early this year, with the Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE), a rice project in the forest zone of the Ivory
Coast; certain fiscal and marketing issues, identified during appraisal, are
presently being discussed with the Government. To assist the Government's
policy towards balanced regional growth and income distribution, we are
considering further oil palm, coconut and rubber projects in the Southwest of
the Ivory Coast and a livestock development project and a followup project
to the Cotton Areas Rural Development Project in the North.
18.       In order to strengthen the country's major transport axes and link
the agricultural areas to the nation's urban centers and ports, we have placed
considerable emphasis on transport and have become the principal lender for
road construction and maintenance. We have thus far financed four road projects
totalling US$51.3 million. The first project was completed in December 1974
with final costs within appraised estimates.    Mter an initial delay caused
by alignment modification and subsequent poor work organization, the second
project is expected to be completed by September of this year. The third
and fourth highway projects incurred substantial cost overruns which the
Government is expected to cover. Execution of these projects is proceeding
satisfactorily. The Bank was also closely associated, as executing agency,
with the 1969 UNDP Transport Survey of the Ivory Coast; we will again act
as executing agency for updating of this survey which will serve as a basis
for determining future priority among transport investments. While the Bank
is expected to continue to play a major role in the transport sector, we hope
that in the future its financing will increasingly be shared with other sources
of funds. A feeder road project is also under preparation. The Government
has requested our assistance in financing the improvement of a section of the
Abidjan-Ouagadougou rail line; other sections of the rail line are being financed
by FED and EIB.
19.       The education system of the Ivory Coast has not been adequate to
support its rapid economic development and the shortage of skilled manpower
has required employment of high-cost foreign technical and managerial personnel.
The Bank is closely associated with the Government's efforts to modernize its
education system, principally at the secondary and vocational levels. The
Bank's Second Education Project, which was signed in June 1975, is basically
an interim operation, aimed at complementing the First Education Project and
preparing a third one.



20.       The Bank is cooperating with the Government to cope with rapid
urbanization in the Ivory Coast. A study of housing and urban transport
needs in Abidjan is being financed with Bank funds; it is hoped that an urban
development project based thereon can be appraised later this year. In
January 1975, the Bank extended a loan for sewerage and drainage development
which will cover the first phase of a ten-year Government program to improve
sanitation in Abidjan. We also hope to appraise later this year a water
supply project for secondary centers.
21.       In view of the predominance of foreign ownership and management
in the private sector of the Ivorian economy, the Government is placing high
priority on strengthening local entrepreneurship. In support of this policy
we appraised last fall two projects, which carry forward the special effort
inaugurated in Western Africa through a 1971 Bank Study of African private
enterprise. A loan for the promotion of small scale enterprises is being
presented to the Executive Directors together with the present project, while
a loan financing medium scale industrial development will be negotiated in
the near future. In line with the Government's regional development policies
substantial investments are foreseen in later years for industry and power
in the southwestern region, and the Government is likely to request the Bank
Group's assistance for these.
22.       Of the total external public debt outstanding at the end of 1973,
30 percent was provided by governments, 20 percent by international organi-
zations (of which 60 percent by the Bank Group), and 30 percent by private
banks and bond issues, while 20 percent came in the form of suDpliers' credits.
The capital not supplied by international organizations came mainly from four
countries, France (35 percent), USA (20 percent), Italy (15 percent), and
Germany (8 percent). France and the European Communities remain the principal
source of development assistance in grant form, accounting for about 10 percent
of the flow of foreign assistance to the public sector.
23.       Bank Group lending to the Ivory Coast, which has averaged about
US$25 million per year in the seven years since we began operating in the
Ivory Coast, is expected to increase substantially over the next several years.
The Bank Group's share of the Ivory Coast's external debt, which is now
approximately 12 percent (including undisbursed), is likely to increase in
the next five-year period to about 18 percent. The Bank Group's share of debt
service is at present 3.4 percent and is expected to go up to about 7 percent
by 1980.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
24.       The transport system consists of more than 36,000 km of roads,
about 640 km of railroads, two major seaports, about 400 km of navigable
lagoons, two international airports, and fourteen airfields for domestic



services. The system is focussed on Abidjan, the capital city, princi-
pal airport, and commercial center. The high rate of economic growth
has manifested itself in increased transport demand. Additional transport
demand has resulted from the growing dependence of Upper Volta and MIali on
imports and exports transported through the Ivory Coast.
25.       Roads are the principal mode of domestic transport, carrying
about 70 percent of inter-urban freight and passenter traffic. The road
network has developed rapidly since the mid-forties, growing from some
10,000 kIn to over 36,000 km of which 1,700 km are paved. In spite of
widely dispersed economic activity and a scattered population, the highway
network serves adequately most of the country. However, development of the
hinterland of San Pedro requires new roads, and diversification and growth
of the agricultural sector demand improvement and expansion of the network
of secondary and feeder roads. Furthermore, the rapid growth in economic
activity was accompanied by a substantial traffic increase, which accelerated
the deterioration of the network; this necessitates rehabilitation and up-
grading of the country's basic road network which is the backbone of the
transport system.
26.       The railway system provides the main link with the North and
Upper Volta. It is part of the Regie du Chemin de Fer Abidjan-Niger (RAN),
which is owned jointly by the Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The Ivory Coast
system consists of about 640 km, of which about 627 km form part of the
1,145 km single-track line Abidjan-Ouagadougou. RAN is implementing a large
ten-year (1970-1980) investment program with the help of European development
institutions. The program includes provision for modernization and some
doubling of track, purchase of rolling stock and telecommunications equipment,
and station improvements; implementation of this program is expected to
contribute to improved quality of service. The Bank Group has been asked
to participate in this renovation effort, and a pre-appraisal mission vf sited
the Ivory Coast in June. The Government wants to construct a new railway
line in connection with the prospective development of the Bangolo iron ore
deposits; under this scheme a 350 to 400 km rail line would be constructed
between the mining area in the Man region and a mineral port to be constructed
near the Port of San Pedro.
27.       External commerce is carried out principally through the port of
Abidjan which is now showing signs of congestion with an average berth occu-
pancy rate of 90 percent. This situation is expected to be relieved by the
construction of additional berths, now under way, and the increasing utili-
zation.of the Port of San Pedro, which should capture most of the traffic
to and from the southwestern part of the country, once the construction of
the hinterland roads is completed. The air service network includes two
international airports at Abidjan and Yamoussoukro, and 14 domestic airfields
capable of handling DC-3-type aircraft. International traffic through
Abidjan has increased at a rate of about 12 percent per annum since 1960.



-9-
28.       The Governnent's transport development plan for the next few years
follows essentially the recommendations of the 1969 UNDP Transport Survey.
For the road sector the plan includes strengthening and paving of road
links between Abidjan and the north and west of the country (particularly
the access roads to the new port of San Pedro), improvement in general road
maintenance, improvement and expansion of the network of secondary and
feeder roads, improvement of the direct route north to Mali and Upper Volta,
and construction of a coastal road link to Ghana. Feeder road development
will be an important part of the next plan, and a study to determine national
requirements would be included in the project. In order to reassess pri-
orities for future investments, an updating of the 1969 UNDP Transport Survey
has become necessary; the Government has agreed to do this (Section 4.05 of
the Loan Agreement).
29.       The transport sector absorbs a large part of public finance.   Over
the last four years, the Government has spent an average of about US$60 mil-
lion per annum on transport (US$30 million per annum on roads). Investments
for the coming years are expected to rise substantially because of delays
in the execution of past projects, spiralling costs and the Government's
desire to close the gaps in its transport system. Out of the twenty-eight
transport projects originally proposed for execution for the period 1971-80,
fifteen should be implemented or underway by the end of this year. This
investment program was essentially sound. In translating it into individual
projects, however, several uneconomic variations (usually involving increased
scope or higher design standards) have been introduced. The Ministry of
Public Works and Transport (MPWT) lacks the proper instruments to make proposals
for investment priorities and to coordinate investments between the different
transport modes, particularly between road and rail. In order to meet this
need, the 1969 UNDP Transport Survey recommended some institutional improvements,
which would be implemented in the proposed project by the creation of a
Planning and Research Unit in the MPWT (para. 38). The Government has agreed
that it would seek the Bank's comments on its proposed long-range transport
investment plans and the annual updating of the Five-Year Plan (Section 4.04
of the Loan Agreement).
30.       Transport regulations, which concern mainly road transport because
of its predominance in the country, are established by MPWT through its Road
Transport Division (RTD). For-hire passenger traffic has flourished over
the past decade primarily because of the dynamic management of a strong union
and the absence of undue governmental interference. For-hire trucking has
fared less well, especially owner-operators and small firms; these latter
suffer a high bankruptcy rate because of excess capacity, inability to break
into the lucrative oil and timber transport (traditionally handled almost
exclusively by large foreign-owned firms), and a lack of managerial and
accounting talent. The Government attempted to solve these problems by
instituting entry and tariff regulations aimed respectively at adjusting
supply nore closely to demand, and at ensuring that trucking charges at



- 10 -
least covered actual costs.   But entry regulations failed to achieve the
intended results, due principally to the difficulties in estimating total
demand and therefore the number of additional licenses to grant, and also
in ensuring that new entries are employed where the increase in demand
occurs. Implementation of transport price regulations has been even less
successful. The Government established a freight office at Abidjan to
police the enforcement of these regulations and to establish efficient
communications between truckers and their customers. However, while the
role of the Abidjan office as a forwarding agent was generally welcomed, its
function of policing tariffs drew adverse reaction from both merchants and
truckers who forced the Government to suspend their compulsory use of the
office. In the wake of the failure of entry and tariff regulations, the
Government has decided to cease enforcing them, and is instead taking
positive steps to organize and use the freight offices as forwarding agents
and providers of information on road transport. The Government is also
studying alternative sources of financing for truckers which will make them
more Independent of foreign merchants who presently make the loans for some
truck purchases, and then dictate tariffs to these owners. Also, as part
of its Ivorianization policy, the Government is promoting increased par-
ticipation of local truckers in the lucrative timber and oil transport. The
response from foreign firms has been good, and many have either sold their
transport business to Ivorians, or formed joint ventures with them; the
level of local participation in timber and oil transport increased from
about 30 percent of total volume in January 1973 to some 70 percent in June
1974. Analysis of transport regulations and other improvements designed
to rationalize the transportation system will be one of the principal tasks
to be undertaken by the proposed Planning and Research Unit.
31.       The 1969 UNDP Transport Survey had stressed the necessity of reor-
ganizing maintenance operations, of training DPW personnel, and of increasing
budgetary appropriations for maintenance. These recommendations are now
being implemented under the 1972 Third Highway Project. Substantial-progress
has been made in the reorganization of maintenance, and budgetary outlays
for maintenance funds have increased steadily by about 7 percent per annum.
Ilowever, the shortage of qualified local personnel in DPW at the upper and
middle levels still remains a crucial issue. To help relieve this situation,
the proposed project would include overseas fellowships for DPW engineers
and technicians and technical assistance services for a comprehensive study
of manpower needs and of curriculum improvements required in the local civil
engineering school.
32.       A road user taxation study financed under the 1971 Second Highway
Loan has just been completed by the consultants SETEC. The consultants
have recommended a new system aimed at recovering the total costs of road
administration and maintenance, as well as that part of construction costs
not financed by foreign funds. The Government has agreed to exchange views
with the Bank on the recommendations made in the Study on a program of action
on road-user taxes and then to implement such a program (Section 4.07 of the
Loan Agreement).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The proposed project is an outgrowth of studies carried out under
the First Highway Project (Loan 542-IVC) and under the second phase of the
1969 UNDP Transport Survey prepared by the French consultants SETEC. The
project was appraised by a Bank mission in April/May, 1974. The mission's
report entitled "Appraisal of a Fifth Highway Project" (No. 750a-IVC, dated
July 31, 1975) is being distributed separately. Annex III contains a loan
and project summary. Negotiations for the loan took place from June 16
to 20, 1975, and the Ivorian delegation was headed by Mr. Naka (Director,
Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement) and included Messrs. Kouadio, Bamba
(Ministry of Public Works and Transport), Angora (Ministry of Plan), Preel
(Ministry of Finances) and Sako (Ivory Coast Embassy in Washington).
Project Description
34.       The proposed project consists of:
(a) continuation of the pavement strengthening program
(about 200 km) initiated under the Third Highway
Project;
(b) realignment of a 27 km section of the Azaguie-Adzope
road and construction of the Anyama-Agboville road
(about 45 km);
(c) purchase of equipment for traffic counting, vehicle
weight control, and pavement surveys;
(d) technical assistance to establish a Planning and
Research Unit in NPWT and train local staff, including
overseas fellowships for DPW engineers and technicians
to help improve the curriculum of the local civil
engineering school; and to reorganize the Public Works
Laboratory; and
(e) feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the
road Mankono-Tenigboue (66 km) and for about 300 km of
other secondary roads to be identified, and a study of
feeder roads requirements.
Pavement Strengthening
35.       The pavement strengthening program of the major trunk roads
linking Abidjan with the economically active regions in the north and
west, was begun under the Third Highway Project (Loan 837-IVC) as recom-
mended by the 1969 UNDP Transport Survey. These roads, built some twelve



- 12 -
to eighteen years ago with light pavements, have been deteriorating quite
rapidly under increasing traffic and have become very expensive to main-
tain. Under the proposed project two road sections totalling some 200 km
would be strengthened, Pakobo-Yamoussoukro on the north/south axis, and
N'Douci-Gagnoa, on the road from Abidjan to the west of the country.
Anyama-Agboville and Azaguie-Adzope Roads
36.       The present link from Abidjan to the northeast region near the
Ghanaian border is a paved road through Adzope, of which the 70-km section
Agnibilekrou-Abengourou was built to two-lane standards under the First
Highway Project. The Azaguie-Adzope section of this road is a badly
deteriorated one-lane road with tortuous curves. Consultants' studies
indicate that the most economic route from Abidjan to Abengourou should
also serve Agboville, a city of increasing economic importance which is
presently connected to the capital by a poorly aligned earth road to
Azaguie (42 km) and by a one-lane paved road (7.5 km) to the junction with
Abidjan-Adzope. The proposed project would provide for the construction
of a more direct alignment from Anyama to Agboville (45 km), reducing the
present distance by about 20 km, and of a 27 km section starting 8 km from
Anyama towards Adzope. Feasibility studies and detailed engineering for
the above works were prepared under the First Highway Project (Loan 542-
IVC); consultants have reviewed the recommended alignment and design
standards with a view to reducing costs. Bids would be called only after
approval by the Bank of the consultants' recommendations (Paragraph A.2.
of Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement).
Equipment Purchase
37.       The Engineering Division of DPW is now establishing systematic
procedures to collect and analyze information necessary to monitor devel-
opments in the use and condition of the road network. This information
will provide a rational basis for preparing annual maintenance and better-
ment programs and will also be useful to the Planning and Research Unit.
To help the Engineering Division in this task, the proposed project would
provide for the purchase of traffic counters, mobile scales, and equipment
needed for studying traffic and pavement conditions.
Technical Assistance
38.       One of the principal institution-building recommendations of the
1969 UNDP Transport Survey was for the establishment of a Planning and
Research Unit, reporting to the Minister of Public Works and Transport, to
make proposals for investment priorities and coordinate the different
transport modes. The proposed project would provide for the services of
two technical assistance experts over a three-year period to establish
such a unit and to train local staff. In order to improve the training
at the local civil engineering school with a view to reducing the acute



- 13 -
shortage of technical skills, the proposed project would also provide
technical assistance to study (i) the total manpower requirements for
civil engineers and other skilled workers in both the private and public
construction sectors; (ii) the measures needed to produce the required
numbers of such personnel; (iii) the school's present and future capacity
to meet these requirements; and (iv) the improvements needed in the
curriculum to ensure achieving the desired quality of instruction. To
help alleviate the present shortage of high and middle-level local personnel
in DPW, the proposed project would also provide, beginning in 1976, overseas
fellowships for training highway engineers and technicians. Nominations
for fellowships would be agreed with the Bank. In order to cope with
increasing demand for the services of the Public Works Laboratory of the
MPWT from both the private and the public sector, the reorganization of
the LBTP has become necessary; a study for this purpose would be included
in the proJect.
Pre-Investment Studies
39.       The Mankono-Tenigboue road (66 km) was identified during the
appraisal of the Cotton Areas Rural Development Project in April/May 1974.
With the flooding of several road sections resulting from the construction
of the Kossou Dam, it has become the major road link between the cotton
ginneries of the central-west region at Mlankono and the railroad station
of Bouake. Consulting services would be provided under the project for
engineering studies for this important road. The project would also provide
for economic and feasibility studies and detailed engineering of about 300 km
of secondary roads to be determined upon the completion of the updating of
the 1969 UNDP Transport Survey. In addition, a study for a country-wide
feeder road program would be conducted under the proposed project. Feeder
road construction would be programmed so as to facilitate participation of
the emerging domestic contracting industry (Section 3.03 of the Loan Agree-
ment).
Project Cost and Financing
40.       Total project costs are estimated at US$69 million including about
US$13.4 million in taxes. The foreign exchange component would be about
US$43 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$43 million would cover the
estimated foreign exchange cost representing about 62 percent of total costs
or 77 percent of costs net of taxes. The following table shows the capital
cost breakdown:

Total net of taxes               12,600      43,000        55,600
Execution and Procurement
41.       MPWT would be responsible for the execution of the project and
would be assisted by consultants for construction supervision, technical
assistance, feasibility and detailed engineering studies. Procurement
would follow international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. Bidding documents for civil works have been prepared
by DPW assisted by consultants SETEC and OTAII/OTF.   The works have been
divided into two packages, one for pavement strengthening and one for new
construction; each package is further divided into separate contracts for
supply of crushed stone and for construction. Bids would be permitted for
any individual portion or any combination of such portions. Bids for the
construction of the Anyama-Agboville and Azaguie-Adzope roads would be called
only after review of design standards recommended bv SETEC. Equipment for
traffic counting, vehicle weight control, and pavement surveys would be
procured, with due regard to the need for standardization. Suppliers would
be required to train local personnel in the use of the new types of equip-
ment.
Disbursement
42.       The Bank loan would be disbursed to cover 60 percent of expendi-
tures for construction contracts, 80 percent of expenditures of consulting
services and technical assistance, and 100 percent of the foreign costs of
fellowships and equipment.

Benefits
43.       Economic growth in the Ivory Coast over the past decade has been
impressive despite extreme fluctuations in world market prices for primary
commodities. To sustain this growth, the Government has embarked on a program
of economic diversification, especially in the agricultural sector. The
success of this effort will depend largely on the availability of reliable
and efficient transport. -The Government also aims at achieving a more even
distribution of income among various sectors of the population by spreading
the fruits of development well beyond Abidjan. Benefits from the road improve-
ment and construction works will primarily result in cheaper, safer and more
reliable transport and in savings in road maintenance costs. On the basis of
conservative traffic projections, and not including benefits other than
savings on transport and maintenance costs, the economic return on the pavement
strengthening program is estimated at 15 percent with returns for individual
sections ranging between 13 and 21 percent. The proposed realignment and
construction of the Anyama-Agboville road and of the section of the Azaguie-
Adzope road would yield economic returns of about 22 and 28 percent respec-
tively. The overall economic return of the project roads is estimated at 19
percent. For the purpose of sensitivity analysis, cost increases of 20 per-
cent coupled with reduction in benefits of 15 percent yield returns of about
10 and 17 percent respectively for the pavement strengthening program and the
road realignment and construction.
44.       The technical assistance aspects of the project are also crucial to
the transport sector in the Ivory Coast.    They will provide a start towards
a major and much needed institution-building effort in sectoral management.
It will ensure the eventual capability of the MPWT to evaluate and coordinate
transport investment proposals and to formulate a firm sectoral policy. The
pre-investment studies are essentially geared to the preparation of secondary
and feeder roads projects for the development of provinces and rural areas.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Ivory Coast
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
46.       The draft Loan Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern of
recent agreements used for highway projects. Features of the Loan Agreement
of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 28, 29, 32, 36 and 39 of
this report.

C. Projects in Execution
Ln. No. 611   612,   First Oil Palm and Coconut Projects; Three loans for a
_13_ 759 and 7_00    total of US /17.1 million of June 13, 1969; Cl)sing Date:
December 31, 1975. Second Oil Palm and Coconut Projects:
Two loans for a total of USV7.0 million of June 227 1971;
Closing Dates: June 30, 1975 and November 30, 1977.
These projects are being implemented satisfactorily, and disbursement
is proceeding normally. The oil mills financed in these projects processed
about 220,000 tons of fruits in 197a. The planting programs are proceeding
well.
Ln. No. 667          First Education Project: TJS1ll.O million Loan of April 27,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Implementation of this project was slow, especially in the initial
years. This resulted from (i) delays in the decision making process, espe-
cially for the selection and appointment of consulting architects; (ii) the
complexity of consultations between international and bilateral donors on the
specifications of the Instructional Television Production Center; and (iii)
uncertainties about the project description which culminated in its renegoti-
ation and amendment in 1971. The amendment consisted of (a) the reduction
from 11 to 10 of the number of educational institutions to be constructed
under the project; (b) the deletion of Bank financing of capitalized interest
except for the amount already disbursed; and (c) reallocation of the proceeds
of the loan to take account of modified architectural standards. The Executive
Directors were notified of these changes. (See Memorandum to the Executive
Directors R71-2h6 of November 3, 1971). Since then, the project implementation
has substantially improved, construction work for all project schools has been
completed and the Thools will be in operation by October 1975, except the
technology institute at Abidjan and the ITV complex at Bouake, which will be
completed respectively in January and June 1976. The Closing Date has been
extended to June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 667-2        Supplemenyary Financing for the First Education Project:
US$2.2 million Loan of January 17, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
At appraisal of the First Education Project, the US dollar was
worth 247 CFA francs. When the project cost was recalculated in October
1971, the exchange rate was US$1 = CFAF 277. Since then the dollar dropped
g/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of the projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

substantially to about 225 CFA francs in January 1975. In the fall of 197i
the Government requested supplementary financing to offset the increase in
the project's dollar cost due to currency realignments.
Ln. No. 686          Cocoa Project: US$7.5 million Loan of June 5, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
The Cocoa Loan has been amended to reduce the number of hectares to
be rehabilitated. Difficulties arose in supervising large numbers of farmer;
who used project inputs to treat non-project cocoa. The Government agreed to
substantially reduce the size of the rehabilitation program. (See Memorandum
to the Executive Directors R73-74 of April 13, 1973.) The project is proceed-
ing satisfactorily except for administrative problems which have delayed the
submission of requests for reimbursement. However, administration of this
and the second project (Ln. 1069-IVC) have been combined and an estimated
3,200 ha of cocoa plantings will be transferred from the first to the second
project. Savings of US$2.2 million resulting from the amendment (R73-74)
and the merging of the two projects were cancelled at the date of signature
of the second project. The first project is therefore considered to be com-
pleted. Disbursements will be completed by September 1975.
Ln. No. 761          Second Highway Project: US$20.5 million Loan of June 22,
1971; Closing Date: November 30, 1975.
A section of the Yabayo-Man Road will be rerouted due to present un-
certainties concerning the construction of a dam in the area of the road.
(See Memorandum to the Executive Directors R73-170 of July 6, 1973.) Con-
struction on the Man-Duekoue and Bouake-Katiola Roads is making good progres:.
At the Government's request, Bank financing of the detailed engineering of the
Katiola-Ferkessedougou Road was abandoned: the road will be constructed under
Government financing. The Government has requested to use the funds thus re-
leased to finance a second phase of an urban study in Abidjan.
Ln. No. 837          Third Highway Project: US$17.5 million Loan of June 23,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
The road maintenance and betterment program has started. A second
call for bids for the reinforcement works had to be made, however, due to
inadequate submissions. The project incurred substantial cost overruns due
to currency realignments and abnormal price escalation.
Cr. No. 406         Fourth Highway Project: US/7.5 million Credit of June
283 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Construction of the N'zi bridge has started. Bids on the Yabayo-
Gagnoa Road have been received and contracts awarded. This project is experi-
encing cost overruns similar to those of the third project.

Ln. No. 938         Rubber Plantation Loan:   US48.4 million Loan of October
23, 1973; Closing Date: December 31L 1980.
Land clearing and planting have started. Project implementation has
been hampered by the poor performance by the management team. Large cost
overruns, mainly due to mismanagement and also to accelerated inflation, are
apparent, but accurate estimate is difficult at this time because present
accounting is poor. Discussions between co-lenders and Government were held
at the end of January in Paris and Abidjan, on the problem of management.
The co-lenders have notified the Borrower that technical and financial manage-
ment of the project, including management arrangements with Michelin, would
have to be drastically changed as a condition of further financing of the
project.
Ln. No. 981         Telecommunications Project:   US$25.0 million Loan of
May 3, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Consultants have been selected and bidding documents are being pre-
pared.

Ln. No. 1069        Second Cocoa Project:   US$20.0 million Loan of January
10, 197T; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
This Loan is not yet effective.
Ln. No. 1076        Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Project: US=9.0 million
Loan of January 17, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
This Loan is not yet effective.
Ln. No. 1077        Cotton Areas Rural Development Project:   US031.0 million
Loan of January 17, 1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1952.
Implementation of the project has begun satisfactorily. Land clearing
has begun and it is expected that 4000 ha will be cleared before the end of the
year. The Blacksmith Training Program has started and CIDT, the project exe-
cuting agency is preparing loan requests to BNDA to finance blacksmith's kits.
Bids for the construction of staff housing are being prepared.
Ln. No. 1124        Tourism Development Project:   US$9.7 million Loan of
June 11, 1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1980.
This Loan is not yet effective.
Ln. No. 1125        Second Education Project:   US$5.0 million Loan of June
11, 1975;  Closing Date:  June 30, 1979.
This Loan is not yet effective.
This Loan became effective on July 29, 1975.
