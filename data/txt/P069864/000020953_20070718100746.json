satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned included: 1) A steady commitment to analytical work\n            in PFM enabled the Bank to respond quickly when the\n            political environment was ready; 2) Strategic and managerial\n            leadership of the reform process needs the full-time\n            commitment of a senior person; 3) Where there is likely to\n            be bureaucratic resistance, a strategy for change management\n            is essential for moving forward; 4) Experienced consultants\n            are important, but they still need to be actively managed to\n            assure consistency with project goals and approaches; 5)\n            Stakeholders need to feel that they have a stake in the\n            changes and tools to engage effectively; and 6) Without a\n            clear sense of how to use performance information in the\n            budget process, program budgeting will remain a mechanical exercise."}, "docdt": "2007-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
