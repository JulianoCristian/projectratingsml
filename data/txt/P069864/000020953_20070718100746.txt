1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

        As part of its anticorruption program, in 1999 the Government requested the
World Bank's support in a diagnostic survey and in the initial formulation of an action
program. Reforming public finance management was identified as one of the top
priorities. The 2001 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) stated that, in order to strengthen
governance and institutions, Bank financial support would be provided for technical
assistance and information technology for public finance management. A Development
Policy Review (DPR, FY03) noted the unsustainability of the fiscal situation and
concluded that in the area of public expenditure management, among the most important
challenges over the next few years would be to give institutional authority to the multi-
year fiscal framework as a basis for budgeting and to ensure that program budgeting is
well understood and fully adopted by all involved. The DPR was adopted by the
Government's Economic Council as part of its policy framework.

        Slovakia was facing important fiscal challenges following the invitation to join
the European Union in May 2004. The general government deficit excluding privatization
revenues, and including called guarantees and bank restructuring costs amounted to 7.7
and 6.7 percent of GDP in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The preliminary estimate for
2002 was 4.7 percent. These fiscal deficits were well above the Maastricht criteria, and
required a substantial fiscal consolidation. Furthermore, there had been a significant
increase in the gross public debt in the previous five years (by 16 percentage points), and
with a high proportion of it (40 percent) in foreign currency, the economy was especially
vulnerable to external shocks.

        In a potentially volatile international financial environment, the benefits gained by
Slovakia in previous years from prudent macroeconomic management and structural
reforms could be compromised by losses from unexpected changes in foreign interest
rates and exchange rates. The drive to meet the obligations of EU membership provided a
strong framework and impetus for much of the needed policy actions. However, the
Government's success in designing and implementing a comprehensive reform program
depended fundamentally on its capacity to strengthen the institutional framework in
which those policies were to be conceived, decided upon, and executed. And within this
institutional framework, public finance management structures would be key.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

        The development objective was to strengthen Slovakia's institutional capacity to
use public resources more effectively, efficiently, and transparently, in line with
Government priorities.

        The key performance indicators from the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
focused on effective mechanisms in place for linking strategic and sectoral policy making
to the budget process:

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

          PDO and indicators were not revised during the implementation of the Project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

          The reform of the public finance system had a number of benefits. Systems
developed under the Project were to improve resource planning, budgeting and public
expenditure management and control, and the capacity to properly formulate, prioritize
and execute fiscal policies. It would also improve the political accountability and
effectiveness of the use of public resources. It would enable more efficient and
professional debt and liquidity management.

          The PAD indicated that the target population of the Project was the public as a
whole. The specific interventions under this project affected all line ministries and public
sector agencies funded by the central budget. However, the most direct beneficiaries of
assistance for improving the budget process were the five pilot ministries ­ Labor,
Education, Transport, Interior, and Agriculture ­ in addition to the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) and the State Treasury.

1.5 Original Components

        The Project was to assist the Government in improving budgetary and financial
management of Government operations:

(1)     The first Project component, to improve the budget process (US$2.59 million),
was to help the Government improve allocative and operational efficiency of public
expenditures by: (i) establishing a framework to link policy decisions to budgeting and to
make strategic policy choices through prioritization of programs within an available
resource envelope at a sectoral and national level; (ii) increasing the predictability of
funding so that ministries can plan ahead and programs can be sustained; (iii) providing
line ministries and other budget chapters with increased autonomy and greater incentives
for efficient and effective use of funds; (iv) generating a seamless budget process in
which the regular evaluation of outcomes and results would feed into future budgetary
choices; (v) creating capacity in the MOF for regular expenditure reviews; and (vi)
analyzing and preparing a policy menu for appropriate alternative financing arrangements
to support a more decentralized system of public service delivery.

(2)     The second component, to strengthen macroeconomic capacity in the MOF
(US$0.56 million), was to help establish the Financial Policy Institute (FPI) as the core of
macro analysis in the MOF and the Government as a whole, which required major
technical and organizational improvements including: (i) developing close institutional
links between the FPI and the Tax Policy and Budget Sections of the MOF, as well as
with the State Treasury and the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) in macroeconomic
forecasting; (ii) assigning a central role to macroeconomic forecasts of the FPI as the sole
basis for establishing the resource envelope for the budget process; and (iii) improving
the quality of the medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts of the FPI, as well as
the economic reports accompanying the budget, both by improving the technical quality
of the models used, as well as by publishing its methodology to allow public debate and
scrutiny.

(3)     The third component, to support debt management and treasury (US$1.08
million), was to assist the Government in: (i) the development of an institutional structure
in which the roles and accountability of the MOF and the Debt and Liquidity
Management Agency (DLMA) are clearly defined, with an appropriate distinction
between the formulation of the debt management strategy by the MOF and the execution
of that strategy by an operationally independent agency; (ii) ensuring the efficient,
transparent, and professional management of public debt and financial assets with an
appropriate balance between risks and costs; (iii) the further development of the domestic
debt market and its overall legal framework; (iv) identifying implicit and explicit
contingent liabilities and establishing a system to monitor these; (v) providing an
assessment of the quality of public accounting and designing a roadmap for the transition
to an accrual accounting system; and (vi) facilitating the introduction and system
improvement of the new treasury system.




                                              3

(4)    The fourth component, to provide support in program coordination and project
management (US$0.68 million), was to finance technical assistance to help senior
management of the MOF deal with organizational and institutional aspects of
implementing the reform program and address the management of change appropriately.
This component was also to provide inputs and advice to: (i) design effective institutional
arrangements to link policy-making at the highest levels to a reflection of choices in the
budget; (ii) design a monitoring and evaluation system for the Project; and (iii) introduce
effective project implementation arrangements to ensure that the Project can provide
timely and flexible support to the reform program.

       A project preparation facility (PPF) Advance was approved (US$0.54 million).

1.6 Revised Components

       In 2003-2006, as a result of the availability of PHARE funding, coupled with
project developments and new demands, several changes were made in the structure of
individual components:

    · Improvement of budget formulation process. The Steering Committee decided to
       establish an "IT support" subcomponent of the project, which was later
       transferred to individual EU-financed projects. The scope of consultancy in a
       subcomponent "Development of multi annual budgeting methodology" was
       minimized and incorporated into two other subcomponents ­ "Institutional
       capacity for budgeting" and "Advisor on public finance management reform
       (PFMR      Counselor)".    The   consultancy    in   the    subcomponent       "Fiscal
       decentralization" was replaced by comments to the Steering Committee on the
       draft fiscal decentralization.

    · Improvement of macroeconomic analytical and forecasting capacity of MOF.
       Tasks and activities in subcomponents "Strengthening macroeconomic analytical
       capacities of FPI," "Methodology and forecasting of tax revenues," and "Training
       and study tours" were integrated into a single subcomponent.

    · Debt management and State Treasury. Consultancy in the subcomponent
       "Advisor to MOF SR and DLMA" was reduced by 18 months, while some
       originally planned activities were integrated into the subcomponent "Advisor on
       PFMR" and in the newly created subcomponent "Advisor on public debt market
       structures development." Upon request of the State Treasury, the subcomponent
       "Advisor to the State Treasury" included also development of a system of
       permanent training for clients and management of the State Treasury and DLMA.
       A consultancy in subcomponent "Diagnosis and draft of a monitoring system for
       contingent liabilities" was reduced until relevant institutional capacity at the MOF
       was set up. Finally, the subcomponent "Diagnosis of public accounting and the
       road map to accrual system" was expanded.

    · Coordination of the reform and project management. After the contract of the
       local advisor expired, activities under the subcomponent "Advisor on


                                            4

        procurement and financial management specialist" were split among the Project
        Coordinator (supervision and system issues in procurement and financial
        management), Project Assistant (detail tasks in procurement of consultancy
        services), and Assistant/Interpreter/Translator (daily tasks in project financing and
        preparation of financial reports). The Steering Committee decided not to
        implement the subcomponent "Adviser on linking high level policy making to the
        budget process."

1.7 Other Significant Changes

        The Government requested reallocation of amounts in the categories of the loan
agreement and cancel the amount of EUR 737,207.38 on May 2, 2006. The reallocation
was made for formal reasons ­ to align client accounts recorded under the Slovak state
budget classification with the loan category classification. The cancellation was made
because of savings on the project and the strong appreciation of the Slovak koruna.

        Beginning in 1999, the Government began initiating legal and regulatory changes
that would become the foundation for public finance management reform.                 Initial
technical assistance on public finance management was provided by the Bank to the
MOF in the form of policy notes on extra-budgetary funds, fiscal decentralization and
public debt management, and a set of background papers for a Workshop on Budgeting
and Expenditure Management in Slovakia. Other relevant Bank activities included a
Country Public Procurement Assessment (CPAR, FY00), a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA, FY01), and a Development Policy Review (DPR,
FY03).

        The Government elected in September 2002 was strongly committed to the
reforms in public finance management. It was one of the principal planks of the Program
Manifesto (the policy statement of the coalition Government) which recognized the
importance of addressing public finance reform in anticipation of imminent accession to
the EU. Moreover, in a Strategy Paper approved by the full Cabinet on April 23, 2003,
the Government laid out its vision for a comprehensive approach for public finance
management reform. The strategy recognized that previous efforts to reform the public
finance system had not been completely successful due to the isolation of reforms, lack of
linkages, and an excessive focus on technical and methodological issues at the expense of
institution building. The Strategy Paper stressed the need to remedy these errors, and
proposed fundamental institutional changes. The Government indicated its wish to link
the Project directly to its political cycle (3 years) in order to demonstrate real results
before the next elections. Finally, the decision by Government to defend borrowing from
the Bank for technical assistance, despite its political unpopularity, demonstrated further
commitment and ownership.




                                              5

        The PAD noted that the Bank experience with public finance management
projects had shown that their success depended on:

    · Commitment at the highest level: both leadership by the MOF and commitment of
        the Cabinet as a whole were very important;
    · Government ownership: The Government needed to own the reforms and had to
        be fully in charge of the process;
    · Realistic timeframe: Institutional reforms required time and sustained
        implementation to produce results;
    · Realistic goals and hands-on Bank supervision;
    · Selectivity: the number of components should be limited and the Project should
        be focused on the essentials;
    · Ensuring that linkages between all components of the reform were maintained and
        were understood by all involved in the reforms; and
    · Communication and other change management techniques which were critical to
        co-opt and convince existing staff of the need for the reforms.

        The main risks to the project objectives were that reforms would continue to be
viewed as technical innovations, and thereby fail to deal with the fundamental
institutional relationships. Lack of attention to change management, including possible
resistance within the MOF bureaucracy, was one of the perceived obstacles. The Project
sought to address these by integrating the various parts of PFM and fostering formal and
informal linkages among the stakeholders.        Change managementstarting with the
MOFwas made an explicit subcomponent of the Project.

        The project preparation also acknowledged that recruitment of qualified staff
could become an issue due to the rigid rules. Consequently, changes were proposed to
the civil service legislation to make it easier to recruit high qualified and senior level
managers.

2.2 Implementation

        The Project was implemented with the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with
other ministries. It was officially started by a Project Launch Workshop organized
together with MOF on December 18, 2003. After the first two years of implementation,
early results were presented in a report on implementation of public finance management
reform (Interim Report), which was acknowledged by the Government in July 2005 and
at the workshop organized jointly by the MOF and the World Bank in September 2005.

        Implementation was strategically coordinated and carried out by the Steering
Committee organized by the MOF. The Project Coordination Group at the MOF prepared
monthly monitoring and evaluation reports for the Steering Committee (see below).

        The Project was not restructured, although some of the components were revised
as the reform proceeded ­ see discussion in the Section 1.6 Revised Components above.
The most important revisions included: an advisor on linking high-level policymaking to
the budget process was not hired, and an adviser on fiscal decentralization was not



                                             6

requested. Consultancy on program budgeting was reduced at Ministry of Interior and
discontinued at the Ministry of Health.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

       Monthly monitoring and evaluation was carried out by the Steering Committee
and the Bank; a member of the Bank team was invited to join the Committee and
participate in the discussions. Furthermore, progress was evaluated vis-à-vis detailed key
performance indicators included in the PAD.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

       Procurement issues. As the loan was to finance technical assistance and training,
all procurement was to be carried out through consultancy services, provided by
individuals or firms, or through training activities. The MOF had relatively little
experience in procurement under World Bank procedures, although some was gained
through the preparation process financed by the PPF Advance, during which about 10
international and local consultants were contracted according to Bank procurement
guidelines. The Coordination Group was the basic implementation structure for the
project, but provision was made within the Loan to finance additional procurement
expertise to assist with procurement activities under the Project. It was also agreed that
the project coordinator and project assistant would undergo appropriate training on
project management and procurement. Finally, an international consultant provided
assistance in drafting terms of references (TORs) and setting up an effective monitoring
and evaluation system to monitor performance of the many consultants that worked under
the Project.

       Safeguards. This Project was governed by OP 4.1 Environmental Assessment and
did not require an environmental assessment.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

       In a relatively short period Slovakia succeeded in establishing a transparent and
credible system of budget preparation and execution, reflecting good practices found in
other OECD countries. While significant progress was made in strengthening budget
preparation, the macroeconomic basis of the budget, the development of the Treasury and
debt management and the integration of these functions more needs to be done to deepen
the reform process. The Government has identified several additional steps needed in
order to capitalize on the modernized systems and to provide more timely and high
quality inputs for informed policy making:

    · strengthen the mechanisms for strategic policy making and link them to the
       medium-term budget framework;
    · ensure a seamless budget cycle in which each stage (budget preparation ­ budget
       execution ­ budget evaluation ­ budget preparation) feeds into the next;
    · enhance multi-annual budgeting;
    · continue implementation of state accounting and reporting reforms; and
    · improve IT support for informing policy decisions.



                                             7

        The new Government formed after June 2006 identified underdeveloped IT
systems as one of the barriers to the state administration being able to monitor and
evaluate policies and efficiency of public spending. While considerably improved from
those existing prior to 2002, more work still needs to be done to develop information
flows for informed policy making. Secondly, the link between expenditure of EU funds,
infrastructure expenditure, and general government budget needs to be strengthened. And
thirdly, program budgeting should be developed further so that its full benefits can be
realized. A project to develop M&E capacity is underway, with the goal of building a
sustainable system of training in ex-ante and ex-post program evaluations. The MOF is
now looking for other ways of developing the next steps of the reform in line with the
above recommendations.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

        In anticipation of EU membership, the Government of Slovakia recognized in
2003 that they faced important challenges to meeting the Maastricht criteria and that it
would require substantial fiscal consolidation. The Bank's 2003 DPR highlighted the
importance of sound public expenditure management and emphasized the value of
institutionalizing a multi-year fiscal framework as the basis for budgeting.        It also
encouraged the Government to strengthen program budgeting.               The newly elected
Government (September 2002) subsequently made reform of the public finance system a
policy priority. Learning from previous years of reform efforts, the Government also
determined to link more effectively the different parts of the reform program and to give
greater attention to institutional strengthening beyond the MOF.

        During project implementation, the Government continued to place strong
emphasis on strengthening public finance management. Moreover, they identified new
activities that were needed to complement the reforms underway under the project.
Information technology support for public finance was one of the most prominent areas
in which the Government initiated and sought support from other donors.

        Since the project's completion, the Government has continued to pursue PFM
reforms as part of its modernization. These include further roll-out of accrual accounting,
strengthening the links between strategy and budgeting, and developing capacity to
monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of government programs. Each of these represents
an appropriate continuation of the activities initiated under the Project.

        Although the Bank was instrumental in the design of the project and coordination
of stakeholders in the early stages of its implementation, the Bank's role was much more
limited in the latter part of project implementation. The Government was strongly
committed to its reform agenda and gained the technical capacity to manage the
consultants directly and to push for quality outputs from them.           The Government
maintained leadership of the overall reform agenda and coordinated complementary
efforts from other donors.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Component 1: Improving the Budget Process

       The objectives of this component were to improve the quality of budgeting,
linking strategic policy making to the formulation of programs, and building analytical
capacity and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms into the budget chapters. The
Project relied on a large international consultancy and several individual consultants to
conduct the ongoing technical assistance and training to the MOF and six key budget
chapters (ministries). This was probably the most ambitious and complex component of
the project, especially given the project horizon (three years). The overall rating for this
component is moderately satisfactory.

       One of the most significant achievements of the Project was the implementation
of a medium-term budget framework (MTBF) that anchored annual budget preparation
within agreed upon limits. The MOF set up the MTBF to include firm sector/ministry
ceilings for the current year and indicative ceilings for the 2nd and 3rd year of the budget
horizon. The Government gave additional weight to the ceilings by presenting them to
Parliament in the form of a Spring Bill. In so doing, the Government discouraged line
ministries from making budget requests that were out of line with the expected resource
envelope (a practice common before the project). The ceilings were not completely rigid,
because the MOF held back a small reserve amount to respond to priority expenditure
items ensuing from the Government Manifesto. (This amount was fully allocated by the
time the draft budget was presented to Parliament.)

       Although 2nd and 3rd year ceilings were formally only indicative, they achieved
the goal of providing a base line estimate of future expenditure trends. Coupled with
projected revenue estimates, the MTBF provided a means for the Government to forecast
any potential issues that would affect the Government's targets for fiscal balance. Indeed
when the ceilings were invoked in practice as an anchor on budget requests for the 2006
budget, many ministries that had not realized their significance of the outer year ceilings
in the MBTF protested. The MTBF therefore served as a hard baseline for continuing the
existing programs, and line ministries came to accept that they needed to manage
programs within those limits. Economic growth provided resources to expand or add
new programs, and these were decided each year on top of the baseline. The MTBF was
developed on a rolling three-year basis, and line ministries have been broadly in
agreement that this has provided greater predictability for planning purposes.

       A second achievement under this component was the deepening and expansion of
program budgeting. Technical assistance for program budgeting had been underway well
before the project commenced (through other donors); however, the accomplishments of
the project were increased transparency of budget expenditure, the deepening of strategic
planning within the pilot ministries, the stabilization of the program structures and their
integration into a new budgeting software module, and the Treasury's accounting for
expenditure on a programmatic basis (since 2006). Each of these is significant. Indeed,
the budget information system provides an automated means by which line ministries
display performance indicators for each of their programs and report statistics against
those indicators.


                                             9

         Where program budgeting still requires development is that it is only gradually
breaking away from being a mechanical exercise. Ministries acknowledged that the
concept is useful, but in practice it has increased demands on the budget department and
is only slowly changing the way budgeting is done. Although the pilot ministries each
developed strategic plans under the project, those plans are not wholly consistent with the
forecasted resources of the medium-term budget framework.                      In short, the political
levelthose who make the key strategic policy decisions in the ministriesis still
largely divorced from the budget process of their ministries. Those in the MOF who led
the Project recognize that the competing reforms of the Government, especially EU-
accession related pressures, meant that they did not pursue buy-in from the political level
as much as they needed to.

         Though the entire State budget is covered by programs now (since 2004),
implementation of program budgeting has also been limited by the lack of effective
institutional capacity to evaluate program performance within the line ministries. Similar
constraints exist at the central level within the MOF. Data is being generated from the
performance indicators, but a number of Government indicators seem to be focused on
internal processes. Moreover, effective systems are not yet in place to identify what is
most important and to use it in decision-making. The Government has been aware of this
shortcoming, and initiated a separate project at the end of 2006 with the EU to create a
system of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for all public spending.                                Greater
understanding of the effectiveness and efficiency of government expenditure should be

one of the outcomes of program budgeting, but the institutional processes to demand and
supply the information have yet to be fully developed.

        Underlying the achievements above were changes to the budget preparation
process, including the development of a budget calendar that specified the steps and
actions required of each party. Integrating the program budget structure within the
MBTF has been the single biggest change to the budget process. An additional outcome
was a requirement that every new policy proposal must be accompanied by a three-year
cost estimate which is reviewed by the MOF Budget department.


Component 2: Strengthening the Macroeconomic Capacity of the MOF

        The overall objective of this component was to strengthen the capacity of the FPI
to prepare high quality macroeconomic forecasts and analysis which would serve as the
basis for annual (and eventually multi-annual) budgeting. (Indicators for this component
are found in Table 2). Implementation of this component was carried out by providing
technical assistance to develop appropriate modeling tools and by strengthening the
institutional framework. The overall rating for this component is highly satisfactory.

        The capacity development at FPI has been one of the more successful components
of the project with FPI's forecasts now widely accepted as sound by all parties engaged
in budgeting. While in the past different groups competed with each other, today there is
a consensus around macro and fiscal estimates that has brought much needed stability to
budget formulation. High-quality international experts helped FPI build sound technical
models for macro-forecasting and revenue projections, and they trained staff to conduct
sensitivity analysis. The models are designed to take into account global economic
factors and to help predict the impact of external shocks on the Slovak economy. Human
resources were strengthened by attracting high quality staff and through training abroad;
the MOF identified some of the best courses available and targeted these.

        In addition to building the internal capacity, the Government created an
institutional review process to assure the quality of FPI's forecasts. Two independent
committees were formed ­ one focusing on macroeconomic estimates and the other on
tax. The FPI's economic and fiscal forecasts are published three times a year and open to
scrutiny.   Although committee members are nominated by the MOF, they include
representatives of the private sector, academia, the Central Bank, and elsewhere, and are
tasked with giving a technical assessment of FPI's projections. Given the qualifications
of the committee members, it has made it much harder for politicians in Government or
in Parliament to challenge the baseline revenue estimates or to propose higher levels of
spending. Thus, the decisions about aggregate levels of revenue and spending have been
depoliticized and transformed into a technocratic exercise. Even though there is no
budget law that forces a government to abide by this procedure, it nevertheless has
created a degree of transparency that makes it hard to ignore the FPI's recommendations.

Component 3: Debt Management and Treasury

         The overall objectives of this component were to provide assistance in
operationalizing the Debt and Liquidity Management Agency (DLMA) and the State
Treasury. (See Table 3 below for key indicators). Implementation of the Treasury
system was coordinated with an EU-PHARE funded project that supported training of
staff; the project provided support to DLMA as well. Technical assistance was provided
primarily through an international advisor and in the form of training for staff. The
overall rating for this component is highly satisfactory.

         The Agency is now well-established and has already played a key role in lowering
the Government's cost of borrowing. Previously, the Government's financial assets were
spread across many different accounts with commercial banks as each ministry and
agency managed its own bank balances separately. The agency has rationalized the
Government's cash management and reduced the costs of margins and fees paid to the
banks. It has also lowered the cost of borrowing by converting various State debts and
guarantees into Government bonds that can be floated at competitive market rates.

         Clear accountability arrangements have been put in place with a newly created
Debt Management Committee of the MOF to oversee debt policy and approve the
Government's debt strategy. The Agency and State Treasury are linked into a single
information system. DLMA enjoys a significant degree of operational independence in
implementing the Government strategy. The working relationship with MOF and the
State Treasury appear to be good overall but there may be some need for further
clarification about relative competencies. The Agency has established close working
relationships with local investors and the domestic debt market. Much of the success of



                                                    12

the Agency is attributed to strong technical advice received during the project, and
extensive training given to staff.

         The establishment of the State Treasury function was another significant
accomplishment under this component of the project. The Treasury links all revenue and
expenditure units of the central Government and has recently added regional
governments. The establishment of the Treasury has comprised development of an
information system and an extensive program of training staff in operation of the new
system. Implementation of the Treasury information system benefited substantially from
the Government's own funding commitment. Since 2006 the Treasury has also supported
program budgeting by recording expenditures on a programmatic basis. The project
provided modest initial support for the modernization of the accounting system and a
road map to accrual accounting.                Continuation of the accounting reforms was
subsequently supported by the EU.

Component 4: Reform Coordination and Project Management

          The overall objective of this component was to facilitate implementation of the
other project components and to assure effective change management across institutions.
This component is rated satisfactory.

          The project management was successfully divided into complementary roles ­
one advisor that provided the technical leadership and coordination with the political
level, a second advisor that managed the operational aspects of the project
implementation (e.g., procurement of consultants and monitoring project indicators).
This proved to be an effective way to assure that both substantive and operational issues
were given adequate attention. The high level Steering Committee provided overall
guidance and direction to the project, but in practice much of the substantive coordination
was done through the budget officials in the six pilot ministries.

          A functional review of the MOF was conducted at the inception of the project,
resulting in a significant downsizing of the Ministry and a reorganization of key functions.
This provided an important impetus for the subsequent project implementation by
establishing a reform-minded culture within the MOF.

          The project components were completed on time. The main area where additional
work is needed is in the implementation of program budgeting ­ an area which most
governments view as a long term process of continual improvement. However, project
coordination could have been more effective with greater engagement of the political
level in linking ministry strategies to budgeting.

3.3 Efficiency

        The Slovak Government implemented a remarkable breadth and depth of PFM
reform in a three-year time window. Notwithstanding the need for further strengthening
of program budgeting, the Government managed to achieve the vast majority of the
project's key performance goals.         The transformations resulting from institutional
capacity building at FPI and DLMA are particularly noteworthy. FPIs forecasts and their
integration into a credible MTBF have significantly improved the quality of fiscal
management. Similarly, DLMA's work helped the Government reduce its debt by about
6.8 percent of GDP. Moreover, the Government achieved these milestones using about
10 percent fewer resources than originally estimated for the project. The project required
only moderate Bank supervision (because of strong Government ownership) and
financing arrangements supported Government systems.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

        Rating: Satisfactory

        The level of progress that Slovakia has made in such a short time is exceptional
among countries undertaking PFM reforms. The outcomes in macroeconomic forecasting
capacity are very demonstrable and have had real impact on the annual budget
preparation process and macroeconomic stability. Likewise, the authorities have built a
highly professional and capable organization to manage the Government's financial
assets and liabilities, in parallel with what one would find in other OECD countries. The
project has been managed well, with MOF exercising strong leadership, coordinating
efforts among different line ministries, and adapting to new opportunities or needs as they
arise (shifting priority across sub-components when called for).

        Perhaps the most complex and difficult aspect of the project was the "improving
budget process" component. The implementation of an MTBF that sets the baseline
expenditure levels and guides the following year's budget preparation is a solid
achievement. However, the institutional understanding of program budgeting and the
related capacity and incentives to evaluate program performance are still lagging. These
reforms have less of a technical focus, and a much greater emphasis on changing
institutional behaviors ­ bringing together strategic planning, budgeting, and evaluation.
Under the project the Government made a considerable effort to address the institutional
dynamics within the project timeframes, but performance-based budgeting is challenging
to implement in most countries and often requires work over many years. Because of the
shortcomings in this large component within the project, it brings the project's overall
rating down from what could have been "highly satisfactory" to "satisfactory."

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

                                              15

b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

        The project resulted in significant strengthening of the FPI and its capacity to
provide reliable macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting, which have greatly improved
preparation of the budget. The DLMA was a newly created institution under the project,
and within a very short time it has built a high level of expertise. The DLMA's work has
transformed debt and liquidity management and resulted in substantial savings through
consolidation of Government accounts and guarantees. DLMA works closely with a
newly strengthened State Treasury. Users have been trained on the State Treasury system
and it is performing well.       The functional analysis and reorganization of the MOF
enabled it to be the leading agent for PFM reform, and it is well positioned to maintain
that role. Finally, there was significant improvement to the internal budgeting processes
for most of the ministries that were targeted under the program budgeting component of
the project.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)

        None

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

        Rating: Negligible to Low

        For components 2 and 3, the main risks to sustainability are linked to the
institutions' ability to retain and/or recruit highly qualified staff. Both FPI and DLMA
cited some turnover among current staff due to competitive salary pressure from the
private sector. (Employees of FPI are compensated on the same scale as other MOF
staff). The FPI reported that they have lost four staff out of 17, and that these tend to be
those with the most marketable skills.        The challenge for FPI is that there was a
substantial investment in training during the project (including expensive courses abroad),
and that this is not easily replicable. Current staff may be able to train new staff on the
model, but some erosion of capacity is possible over time without action on incentives.

        DLMA has enjoyed a substantial degree of stability in its early years, but its
Director noted that the organization has begun to lose key staff. Through a system of
bonuses, the total remuneration at DLMA ends up slightly higher than at the MOF but
still lags behind the private sector. They anticipate that recruitment of new staff may not
be as easy as in the past when the agency had the allure of a start-up. In contrast, staff
turnover at the State Treasury is not as significant a concern because the skills are more
narrowly focused on the use of the State Treasury system, and because an ongoing
program for training was established as part of the project.

        Institutional changes to the budget process, including the introduction of the
medium-term budget framework and the execution of the budget on a program basis are
likely to be maintained, as there appears to be broad support despite changes in the
Government. In contrast, ongoing efforts to develop an M&E capacity might proceed
slowly in the future because of limited demand by the political level. International


                                              16

experience has shown that when economic growth and government revenues are strong
(as is currently the case in Slovakia), there is often less interest in questions of
"efficiency" of expenditure and much greater emphasis on identifying new spending
priorities. Furthermore, the current budget staff within the ministries are not necessarily
equipped ­ either in training or institutional capacity ­ to evaluate program performance
within their ministries.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

        Rating: Highly Satisfactory

        The project built on years of prior analytical work related to public expenditure
management ­ work that was sustained despite ambivalence of previous governments
regarding reform. This body of economic and sector work (ESW) enabled the Bank to
respond promptly to the new reform-minded Government that came into power in
November 2002. Subsequent project assessment reports were done on the individual
components of the projects, led by highly experienced consultants and incorporating
lessons from neighboring transition countries. The project fit well strategically with the
country's future development needs and requirements for EU accession. It focused on
both immediate concerns for macroeconomic management and transparency of public
finances, as well as systems for ongoing accountability in the use of funds.

        The project team anticipated obstacles to institutional strengthening in the
targeted areas and adopted reasonable mitigation strategies.           In particular, they
highlighted the importance of addressing institutional linkages among major stakeholders,
change management issues, and overall project coordination. Thus, the project took
account of not only the technical changes required, but also the administrative and
institutional influences that could be obstacles to reform. Furthermore, they supported
Government ownership by using project performance and outcome indicators drafted by
the Government. On the whole, the Government found the Bank's role to be critical in
the design phase of the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision

        Rating: Satisfactory

        The Bank conducted supervision missions at six-month interval beginning in June
2004 and continuing through July 2005, the latter serving as a mid-term review mission.
The Bank also reviewed the Government's quarterly progress reports for work conducted
up through March 2006 when all activities under the Project closed. The Government
subsequently requested cancellation of the remaining loan balances. Throughout the
project implementation the Bank maintained close interaction with the authorities leading
the project, yet the Bank's role was one of a facilitator. The project objectives were fully



                                            17

owned by the Government, which took on the responsibility to supervise the consultants
and assure their coordination. At moments when the Government believed circumstances
required some activities be given greater or lesser importance than originally envisioned,
the Bank responded flexibly and supportively. Moreover, the Bank agreed to supervise
related activities that supported the Government's public finance reform agenda, even
when they were not directly financed by the Project.

        There is one area where the Bank's supervision may have been improved. As the
project was being implemented, the Bank could have anticipated future challenges in
retaining qualified staff at the FPI and DLMA and encouraged the Government to address
the issue more directly and design a suitable long-term strategy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

        Rating: Satisfactory

        One component is rated highly satisfactory and the other satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

        Rating: Highly Satisfactory

        The Government's ownership of the project components was extremely high, in
part given the urgency to meet EU accession requirements and a prevailing sense that
Slovakia had substantial catching up to do. The Steering Committee provided the formal
guidance and legal mandate for the reforms, but much of the ongoing coordination was
achieved through the informal network of budget officials in the six pilot ministries.

        The Policy Advisor to the MOF provided an important role of providing overall
substantive and strategic leadership of the reform process, reporting directly to the MOF
and the State Secretary. He was tasked with providing guidance on the content of the
reforms, alleviating institutional bottlenecks, and assuring that outputs of the consultants
were consistent with the MOF's own reform objectives. A second advisor to the project
helped manage various activities related to the project, including supervision of
consultants, identification of other technical assistance needs, harmonization of training
activities, and development of the M&E system for the project itself.

        The Government's active leadership of the project was reflected in several
dimensions. To begin with they closely evaluated the performance of the consultants
they contracted. In at least one case, they requested the consultant be replaced because
he/she was ineffective, this occurred despite the fact the consultant was appointed
through a firm as a team leader. Secondly, the Government took the initiative to identify
new opportunities and to adapt the project to new circumstances. For example, as IT
support for PFM became an increasing concern they secured support from the EU to
include this activity. In addition, they have followed up since project completion with
follow-on activities such as capacity building in M&E. Although the linkages between



                                             18

policy planning and budgeting did not strengthen as much as was hoped during the period
of the project, a substantial amount was achieved during a period when EU accession
brought many competing demands on the MOF.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies' Performance

        Rating: Highly Satisfactory

        The Project was implemented using the MOF's own systems for payment
processing and record transactions. The MOF made all payments directly to contractors
and sought Bank reimbursement after incurring expenditures. Technical assistance was
required primarily to assist with fulfilling Bank procurement procedures.          Financial
monitoring reports were prepared on a quarterly basis with no delays. The project
coordination unit prepared an interim report on project progress in January 2005 and a
final report in June 2006. There were no significant problems with project administration
or performance reporting during the project, although there was a learning curve in
determining how to pay the international consultants under the Slovak tax laws.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

        Rating: Highly Satisfactory

        Both elements of borrower performance are rated highly satisfactory


6. Lessons Learned

        A steady commitment to analytical work in PFM enabled the Bank to respond
quickly when the political environment was ready. Through several years of lukewarm
Government interest, the Bank built a foundation of analytical work that would support
the country's longer term EU aspirations. When a reform-minded Government came into
power, the Bank was positioned to respond quickly.

        Strategic and managerial leadership of the reform process needs the full-time
commitment of a senior person. Complex PFM reforms are not easily implemented by a
Steering Committee or by its Secretary given competing responsibilities. The project
succeeded in part because the Advisor to the MOF not only had the ear of the Minister
and the State Secretary, but he also had PFM reforms as his sole task. In fact, even the
process-related aspects of managing a donor-funded project (e.g., procuring consultants)
were given to another technical advisor. Therefore, this person was able to provide
intellectual leadership and liaison with the political level as necessary in order to sustain
the project and to assure consistent communication.

        Where there is likely to be bureaucratic resistance, a strategy for change
management is essential for moving forward. The Minister of Finance anticipated that
the ministry staff would not necessarily be supportive of reform. The functional review
of the MOF led to a reorganization of the functions and a reduction in the number of
positions. Changes to the civil service regulations enabled new, more qualified staff to be




                                             19

recruited at better salaries. The changes set a precedent to bring in people who would be
able to function in a more dynamic work environment.

        Experienced consultants are important, but they still need to be actively
managed to assure consistency with project goals and approaches.                  In the two
components that were most successful, the Government attributed the success to having
had consultants who had direct experience. In the program budgeting component, pilot
ministries each had good consultants to work with but the overall coordination amongst
them was sometimes lacking. The Government had relied upon a respected consulting
firm to do this management and coordination on their behalf. When it was not working,
it led to difficulties in developing consistent advice and progress. The MOF advisor then
played an important role to review the quality of the work across consultancies and to
assure that effective working relationships were being established.

        Stakeholders need to feel that they have a stake in the changes and tools to
engage effectively. Previous reform efforts had failed in part because they were MOF-
driven. During this Project, however, the pilot ministries were given international
advisors who became in a sense "their advisors." Although there were risks with this
strategy, it also had the upside potential of helping ministries buy in to the reform process.
In a sense the advisors were a bridge and an advocate for the ministries.

        Without a clear sense of how to use performance information in the budget
process, program budgeting will remain a mechanical exercise. Program budgeting is
intended to inform decisions about the effectiveness and efficiency of expenditure.
Although ministries were generating data about their activities, there was not as clear a
sense ex-ante about how that information would be used ­ i.e., what were the key policy-
related questions that data might answer. The institutional capacity to use the data should
perhaps precede the ability to generate it.

        Major benefits of the Project included strengthening the institutional mechanisms
of fiscal control and ensuring that resources are allocated according to Government
priorities, providing the means to ensure more effective implementation of those budget
allocations and greater transparency in Government's financial management. Improved
macroeconomic forecasting will allow the development of a more realistic multi-year
resource envelope, reducing the need for ad hoc adjustments to the budget and increasing
the ability of line ministries to effectively plan within a more predictable resource
allocation. These benefits are not susceptible to accurate measurement, but are likely to
be several orders of magnitude greater than the costs of the Project. Other Project
benefits include the avoidance of losses due to poor debt and asset management.

      SLOVAK REPUBLIC: PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT


                         Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR


         Public finance management (PFM) reform has been implemented by the Ministry
of Finance in cooperation with other ministries and budget chapters since 2000 by
gradual steps. Upon approval and signature of the PAD (Project Appraisal Document) in
April 2003, the Government approved the Strategy for PFM reform (Strategy), defining
the position of the reform as an integral part of broader outlined public finance reform,
which included deep structural changes in the tax system, pension system, health sector
and education. As a comprehensive reform, it sought fundamental improvement of PFM
in all its phases ­ budget preparation, budget execution and both quantitative (compliance
with the state budget) and qualitative (measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of
spending) auditing. Because some of the reform elements were interdependent, it was
necessary to find correct chronology of their implementation.

         The reform focused on the following seven key areas:

    · Implementation of modern budgeting methodology, mainly of results-oriented
         budgeting (so called program budgeting) and multi-annual budgeting;
    · Introduction of unified state accounting;
    · Settlement of old contingent liabilities and hidden debts;
    · Set-up of a methodological and institutional framework for the medium-term
         macroeconomic fiscal policy framework;
    · Budget execution through the State Treasury system;
    · Integration of system and IT support of public finance; and
    · Development of educational (training) system for public employees in public
         finance.

         The reform quickly achieved positive results ­ they were presented in the Report
on Implementation of Public Finance Management Reform (interim report),
acknowledged by the Government in July 2005 and at the workshop organized jointly by
the Ministry of Finance and the World Bank in September 2005. And although the PFM
reform involves complex technical and institutional changes, it brought a distinctly higher
quality of PFM, increased transparency, and substantially lower risk of sudden fiscal
shocks. The reform is positively assessed also in the international context, and
contributed to better evaluation of Slovakia by rating agencies.

         Despite the completion of two key areas (the first and the seventh) and substantial
progress in other key areas, the reform may not be assumed completed and needs to be
fine-tuned. The key condition to further progress now is to reform state accounting and
build a respective IT system.




                                            27

Budget Management

        Although some important achievements were made, budget management remains
far from the ideal. It takes a long time to change understanding of the budget as a tool for
achieving results and making impacts. Program budgeting has not become a tool for
budget management. A true monitoring and evaluation system is lacking, results are not
measured, and financial execution of the budget remains of primary concern.
Furthermore, because in a majority of chapters the way of budget preparation did not
change, as new responsibilities were not assumed by respective policy units, the demands
on budgetary units increased and created resistance among the staff. There are, however,
positive exceptions like the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Labor, and Ministry of
Education.

        New program budgeting or program structures bring positive results in facilitating
communication of the Government with the Parliament and the public. Nevertheless, it is
necessary to improve the quality of program structures, mainly definition of goals,
objectives and measurable indicators.

        A multi-annual budget (established by the Law on Budgetary Rules for Public
Administration) was first prepared in 2004 for 2005-2007. The budget for the first year is
binding and prepared in a detail, while budgets for the other two years are only indicative.

        In order to complement budget management reform, MOF since January 2005 has
been implementing also radical changes in accounting and reporting and asked the
Bank to supervise also this part. The uniform state accounting and reporting is to give
information in cash and ESA95 methodology enabling management to plan, organize and
control use of public funds better. The financial statements and other fiscal statements
will also be utilized by external users. New accounting and reporting standards will be in
place since January 2008.

        Another urgent issue was that of contingent liabilities and hidden debt. The
Government in 2002 recognized large hidden debts especially in the health sector,
railways, Slovak Television and radio, and regional schools. Its analysis concluded that
these resulted from soft budget constraints, unfinished litigations, and liabilities
transferred during privatization. While Government took quick steps to document and
offset existing liabilities, it also restricted issues of new state guarantees and ­ by
requiring their approval by the parliament ­ increased transparency of the whole process.
The World Bank provided supervision also to this part, as it was closely linked to the
project.

Macroeconomic Framework for Fiscal Policy

        Both goals ­ to create a system of macroeconomic forecasting for the Government
and to finalize system for developing medium-term fiscal outlook ­ were fully achieved
thanks to progress made by the Financial Policy Institute (FPI) at the Ministry of Finance.

        FPI developed its own model apparatus for macroeconomic analyses and
forecasts, interlinked to global model systems. The forecast of FPI are three times a year


                                              28

verified by Committee for macroeconomic forecasts and Committee for tax revenue
prognoses. They enjoy high credibility and serve whole public administration, as well as
basis for discussions with international organizations.

State Treasury

        The goals were almost fully achieved. The State Treasury system represents
a modern and top quality system comparable with other European systems. The State
Treasury saved the state budget large amounts of money by improving liquidity
managementidentifying and using free public funds to cover costs of immediate
deficits and costs of central debt. Furthermore, the State Treasury saves public
administration fees for payment transactions and holding accounts.

        The whole system consists of four institutions. State Treasury ensures complete
administration of revenue, expenditure and other accounts of public administration
entities, executes domestic and foreign payment transactions, aggregates prescribed
statements from individual organizations in direct communication with users of its
system. Debt and Liquidity Management Agency (DLMA) performs operations on money
and capital markets for liquidity and debt management, and manages debt on operational
level. DataCentrum operates the State Treasury information system and ensures
communication with the clients. Ministry of Finance strategically oversees the state debt
and supervises the State Treasury, consolidates accounting statements, and prepares state
final account.

System and IT Support for Public Finance Management

        It was quickly recognized that a good PFM framework would require relevant IT
support. The analysis showed that information systems, with the exception of new State
Treasury system and EU funds management system, were not coordinated or able to
cooperate. A strategy for integration and further development of IT support for PFM was
funded by PHARE funds and a new design for the IT system was approved by the MOF
Management Board on April 24, 2006.

Educational System for Public finance Sector

        Fully completed and successful. While implementing PFM reform it became
obvious that the system lacked a tool through which new state employees could be
trained or educated. As the first step, the training module was built for users of State
Treasury system. Later, the module was extended to budgeting and accounting for state
employees.
