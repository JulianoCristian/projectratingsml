(see 
Annex

Document number: 
20232-SK 
As 
part 
of 
its 
anticonuption 
program, 
in 
1999 
the Government requested 
the 
Bank’s 
support 
in 
a 
diagnostic 
survey 
and 
in 
the 
initial 
formulation 
of 
an 
action 
program. 
Reforming 
public 
finance 
management 
was 
identified 
as 
one 
of 
the 
top priorities.  The 
2001 
CAS 
states 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
governance 
and 
institutions, 
Bank 
financial 
support 
would 
be 
provided 
for 
technical 
assistance 
and 
information 
technology 
for 
public 
finance 
management. 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
January 
2001 
Initial 
technical 
assistance 
on 
public 
finance 
management 
was 
provided to 
the 
MOF 
in 
the 
form 
of 
policy 
notes 
on 
extra-budgetary 
funds, 
fiscal 
decentralization 
and 
public 
debt management 
and 
a 
set 
of 
background 
papers 
for 
a 
Workshop 
on 
Budgeting 
and 
Expenditure Management 
in 
Slovakia. 
Other 
relevant 
Bank 
activities include 
a 
country 
public 
procurement 
assessment 
(CPAR, 
FYOO) 
and 
a 
country 
financial 
accountability 
assessment 
(CFAA, 
FYO 
1) 
and 
a Development 
Policy 
Review 
(DPR, 
FY03). 
The 
DPR 
noted 
the 
current 
unsustainability 
of 
the 
fiscal 
situation 
and 
concluded 
that 
in 
the area 
of 
public 
expenditure management, 
among the most 
important 
challenges 
over 
the 
next 
few 
years are 
to 
give 
institutional 
authority 
to 
the 
multi-year fiscal 
framework 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
budgeting 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
program 
budgeting 
is 
well 
understood 
and 
fully 
adopted 
by all 
involved.  The 
DPR 
was 
adopted 
by 
the 
Government’s 
Economic 
Council 
as 
part 
of 
its 
policy 
framework. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Backpsound. 
Slovalua 
is 
a member 
of 
the OECD, 
and 
will 
be 
facing 
important 
fiscal 
challenges 
following 
its 
invitation 
to 
join 
the 
European 
Union 
in 
May 
2004. 
The 
general 
Government 
deficit 
excluding privatization 
revenues, 
and 
including 
called 
guarantees 
and 
bank 
restructuring 
costs 
amounted 
to 
7.7 
and 
6.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2000 
and 2001 respectively. 
The 
preliminary 
estimate 
for 
2002 
is 
4.7 
percent. 
These 
fiscal deficits 
are 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
Maastricht criteria, and 
will 
require 
a 
substantial 
fiscal 
consolidation. 
The 
level 
of 
the 
public 
debt 
is 
not 
yet 
a 
serious 
problem 
(the 
general Government 
gross 
debtiGDP 
ratio 
was 
around 
43 
percent 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2001, 
but 
net 
debt 
was 
only 
12.8 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
but 
there 
are 
two 
matters 
which 
require 
attention: 
the 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
gross 
public 
debt 
in 
the last 
five 
years 
(by 
16 percentage 
points) 
and 
the 
high 
level 
of 
state guarantees 
(about 
1 
1 percent 
of 
GDP 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2001). 
Moreover, 
the 
share 
of 
foreign-currency 
debt 
in 
total 
debt 
is 
relatively 
high 
(40 
percent) 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
about 
one-thrd 
of 
the 
foreign 
debt 
is 
in 
non-euro 
currencies 
exposes 
the 
debt 
portfolio 
to 
a 
considerable exchange 
risk, 
thereby increasing the 
vulnerability 
of 
the 
economy 
to 
external 
shocks. 
In 
a 
potentially 
volatile 
international 
financial 
environment, the benefits gained 
by 
Slovakia 
in 
recent 
years 
from 
prudent 
macroeconomic 
management 
and structural 
reforms 
could 
be 
compromised 
by 
losses caused 
by 
unexpected 
changes 
in 
foreign 
interest 
rates 
and 
exchange rates. 
As 
the 
DPR 
concludes, 
the 
next 
year 
offers 
a 
window 
of 
opportunity 
to 
act 
on 
these 
key 
issues. 
The 
drive 
to 
meet 
the 
obligations 
of 
EU 
membership provides a strong 
framework 
and 
impetus 
for 
much 
of 
the needed 
policy 
actions. 
However, 
the 
Government’s 
success 
in 
desiming 
and implementing 
a 
commehensive 
reform 
Dropsam 
will 
depend 
hdamentallv 
on 
its 
capacitv 
to 
strewthen 
the 
institutional 
framework 
in 
which 
those 
policies 
are conceived, 
decided upon, and 
executed. 
And 
within 
this 
-4- 
Page  9
institutional 
framework, 
public 
finance 
management 
structures 
will 
be 
key. 
Main 
Issues. 
Obtaining 
sustainable 
public 
finances 
is 
not 
simply 
a 
question 
of 
having 
the 
political 
will 
to 
impose 
expenditure 
cuts 
or 
raise 
revenues. Sustainable 
public 
finances depend 
on 
a 
system 
of 
institutions, 
including 
relationshps 
between 
the 
MOF, 
the 
line 
ministries, 
individual 
ministers, 
and 
the 
Parliament. 
Effective 
management 
of 
public 
finances 
requires 
an 
understandmg 
among policy-makers 
in 
all 
spheres 
that 
policies 
are 
constrained 
by 
the 
available 
resources 
and 
that 
there 
should be 
mechanisms 
that 
oblige policy-makers 
to 
confront 
the 
resulting 
fiscal 
choices 
openly. 
Public 
finance 
institutions 
can 
help 
this 
process 
by 
providing 
a 
framework 
in 
which 
(i) 
meaningful 
choices 
can 
be 
made; 
(ii) 
coordination 
can be 
established 
and 
consensus 
reached 
among interested 
parties; 
(iii) 
the 
selected programs can 
be 
implemented, 
and 
(iv) 
reliable 
feedback 
is 
generated 
following 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
policy 
to permit 
corrective 
action 
where 
needed. 
The 
Government recognizes 
the 
need 
to urgently 
modernize 
its 
public 
finance 
system, 
including 
budgeting, 
financial 
planning; 
cash 
and 
debt management, 
public 
accounts, payment 
system, 
public 
expenditure 
management 
and 
financial 
control, 
in 
order 
create 
an 
integrated 
system 
capable 
of 
achieving 
these 
goals. 
Government 
Strategv. 
Historically, 
the 
budgeting 
process 
in 
the 
Slovak Republic 
was 
driven 
by 
“budgetary  incrementalism,’’  whereby each spendmg agency applies 
for 
funding 
based 
on 
its 
own 
assessment 
of 
financial 
needs 
for 
existing 
personnel 
and 
facilities. 
Moreover, 
the 
focus 
of 
budgeting 
was 
on 
an 
extremely 
short 
time 
horizon 
and 
on 
a 
narrow 
state 
budget 
that excluded 
numerous extra-budgetary 
activities. 
This 
narrow 
budget 
fell 
far 
short 
of 
the standard 
definition 
of 
general 
Government 
and 
did 
not 
provide 
an 
effective 
indicator 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
public 
finances 
on 
the 
overall 
economy. 
Equally, 
budget 
preparation 
was 
not 
embedded 
in 
a 
sound and 
consistent 
macroeconomic framework. 
In 
response 
to 
this 
state 
of 
affairs, 
in 
1999 
the 
Government launched 
an 
ambitious 
program 
of 
public 
finance reforms, 
consisting 
of 
abolishing 
extra-budgetary 
funds, 
adopting 
new 
au&t 
legislation, the 
introduction 
of 
a 
medium-term 
fiscal 
outlook, 
a 
major 
overhaul 
of 
budgetary legislation, elaborating 
and 
implementing 
ESA95 
and 
GFS200 1 
methodologies 
for 
reporting 
on 
public 
finance, 
improving 
control 
of 
the 
deficits 
of 
local 
Governments 
and 
public 
funds, 
initiating 
fiscal 
decentralization, 
adopting 
a 
pilot 
scheme 
for 
program 
budgeting, 
and 
creating 
a 
legal 
framework 
for 
a 
State 
Treasury 
and 
a 
Debt 
and 
Liquidity 
Management 
Agency 
(DLMA). 
In 
many 
cases, 
however, the 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
implement 
these changes 
in 
a comprehensive 
fashion 
was 
not 
yet 
fully 
developed. 
The 
Government elected 
in 
September 2002 made 
it 
a 
top 
priority to 
revamp 
the 
reform 
effort, 
by 
redesigning 
the 
public 
finance 
management 
reforms, 
in 
order 
to 
achieve a sustainable 
fiscal 
consolidation 
and increase 
the 
transparency 
of 
the 
public 
finance 
system. 
Building 
on 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
previous 
four 
years, 
the 
program 
has 
been 
carefully 
refocused 
to 
ensure 
adequate 
linkages between the 
different 
elements 
of 
the 
program 
and 
with 
due 
attention 
to 
the 
required institutional 
strengthening, 
not 
only 
of 
the 
MOF, 
but 
also 
of 
other 
key 
organizations 
involved 
in 
the 
process. 
In 
addition, 
the 
MOF 
recognized the 
importance 
of 
ensuring 
the 
full 
support 
of 
the 
Government 
and 
the Parliament 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
sustainable 
benefits 
from 
the 
reforms. 
Therefore, 
simultaneously 
with 
the preparation 
of 
this 
Project, 
MOF 
drafted 
a Strategy 
Paper 
which 
was adopted 
by 
the 
Cabinet 
on 
April 
23,2003.

issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
Strategy Paper envisages 
setting 
up 
a 
framework 
to 
allow 
the 
Government 
to 
balance 
policy 
priorities 
against 
macroeconomic 
constraints. 
This 
would 
involve 
(ij 
bringing 
down 
the 
overall

by

The principal 
challenge 
for 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Management 
Reform 
Proiect 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
effective institutions 
are 
created

Medium 
Term Budget 
Framework 
{MTBF). 
The 
MTBF 
is 
the 
main 
instrument 
to 
link 
all 
individual 
parts 
of 
the 
public 
finance 
management 
system. 
It 
sets 
the 
macroeconomic 
parameters 
and 
resource 
framework 
for 
the 
budgeting 
process, 
it 
requires sectoral 
and 
strategic decisions 
on 
spending 
priorities, 
and 
sets 
the 
financing 
requirements 
for 
the 
Government. 
It 
also 
provides 
a benchmark 
for 
intra-year 
evaluation 
of 
fiscal 
performance that 
may 
require 
budget 
adjustment. 
A 
well 
functioning 
MTBF 
requires 
a system 
whereby 
policy 
makers 
transmit 
policy 
priorities 
and 
issues 
to 
the 
budget formulators, 
as 
well 
as 
using 
results 
of 
the 
evaluation 
of 
budget 
programs 
outcomes 
to refine priorities 
and 
strategic choices. 
In 
Slovakia, 
this 
two-way 
transmission 
does 
not 
take 
place yet. 
The 
Government 
program 
that 
states 
annual 
priorities 
is 
prepared 
by 
the 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister 
for 
Economy 
for 
cabinet 
decision. 
Whle 
this 
document drives the preparation 
of 
a 
working 
plan 
by 
the 
MOF, 
with 
input 
from 
line 
ministries, 
it 
does 
not 
take 
into 
account 
either 
realistic 
and 
costed-out sectoral 
strategies, 
or 
proper 
evaluation 
of 
past 
results, since 
it 
has 
to 
be 
prepared 
in 
less 
than 
two 
weeks. 
Rethinlung 
of 
the 
institutional

to

the 
creation

and a strong

ultimate goal

a

The 
Government 
gives 
high 
priority 
to 
strengthening the 
process 
of 
strategic 
allocation 
of 
the budget. 
The 
process 
of 
moving 
toward 
a 
multi-annual 
rolling 
budget 
withm 
a 
medium 
term 
fiscal 
framework, 
initiated 
in 
2001, 
is 
now 
being 
reviewed 
to 
ensure 
proper implementation 
throughout 
the 
Government 
within 
the 
next 
two 
years. 
The 
Act 
on 
Budgetary 
Rules 
(organic 
budget 
law> 
was 
amended 
in 
2002 
to 
include provisions 
for 
multi-annual budgeting 
to 
start 
in 
2004. 
Macro-Economic 
Framework. 
A 
credible 
MTBF 
requires that the 
medium 
term 
macroeconomic 
framework 
determines 
the 
resource envelope 
for 
a 
multi-year budgeting 
process, 
which 
will 
take 
into 
account 
existing 
and 
new 
policy 
commitments 
of 
the Government. 
It 
should 
also 
set 
the 
broad 
economic 
parameters 
for 
the 
multi-annual 
budgeting 
process. 
Furthermore, 
it 
requires 
a 
strategic 
priority 
setting 
mechanism 
linked 
to 
the 
resource envelope. 
Finally, 
it 
will 
require 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
rationale 
of 
multi-annual 
budgeting 
within 
the 
line 
ministries. 
An 
effective 
MTBF 
will 
facilitate 
the 
development 
of 
a macro-economic 
convergence 
program 
once 
Slovalua 
enters 
the 
EU. 
Since 
2000, 
the 
Financial 
Policy Institute (FPIj 
of 
the 
MOF 
has 
prepared a 
medium 
term 
macro-economic outlook, 
whch 
includes projections 
of 
aggregate 
fiscal 
revenues 
and 
expenditures. 
However, 
this 
framework currently 
has 
little 
institutional 
linkage 
to 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
budget process, and 
has 
no 
direct 
relevance 
for 
poIicy 
choices. 
The 
macro 
economic 
outlook 
is 
relatively 
ad 
hoc 
and 
is 
heavily 
reliant 
on 
external 
contributions 
from 
institutions 
such 
as 
NBS, 
Infostat, a 
commercial 
subsidiary 
of 
the 
statistics 
agency, 
and 
international 
organizations 
such 
as 
EC 
and 
IMF. 
Even 
such 
key 
variables 
as 
inflation 
are 
not 
forecasted in-house. 
In 
practice, 
the  macro 
economic 
forecasts 
of 
the 
FPI 
are 
provided 
more 
as 
a 
service for 
the 
reporting 
requirements 
of 
various 
international 
organizations. 
Given 
the 
limited 
-6- 
Page  11
capacity 
of 
the forecasting 
unit 
of 
only 
four staff 
members, 
inputs 
to 
the 
budget 
process 
are 
fairly 
low 
in 
the 
priorities 
of 
the 
unit. 
This 
is 
also 
partly 
due 
to 
the fact 
that 
the 
Budget 
Section 
treats 
these 
forecasts 
as 
one 
of 
a 
number 
produced 
inside 
and 
outside 
of 
Government, 
from 
which 
they 
choose 
the 
key 
macro 
assumptions 
underlying 
the 
budget. 
Program 
Budgeting. 
The 
Government 
has 
initiated 
program 
budgeting 
and 
has 
been 
receiving 
assistance 
in 
this 
process 
from 
the 
US 
Treasury since 2000. 
In 
2002, 
it 
was 
introduced 
in 
a 
pilot form 
for 
4 
budgetary 
chapters 
(Ministry 
of 
Education, 
Constitutional 
Court, 
Supreme 
Court, 
Slovak 
Academy 
of 
Sciences). 
For 
the 
2003 
budget, 
the 
pilot 
was 
extended 
to 
six 
more 
chapters 
(ministries) 
and 
programs 
for 
all 
budgetary 
chapters 
will 
be implemented 
in 
the 2004 
budget. 
During 
the 
pilot 
period, 
although 
programs 
have 
been 
prepared, 
budgeting 
basically 
took 
place 
outside 
the 
program 
structure. 
As 
from 
2004, 
all 
budgets 
will 
be 
prepared 
within 
the 
program 
structure. 
The 
move 
to 
program 
budgeting should 
represent 
a 
substantial 
change 
in 
the 
way 
that 
budgets 
are 
prepared, approved, managed 
and 
evaluated 
-and 
therefore a 
“cultural” 
change 
in 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
adrmnistration. 
It 
requires 
strategic 
priority 
setting 
at 
both 
the 
sectoral 
and 
national 
level. 
It 
should 
be 
seen 
as 
a complete 
process, 
whereby 
programs 
and 
priorities 
are 
set 
following 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
results 
and 
outcomes 
of 
past performance. 
To 
achieve 
more effective 
resource 
allocation, however, 
both 
policy 
makers 
and 
budget 
formulators 
need 
to 
fully 
understand 
the 
rationale 
of 
changes 
implied 
by 
the 
reforms, 
and 
incorporate 
them 
into 
their 
operational 
work. 
This 
requires 
a strong 
link 
between the 
strategic 
policy 
making 
process 
and 
the 
formulation 
of 
programs, 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
monitoring, 
evaluation 
and 
analytical 
capacities 
of 
the Budget 
Sections 
of 
the 
MOF 
and the 
line 
ministries 
to 
report 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
programs. 
Program 
budgeting 
should eventually 
become 
institutionally 
embedded 
within 
all 
budget chapters, 
and 
will 
require 
clear guidelines 
from 
the 
State 
Budget section 
of 
the 
MOF 
on 
methodological 
issues 
to 
ensure 
a 
consistent 
approach 
across 
all 
budget 
chapters. 
Multi 
Annual Budgeting. 
All 
budget 
chapters 
are 
required to 
present 
3 
year 
rolling 
budgets 
starting 
from 
2005. 
No 
technical preparation 
has 
been 
undertaken 
thus 
far 
to 
facilitate 
this 
process, 
either 
in 
the 
MOF 
or 
in 
individual 
budget 
chapters.  There 
is 
currently 
a 
lack 
of 
understanding 
of 
what multi-annual 
budgeting 
may 
involve, 
so 
the Government 
plans 
to 
gradually 
increase 
the 
level 
of 
detail 
and 
sophstication 
of 
the 
process, 
and 
envisages 
a 
comprehensive approach 
by 
2006. 
Extra-Budgetary Funds. 
Considerable progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
the 
elimination 
of 
extra-budgetary 
funds 
and 
the 
integration 
of their 
finances 
into 
the 
state 
budget. 
All 
extra-budgetary 
funds 
except 
the 
Agricultural Market 
Regulation 
Fund 
(transformed 
into 
an 
Agency), 
the 
Nuclear 
Fund 
(which 
accumulates revenues for 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants), 
and 
the State 
Fund 
for 
Housing 
Development, 
have 
now 
been abolished 
and 
their 
finances 
integrated 
into 
the 
budget. 
Social Insurance 
System. 
There remains the 
issue 
of 
the 
social 
insurance system 
(Social 
Insurance 
Company, 
Health 
Insurance Companies 
and 
the 
National 
Labor 
Office) 
which 
have 
their 
own 
boards 
and 
budgets. 
These 
budgets were 
tightened 
in 
recent 
years, 
but 
further 
improvement towards standardization 
of 
their 
budget 
procedures 
is 
still 
required, 
since 
these 
institutions 
are 
responsible 
for 
a 
significant 
proportion 
of 
public 
expenditures (over 
14 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001). 
Given 
that ex-post 
deficits 
in 
these 
funds 
will 
be funded 
automatically, they 
pose 
a 
significant 
risk 
to 
the 
sustainability 
of 
public 
finances. 
Contingent 
Liabilities. 
Other 
problematic 
liabilities 
include 
implicit 
and 
explicit 
guarantees 
issued 
by 
different 
public 
enterprises 
in 
the 
past, 
the 
total 
extent 
of 
which 
is 
not 
fully 
documented. 
In 
adhtion, 
no 
analysis 
of 
risks 
has 
been carried 
out, 
and 
moreover, 
there 
appear 
to 
be 
no 
systematic procedures 
to 
monitor 
and 
report 
on 
the issue 
of 
any 
guarantees 
and 
the 
likelihood 
that 
these 
will 
be 
called. 
The 
inclusion 
of 
such procedures 
and 
analysis 
of 
risks 
as 
part 
of 
the 
wider 
budget process 
would allow 
the 
-7- 
Page  12
Government 
to 
ensure that 
it 
was 
able 
to 
make proper 
provision 
for 
these guarantees, 
and 
thus 
ensure 
the 
stability 
and 
sustainability 
of 
other 
spending 
programs. 
Expenditure 
Review. 
The 
current 
Government 
has 
launched ambitious 
reforms 
in 
many 
areas. 
With 
the 
new 
focus 
on 
linking 
policy 
priorities to 
spending 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
form 
an 
picture 
of 
how 
expenditure 
is 
currently 
distributed 
and 
how 
this 
matches 
up 
with 
current 
policy 
priorities 
and 
international 
practices. 
In 
2000, 
an 
Audit 
of 
“Operations 
and 
Financing 
of 
Central 
Bodies 
of 
The 
State 
Administration 
and 
their 
Dependent Organizations” 
was 
carried 
and 
the 
DPR 
reviewed 
expenditures 
in 
agriculture, 
social 
protection, 
health 
and 
education. 
To 
extend 
this 
work, the 
Government 
has 
requested 
a 
joint 
IMFmorld 
Bank 
mission 
to 
visit 
Bratislava 
in 
May, 
2003 
to 
compare 
Slovalua’s 
expenditure 
patterns 
to 
other 
comparable 
countries and 
propose short 
term 
options 
for 
expenditure 
rationalization. 
Currently, 
the 
MOF 
has 
limited 
capacity 
to 
manage 
regular expenditure reviews. 
This 
needs 
to 
be 
addressed 
if 
the 
Ministry 
is 
to 
engage 
in 
effective 
dialogue 
with 
line 
ministries 
on 
spending 
priorities. 
Treasury. 
A 
Treasury Project 
was 
initiated 
within 
the 
MOF 
in 
2000. 
However, 
until 
late 
2002 
little 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
setting 
up 
a 
new 
Treasury. 
The 
Law 
setting 
up 
the 
legal framework 
for 
a 
new 
State 
Treasury 
and 
a 
separate 
DLMA 
was 
only 
passed 
in 
June 
2002. 
In 
October 2002 
a 
contract 
was 
awarded 
for 
the 
installation 
of 
IT 
systems 
and 
in 
December 
EU 
PHARE 
began 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
for 
the 
Treasury. 
Pilot 
testing 
of 
treasury 
sub-systems 
began 
in 
February 
2003 
and 
a 
deadline 
has 
been 
set 
to 
transfer 
responsibility 
for 
executing budgetary 
payments 
from 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Slovakia 
(NBS) 
to 
the 
Treasury 
by 
1 January 2004. 
The 
Treasury 
is 
also 
to 
carry 
out 
cash 
management 
and 
will 
include 
comprehensive Government 
accounting and 
financial information 
systems. 
While 
the 
Government 
gives 
highest 
priority 
to 
establishmg 
the 
State 
Treasury 
withn 
this 
ambitious 
time-frame 
and 
has 
allocated 
US$25 million 
of 
its 
own 
resources 
to 
the 
Project, appointed 
a 
new 
General 
Director 
from 
January 
1,2003, and 
a 
fairly 
large 
technical 
assistance 
program 
is 
underway, 
it 
is 
obviously not 
easy 
to 
simultaneously 
manage 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
new institution 
and 
the 
installation 
of 
complex 
new 
hardware 
and 
software 
system 
to 
run 
the 
Treasury. 
In 
addition, 
the 
implications 
for 
stakeholders 
and 
clients 
of 
the treasury 
are 
still 
to 
be 
addressed. 
Preliminary indications 
suggest 
that 
line 
ministries 
have 
displayed 
concerns 
at 
the 
implications 
of 
the 
Treasury 
system 
for 
the management 
of 
their 
finances. 
Within 
the 
Treasury, the process 
of 
setting 
up 
the 
internal 
structures 
has 
only just 
begun, 
and 
indeed 
many 
of 
the 
functions 
of 
its 
organizational 
units 
have 
not 
been 
fully 
specified. 
Although 
recently 
the 
four 
key 
managerial 
positions 
were 
filled, 
enabling 
the 
process 
of 
creating 
job 
descriptions and 
recruitment 
of 
many 
subordinate 
staff 
to 
begin, 
as 
of 
May 
1, 
2003, 
still 
only 
some 
35 
out of 
150 
anticipated positions 
have 
been 
hired.  Moreover, 
the 
payment system 
function 
requires 
the 
recruitment 
of 
specialized 
staff 
before the 
Treasury 
begns 
operations, 
as 
mentioned 
above scheduled 
for 
January 2004. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
technical 
assistance 
and 
on-the-job 
training 
under 
the 
EU 
PHARE 
Project 
is 
planned 
to 
be 
completed 
during 
2003, 
and 
there 
still 
remains uncertainty 
regarding 
the 
possibility 
of 
an 
extension 
of 
this 
assistance. 
Even 
if 
follow 
up 
assistance can 
be 
arranged, 
only 
initial 
training 
of 
the approximately 
5000 
staff 
in 
the 
spending 
units 
is 
currently 
arranged 
for. 
More 
advanced 
IT 
training 
and 
other 
support 
for 
system maintenance 
and improvement 
-based 
on 
feedback 
from 
system users- 
will 
be 
required 
once 
the 
system becomes 
operational. 
Debt and 
Liquidity 
Management. 
The 
quality 
of 
debt management 
has 
been 
a 
concern to 
the 
government. 
Historically 
it 
was seen 
as 
an 
adrmnistrative 
function, 
with 
inadequate 
attention 
given 
to 
i) 
the 
balance 
of 
risks, 
(e.g. 
currency 
risk, 
refinancing 
risk, 
maturity 
structure 
etc); 
ii) 
the 
need 
for 
an 
integrated 
strategic 
approach 
to 
the 
management 
of 
both 
contingent 
as 
well 
as 
actual 
liabilities 
and; 
iii) 
the 
need 
for 
debt 
managers 
to 
play 
a 
pro-active 
role 
in 
the development 
of 
a 
deeper 
and 
more 
efficient 
domestic government 
bond 
market, 
so 
as 
to 
facilitate 
a 
more 
balanced 
cost/risk 
debt strategy 
as 
well 
as 
-a- 
Page  13
contributing 
to 
the 
broader 
development 
of 
the 
Slovak 
financial 
markets. 
In 
regard 
to 
the 
latter point, 
communication between 
investors, 
the 
government 
as 
debt issuer and 
market 
intermediaries 
has 
been 
described 
as 
inadequate. 
It 
is 
felt 
that 
this 
lack 
of 
professionalism 
resulted 
in 
a 
less 
than 
optimal 
use 
of 
the 
financial 
assets 
acquired 
as 
the 
result 
of 
the 
privatization 
process. 
The 
newly 
created 
DLMA 
is 
intended to 
address 
these 
weaknesses. 
Whle 
the 
MOF 
ultimately 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
State Debt, 
the 
operationally 
independent 
DLMA 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
day-to-day 
debt management 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
strategic 
guidelines 
issued 
by 
the 
MOF. 
The 
DLMA 
will 
need 
to 
have 
clearly 
defined  institutional 
links 
with 
the 
MOF 
and 
report 
periodically 
to 
the management 
of 
the 
Ministry 
on 
the current 
position 
of 
the debt 
relative 
to 
agreed 
targets 
or 
guidelines and 
on 
any 
significant 
developments 
and 
policy 
issues 
related 
to 
the 
management 
of 
the 
debt. 
However, none 
of 
these 
relationships yet 
has 
a 
legal 
basis, 
since 
the 
Treasury 
Law 
which 
sets 
up 
the 
DLMA 
does 
not 
address 
any 
of 
these 
issues. 
The 
Government 
recognizes 
that 
the 
final 
institutional 
set 
up 
needs 
to 
appropriately 
balance 
accountability 
arrangements 
with 
the 
need 
for 
operational 
independence 
of 
the 
DLMA. 
Most 
recently, a 
decision 
was 
taken 
to retain 
the 
status 
of 
the 
DLMA 
as 
a 
separate 
budgetary organization. 
Work 
has 
now 
begun 
to 
develop the 
required accountability 
arrangements 
and 
the 
&vision 
of 
responsibilities 
between 
the 
MOF, 
the 
State 
Treasury 
and 
the 
DLMA. 
A 
first 
draft 
of 
the 
required 
amendments 
to 
the 
legal 
and regulatory framework 
for 
the 
new 
system 
is 
expected 
by 
the 
end 
of 
June, 
2003. 
A 
first 
draft 
of 
the 
initial 
debt 
strategy 
is 
foreseen 
by 
September. 
The 
legal 
changes 
and 
the 
debt 
strategy 
will 
then 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Government 
for 
approval later 
in 
the 
year. 
The 
DLMA 
will 
assume 
its 
new 
responsibilities 
only 
after 
the 
new 
arrangements 
are 
in 
place, 
expected 
by 
January 
1,2004. 
In 
due 
course, 
the 
DLMA 
will 
also 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
the 
management 
and 
adrmnistration 
of 
contingent 
liabilities. 
For 
the 
above arrangements 
to 
be 
successful, 
a 
number 
of 
organizational 
developments 
are 
required 
as 
well. 
The 
DLMA 
needs 
to 
be able 
to 
build 
up 
its 
expertise 
rapidly 
through 
the 
recruitment 
of 
talented 
staff, 
which 
will 
be 
facilitated 
by 
the 
decision 
not 
to 
merge the 
DLMA 
with 
the State Treasury, 
and 
the 
good 
use 
of 
external 
advice, 
training 
opportunities 
and international networking. 
The 
new 
Director 
for 
the 
DLMA 
has 
been appointed 
since January 
1,2003, 
and 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
recruiting key 
staff 
of 
the 
DLMA. 
A 
few 
of 
the 
operational staff, 
currently 
working 
in 
the 
MOF, 
are 
expected 
to 
be transferred 
by 
mid 
year. 
The 
MOF 
has 
to 
ensure adequate 
expertise 
to 
be able 
to 
provide 
professional 
and 
objective 
advice 
on 
debt 
policy 
and 
strategy 
as 
and 
when 
required 
by 
the 
Minister. 
This 
function 
requires 
experience 
and 
judgment, 
rather 
than 
number 
of 
people. 
Fiscal 
Decentralization. 
Legislation 
was 
adopted 
in 
200 
1 
to 
gradually 
expand 
responsibilities 
of 
municipalities 
to 
include 
social 
assistance, 
some 
roads, 
environmental 
protection, 
primary 
schools 
and 
parts 
of 
the 
health 
care 
system, 
among others. 
In 
2003 
local 
expenditures were 
still 
only 
8 
percent 
of 
total public 
spending, 
but 
this 
low 
percentage 
is 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
newly 
devolved 
responsibilities 
are 
financed 
by 
block 
grants 
(calculated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
service 
levels 
previously provided 
by 
the central 
Government) 
and 
are 
still 
included 
as 
central 
Government 
expenditures 
in 
the 
corresponding 
sector. 
In 
February 
2003, 
the 
Government 
adopted a 
strategy 
proposed 
by 
its 
specially appointed 
Plenipotentiary 
for 
Decentralization 
and 
will 
move 
forward 
aggressively 
in 
ths 
area. 
The 
strategy 
included 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 79 
district offices 
of 
the 
central 
Government, 
leaving 
only two 
levels 
of 
sub-national 
Governments; 
the 
8 
higher 
territorial 
units 
and 
some 
2991 
municipalities, 
ranging 
from 
5 
to 
450,000 
inhabitants. 
The 
final 
step 
in 
decentralization 
will 
be 
the 
devolution 
of 
fiscal 
authority 
to 
local 
Governments, 
currently 
planned 
to 
be implemented 
by 
January 
1,2005.

The 
Government plans 
to 
use 
the 
time 
until 
January 
1,2005 
to 
develop 
coherent 
financing 
arrangements 
for 
sub 
national 
Governments 
which 
match 
resources 
to 
functional 
assignments 
within 
a 
transparent 
and 
accountable 
framework. 
This 
will 
require 
analysis 
of 
the various alternatives available, 
of 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
put 
them 
into 
practice, 
and 
of 
the 
possible 
timing 
of 
implementation.  The fact 
that 
a 
major 
overhaul 
of 
the 
taxation 
regime 
is 
underway 
will 
need 
to 
be factored 
into 
this 
analysis 
as 
well. 
While 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
continue 
financing 
decentralized 
functions through 
block 
grants 
based 
on 
past 
allocations 
indefinitely, 
this 
would 
undermine 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
scrutiny 
of 
resource 
allocations 
based 
on 
evolving priorities 
and 
performance evaluation. 
Any 
new 
fiscal 
decentralization 
regime should 
reflect 
these 
principles 
as 
well. 
Management 
ofchange. 
The 
failure 
of 
the 
original 
reform 
strategy 
to 
propose a 
sufficiently 
clear 
vision 
of 
the linkages between 
budget 
preparation, expenditure management 
and 
budget execution 
is 
now 
being 
addressed 
by 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
in 
all 
of 
these 
areas, 
together 
with 
a Project 
management 
structure 
which 
puts 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
the 
integration 
of 
the 
dfferent 
components 
of 
public 
finance 
management 
into 
a coherent 
system, 
but 
requires 
adequate 
attention 
to 
effective 
management 
of 
change. 
All 
involved 
institutions 
have 
just 
been 
or 
are 
in 
the process 
of 
being 
created (State Treasury, 
the 
DLMA) 
or 
are 
planned 
to 
be 
fundamentally 
reorganized. 
Within 
the 
MOF, 
the budget section 
has 
been 
split 
into two 
parts, 
in 
order 
to 
create 
a 
new 
budgetary 
policy 
department. 
A 
new 
General 
Director 
has 
been 
appointed 
to 
oversee 
an 
expanded FPI, 
with 
explicit 
fiscal 
forecasting 
responsibilities. 
Some 
staff 
of 
the 
Debt 
Department 
of 
the 
MOF 
are 
likely to 
move to 
the 
DLMA 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
year, 
and the 
main 
task 
of 
the 
Ministry 
will 
change 
from 
operational 
debt 
management 
to 
the design 
and 
supervision 
of 
a 
new 
debt 
strategy. 
Other 
staff 
are 
being 
transferred 
from 
the 
Ministry 
to 
the 
new 
State 
Treasury 
to 
manage budget 
execution. 
And 
finally, 
some 
staff 
of 
the 
NBS 
may move 
from 
the 
NBS 
to 
the 
State 
Treasury 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year. 
All 
these 
personnel 
changes 
are 
taking 
place 
through 
the 
recruitment 
procedures, 
set 
up 
under 
new 
civil 
service 
legislation, 
requiring 
complex 
formal 
procedures 
to 
fill 
positions. 
The result 
is 
that 
there 
are 
substantial delays 
in 
setting 
up 
the 
new 
institutions 
and 
extreme 
uncertainty 
for 
existing 
personnel 
as 
to 
their 
future. 
At 
the 
very 
minimum, 
the reforms reauire 
an 
active 
and 
clear communication 
stratem 
to 
allow 
those 
in 
existing 
units 
to understand the 
forthcoming 
changes 
and 
their 
possible 
roles 
in 
a 
reform 
of 
the 
public 
finance 
svstem. 
In 
addtion, 
this 
requires 
a well-designed 
reorganization 
of 
the 
MOF, 
with 
special 
attention 
to 
close 
collaboration 
and 
communication 
of 
the various 
units. 
The 
MOF 
is 
currently preparing 
an 
Audit 
(Functional Review) 
of 
the 
Ministry 
(with 
a budget 
of 
approximately 
EURO 
500,000). 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
Audit 
is 
to 
prepare 
a fundamental 
reorganization 
of 
the 
MOF 
including 
a detailed 
change management strategy. 
The 
reorganization 
will 
permit 
a 
streamlining 
of 
functions 
and 
a 
redrafting 
and 
simplification 
of 
internal 
procedures such 
that they 
are 
consistent 
with 
a modem, dynamic 
and 
flexible 
ministry. 
The 
Audit 
is 
well 
timed 
(starting 
in 
May 
or 
June 
2003) 
to 
fit 
in 
with 
key activities 
under 
this 
Project, 
since 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Management 
Reform 
will 
very 
much 
depend 
on 
the 
successful 
modemization 
of 
the 
MOF. 
Finally, 
the 
Audit 
envisages 
support 
for 
an 
effective 
communication 
strategy, 
whch 
will 
be 
imperative 
to avoid 
a 
paralysis 
of 
the 
MOF 
during 
the 
transition 
to 
new 
structures 
and 
procedures.

the 
above 
issues, 
the 
proposed 
Project

Project Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed 
description 
and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
The 
Project 
will 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
improving 
budgetary 
and 
financial 
management 
of 
Government 
operations, 
in 
particular 
in: 
(1) 
improving 
the budget 
process 
by 
supporting 
the 
effective 
implementation 
of 
program 
budgeting 
within 
an 
overall 
medium 
term 
framework 
and 
eventually 
fully 
fledged 
multi-annual 
budgeting; 
(2) 
strengthening 
the 
macroeconomic 
analysis 
and 
forecasting capacity 
of 
the 
Ministry 
and 
tightening 
its 
link 
to 
other elements 
of 
the 
public 
finance 
system; 
(3) 
supporting 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
professional 
debt 
management 
capacity 
and 
completing 
the 
institutional 
set 
up 
of 
the 
new 
Treasury 
System 
together 
with 
provision 
of 
training 
in 
both 
these 
areas; 
and 
(4) 
supporting 
technical 
expertise 
to 
ensure 
the effective coordination 
of 
the 
overall 
reform 
effort. 
The 
first 
project 
component, 
to 
improve 
the budget 
process, 
would 
help 
the Government 
to improve 
allocative 
and operational 
efficiency of public 
expenditures 
by: 
(i) 
establishing 
a 
framework 
to 
link 
policy 
decisions 
to 
budgeting, and make 
strategic 
policy 
choices 
through prioritization 
of 
programs 
within 
an available 
resource envelope 
at 
a sectoral 
and 
national level; 
(ii) 
increasing 
the 
predictability 
of 
funding 
so 
that 
ministries 
can 
plan 
ahead 
and programs can 
be 
sustained; 
(iii) 
providing line 
ministries 
and 
other 
budget 
chapters 
with 
increased 
autonomy 
and 
greater 
incentives 
for 
efficient 
and 
effective 
use 
of 
funds; 
(iv) 
generating 
a 
seamless 
budget 
process 
in 
which 
the 
regular 
evaluation 
of 
outcomes 
and 
results 
feeds 
into 
future 
budgetary 
choices; (v) 
creating capacity 
in 
the 
MOF 
for 
regular expenditure 
reviews; 
and 
(vi) 
analyzing 
and 
preparing 
a 
policy 
menu 
for 
appropriate alternative 
financing 
arrangements 
to 
support 
a 
more 
decentralized 
system 
of 
public 
service 
delivery. 
The 
second component, 
to 
strengthen macro-economic 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOF, 
would 
help 
establish the 
FPI 
as 
the 
core 
of 
macro-analysis 
in 
the 
MOF 
and 
the 
Government 
as 
a 
whole, 
which would 
require 
major 
technical 
and 
organizational improvements 
including: 
(i) 
developing 
close 
institutional 
links 
between 
the 
FPI 
and 
the 
Tax 
Policy 
and 
Budget 
Sections 
of 
the 
MOF 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
State 
Treasury 
and 
the 
NBS 
in 
macroeconomic 
forecasting; 
(ii) 
assigning 
a 
central 
role 
to 
macroeconomic 
forecasts 
of 
the 
FPI 
as 
the sole basis 
for 
establishing 
the resource 
envelope 
for 
the 
budget 
process, 
and 
(iii) 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
medium 
term 
macroeconomic 
and 
fiscal 
forecasts 
of 
the 
FPI, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
economic 
reports accompanying the 
budget, 
both 
by 
improving 
the 
technical 
quality 
of the models 
used, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
publishing 
its 
methodology 
to allow 
public 
debate 
and 
scrutiny. 
The 
third 
component, 
to 
support debt management 
and treasury, 
would 
assist 
the Government 
in: 
(i) 
the 
development 
of 
an 
institutional 
structure 
in 
which 
the 
roles 
and 
accountability 
of 
the 
MOF 
and 
the 
- 
11 
- 
Page  16
DLMA 
are 
clearly 
defined, 
with 
an 
appropriate 
distinction 
between the 
formulation 
of 
the debt 
management strategy 
by 
the 
MOF 
and 
the 
execution 
of 
that 
strategy 
by 
an 
operationally 
independent 
agency; 
(ii) 
ensuring 
the 
efficient, 
transparent, 
and 
professional 
management 
of 
public 
debt 
and 
financial 
assets 
with 
an 
appropriate 
balance 
between 
risks 
and 
costs; 
(iii) 
the 
further 
development 
of 
the 
domestic 
debt 
market 
and 
its

Key 
policy and 
institutional reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
focus 
of 
this 
project 
is 
to 
build 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
implement 
the Government's 
comprehensive 
public 
finance 
reforms. 
As 
mentioned 
in 
the 
strategic choices 
section 
above, 
this 
is 
a 
wide-ranging 
agenda, 
requiring 
expertise 
in 
&verse 
fields. 
Other 
donors, 
in 
particular 
the 
EU, 
are 
providing 
assistance 
in 
related 
fields, 
in 
particular 
technical 
assistance 
to 
set 
up 
the 
State 
Treasury. 
The 
project currently 
envisages 
supporting 
a 
number 
of 
well-identified institutional 
reforms, 
including: 
supporting 
the 
formal 
and 
informal 
linkages 
between 
MOF, 
the 
line 
ministries, 
the 
State 
Treasury, 
the 
DLMA, 
and 
the 
NBS, 
to 
ensure a 
seamless, 
transparent, 
and robust budget 
preparation 
and 
execution 
process; 
strengthening 
the 
analytical capacity 
of 
the 
budget 
units 
and 
the 
linkages between 
policy-makmg 
and 
the 
budget 
process 
in 
MOF 
and 
six 
key 
budget 
chapters; 
strengthening the capacity 
of 
the 
FPI 
to 
produce 
high 
quality 
macro economic and 
fiscal 
analysis 
and 
forecasts; 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
policy 
menu 
for 
fiscal 
decentralization 
and 
diagnostic studies 
in 
the 
area 
of 
contingent 
liabilities 
and 
public 
accounting;

supporting 
the 
establishment 
of 
a mechanism 
at 
the heart 
of 
Government 
capable 
of 
linlung 
strategic choices 
to 
available 
resources; 
supporting the 
establishment 
and 
development 
of 
an 
operationally 
independent, 
professional 
DLMA; 
and 
assisting 
in 
building 
capacity 
to 
further 
develop 
and 
effectively 
utilize 
the 
new 
treasury 
system. 
It 
needs 
to 
be 
stressed, 
however, that 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
further 
needs 
within 
ths 
program 
will 
emerge 
and 
the 
project should be 
flexible 
enough 
to 
response 
to 
those 
needs 
appropriately. 
3. 
Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The 
reform 
of 
the 
public 
finance system 
has 
a 
number 
of 
benefits. 
Systems 
developed 
under 
the 
Project 
will 
improve 
resource 
planning, 
budgeting 
and 
public 
expenditure 
management 
and 
control 
and 
the 
capacity to 
properly 
formulate, 
prioritize 
and 
execute 
fiscal policies. 
It 
will 
also 
improve 
the 
political 
accountability 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
use 
of 
public 
resources. 
It 
will 
enable 
more efficient 
and 
professional 
debt 
and 
liquidity 
management. 
The 
target 
population 
is 
the 
public 
as 
a whole.  The specific 
interventions under 
this 
project affect 
all 
line 
ministries 
and 
public 
sector agencies 
funded 
by 
the 
central budget. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
A 
Steering Committee chaired 
by 
the 
State 
Secretary 
of 
MOF 
responsible 
for 
public 
finance reform, 
and 
including 
the 
State 
Secretary 
overseeing the 
Treasury 
project 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Directors 
of 
key 
departments 
within 
the 
MOF, 
the 
State 
Treasury 
and 
the 
DLMA 
has 
been 
set 
up 
to 
coordlnate the 
overall 
Public 
Finance 
Management 
Reform. 
In 
addition, a 
senior 
advisor 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance, 
with 
extensive 
experience 
of 
public 
sector 
reform, 
has 
been contracted 
under the 
project to provide 
intellectual 
leadershp 
and 
link 
project implementation 
to 
wider 
policy 
reform 
issues. 
He 
has 
been appointed 
as 
vice-chair 
of 
the 
Steering Committee. 
The 
Steering 
Committee 
is 
responsible 
for 
overall 
policy 
within 
the 
public 
finance 
reform 
and 
strategic 
coordination 
of 
those 
reform 
efforts 
and 
oversees 
a 
number 
of 
separate, 
technically-focused 
committees. 
It 
will 
also 
include 
a 
legislative 
review 
group 
to 
coordinate 
and 
package 
future 
legal 
changes 
required 
to 
give effect 
to institutional 
reforms. 
In 
addition, 
there 
is 
a 
Project Coordination 
Group 
to 
deal 
with 
project 
related 
matters, 
chaired 
by 
the 
State 
Secretary 
with 
the 
Advisor 
to 
the 
Minister 
as 
deputy. 
The 
secretariat 
for both 
the Steering 
Committee 
and 
the 
Project Coordination 
Group 
is 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
Project 
Coordinator 
and 
his 
team, 
who 
are 
also 
responsible 
for 
day-today 
project implementation 
and 
adrmnistration. 
Finally, 
the 
Coordination Group 
is 
responsible 
for 
ensuring that 
project 
resources 
are 
used 
in 
a 
flexible 
and effective 
way, 
in 
response 
to 
evolving 
needs. 
Flow 
of 
Funds 
The 
Bank 
would 
make 
funds 
available 
to 
the Government 
of 
Slovakia, 
according 
to 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions specified 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
The 
Project 
will 
not 
maintain 
a 
foreign 
currency Special 
Account; 
all 
disbursements 
from 
the 
Bank 
will 
be 
made 
based 
on 
reimbursement 
of 
Statement 
of 
Expenditures 
(SOEs) 
for 
eligible 
payments. 
Counterpart 
funds 
will 
not 
be 
paid 
into 
a 
separate 
bank 
account 
but 
will 
be 
accessed 
through 
the 
state 
budget 
system.

and 
reasons 
for

development agencies 
with 
the 
Government 
in 
1999, 
a 
Public 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Loan 
supporting 
sector 
was 
envisaged. 
It 
subsequently became 
clear that 
Slovakia 
has 
little 
given 
the 
large 
FDI 
inflows 
resulting 
from 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
banking 
and 
the 
privatization 
reforms. 
In 
fact, Slovakia's 
main 
constraint 
to 
effective 
public 
finance 
management 
is 
related 
to 
its 
limited 
administrative 
capacity 
in 
the 
public 
sector.  Therefore, 
it 
was 
decided that 
a 
Techcal 
Assistance 
Loan 
was 
a 
much 
more 
appropriate instrument 
to 
support 
the 
reform 
effort.

In 
general the 
Bank's 
experience 
shows 
that 
technical 
assistance 
loans 
that 
are 
not 
linked, through 
the 
CAS, 
to 
adjustment 
lending 
are 
often not 
effective 
because 
Government 
ownership 
for 
the 
policy 
and 
institutional 
changes tends 
to 
be 
weak 
without 
the 
broader 
context 
of 
a coherent 
policy 
framework 
associated 
with 
adjustment 
lending. 
However, 
this 
does 
not 
apply 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Slovalua: 
as 
mentioned 
below 
(see 
4. 
below), 
the Government 
has 
developed 
such a coherent 
policy 
framework 
on 
its 
own 
- 
as 
reflected 
in 
the adopted 
Strategy 
on 
Public 
Finance 
Reform. 
Thus, there 
is 
no 
question 
that the 
Government 
is 
strongly committed 
to 
these 
public 
finance 
management 
reforms.

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
Project activities 
build 
upon 
the 
policy 
dialogue between 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
Bank 
in 
recent 
years. 
The 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
management 
of 
the 
public 
sector, 
and 
public 
finances 
in 
particular, 
is 
underlined 
in 
the 
January 
2001 
CAS. 
In 
2000-02, 
the 
Bank 
produced 
several 
ESW 
pieces 
of 
relevance 
for 
this 
Project 
including 
(1) 
a 
consultant 
report 
on 
Extra-budgetary 
Funds 
(prepared 
by 
the 
former 
State 
Secretary 
of 
Finance 
of 
Hungary); 
(2) 
a 
consultant 
report 
on 
Public 
Debt 
Management 
Issues (prepared 
by 
the 
Head 
and 
the 
Director 
of 
research 
of 
the 
Portuguese 
Debt 
management Agency); 
(3) 
an 
assessment 
by 
Bank 
staff 
of 
the 
Government's Strategy 
for 
Building 
the Treasury 
System; 
and 
(4) 
a 
consultant 
report 
on 
budgetary 
rules 
for 
decentralization. 
The 
World 
Bank 
has 
been 
involved 
in 
the 
reform 
of 
budgetary 
institutions 
and 
in 
improving 
the 
management 
of 
public 
finances 
in 
several 
ECA 
countries 
including 
Albania, 
Latvia, 
Russia, 
Hungary, 
Kazakhstan 
and 
Ukraine. 
Specifically 
on 
public 
debt management, 
this 
Project benefits 
from 
other 
World 
Bank 
activities, 
and 
the 
recently 
completed 
paper 
comparing 
Institutional 
Arrangements 
for 
Public 
Debt 
Management 
in 
a 
number 
of 
countries 
and 
general 
Bank's 
expertise 
in 
the 
public 
finance 
management 
area. 
Bank 
experience 
with 
public 
finance

Projects 
has 
shown 
that 
their 
success 
depends 
on: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
Commitment at 
the 
hghest 
level: 
both 
leadership 
by 
the 
MOF 
and 
commitment 
of 
the 
Cabinet 
as 
a 
whole 
(see 
item 
4 
below) 
are 
very 
important; 
Government 
ownership: 
The 
Government 
needs 
to 
own 
the 
reforms 
and 
should 
be 
fully 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
process; 
Realistic time-frame: 
Institutional 
reforms require 
time 
and 
sustained 
implementation 
to 
produce 
results; 
Realistic 
goals 
and 
hands-on 
Bank 
supervision; 
Selectivity: 
the 
number 
of 
components 
must 
be 
limited 
and 
the 
Project 
must 
be 
focused 
on 
the 
essentials; 
Ensure 
that 
linkages 
between 
all 
components 
of 
the 
reform 
are 
maintained 
and 
are 
understood 
by 
all 
involved 
in 
the 
reforms; 
Communication 
and 
other 
change 
management techtuques 
are 
critical 
to 
co-opt 
and 
convince 
existing 
staff 
of 
the 
need 
for 
the reforms. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
As 
stated, 
Slovalua 
is 
strongly 
committed 
to 
the 
reforms 
in 
public 
finance 
management. 
It 
was 
one 
of 
the 
principle 
planks 
of 
the 
Program 
Manifesto (policy 
statement 
of 
the 
coalition 
Government that 
came 
into 
power 
late 
2002) 
and recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
addressing 
public 
finance 
reform 
in 
the context 
of 
imminent 
accession 
to 
the 
EU. 
Moreover, 
in 
a Strategy Paper 
approved 
by 
the 
full 
Cabinet 
on 
April 
23, 
2003, 
the 
Government 
laid 
out 
its 
vision 
for 
a comprehensive approach 
for 
public 
finance 
management 
reform. 
The 
strategy 
recognized 
that 
previous efforts 
to reform 
the 
public 
finance 
system have 
not 
been 
completely 
successful 
due 
to 
the 
isolation 
of 
reforms, 
lack 
of 
linkages and 
an 
excessive 
focus 
on 
technical 
and 
methodological 
issues 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
institution 
building. 
The 
Strategy Paper 
stresses 
the need 
to 
remedy 
these 
errors, 
and 
proposes 
fundamental 
institutional 
changes. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Government 
has 
indicated 
its 
wish 
to 
link 
the 
Project 
directly to 
its 
political 
cycle 
(3 
years) 
in 
order 
to 
demonstrate 
real 
results 
before 
the 
next 
elections. 
Finally, 
the 
willingness 
of 
the Government 
to 
defend 
borrowing 
from 
the 
Bank 
for 
technical 
assistance 
by 
arguing 
that 
it 
wants 
to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Bank 
in 
designing 
and 
coordinating 
these 
complex reforms 
demonstrates 
clear 
commitment 
and 
ownership.

Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
(i) 
Institution 
Building: 
The 
Bank 
will 
help 
strengthen 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
deal 
with 
public 
expenditure 
management 
issues 
in 
general, 
and 
budget preparation 
in 
particular, 
in 
accordance 
with 
international 
norms. 
(ii) 
Focus: 
by 
bringing 
the 
key 
elements 
of 
the 
integrated 
public 
finance 
reforms 
together 
in 
one 
Project, 
with 
clear 
implementation and coordination 
arrangements 
and performance indicators, 
the 
Government 
expects 
to 
be 
able 
to 
implement 
the 
reforms 
in 
a 
systematic 
and 
comprehensive way, 
within 
an 
agreed 
upon 
timetable. 
(iii) 
Quality Control: 
Supervision 
over the 
course 
of 
this 
Project 
will 
enable 
the 
Bank 
to 
be 
available 
as 
a 
permanent 
partner 
in 
&alogue 
on 
the reforms, 
and 
Bank 
involvement 
may 
help 
attract the 
best 
international 
consultants 
to 
the Project.

Major 
benefits 
of 
the 
Project 
include 
strengthening 
the 
institutional 
mechanisms 
of 
fiscal control 
and 
ensuring 
that 
resources 
are 
allocated 
according 
to 
Government 
priorities, 
providing 
the 
means 
to 
ensure 
effective implementation 
of 
those 
budget allocations 
and 
greater transparency 
in 
Government's 
financial 
management. 
Improved 
macro-economic 
forecasting 
would 
allow 
the development 
of 
a 
more realistic 
multi-year 
resource envelope, 
reducing 
the need 
for 
ad 
hoc 
adjustments 
to 
the budget 
and 
increasing the 
ability 
of 
line 
ministries 
to 
effectively 
plan 
within 
a 
more 
predictable 
resource 
allocation. 
These 
benefits 
are 
not 
susceptible 
to 
accurate measurement, 
but 
are 
likely to 
be 
several orders 
of 
magnitude 
greater 
than 
the 
costs 
of 
the Project.  Other 
Project 
benefits 
include 
the avoidance 
of 
losses 
due 
to 
poor 
debt 
and 
asset 
management.

discipline. 
Improved 
debt 
management 
will 
reduce 
the 
Government's 
borrowing 
costs 
and 
potential fiscal 
risks.

Technical: 
This 
Project 
only 
finances 
the technical 
assistance 
required 
for 
the 
public 
finance 
management 
reforms. 
Simultaneously, there 
is 
a 
new 
Treasury system 
being 
developed 
financed 
from 
the 
State 
Budget 
and 
EU/PHARE.

4. 
Institutional: 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
Project 
is 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
institutions 
of 
public 
finance 
management 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
institutions 
linking 
policy 
to 
budgeting. 
Some 
specific 
institutional 
constraints 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Project 
have 
been 
identified. 
Among 
the 
most 
important 
are 
the weak ownership 
of 
most 
of 
the budget 
chapters 
of 
the 
budget 
reform 
process, 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
change management strategy, 
an 
unreformed 
MOF 
operating 
with 
inappropriate functions 
and 
outdated 
procedures, 
complex 
civil 
service 
recruitment 
procedures 
which 
impede the 
rapid 
recruitment 
of 
new staff 
and 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
the Treasury 
and 
DLMA, 
a 
poorly 
defined 
legal 
framework 
which 
does 
not 
clearly 
assign 
appropriate roles 
and 
responsibilities. 
Each 
of 
these 
problems 
is 
to 
be 
addressed 
directly 
by 
the 
Project 
or 
parallel 
actions 
by 
the Government. 
The 
Budget 
reforms 
are 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
Government 
Public 
Finance 
Strategy. 
In 
order 
to 
secure 
full 
line 
ministry 
backing 
for 
the 
reforms, a 
separate 
managerial 
working 
group 
on 
the 
budget 
process 
will 
be 
created. 
In 
addition, a 
review 
of 
the 
budget 
process 
is 
envisaged. 
The 
MOF 
is 
conducting 
a wide-ranging 
Audit 
(Functional 
Review) 
of 
its 
structures 
and 
procedures. 
The 
result 
of 
this 
Audit 
will 
be a reorganization 
of 
the 
Ministry 
and rationalization 
of 
intemal 
operating 
procedures 
using 
a 
coherent change management 
and 
communications 
strategy. 
Under 
the 
Project, 
the 
MOF 
has 
committed 
itself to 
putting 
in 
place 
an 
adequate 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework 
for 
a 
separate 
DLMA, 
and 
is 
already 
receiving 
technical 
assistance 
for 
ths. 
Senior 
management 
of 
the 
MOF 
is 
also 
worlung 
closely 
with 
other 
agencies 
to 
bring 
about 
reforms 
to 
civil 
service 
legislation 
and 
recruitment 
procedures. 
Advisors 
will 
be 
provided 
on 
institutional 
and 
administrative 
reform within 
the 
MOF. 
A 
legal review 
group 
is 
proposed 
to 
work 
under the Steering Committee 
for 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Management 
Reform 
to 
coordinate the 
necessary 
changes 
to 
legislation. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
MOF 
of 
the 
Slovak 
Republic 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
A 
Steering Committee chaired 
by 
the 
State 
Secretary 
of 
MOF 
responsible 
for 
public 
finance 
reform, 
has 
been 
set 
up 
to 
coordinate the 
overall Public 
Finance Management 
Reform. 
In 
addition, a 
senior 
advisor 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance, 
with 
extensive experience 
of 
public 
sector 
reform, 
has 
been 
contracted under 
the 
Project 
to provide 
intellectual 
leadership 
and 
link 
Project 
implementation 
to 
wider 
policy 
reform 
issues. 
He 
has 
been 
appointed 
as 
vicechair 
of 
the Steering Committee. 
It 
also 
will 
include 
a 
legislative 
review 
group 
to 
coordinate 
and 
package 
legal 
changes 
required 
to 
give 
effect 
to institutional 
reforms. 
In 
addition, 
there 
is 
a Project 
Coordination Group 
to 
deal 
with 
Project related 
matters, 
chaired 
by 
the 
State 
Secretary 
with 
the 
Advisor 
to 
the 
Minister 
acting 
as 
his 
deputy. 
The 
secretariat 
for 
both 
the 
Steering Committee 
and 
the 
Project Coordination Group 
is 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
Project 
Coordinator 
and 
his 
team, 
who 
are 
also responsible 
for 
day-to-day 
Project implementation 
and 
administration. 
Also, 
technical 
assistance 
is 
planned 
to 
design 
an 
effective 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
for 
the various 
consultancies 
financed 
by 
the 
Project. 
Finally, 
the 
Coordination Group 
is 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
that 
Project 
resources 
are 
used 
in 
a 
flexible 
and 
effective 
way, 
in 
response 
to 
evolving 
needs. 
4.3 
Procurement issues: 
The 
Loan 
is 
to 
finance technical 
assistance 
and 
training. 
As 
such, 
all 
procurement 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
through 
consultancy 
services, 
provided 
by 
individuals 
or 
firms 
or 
through 
training 
activities.  The 
MOF 
has 
relatively 
little 
experience 
in 
procurement under 
World 
Bank 
procedures, 
although 
some 
was 
gained 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PPF, 
during 
which 
about 
10 
international 
and 
local 
consultants were 
contracted, 
according 
to 
Bank 
procurement 
guidelines. 
The 
Coordination Group 
is 
the basic 
implementation 
structure 
for 
the Project, 
but 
provision 
has 
been 
made 
within 
the 
Loan 
to 
finance 
additional 
procurement 
expertise 
to 
assist 
with 
procurement 
activities 
under the Project. 
Given 
the 
ambitious 
timetable and 
close 
linkages between 
the 
activities 
under the 
Project 
such expertise 
is 
required 
- 
17- 
Page  22
immediately. 
Currently, a 
local 
consultant 
(full 
time) 
and 
an international 
consultant 
(part 
time) 
are 
being 
selected 
to 
join 
the 
team 
in 
the nearest 
future. 
It 
was 
also agreed 
that 
the 
Project Coordinator 
and 
Project 
Assistant 
will 
undergo appropriate 
training 
on 
Project 
management 
and 
procurement. 
Finally, 
an 
international 
consultant 
is 
providing 
assistance 
in 
drafting 
TORS 
and setting 
up 
an 
effective monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
to 
monitor 
performance 
of 
the 
many 
consultants 
that 
will 
work 
under 
the Project. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
A 
review 
was 
undertaken 
in 
March 
2003 
to 
determine whether the 
financial 
management arrangements 
for 
the 
PFMP 
are acceptable 
to 
the Bank. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
Project financial 
management process 
relies 
upon 
the 
existing 
systems 
of 
the 
MOF, 
the 
exception 
being 
the 
production 
of 
final 
financial 
reports 
for 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Project Coordination 
Group, 
which 
will 
be 
handled 
by 
the 
Secretariat 
of 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Group. 
Disbursements 
from 
the 
Bank 
Loan 
will 
follow 
the transaction-based method, 
i.e., 
the 
traditional 
Bank 
procedures 
including 
reimbursements 
with 
full 
documentation 
or 
reimbursements against Statements 
of 
Expenditure 
(SOE). 
The 
Project 
will 
not 
maintain 
a Special 
Account 
and 
hence 
the 
Bank 
will 
not 
advance 
funds 
to 
the 
Borrower to 
pre-finance 
any 
expenditures. 
Based 
upon 
the 
results 
of 
the 
assessment, 
the 
Project 
satisfies  the 
Bank's 
financial 
management 
requirements.

including 
areas

In 
its 
early 
stages 
the 
Public 
Finance 
reform 
program 
did 
not 
fully 
involve 
many 
of 
the 
stakeholders. 
These 
deficiencies 
have 
been 
recognized, 
partly 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a malogue 
on 
Project 
implementation, 
and 
one 
of 
the 
major 
focuses 
of 
the 
Project 
is 
to help 
generate 
linkages, 
common 
interests 
and 
common 
understanding among 
the 
various participants 
in 
the Project. 
The Project 
now 
includes extensive 
dialogue 
with 
key 
budget agencies 
at 
all 
levels, 
envisages 
the 
creation 
of 
a managerial budget 
group, 
brings 
together 
representatives 
of 
all 
key 
units 
in 
public 
finance 
management 
in 
the Steering 
Group, 
and 
supports 
a 
program 
to 
facilitate 
introduction 
and 
system development 
for 
the 
new 
treasury, based 
on 
feedback 
from 
the 
end 
users. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
Several 
Slovak 
NGOs 
have 
been 
active 
in 
the 
area 
of 
public 
finance 
management. 
The Slovak 
Government 
and 
members 
of 
the 
Bank 
team participated 
in 
and commented 
on 
the 
initiative 
of 
the 
Slovak 
Govemance 
Institute 
(SGI), 
which 
resulted 
in 
a 
publication 
Budgeting and Management 
of 
Public 
Expenditure 
- 
A 
realistic vision 
of 
reforms 
for 
the 
next 
four 
years. 
The 
SGI 
concluded 
in 
2002 
that 
"The 
current 
system 
of 
management 
of 
public 
finances 
(along 
with 
other 
problems) 
does 
not 
allow 
the 
Government 
to 
really 
manage 
the 
State 
in 
the 
horizon 
of 
the 
whole electoral 
term 
and 
turns 
its 
activity 
into 
a 
combination 
of 
many 
half-empty 
words 
and 
patchng 
up 
the 
most 
pressing problems.  The 
beginning 
of 
a 
new 
electoral 
term 
provides a 
unique opportunity 
to 
introduce 
reforms, 
which 
will, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the four-year 
term, 
bring 
political 
effects."

for 
the

has 
actively participated 
in 
the 
public

This

is 
actively promoted 
by 
highly 
transparent 
policy 
discussion 
within 
the Government 
and 
between 
it 
and 
civil

The 
law

discussed 
by 
the 
Cabinet 
must

all 
public

and 
include

submitted 
to 
the 
Cabinet, 
as 
well 
as 
publishng 
the 
comments 
and

on 
the 
intemet. 
Finally, 
once 
a

is 
taken, 
any 
changes 
made 
are 
published 
on 
the 
web 
and 
archived 
(with

able 
to follow 
Government 
work 
from 
the 
stage 
of

proposal 
to

option 
is 
used 
by

and 
by

1. 
Sustainability: 
The sustainability 
of 
the 
Project 
depends 
largely 
upon 
the 
continued 
commitment 
by 
the 
Authorities to 
the 
Project 
objectives. 
The 
new 
Government 
was 
elected 
on 
a strong 
reform 
platform 
and 
has 
demonstrated 
during 
its 
first 
eight 
months 
that 
it 
is 
serious 
in 
implementing 
its 
wide-ranging 
agenda 
early 
on 
its 
electoral period. 
Public 
finance 
reform 
has 
always been a 
pillar 
of 
this 
wider transformation 
of 
Government 
and 
society. 
The 
Government realizes 
that 
Slovalua 
has 
lagged 
many 
of 
its 
neighbors 
in 
public 
finance 
reform 
and 
now, 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
EU 
accession, 
is 
anxious 
to 
catch 
up. 
The 
MOF 
and 
other 
related institutions 
are 
currently 
being 
strengthened 
by 
the 
recruitment 
of 
talented reformers 
to 
key 
posts, 
who 
will 
be 
critical 
to 
build 
the 
key 
institutions 
capable 
of 
sustaining the 
reforms beyond 
the 
term 
of 
the 
current 
Government. 
I 
Risk Mitigation 
Measure 
The 
main 
theme 
of 
the 
Project 
is 
to 
integrate 
the various 
parts 
of 
the 
public 
finance 
reforms, 
and 
to 
create 
and 
foster 
both informal 
and 
formal 
linkages 
within 
the 
system. 
The 
Government 
has 
placed 
the 
treasury 
steering group 
under 
a broader 
public 
finance 
reform 
Steering 
Group, 
and 
the 
latter 
will 
be 
the 
main 
decision 
mahng 
body 
for 
the 
entire 
program. 
To 
facilitate 
to 
operation 
of 
the 
new 
Treasury 
system, 
and 
its 
acceptance 
by 
its 
clients, a 
change management 
and 
system

will 
be offered. 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
the 
Project 
to 
mitigate 
this 
risk 
directly 
in 
the 
short 
term. 
However, the 
increased 
capacity 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
budgeting, 
macro-economic 
analysis 
and forecasting 
debt 
management 
will 
enable 
the Government

There 
has 
been a 
tendency 
to 
regard 
reforms 
as 
largely 
a 
process 
of 
technical 
innovations, 
and 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
that 
the 
current 
reforms 
are 
simply 
an 
extension 
of 
such 
innovations. 
State 
Treasury 
is 
excessively focused 
on 
meeting the deadline

The

A

of

are 
being 
prepared 
to 
inform 
and 
involve 
more 
people 
in 
the 
design 
and

of

A

is 
encouraged 
as

A 
Strategy Paper 
on 
public 
finance 
reform 
has 
been approved 
by 
the Cabinet. 
Explicit 
attention 
is 
being 
paid 
to 
communicating 
the 
rationale 
of 
each 
part 
of 
the 
reform. 
A 
number 
of 
reformers 
have been 
appointed 
to 
guide the 
transformations 
of 
key 
functions 
of 
the 
MOF. 
The 
MOF 
is 
undertaking 
an 
extensive 
Audit 
(Functional 
Review) 
to 
fundamentally 
revamp 
the 
MOF, 
including 
streamlining 
ministerial 
functions 
and 
internal 
procedures. 
Finally, 
the 
abundance 
of 
training, 
technical 
assistance, 
seminars 
and 
study 
tours 
should 
expose 
staff 
to 
new 
ideas 
and 
a 
new 
culture 
in 
the 
MOF. 
A 
number 
of 
key 
management 
positions 
qualify 
for 
significantly

This

both 
directly 
and 
helps

Available

it 
is 
always

Detailed Project Description 
SLOVAK 
REPUBLIC: Public Finance Management Project 
By 
Component: 
Project Component 
1 
- 
US$3.17 
million 
Improving 
the 
Budget 
Process 
(e 
2.91 
million) 
This 
component 
will 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training to 
the 
budget 
sections 
of 
the 
MOF 
and 
selected 
line 
ministries to 
support 
the 
effective implementation 
of 
program 
budgeting 
within 
an 
overall 
medium 
term 
framework 
and 
eventually 
fully 
fledged 
multi-annual 
budgeting. 
It 
will 
focus 
on 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
budgeting, 
linking 
strategic 
policy 
makmg 
to 
the 
formulation 
of 
programs, 
building 
analytical capacity 
and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
mechanisms 
of 
budget 
chapters. 
In 
particular, the 
component 
will 
finance: 
i. 
a 
large consultancy contract 
to 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training to 
the 
MOF 
and 
six 
key 
budget chapters 
to 
assist 
in 
(a) 
carrying out 
a 
functional 
review 
of 
the budget process 
covering 
the 
roles and responsibilities 
of 
all 
units 
of 
the 
MOF 
and 
line 
ministries involved, 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
Audit 
of 
the 
MOF's 
functions 
and 
structures; 
(b) 
building 
strategic 
policy 
making 
capacity 
of 
budget 
chapters; 
(c) 
building 
analytical 
capacities, 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
mechanisms 
for 
program budgeting 
in 
a 
uniform 
and 
coherent 
manner 
across 
budget 
chapters; 
and 
(d) 
organization 
of 
relevant 
training 
and 
change 
management 
courses 
and; 
ii. 
individual 
consultants 
to 
assist 
in: 
(a) 
the 
continuous 
fine-tuning 
of 
program 
budget structures 
and 
overseeing 
the 
development 
within 
the 
MOF 
of 
methodological 
capacity 
for 
program budgeting 
and 
its 
links 
to 
strategic 
policy 
makmg; 
(b) 
the 
development 
of 
a 
uniform 
multi-annual 
budget 
methodology 
and 
the 
elaboration 
of 
multi-annual 
budgets 
by 
budget 
chapters; 
(c) 
developing 
capacity 
in 
the 
MOF 
for 
carrying 
out 
regular 
expenditure 
reviews 
and; 
and 
(d) 
advising 
on 
options 
for 
inter-governmental 
finances. 
Status. 
The 
Slovak Republic 
has 
advanced 
considerably 
in 
the 
introduction 
and 
implementation 
of 
program budgeting 
during 
the 
last 
two 
years. 
This 
process has 
been 
facilitated 
by 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
activities 
on 
the 
techniques 
of 
program budgeting 
organized 
by 
experts 
of 
US 
Treasury 
assisting 
the 
MOF 
over 
ths 
period. The 
main 
achievements are: 
(i) 
a 
draft program budgeting methodology 
prepared 
by 
the 
MOF; 
(ii) 
program 
budgets for 
the year 
2003 
prepared 
by 
9 
budget 
chapters 
(4 
pilot 
budget 
chapters 
in 
2001 
and 
another 
5 
added 
in 
2002); 
and 
(iii) 
intensive preparation 
of 
the 
program 
budget 
for 
2004 
by 
all 
budget 
chapters. 
The draft 
program 
budgeting methodology 
is 
currently 
under 
review 
by 
all 
budget 
chapters. 
The 
MOF 
recognizes 
that 
the methodology 
needs 
to 
link 
the 
strategic 
policy 
making 
process 
with 
the 
formulation 
of 
programs 
and 
should 
further be 
elaborated 
in 
the 
area 
of 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
There 
is 
strong 
commitment 
by 
senior 
policy 
makers 
to 
implement 
meaningful program 
budgeting 
in 
all 
budget 
chapters 
in 
Slovakia.  The 
MOF 
also recognizes 
that 
in 
the 
past 
Budget 
Chapters have 
not 
been 
fully 
involved 
in 
and 
committed 
to 
the 
introduction 
of 
program budgeting 
and 
wider 
budget 
reforms. 
In 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
Budget 
Chapters a 
workmg 
group 
of 
budget 
managers 
from 
the 
MOF 
and 
key 
budget 
chapters 
is 
to 
be 
formed to 
oversee 
the 
reform 
process, 
maintain 
its 
coherence 
across 
institutions 
and 
provide 
feedback 
on 
implementation 
problems. 
The 
functional review 
of 
the budget 
process 
to 
be 
conducted under the 
large 
consultancy 
contract 
within 
this 
component 
will 
examine 
all 
the 
structures 
and 
procedures associated 
with 
budget 
preparation, 
execution 
and 
reporting. 
It 
will 
be important 
that the 
functional 
review 
of 
the 
budget 
process 
is 
closely coordinated 
with 
and 
feeds 
into 
the 
Audit 
of 
functions 
and 
procedures 
being 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
MOF 
and 
is 
linked 
to 
the 
institutional 
strengthening 
of 
the 
FPI 
to 
-29

Page  34
be 
carried 
out 
under 
second 
component 
of 
this 
Project. 
Multi-annual 
budgeting 
is 
required 
by 
Law 
as 
from 
2004. 
No 
methodology 
has 
yet 
been 
developed. 
However, the 
MOF 
is 
in 
the process 
obtaining 
assistance 
for 
developing 
such a 
methodology 
using 
Project 
resources 
available 
under 
the 
PPF, 
and 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
budget 
chapters 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
methodology. 
In 
order 
to 
begin 
the 
process 
of 
prioritizing 
expenditures 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
carry out 
an 
expenditure 
review. 
In 
May 
2003, a 
joint 
Fund 
/ 
Bank 
mission 
will 
be 
visiting 
Slovakia 
to 
provide 
advice 
on 
options 
for short 
term 
expenditure rationalization. 
The 
MOF 
wishes 
to 
build 
on 
this 
experience 
and 
to 
develop 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
MOF 
to 
carry 
out 
meaningful 
regular 
expenditure 
reviews 
in 
order 
for 
the 
Ministry 
to 
be 
an 
effective 
counterpart 
in 
dialogue 
on 
sectoral 
priorities. 
While 
it 
is 
outside the 
scope 
of 
this 
Project 
to 
deal 
extensively 
with 
decentralization 
issues, 
the 
fiscal 
aspects 
and 
the 
financial 
arrangements 
between levels 
of 
Governments have 
important 
linkages 
to 
the 
public 
finance management 
reform 
process. 
A 
Plenipotentiary 
for 
Public Adrmnistration 
Reform 
was 
appointed 
at 
the end 
of 
2002 
to 
lead 
the 
effort 
to 
accelerate the 
process. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
final 
phase 
in 
the decentralization 
process, 
the 
reform 
of 
inter-Governmental 
fiscal 
relations, 
will 
start 
on 
January 
1, 
2005, 
and 
preparatory 
work 
to develop 
a 
set 
of 
viable 
options 
is 
required 
before 
the 
decision 
is 
taken. 
The 
Government 
has 
requested 
assistance 
in 
developing 
these 
options. 
A 
number 
of 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
budget 
process: 
The 
link 
between 
the strategic 
policymaking 
and 
the 
budget 
needs 
significant 
strengthening. 
Both 
policy 
makers 
and 
budget 
experts need 
to 
work 
together 
in 
ensuring that 
funding 
is 
allocated 
according 
to 
priorities. 
Well-established 
program 
budgeting, 
however, 
requires 
a stable 
and 
coherent 
policy 
making 
climate.  Improvement 
in 
this 
area 
in 
Slovakia 
is 
essential 
to 
achieve 
all 
the benefits 
of 
program 
budgeting. 
Budget 
units 
need 
to 
be 
fully 
aware 
of 
the rationale 
of 
program budgeting and 
understand that 
it 
is 
part 
of 
a 
wider 
reform 
effort to improve 
resource 
allocation. 
Staff 
of 
budget 
departments 
of 
both 
the 
MOF 
as 
well 
as 
the 
line 
ministries 
perceive the 
implementation 
of 
program budgeting 
as 
a 
complex, 
technical, 
still 
input-oriented, 
exercise, 
accompanied 
by 
many 
new 
time-consuming 
operations 
without 
any 
purpose. 
Often 
there 
is 
a 
sharp 
&vision 
of 
tasks 
and 
responsibilities 
between 
top-level 
management 
and 
operational 
staff 
of 
budget 
chapters 
accompanied 
by 
a weak 
communication between 
these 
layers 
of 
Government 
organizations. 
Budget 
chapters 
are 
preparing 
overly 
detailed 
budgets, 
presenting 
many 
segmented programs, 
sub-programs, 
projects and 
elements. 
Such 
a 
level 
of 
detail 
is 
superfluous 
in 
program 
budgets 
and 
should 
be reduced 
to avoid 
unnecessary 
administrative 
burdens. 
Budget 
chapters have 
difficulties 
in 
formulating 
proper, 
results-oriented, 
performance indicators. 
No 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
mechanism 
for 
program 
budgeting 
has 
been developed yet.  Such 
mechanisms 
are 
fundamental 
to 
the 
process 
because 
they 
allow 
evaluation 
of 
outcomes 
and 
results 
and 
contribute 
to 
the 
formulation 
of 
strategic 
priorities. 
An 
analysis 
of 
the organizational 
structures, procedures 
and 
flows 
of 
information 
between 
all 
units 
and 
institutions 
involved 
in 
the 
budget 
process 
is 
required 
in 
order 
to 
streamline 
these 
and 
prepare 
the 
ground 
for 
a 
modem 
and 
flexible 
budgetary 
process 
in 
which 
resource 
allocations 
are 
linked 
to 
policy 
priorities 
and 
governed 
by 
a resource 
envelope 
derived 
from 
the 
MOF's 
macroeconomic 
frame 
work. 
The 
Budgetary 
Rules 
Act 
requires 
the 
introduction 
of 
multi-annual 
budgeting 
from 
2004. 
While 
important, 
this 
techmque 
will 
require 
a 
number 
of 
years 
to 
bear 
fruit. 
It 
will 
however, 
in 
time, 
- 
30 
- 
Page  35
complement 
the 
other 
reforms 
of 
the 
public 
finance 
system. 
It 
is 
therefore 
important 
that 
work 
begns 
to 
design 
a coherent 
methodology 
that 
can 
be introduced 
in 
an 
increasingly rigorous fashion 
in 
the 
next 
few 
years. 
9. 
The capacity 
of 
the 
MOF 
to 
carry 
out 
expenditure 
reviews 
needs 
to 
be 
developed 
to 
allow 
effective 
debate 
with 
line 
ministries 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
sectoral 
priorities 
. 
10. 
A 
viable 
set 
of 
options 
for 
the 
next 
phase 
of 
fiscal 
decentralization 
needs 
to 
be 
prepared. 
Project 
Component 2 
- 
US$0.68 
million 
Strengthening 
the 
macro capacity 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(e 
0.62 
million) 
This 
component 
will 
provide training 
and 
consultancy services 
to 
assist 
the 
MOF 
to 
strengthen 
capacity 
of 
the 
Financial 
Policy 
Institute 
(FPI) 
to 
prepare 
high 
quality 
macroeconomic 
forecasts 
and 
analysis 
whch 
will 
serve 
as 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
both 
the 
annual 
and, 
in 
time, 
the multi-annual 
budget 
process. 
This 
requires 
major 
technical 
and 
organizational improvements 
including: 
(i) 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
medium 
term 
macroeconomic 
and 
fiscal 
forecasts 
of 
the FPI, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
economic 
reports 
accompanying 
the 
budget; 
(ii) 
developing 
close 
institutional 
links 
between the 
FPI 
and 
the 
Tax 
Policy 
and Budget 
Sections 
of 
the 
MOF 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
Treasury 
and 
the 
NBS 
in 
macroeconomic 
forecasting; 
and 
(iii) 
assigning 
a 
central 
role 
to 
macroeconomic 
forecasts 
of 
the 
FPI 
as 
the 
sole 
basis 
for 
establishing the 
resource 
envelope 
for 
the 
budget process 
. 
In 
particular, 
the 
component 
would 
finance 
(i) 
an 
individual 
international 
consultant 
to 
strengthen 
the 
analytical capability 
of 
the 
FPI 
and 
improve 
their 
medium 
term 
macroeconomic 
and 
fiscal 
forecasts, 
including 
development 
of 
reliable 
databases 
as 
a 
requisite 
for 
the preparation 
of 
forecasting 
models; 
(ii) 
a 
second consultant 
to 
advise 
on 
institutional 
links 
of 
the 
FPI 
to 
other 
institutions 
involved 
in 
the 
budget 
process 
includmg 
the 
Tax 
Policy 
and 
Budget 
Sections 
of 
the 
MOF 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
developing 
a 
coherent 
medium 
term 
fiscal 
framework, 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
MOF's 
Audit 
of 
functions and 
procedures; 
(iii) 
consultancy 
to 
develop 
links 
between 
the 
Slovak 
macroeconomic model 
and 
external 
data 
and 
models; 
and 
(iv) 
training, 
study 
tours 
and 
internships 
for 
staff 
of 
the 
FPI 
to 
work 
and 
learn 
alongside 
professionals 
in 
the 
field 
of 
macro-economic 
policy 
in 
other countries, 
so 
as 
to 
build 
skill 
levels 
and 
provide 
a 
stimulating 
working 
environment 
which 
will 
encourage 
the 
recruitment 
and 
retention 
of 
talented staff. 
Status. 
The 
FPI 
is 
responsible 
for 
assessing 
the 
economic 
conditions 
in 
Slovakia 
and 
their implications 
for 
the 
development 
of 
public 
finances. 
It 
produces the 
key 
macroeconomic 
projections 
that 
underpin 
the 
budget 
formulation 
and 
also supplies 
these 
projections 
to 
international 
organizations, 
including 
the 
OECD, 
EC 
and 
IMF. 
While 
the 
staff 
of 
the Institute, 
with 
the 
limited 
resources 
available, 
demonstrate great 
commitment 
in 
meeting 
the 
demands 
placed 
on 
them over 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
they acknowledge the 
lack 
of 
both 
organization 
and 
technical 
instruments 
to 
meet 
the 
new 
challenges. 
The 
Government 
has 
decided 
to 
both 
reorganize 
and 
increase 
the 
skill 
level 
of 
the 
FPI. 
A 
new Director 
was 
appointed 
on 
April 
1,2003 
and 
considerable efforts 
are 
being 
made 
to 
design incentives 
to 
attract 
qualified 
professionals 
to 
join 
the 
unit. 
Furthermore, there 
is 
full 
recognition 
that 
weak 
linkages 
between 
the 
FPI 
and 
its 
counterparts 
in 
the 
budget 
process 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
urgently. 
Such 
links 
require 
both 
formal 
procedures 
and 
an 
authority 
based 
upon 
reputation and 
quality 
as 
well 
as 
the 
development 
of 
informal 
networks 
between the 
FPI 
and 
other sections 
of 
the 
MOF 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
line 
ministries, 
the 
NBS 
and 
other 
public 
institutions. 
In 
order 
to achieve 
these 
goals, a 
number 
of 
issues 
need 
to 
be 
addressed, 
including:

Page  36
1. 
Improving 
the 
technical 
quality 
of 
the 
formal modeling 
and 
macro 
economic analysis 
to: 
(i) 
rely 
less 
on 
the mechanical 
use 
of 
external contributions; 
(ii) 
extend 
the 
forecasting period; 
and 
(iii) 
improve 
capacity 
to 
analyze 
the 
macro 
economic 
implications 
of 
policy 
changes 
and 
external 
events. 
2. 
The 
formal 
establishment 
of 
the 
FPI 
as 
the core 
institute 
for 
macro-analysis 
in 
the 
MOF 
in 
particular 
as 
the 
sole source 
of 
the 
macroeconomic basis 
for 
the 
MTBF 
and 
the 
annual 
budget. 
3. 
Creating 
a 
transparent 
organizational structure that 
clearly 
assigns 
responsibility 
for 
macro 
economic 
and 
fiscal 
forecasting 
at 
the 
aggregate 
level 
to 
the 
FPI 
and, 
at 
a 
more 
detailed 
level, 
to 
specialized 
units 
such 
as 
the 
tax 
policy 
and 
budget sections 
(using 
macro 
inputs 
provided 
by 
the FPI). 
Currently, 
the 
estimates 
of 
tax 
developments 
are 
performed 
in 
at 
least three 
departments: 
the FPI, the 
Tax 
and 
Customs 
Section 
and 
the 
Budget 
Section. 
4. 
Avoiding 
an 
excessive 
emphasis 
on 
the 
technical 
aspects 
of 
developing 
the 
FPI’s analytical 
capabilities at 
the 
expense 
of 
organizational 
development. 
Project 
Component 
3 
- 
US$ 
1.28 
million 
Debt 
Management 
and 
Treasury 
(€ 
1.18 
million) 
This 
component 
will 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training to 
assist 
in 
operationalizing 
the 
Debt 
and 
Liquidity 
Management Agency 
(DLMA) 
and 
the 
State 
Treasury. 
These 
new 
institutions 
are 
intended 
to 
ensure 
the 
efficient 
execution 
of 
the budget 
and 
manage 
the 
financial 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
of 
Slovakia. 
As 
such, 
they 
are 
a fundamental 
part 
of 
the 
public 
finance 
system. 
The 
component requires 
close 
collaboration 
and 
coordination 
with 
a 
major 
technical 
assistance 
Project 
funded 
by 
EU-PHARE, to 
support 
the 
development 
of 
an 
integrated 
State 
Treasury 
function 
in 
Slovakia. 
The 
focus 
of 
that Project, 
however, 
is 
to 
support 
all 
aspects 
of 
the technical 
creation 
of 
the 
treasury 
system. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
debt 
management, 
the 
PURE 
Project 
provides 
some 
support, 
focused 
on 
operational 
matters. 
The 
aim 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
ensure 
that the 
DLMA 
is 
established 
with 
a 
professional 
debt 
management capacity, 
appropriate 
institutional 
linkages 
and 
adequate 
accountability 
arrangements 
to 
the 
MOF, 
and 
that 
the 
State 
Treasury 
receives support 
for 
change 
management 
and 
system 
improvement 
once 
it 
becomes 
operational 
in 
2004, 
This 
component 
would 
finance 
in 
particular: 
(i) 
a 
long term 
adviser 
to 
assist 
in 
the development 
of 
an 
institutional 
structure 
and 
legal framework 
which 
clearly 
defines 
the 
roles 
of 
the 
MOF 
and 
the 
DLMA, 
and 
advise 
on 
the 
development 
of 
an 
appropriate 
debt strategy, 
risk 
management techniques 
and 
on 
strategies 
to 
encourage 
the 
development 
of 
the 
domestic security 
market; 
(ii) 
a 
training 
and 
change 
management 
program 
to 
help 
the 
operational 
start-up 
of 
the 
new 
Treasury system 
by 
facilitating 
its 
day-to-day  use 
by 
end-users 
and 
by 
reinforcing 
IT 
staff 
capabilities 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
real 
and 
reliable 
system 
maintenance 
and 
improvement; 
(iii) 
a diagnostic 
study 
to 
identify 
the extent 
and 
nature 
of 
implicit 
and 
explicit 
contingent 
liabilities 
and 
the 
design 
of 
a 
monitoring 
and 
management system 
for 
these 
liabilities; 
(iv) 
study 
tours, 
internships 
and 
specialized 
training 
in 
debt 
management 
for 
MOF 
and 
DLMA 
staff; 
and 
(v) 
a diagnostic 
study 
on 
the 
weaknesses 
of 
public 
accounting 
and 
the 
design 
of 
a 
road 
map 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
accrual 
accounting. 
Status 
(debt 
management). 
While 
falling 
significantly 
short 
of 
international 
best 
practice 
in 
a number 
of 
respects 
both 
at 
the 
strategic/policy 
level 
and 
at 
the 
operational 
level, 
current 
state 
debt 
and 
liquidity 
management 
activities 
in 
Slovakia 
are 
of 
a 
reasonable 
standard 
and 
demonstrate 
a 
commitment 
to 
professional 
standards. 
Without 
a 
major 
domestic/external 
systemic 
shock, 
there 
appear 
to 
be 
no 
immediate 
time 
critical 
risks 
requiring 
urgent 
remedial action.  That 
is 
not 
however, 
to 
imply 
any 
scope 
for 
diminution 
of 
focus 
or 
urgency 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the Project, 
as 
the 
prospect 
of 
domestic 
and 
external 
shocks increases 
over time. 
-32- 
Page  37
There 
is 
also 
a 
significant need 
for 
a 
more 
integrated 
view 
of 
the 
State’s 
liabilities, 
both 
actual 
and 
contingent, 
in 
view 
of 
the substantial 
level 
of 
“state”guarantees 
of 
various forms 
in 
existence 
in 
Slovakia. 
The 
volume, 
nature 
and 
currency 
of 
the contingent 
liability 
portfolio 
will 
need 
to 
be 
examined 
in 
the 
formulation 
of 
an 
overall 
liability 
management strategy 
for 
the 
State. 
The 
essential 
principle 
underpinning 
the 
Authorities’  decision 
to 
set 
up 
the 
DLMA 
is 
the 
important 
distinction 
between 
the 
formulation 
of 
high 
level 
debt 
management 
policy 
and 
strategy 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
the 
need 
for 
operational 
flexibility 
and 
professional technical operational 
management 
of 
debt 
and 
liquidity. 
The 
Government 
recognizes 
that the current 
legal 
framework 
for 
the 
DLMA 
is 
inadequate 
to 
fulfill 
these 
purposes. 
The 
DLMA 
was 
set 
up 
as 
an 
independent 
budgetary 
institution 
under 
the 
State 
Treasury 
Law 
passed 
in 
2002. 
However, 
the 
law 
makes 
no 
provision 
for 
accountability 
and 
reporting 
arrangements 
between the 
DLMA 
and 
the 
MOF. 
The 
MOF 
decided 
in 
April 
2003 that 
it 
wished 
to 
retain 
the 
status 
of 
the 
DLMA 
as 
an 
independent 
budgetary 
institution. 
In 
order 
to 
give 
the 
DLMA 
a 
firm 
legal 
and 
institutional 
basis, 
the 
MOF 
is 
currently preparing 
the 
required accountability 
arrangements 
and 
&vision 
of 
responsibilities 
between 
the 
MOF, 
the 
State 
Treasury 
and 
the 
DLMA. 
A 
first 
draft 
of 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
legislation 
and the 
regulatory framework 
is 
expected 
by 
the end 
of 
June, 
2003. 
A 
draft 
debt 
strategy 
will 
be developed 
by 
September. 
The 
legal 
changes 
and 
the 
debt strategy 
will 
then 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Government 
for 
approval 
later 
in 
the 
year. 
The 
DLMA 
will 
assume 
its 
new 
responsibilities 
only 
after 
the 
new 
arrangements 
are 
in 
place. 
In 
due 
course, 
the 
DLMA 
will 
also 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
the 
management 
and 
administration 
of 
contingent 
liabilities. 
Developing 
the 
domestic government debt 
market 
(rules, 
participants, organization) 
and the 
overall legal 
framework 
for 
debt 
market 
are 
urgent 
tasks 
in 
which 
the 
new 
DLMA 
should 
take 
a 
leadmg role.  Market 
participants 
should be 
closely 
involved 
in 
the development 
of 
the 
domestic 
debt 
market 
and 
of 
the 
legal 
framework, 
since 
they 
will 
be 
key 
players 
in 
the 
market 
and 
the 
main 
vehicle 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the reforms. 
In 
order 
to 
achieve 
the most 
efficient 
management 
of 
resources 
within 
a 
proper 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework, the 
following 
issues 
need 
to 
be addressed: 
1. 
Institutional 
and legislative framework: 
(i) 
Appropriate 
reflection 
of 
the 
accountability 
arrangements 
required given 
the 
status 
of 
the 
DLMA 
as 
a 
separate 
budgetary 
organization; 
(ii) 
assignation 
of 
responsibility 
at a 
senior 
level 
within 
the 
MOF 
for 
debt 
and 
liquidity 
management 
strategy 
and 
policy; 
(iii) 
development 
of 
procedures 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
debt management 
policy/strategy; 
(iv) 
creation 
of 
an 
analytical capacity 
within 
the 
MOF 
to provide 
independent 
advice 
on 
policy 
and 
strategy 
formulation; 
and 
(v) 
creating 
a mechanism 
to identify, 
coordinate 
and 
propose 
legdative 
amendments 
arising 
from 
decisions 
made 
in 
these 
areas. 
2. 
Technical/Systems 
framework; 
close 
collaboration 
will 
be required 
with 
the 
team developing 
the 
technical 
(particularly 
software) specifications 
for 
the 
debt management 
systems. 
The 
Director 
of 
the 
DLMA 
should 
provide leadershp 
in 
the process 
of 
the 
identification 
of 
system 
needs 
and 
the 
management 
of 
their 
provision; 
3. 
Debt/Liquidity 
Management 
priorities; 
the development 
of 
debtlliquidity 
management 
capacity 
in 
Slovakia 
may 
require 
a number 
of 
initiatives, 
including: 
(i) 
clarification 
of 
and 
agreement 
with 
relevant authorities 
on 
appropriate 
staffing recruitment 
policies 
for 
the 
new 
DLMA 
(compensation, 
other 
benefits, 
recruitment 
processes, 
etc.); 
(ii) 
creation 
of 
a 
non-executive 
consultative 
group, 
the 
purpose 
of 
which would 
be 
to 
bring 
to 
the 
table the 
perspectives 
of 
the 
three 
main 
participants 
of 
the 
Government securities 
market 
- 
namely the 
issuer, the 
investors 
and 
the 
market intermediaries; 
and 
-33- 
Page  38
(iii) 
the 
identification 
of 
the 
extent 
of 
contingent 
liabilities 
and the 
establishment 
of 
procedures 
to 
manage 
and 
monitor 
these 
liabilities. 
Status 
(treasury) 
The 
Government 
has 
endorsed 
the 
strategy 
to 
build 
a 
Treasury 
to 
EU 
standards 
and 
best 
practice 
and 
the 
MOF 
has 
made available 
some 
€25 
million 
of 
national 
budget 
funds 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
a 
treasury 
information 
system 
as 
the 
main 
backbone for 
the 
new 
State 
treasury 
function.  The 
full 
implementation 
of 
the Treasury 
system 
is 
scheduled 
for 
January 
1,2004  (accordmg 
to 
the 
Law 
on 
State 
Treasury). 
This 
deadline 
is 
extremely ambitious. 
While 
the 
EU 
PHARE 
program 
that 
started 
in 
December 
2002 
is 
providing 
substantial 
technical 
assistance 
(€2 
million, 
4000 
consultant-days 
), 
this 
assistance 
is 
scheduled 
to 
terminate at 
the 
end 
of 
2003. 
It 
has 
been 
set 
up 
with 
a 
very detailed 
operational 
schedule, 
presuming 
the organizational 
and 
human 
resource 
preconditions 
to 
be 
in 
place. 
Experience 
elsewhere 
suggests 
that 
additional 
resources 
will 
be 
required 
after 
2003 
even 
in 
the 
most 
favorable 
circumstances. 
The 
starting 
point 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
treasury 
in 
Slovakia 
is 
one 
in 
whch 
most 
of 
the 
human 
resources 
are 
not 
yet 
in 
place, 
and 
a 
full 
complement 
of 
staff 
is 
only 
expected 
to 
be 
place 
by 
the end 
of 
2003. 
This 
makes 
current plans 
on 
transfer 
of 
knowledge 
and 
training 
on 
the 
job 
rather ambitious. 
Although 
not 
foreseen 
in 
current 
EU 
assistance 
strategy 
to 
Slovalua, discussions 
are 
now 
underway 
on 
a 
possible extension 
of 
the current contract 
and 
a substantial  €5 
million 
follow 
up 
Project, 
so 
the Government 
has 
indcated 
that 
World 
Bank 
resources 
should 
only 
complement the 
EU 
assistance. 
Even 
assuming 
that 
EU 
assistance 
to 
the 
Treasury 
Project 
will 
continue 
beyond 
2003, 
the current 
efforts 
are 
particularly 
focused 
on 
technical 
matters, 
whde 
the 
institutional, 
organizational 
(e.g. 
distribution 
of 
tasks) 
and 
human 
resource 
(e.g. 
staffing, communication, commitment, 
motivation) 
aspects 
receive 
insufficient 
attention. 
A 
change management approach, 
creating 
the 
right 
worlung 
environment and 
putting 
emphasis 
on 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
old 
to 
the 
new 
situation 
is 
currently 
underdeveloped. 
However, the 
newly 
appointed Director-General 
for 
the 
State 
Treasury 
(since January 
1,2003) 
is 
confident 
that 
adequate 
local 
resources 
are 
available 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
issue. 
Until 
now, 
little 
attention 
has 
been 
given 
to 
ensure that 
spending 
units 
are 
adequately 
prepared 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
new 
system, 
which 
will 
constitute 
their 
main 
worlung 
tool. 
The 
problem 
is 
likely 
to 
become 
particularly 
apparent once 
the 
new 
system 
is 
introduced, 
as 
operational problems 
appear 
and 
system 
improvements 
are 
required. 
Thls 
is 
an 
area 
where 
Project 
assistance has 
been 
requested. 
These 
challenges 
could 
be 
addressed 
through 
advanced 
IT 
training 
and 
assistance 
with 
change 
management, 
including 
assistance 
in 
allowing 
users 
to 
provide 
feedback 
for 
the 
further 
development 
of 
the Treasury 
system 
in 
response 
to 
operational problems 
as 
they 
arise. 
The 
IT 
training 
would 
be aimed 
at 
a 
substantial 
kemel 
of 
IT 
experts 
withln 
the 
State 
Treasury 
(managers, 
developers 
and 
technicians)  able 
to 
supervise, 
develop 
and 
manage 
the 
newly 
installed 
integrated 
financial 
system 
and 
develop 
an 
in-house 
capacity 
to 
make improvements 
or 
changes 
to 
the 
system 
as 
may 
be 
required. 
The practical 
objective 
of 
this 
component 
would 
be to 
train 
the 
IT 
staff 
in 
Oracle, 
SAP 
and 
Mcrosoft, 
development 
and 
production 
environments 
so 
that 
the members 
of 
this 
staff 
could 
successfully take 
part 
to 
the 
certification 
tests 
periodically 
organized 
by 
Oracle, 
SAP 
and 
Microsoft. 
In 
addition 
to 
increasing 
IT 
capacity 
such 
training 
would 
help 
recruitment 
and 
retention 
of 
staff. 
Change 
management 
would 
help 
the 
MOF 
to: 
(i) 
define 
and 
monitor 
the 
process 
of 
change; 
(ii) 
prepare 
for 
the 
change, 
especially 
by 
putting 
in 
place 
a change 
network 
that 
will 
assist 
start-up 
and 
implementation 
efforts; 
(iii) 
support 
end-users 
in 
providing 
a 
system 
to 
allow 
feedback 
from 
them 
to 
be 
-34- 
Page  39
incorporated 
into 
system 
improvements 
thus 
enhancing 
overall 
system 
performance; 
and 
(iv) 
assist 
in 
the 
Project deployment. 
The combination 
of 
advanced 
IT 
training 
and 
assistance 
with 
system development 
should 
be 
to 
ensure 
that the 
future 
system 
will 
be maintained 
and 
further 
developed at 
an 
optimal 
cost 
and 
ensure 
that 
the 
Treasury 
IT 
staff 
are 
capable 
of 
providing 
a 
sufficient 
level 
of 
support 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
systematic 
and 
costly 
use 
of 
external 
consultants. 
For 
the 
successful 
introduction 
of 
the 
State 
Treasury 
it 
is 
important 
that 
the 
following 
issues 
are 
addressed: 
Linking 
the 
Treasury 
to thepublicJinance 
system; 
The 
treasury system design 
is 
well 
underway. 
With 
the 
help 
of 
Hewlett-Packard 
consultants, 
detailed technical 
specifications 
for 
hardware 
and 
software 
to 
support 
the 
new 
treasury system are 
being 
finalized. 
Inadequate mechanisms 
exist 
for 
inputs 
on 
requirements 
of 
treasury 
users. 
In 
this 
context 
it 
is 
to 
be 
welcomed that 
Public 
Finance 
Reform 
Steering 
Committee 
has 
been expanded 
to include 
the 
Treasury 
Steering Group, ensuring 
proper 
involvement 
and 
consultation 
of 
users. 
Organizational 
issues 
and Human resources; 
The 
new 
Treasury 
Director 
has 
only 
just 
begun 
developing 
an 
organization 
scheme 
from 
scratch. 
In 
ths 
process 
it 
will 
be 
critical 
to 
match 
the 
new 
organizational 
structure 
with 
the 
need 
for 
an 
effective 
interaction 
between 
the 
treasury 
and 
its 
clients. 
In 
addition, 
the 
State 
Treasury 
Project should 
directly 
address 
the question 
of 
change 
management 
(in 
particular 
organization, 
distribution 
of 
responsibilities, 
human 
resources, 
coherence 
of 
relevant 
legislation, 
bottlenecks), 
to 
present, 
update, 
and 
disseminate 
a 
change management 
plan. 
Treasury 
Project 
Implementation 
Schedule: 
currently, 
the 
Law 
requires 
that 
the 
State 
Treasury 
assumes 
full 
responsibility 
for 
all 
treasury 
functions 
as 
of 
January 
1,2004. 
A 
decision 
on 
postponing 
ths 
deadline 
apparently 
requires amending 
the 
Law 
itself, 
and 
would 
push 
back the 
start 
of 
the operations 
by 
a 
full 
year. 
These 
constraints 
unduly 
restrict 
the 
implementation 
schedule; 
any 
amendment 
to 
the 
law 
should 
avoid 
fixing 
a 
new 
deadline 
in 
the 
law 
itself, 
but 
rather 
give 
the 
authority 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance 
to 
transfer 
operational responsibilities 
to 
the treasury 
as 
and 
when 
the 
technical 
and 
organization 
conditions 
permit. 
Users 
ofthe 
new 
Treasury; 
to 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
treasury 
system, 
attention 
is 
needed 
for 
the 
progressive 
strengthening 
of 
the 
capacity 
of 
end 
users 
in 
the 
MOF 
and 
in 
the 
line 
ministries 
and 
other budgetary 
agencies 
to 
use 
the treasury 
system 
and 
to 
allow 
system 
development 
based 
upon 
user feedback. 
Project Component 
4 
- 
US$0.81 
million 
Reform 
Coordination and 
Project 
Management 
(e 
0.75 
million) 
One 
of 
the 
key 
risks 
to 
this 
Project 
is 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
individual 
elements 
of 
the 
reform 
will 
be 
seen 
as 
separate 
technical innovations 
without 
fi"enta1ly 
altering 
the 
vision 
and 
culture 
of 
the 
public 
finance 
management 
system 
in 
Slovakia.  Therefore, great 
attention 
needs 
to 
be 
given 
to 
supporting 
mechanisms 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
groups 
and 
individuals 
involved 
understand the 
linkages 
of 
their 
activities 
to 
the 
wider 
reform 
process. 
This 
requires 
a continuous 
process 
of 
communication 
and 
coordination 
through 
new 
formal 
and 
informal 
structures. 
In 
addition 
the component 
provides 
for 
inputs 
and 
advice 
to 
design 
and 
implement effective 
institutional 
arrangements 
to 
link 
policymalung 
at the 
hghest 
levels 
to 
a 
reflection 
of 
choices 
in 
the budget.  Program 
coordination and Project 
management 
should 
therefore be 
seen 
as 
much 
broader 
concepts 
than 
simply 
integrating 
the 
individual 
components 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
will 
require 
an 
ability 
to 
develop 
new 
organizational 
structures. 
It 
should 
also 
pay 
due 
attention 
to 
-

Page  40
organizational 
and 
institutional 
aspects 
of 
implementing 
the 
reform 
program 
and 
address 
the 
management 
of 
change 
appropriately. 
Finally, 
the 
reform 
of 
public 
finances 
is 
taking 
place 
in 
the context 
of 
imminent 
accession 
to 
the 
EU. 
Thus 
the 
challenges 
of 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Management 
Reform 
will 
be 
increased 
due 
to 
the 
major policy 
and 
institutional 
issues 
faced 
as 
a result 
of 
the 
accession process. 
This 
component 
would 
finance 
technical 
assistance 
to 
help 
senior management 
of 
the 
MOF 
to 
deal 
with 
these 
complex 
issues. 
The 
process 
of 
change 
within 
the 
MOF 
is 
already 
moving 
rapidly. 
The 
new 
management 
of 
the 
ministry 
has 
begun important 
changes 
by 
appointing reform-minded 
staff 
in 
key 
positions. 
The 
MOF 
will 
shortly 
begin 
a 
fundamental 
Audit 
(Functional Review) 
of 
its 
structures 
and 
procedures 
in 
May 
2003. 
This 
is 
an 
extremely important 
development 
and 
it 
is 
important 
that 
its 
recommendations 
are 
carried out 
with 
an 
effective 
communication 
and 
change 
management strategy. 
It 
is 
also 
important 
that 
work 
on 
components 
of 
the 
Project 
involved 
with 
organizational 
and 
institutional 
change 
in 
the 
MOF 
is 
closely 
coordinated 
with 
the 
Audit. 
In 
particular 
the 
review 
of 
budget 
processes, 
the 
development 
of 
new 
procedures 
and 
institutional 
links 
of 
the 
FPI 
to 
other 
units 
and 
the 
development 
of 
the 
institutional 
relationship 
between 
the 
MOF 
and 
the 
DLMA 
will 
all 
have 
an 
important 
impact 
on 
the 
design 
of 
new 
structures 
and 
procedures 
for 
the 
MOF. 
In 
all 
these 
cases 
there should be close 
collaboration between 
the 
consultants 
carrying 
out 
the 
Audit 
of 
the 
MOF 
and 
those 
worhng 
on 
the 
Public 
Finance Management 
Reform. 
It 
is 
expected 
that the 
implementation 
of 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Audit 
will 
result 
in 
the 
MOF 
fundamentally 
overhauling 
its 
existing 
structures 
and 
management practices, since 
these 
currently 
are 
a 
potential 
barrier 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the wider 
reform 
program. 
Beyond 
the 
ministry, 
but 
of 
direct impact 
to 
building 
the 
capacity 
for 
carrying 
out 
the 
reforms 
is 
centralized recruitment 
procedures 
adopted last 
year 
as 
part 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
reform-  The idea 
is 
to 
promote competition 
and 
streamlining 
of 
procedures. 
The 
central 
office 
of 
state 
service 
should facilitate 
in 
the 
display 
of 
free 
vacancies 
and 
to 
set 
model 
procedures 
for 
state 
institutions. 
In 
practice, however, 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
office 
was delayed, 
and 
the 
new 
procedures 
are 
not 
well 
understood, 
so 
they 
are 
significantly delaying 
the appointment 
of 
new 
qualified 
staff 
in 
many 
of 
the 
institutions 
involved 
in 
the 
reform 
effort. 
While 
it 
is 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
this 
Project 
to 
address these issues 
comprehensively, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
the 
authorities 
have recognized 
the 
potential 
damage 
of 
these 
delays 
at 
this 
critical 
juncture 
in 
the 
reform 
process, 
and 
are 
putting 
together 
a 
package 
of 
reforms 
to 
ease 
recruitment 
problems. 
Finally, 
effective 
Project 
implementation 
arrangements 
are 
essential 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
loan 
can 
provide 
timely 
support 
to 
the 
reform 
program. 
The 
MOF 
of 
Slovakia 
has 
never 
implemented 
a 
World 
Bank 
Project 
before. 
Experience 
with 
the PPF 
has 
shown that 
attempts 
to 
apply 
standard 
ministry 
procedures 
have 
led 
to 
delays 
in 
Project 
activities. 
During 
Negotiations 
it 
was 
agreed that, 
to 
avoid 
such delays 
in 
the future, 
full 
authority 
will 
be 
given 
to 
the 
Project 
coordinator 
to 
prepare 
and 
negotiate 
contracts, 
and 
to 
supervise contract 
administration. 
Implementation 
will 
also 
be 
eased 
by 
the 
provision 
of 
training 
in 
Project 
management, 
procurement 
under 
World 
Bank 
rules, 
and 
financial 
management. 
Ths 
component 
will 
also support 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
to 
manage 
the numerous 
consultants 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
Loan. 
This 
component 
would 
finance a 
number 
of 
consultancies 
that 
would 
help 
ensure 
the 
design, 
coordination, 
implementation 
and 
management 
of 
the 
overall 
reform 
effort 
including: 
(i) 
an 
advisor 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance 
on 
strategy 
of 
public 
finance 
reform 
and integration 
of 
all 
elements 
of 
the reforms; 
(ii) 
a 
consultant 
to 
advise the 
Project Coordination 
Group 
on 
Project implementation 
and 
to 
set 
up 
a 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
for 
the Project; 
(iii) 
consultancy 
from 
a 
senior 
international 
official to 
advise the Government 
on 
setting 
up 
and 
linking 
policy 
malung 
structures 
at the highest 
level 
of 
Government; 
(iv) 
local 
consultants 
to 
manage 
the

including 
Project 
Coordinator,

A 
local 
procurement 
specialist 
and 
an 
international 
procurement advisor 
are 
being 
hired 
to 
assist 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Group. 
The position 
of 
the 
local 
procurement 
specialist 
will 
continue throughout 
the 
Project 
life. 
The 
procurement 
specialist, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
procurement 
advisor, 
will 
prepare 
all 
requisite 
procurement 
documents 
and 
train 
government 
officials 
in 
Bank 
procurement 
methods.

Are 
the 
bidding 
documents 
for 
all 
procurement 
actions 
of 
the 
first 
year 
ready 
by

No. 
The 
PPF 
is 
financing 
a 
number 
of 
key 
long-term 
consultants 
in 
all 
components 
of 
the 
Project, 
including 
advisors 
on 
the 
design 
of 
the 
overall public 
finance 
reform, program 
budgeting, 
macroeconomic 
analysis 
and 
forecasting, debt management, 
and 
reform 
coordination. 
In 
addition, 
consultants have 
been 
hired 
to 
ensure 
effective project implementation 
and administration. 
Many 
of 
these 
contracts 
are 
likely to 
be 
extended once 
the 
Loan 
becomes 
effective. 
A 
consultant 
on 
multi-annual 
budgeting, 
the 
procurement 
specialist 
and 
the 
procurement advisor 
are 
all 
currently 
being 
procured. 
All 
TORS 
and 
Requests 
for 
Proposals 
for 
activities 
that 
are 
planned 
to 
start 
in 
the 
fall 
of 
2003 
are 
under 
preparation.  These 
include 
the 
EURO 
2 
million 
contract 
to 
increase 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
budgeting, 
as 
well 
as 
individual 
consultancies 
to 
strengthen 
the FPI, 
to 
prepare 
a 
diagnostic 
study 
on 
contingent 
liabilities, 
and 
to 
provide 
assistance 
on 
public 
accounting.  The relevant documentation 
will 
be 
sent 
for 
the 
Bank's 
no-objection 
by 
May 
3 
1,2003. 
An 
assessment 
of 
the 
Borrower's capacity 
to 
implement 
the 
Project 
Procurement 
Plan 
was 
conducted 
in 
March, 
2003. 
The 
assessment 
addressed 
legal 
aspects, 
procurement 
cycle 
management, 
organizations 
and 
functions, 
support 
and 
control 
systems, 
record 
keeping, 
staffing, 
and 
the general 
procurement 
environment, 
and 
made a general 
risk 
assessment 
of 
the 
Project Implementation 
Group's 
capacity. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
this 
assessment 
the procurement 
risk 
is 
rated 
"high 
risk". 
The 
rating 
will 
be 
revisited 
after the 
first 
year 
of 
implementation.

Summary 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
Country 
Issues 
Slovakia 
is 
a 
member 
of the OECD, 
and 
will 
be facing important 
fiscal 
challenges 
following 
its 
invitation 
to 
join 
the European 
Union 
in 
May 
2004. 
Its 
current 
fiscal deficits 
are 
unsustainable, 
and 
will 
require 
a substantial 
fiscal 
consolidation, 
focusing 
on 
cutting 
back 
expenditure 
and stabilizing 
revenues. 
The 
Government’s 
success 
in 
designing 
and 
implementing 
a 
comprehensive 
reform 
program 
will 
depend 
fundamentally 
on 
its 
capacity 
to 
strengthen 
the 
institutional 
framework 
in 
which 
those 
policies 
are 
conceived, 
decided 
upon, 
and 
executed. 
And 
within 
this 
institutional 
framework, 
public 
finance 
management structures 
will 
be 
key. 
Strengths 
and 
Weaknesses 
The 
major 
strength 
of 
the 
FM 
system 
lies 
in 
the 
use 
of 
existing 
MOF 
systems, 
with 
robust 
intemal 
control 
mechanisms, 
to 
process payments 
and 
record 
transactions. 
The 
potential 
wealmess 
is 
that 
departments/sections 
within 
the 
MOF 
that 
have 
no 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Project 
may 
slow 
the 
processing 
of 
contracts 
and 
payments etc. 
It 
was 
agreed 
during 
negotiations that 
once 
the 
loan 
agreement becomes 
effective,  adequate 
authority 
will 
be 
formally 
delegated 
to 
the Coordinated 
Group, 
to 
ensure 
efficient 
and 
rapid 
implementation 
of 
the 
Project. 
Implementing 
Entity 
A 
Steering Committee chaired 
by 
the 
State 
Secretary 
of 
Minister 
of 
Finance responsible 
for 
budget 
reform, 
and 
including 
the 
State 
Secretary 
responsible 
for 
the 
State 
Treasury 
as 
well 
as 
the &rectors 
of 
key 
departments 
within 
the 
MOF, 
the 
State 
Treasury 
and 
the 
DLMA 
has 
been 
set 
up 
to 
coordinate the 
overall Public 
Finance 
Management 
Reform. 
In 
addition, a 
senior 
advisor 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance, 
with 
extensive 
experience 
of 
public 
sector 
reform, 
has 
been contracted under the 
Project 
to provide 
intellectual 
leadershp 
and 
link 
Project implementation 
to 
wider 
policy reform 
issues. 
He 
has 
been 
appointed 
as 
vicechair 
of 
the Steering Committee. 
Funds 
Flow 
The 
Bank 
would 
make 
funds 
available 
to 
the 
Government 
of 
Slovakia 
under 
the 
Loan 
Agreement, 
goveming 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions 
of 
the 
Bank 
Loan 
and 
specifying 
the 
Project. 
The Project 
will 
not 
maintain 
a 
foreign 
currency Special 
Account. 
All 
disbursements 
from 
the 
Bank 
will 
be 
made 
to 
the 
MOF 
to 
reimburse 
it 
for 
eligible 
expenditures already 
paid. 
The 
Government 
has 
indicated 
that 
direct 
payments 
to 
suppliers 
would 
be inconsistent 
with 
Slovak 
budgetary 
legislation. 
Counterpart 
funds 
will 
not 
be 
paid 
into 
a 
separate 
bank account 
but 
will 
be 
accessed 
through 
the state 
budget 
system. 
See 
Annex 
for 
a 
flow 
of 
funds 
diagram. 
Staffing 
of 
the 
AccountingIFinance 
Function 
Accounting 
will 
be 
performed 
by 
the 
“Economic 
and 
Accounting” 
section 
of 
the 
MOF. 
Senior 
staff 
within 
the 
department 
have 
many 
years 
of 
relevant 
experience. 
As 
the 
Project 
accounting 
cycle 
will 
follow 
the 
standard 
MOF 
cycle, 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to provide 
“Bank 
specific” 
training 
to 
the staff.

Page  55
Accounting Policies 
and Procedures 
The 
MOF 
uses 
a 
modified 
cash 
accounting 
policy 
(recognizing commitments 
after 
receipt 
of 
invoices). 
The 
Project 
will 
report 
to 
the 
Bank 
strictly 
on 
the 
cash basis. 
The 
various 
departmentshections 
of 
the 
ministry 
that 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
receiving 
funds 
under 
the 
Project, 
for 
processing 
payments 
and 
for 
recording the 
underlying 
transactions, 
have 
written 
gwdelines 
and 
procedures 
to 
safeguard 
assets 
and 
to 
ensure 
the accuracy 
of 
financial 
reporting. 
Reporting 
and 
Monitoring 
It 
has 
been agreed that the 
Project Coordination Group 
will 
prepare 
financial 
monitoring 
reports 
(FMRs) 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis. 
The 
FMRs 
include: 
0

The

the 
Bank 
not 
later 
than 
45 
days 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first 
calendar 
quarter 
after 
the 
Effective 
Date, 
and 
will 
cover 
the 
period 
from 
the 
Effective 
Date 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first 
calendar 
quarter. 
Draft 
FMR 
formats have 
been 
annexed 
to 
the 
Minutes 
of 
Negotiations. 
Information 
Systems 
The 
Project 
will 
utilize 
the 
accounting 
system 
of 
the 
MOF. 
The 
system 
has 
sufficient 
flexibility 
to 
permit 
the 
establishment of 
separate 
accounts 
(analytical 
codes) 
to 
track 
the 
use 
of 
Project 
funds. 
Project 
FMRs 
will 
not be 
generated 
automatically 
from 
the 
Ministry’s 
systems 
but 
will 
be 
compiled 
manually. 
Transaction 
statements 
from 
the accounting 
system 
will 
be 
retained 
with 
the 
FMRs 
to 
provide 
an 
audit 
trail to 
the 
underlying 
documentation. 
Supervision 
Plan 
The 
reports 
of 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
Project implementation 
will 
be 
monitored 
in 
detail 
during 
supervision 
missions. 
FMRs 
will 
be 
reviewed 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
by 
the 
Belgrade-based 
FMS 
and 
the 
results 
or 
issues 
followed 
up 
during 
the 
supervision 
missions. 
Audited 
financial 
statements 
of 
the 
Project 
will 
be 
reviewed 
and 
issues 
identified and 
followed 
up. 
2. 
Audit 
Arrangements 
Internal 
audit 
The 
MOF 
is 
subject 
to internal 
audit inspections 
and 
to 
review 
by 
the 
MOF 
controllers 
office. 
However, 
as 
neither 
of 
these 
functions 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
MOF, 
the 
beneficiary 
of 
the Project, the 
Bank 
will 
place 
no 
reliance 
upon internal 
audit 
when determining the 
extent 
of 
Project 
level 
internal 
controls 
necessary 
to 
give 
assurance 
that 
funds 
are 
adequately 
protected 
and 
transactions 
are 
accurately reported. 
External 
audit 
The 
Coordmation 
Group 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
that Project 
financial 
statements are 
auhted 
by 
-51

Page  56
an 
independent 
auditor 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank, 
in 
accordance 
with 
standards 
on 
auditing 
that 
are 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
It 
was agreed 
during 
negotiations 
that 
auditing 
standards 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
are 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing 
promulgated 
by 
the 
Intemational Federation 
of 
Accountants 
(IFAC). 
It 
was agreed 
during 
negotiations that 
auditors acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
are 
those 
auditors that 
have 
been 
pre-qualified 
to 
audit 
Bank 
funded 
operations 
in 
Slovalua. 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
audit 
will 
be 
financed 
from 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the loan. 
Audit 
Report 
Project 
SOE 
The 
following 
chart identifies the audit reports 
that 
will 
be required 
to 
be 
submitted 
by 
the 
Project 
implementation 
agency together 
with 
the due 
date 
for 
submission. 
Due 
Date 
Within 
five 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year 
and 
also 
at the closing 
of 
the 
Project 
Within 
five 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year 
and 
also 
at 
the closing 
of 
the Project 
Expenditure Category 
Consultants' Services 
TORS 
for 
the 
audit 
of 
the 
Project 
financial 
statements 
(including 
an opinion 
on 
SOE 
operations) 
were 
confirmed 
during 
negotiations. 
3. 
Disbursement Arrangements 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Loan 
will 
be 
disbursed 
over a 
period 
of 
three 
and 
a 
half 
years, 
which 
includes six 
months 
for 
the 
completion 
of accounts 
and 
the submission 
of 
withdrawal 
applications. 
The 
estimate 
of 
the 
volume of 
counterpart 
funds 
required 
to 
fully 
implement 
the 
Project 
is 
based 
on 
the 
Standard 
Disbursement 
Profile 
for 
Slovakia. 
As 
this 
is 
a 
TA 
loan, 
and 
as 
it 
is 
one 
part 
of 
a broader 
package 
of 
public 
finance reforms 
with 
a 
total 
cost 
of around 
€30 
million, 
no 
counterpart 
contribution 
over 
and 
above taxes 
is 
required. 
The 
majority 
of 
contracts 
to 
be financed 
will 
be 
for 
foreign 
individual 
consultants 
for 
which 
the 
SDP 
is 
100% 
and 
hence 
the 
risk 
to 
the 
Project 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
unavailability 
of 
counterpart 
funds 
is 
negligible. 
Disbursements 
from 
the 
Bank 
Loan 
will 
follow 
the 
transaction-based 
method, 
i.e., 
the 
traditional 
Bank 
procedures 
including 
reimbursements 
with 
full 
documentation 
and 
reimbursement 
against 
Statements 
of 
Expenditure 
(SOE).

for: 
(i) 
expenditures 
under 
contracts 
costing 
less 
than 
US$lOO,OOO 
for 
consultant services 
provided

(ii) 
expenditures 
under 
contracts 
costing 
less 
than 
US$50,000 
for 
individual

and 
(iv) 
the 
incremental 
operating 
costs less 
than 
US$15,000, 
all 
under such terms 
and

notice 
to 
the 
Borrower.  Related 
documentation 
in 
support 
of 
SOEs 
will 
not 
be submitted 
to 
the 
Bank, 
but 
will 
be 
retained 
by 
the 
MOF 
for 
at 
least one 
year after receipt 
by 
the 
Bank 
of 
the 
au&t 
report 
for 
the 
year 
in 
which 
the last 
withdrawal 
is 
made 
from 
the 
Loan 
Account. 
This 
documentation 
will 
be 
made 
available 
for 
review 
by 
the auditors 
and 
supervision missions. 
Disbursements 
for 
services exceedmg 
the 
above 
limits 
will 
be 
made against 
full 
documentation 
and 
respective 
procurement guidelines.
