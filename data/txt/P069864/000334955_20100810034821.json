 Adjustment Loan (PSMAL) Project for Macedonia are as\n            follows: outcome was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Second Public Sector\n            Management Adjustment Loan Project for Macedonia are as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Public Finance Management\n            Project for Slovak Republic are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was low or\n            negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned include:\n            although differences dominated similarities in the three\n            projects, the one common factor that had a determining\n            influence on outcomes was the extent of government\n            commitment to the projects. Sound analytical work was\n            necessary but not sufficient for project success. All three\n            projects were based on sound analytical work and they\n            matched government strategy. In the case of the Public\n            Finance Management Project (PFMP) there was a hand-in-glove\n            match between analytical work and government strategy, as\n            the government adopted the full recommendations of the\n            Development Policy Review. Concentrating on core elements\n            was a factor contributing to success. Compared with the\n            PFMP, the other two projects over-reached in their ambitions\n            to achieve rather wide development policy goals. In the\n            main, introducing elements that were outside the purview of\n            the budget, such as health and pension reform, affected the\n            efficacy of these two operations and prevented them from\n            fully realizing their goals. Finally, when the different\n            elements of a project fit together well, the project has a\n            greater probability of success. The different elements of\n            the PFMP fit each other better with one another than those\n            of either the Public Sector Management Credit (PSMAC) or the\n            PSMAL and were not as widely dispersed as the two Former\n            Yugoslav Republic (FYR) Macedonia operations."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
