MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA
FOR A UNIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan of US$48.2 milLion
equivalent to Malaysia is submitted for approval.  The loan, to have a term of
15 years, including three years grace, at the standard variable rate, would
help finance a University Development Project.
2.        Background.  The university system in Malaysia is relatively small,
with an enrollment in 1985-86 of 33,000 which represented only 4% of the age
group. The demand for higher education exceeds the enrollment capacity of the
domestic universities and many Malaysians study overseas, 23,000 in 1985-86,
at a high cost in foreign exchange. The quality of university entrants is
high; overall only 25% of qualified applicants gain admission to higher
education. The student admission policy, in terms of academic requirements
and planned overall ethnic and sex distribution is satisfactory, and will be
maintained. In its expansion of university capacity, the Government is giving
priority to the specific fields of engineering, technology and medicine for
which adequate facilities do not exist. For example, in engineering the
number of mechanical, industrial and electrical engineers required to develop
a competitive export-oriented manufacturing industry as envisaged in the
Industrial Master Plan is estimated to exceed the present output from Local
universities by about 2,500 per annum. In the health sector, the Government's
policy of improving quality and equitable distribution of health services
includes a doctor:population target of about 1:2000, which will require an
additional annual output of about 200 doctors, most of whom would be needed
for posts in rural and community health. The issues for the university sector
which need to be addressed as priorities are: (a) fragmented management; (b)
relatively high capital and operating costs partly due to small enrollment in
courses and low utilization of resources; (c) need for exp.nsion to meet
economic and manpower needs within severe budget constraints, and (d) need to
improve cost-recovery to reduce the burden on Government expenditure. The
Government is addressing these issi,es by implementing the following recent
policies for higher education: (a) increasing enrollments thr ugh more
efficient utilization of resources; (b) controlling the introduction of new
courses; (c) shifting emphasis to engineering, technology and applied studies
programs; (d) giving priority to university staff for training fellowships;
(e) improving cost-sharing by reducing the number of scholarships and
providing support through loans; (f) preparing strategies and plans for long-
term university development; and (g) strengthening management.
3.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the project, which would
be the first Bank loan for universities in Malaysia, are: (a) to support
limited new investment to expand university enrollment capacity to meet
priority manpower needs in the areas of engineering related to industrial
development and in the medical sciences related to rural and community health;
(b) to strengthen university management; and (c) to improve planning of
university development and operations.



4.        Project Description.  The project would finance investment in site
preparation, academic buildings, administrative and communal facilities and
student dormitories, equipment, staff training and technical assistance to:
(a) complete the second phase of development of the School of Medical
Sciences, University of Science, Malay,;ia (USM) at Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, to
integrate the School on one campus with the university teaching hospital and
to increase enrollment from about 550 to 1,200; (b) complete the first stage
of development of the Schools of Engineering, USM, at Sri Iskandar, Perak, for
an enrollment of about 1,200 students; and (c) expand enrollments in the
Faculty of Engineering, the National University of Malaysia (UKM), from about
300 to 1,200. The engineering courses and research would be focussed on
specializations relevant to the development of manufacturing industry which is
a priority area for Malaysia's long-term economic development. The courses
and research in the medical sciences would specialize in rural and community
health in li,.e with the Government's policy to improve medical services and
the doctor:population ratio in rural areas. The project would also provide
technical assistance to support the Ministry of Education (MOE) to establish
long-term plans and strategies for university development, operations and
financing for the period after 1990, and to initiate improvements in
university management. The supply of potential university staff is adequate
to meet the requirements of expanding enrollments. Curricula and teaclKng
materials are being prepared. The projects would incltde about 32 staff-years
of consultant and specialists' services and about 850 staff-years of overseas
fellowships for staff training.
5.        The total project cost is estimated to be US$81.4 million equiva-
lent, including estimated taxes of US$0.8 million equivalent, and estimated
direct and indirect foreign exchange costs of US$49.6 million equivalent (61%
of total project cost). The proposed Bank loan of US$48.2 million equivalent
would finance the Fifth Plan development budget expenditure, net of taxes,
equivalent to about 59% of total project costs and slightly less than the
foreign exchange cost. The loan would be disbursed against the Government's
development budget expenditures for civil works, architects' fees and
equipment. Because of government policy there would be no loan disbursement
against the costs of staff-training and technical assistance which would be
paid from annual operating budget allocations, and which cannot be transferred
to the development budget because of the strictly imposed budget ceilings.
Retroactive financing of US$4.8 million would be provided from loan funds for
eligible expenditure from April 1, 1987. The contract for site preparation
for the USM Schools of Engineering at Sri Iskander, at a cost of US$4.5
million, has been awarded following procedures in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. In order to ensure that funds would be
available as needed and to minimize delays in loan disbursement, special
accounts would be set up for each of the two project universities. A time-
table of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
in Malaysia are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6906-MA, (October 14, 1987) is being
distributed separately.



- 3 -
-         Actions Agreed.  During negotiations assurances were obtained that
the Government would: (a) prepare a plan for long-term university development
and its financing for the period after 1990, with such assistance of the Bank
as the Government might reasonably request; and (b) implement programs agreed
with the Bank for staff training and provision of technical assistance, which
would be reviewed annually with the Bank.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has experience in Malaysia
since 1968, in primary ar4 secondary education, teacher training, technical
and vocational educatio   -sd educational administration through eight
projects, five of which have been completed.  OED audit and project completion
reports on the first four projects concluded that the projects had been
implemented successfully. The lissons, which related primarily to the need to
ensure strong project management and to acquire sites at an early stage, have
been taken into accoant in the design of this project. The central agencies,
Treasury and Economic Planning Unit, and MOE have, for the first time,
requested Bank support for investment in university development and, as
necessary, assistance in the preparation of long-term strategy and plans for
university development. The long-term planning would be complemented and
supported by Bank sector work. The project would be a logical extension of
the Bank's successful experience in projects in the education sector.
8.        Justification.  The project would support a program of high priority
university investments aimed at meeting key manpower needs.  It would also
assist the Government to implement the key policy decisions it has already
taken to expand enrollment through more efficient use of resources and to
increase 'st-recovery.  Improvements in university management and planning
would provide a basis for sound investment programs for the period after 1990.
9.        Risks.  The main risk is that, because of budget constraints, the
Government wou.d be unable to sustain the development and operating
expenditures generated by the project over the next four years. This has been
addressed by limiting the scope of the project, working within strict budget
ceilings and minimizing unit costs. The strengthening of management would be
aimed at improving efficiency including the utilization of resources.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
