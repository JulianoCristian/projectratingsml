"The objectives of the University\n            Development Project, which is the first Bank loan for\n            university development in Malaysia, are:  (a) to support new\n            investment in the expansion of university facilities and in\n            staff, course and research development and (b) to improve\n            planning and management of university development and\n            operations.  The investments are to be made at two\n            universities:  (a) the University of Science, Malaysia (USM)\n            and (b) the National University of Malaysia (UKM) at Bangi.\n            These investments include (i) completing the infrastructure\n            and the first stage of development of the Schools of\n            Engineering at Sri Iskandar, Perak; (ii) completing the\n            second phase of development of the School of Medical\n            Sciences at Kubang Kerian, Kelantan; and (iii) assisting the\n            Faculty of Engineering to expand enrollments.  The\n            engineering courses, included in the project, will be\n            focused on specializations relevant to the development of\n            the manufacturing industry which is the key factor in\n            Malaysia's long term economic development. The courses\n            in the medical sciences will specialize in rural and\n            community health in line with the Government's policy\n            to improve medical services and the doctor:population ratio\n            in rural areas."}, "docdt": "1987-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
