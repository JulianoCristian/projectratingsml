remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories shall follow such procedures  as the Bank shall specify
by notice to the Borrower.
Such further withdrawals shall be made
only after  and  to  the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall have been
satisfied that all such  amounts  remaining  on deposit in the UKM
Special Account as of the date  of such notice will be utilized in
making payments for eligible expenditures
.
6.   (a)
If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
payment out of  the  UKM  Special  Account
(i)
was  made for any
expenditure or in any amount  not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2
of this  Schedule,  or
(ii)
was  not  justified  by the evidence
furnished pursuant to paragraph
