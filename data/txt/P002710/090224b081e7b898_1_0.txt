2.   For the purposes of this Schedule the term "foreign expendi-
tures" means expenditures in the currency of any country other
than the Borrower for goods or services supplied from the terri-
tory of any country other than the Borrower.
3.   The disbursement percentages have been calculated in compli-
ance with the policy of the Bank that no disbursements shall be
made on account of payments for taxes levied by, or in the terri-
tory of, the Borrower on goods or services, or on the importation,
manufacture, procurement or supply thereof; to that end, if the
amount of any such taxes levied on or in respect of any item to
be financed out of the proceeds of the Swedish Grant or the Bank
Loan decreases or increases, the Bank may, by notice to TANESCO,
increase or decrease the disbursement percentage then applicable
to such item as required to be consistent with the aforementioned
policy.
4.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no with-
drawals shall be made in respect of expenditures prior to the
date of this Agreement, except that withdrawals may be made in
respect of Category (4) on account of expenditures incurred after
December 1, 1975 in an aggregate amount not exceeding the equiva-
lent of $1,100,000.
5.   Notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Swedish
Grant and the Bank Loan or the disbursement percentages set forth
in the table in parag7aph 1 above, if the Bank shall have reason-
ably estimated that the amount of the Swedish Grant and the Bank
Loan then allocated to any Category will be insufficient to finance


﻿- 29 -
the agreed percentage of all expenditures in that Category, the
Bank may, by notice to the Borrower: (i) reallocate to such Cate-
gory, to the extent required to meet the estimated shortfall, pro-
ceeds of the Swedish Grant and the Bank Loan which are then allo-
cated to another Category and which in the opinion of the Bank are
not needed to meet other expenditures, and (ii) if such realloca-
tion cannot fully meet the estimated shortfall, reduce the dis-
bursement percentage then applicable to such expenditures in order
that further withdrawals under such Category may continue until
all expenditures thereunder shall have been made.
6.   If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the pro-
curement of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the pro-
cedures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expenditures
for such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of the Swedish
Grant and the Bank Loan and the Bank may, without in any way re-
stricting or limiting any other right, power or remedy of Sweden
under the Swedish Agreement or of the Bank under the Bank Agree-
ment, by notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount of the Loan
as, in the Bank's reasonable opinion, represents the amount of
such expenditures which would otherwise have been eligible for
financing out of the proceeds of the Swedish Grant and the Bank
Loan.

C.   Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Goods; Preference for
Domestic Manufacturers
1.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the
supply of goods except those to be procured in accordance with
local procedures: (i) bidders shall be required to state in their
bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods, or the
ex-factory price for domestically manufactured goods; (ii) customs
duties and other import taxes on imported goods, and sales and
similar taxes on domestically supplied goods, shall. be excluded;
and (iii) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight and other
expenditures incidental to the delivery of goods to the place of
their use or installation shall be included.
2.   Goods manufactured in Tanzania may be granted a margin of
preference in accordance with, and subject to, the following pro-
visions:
(a) All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall
clearly indicate any preference which will be granted, the infor-
mation required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such
preference and the following methods and stages that will be fol-
lowed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
(b) After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in
one of the following three groups:
(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in
Tanzania if the bidder shall have established


﻿- 34 -
to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the
Bank that the manufacturing cost of such
goods includes a value added in Tanzania
equal to at least 20% of the ex-factory bid
price of such goods.
(2) Group B: all other bids offering goods manu-
factured in Tanzania.
(3) Group C: bids offering any other goods.
(c) All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared
among themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import
taxes on goods to be imported and any sales or similar taxes on
goods to be supplied domestically, to determine the lowest evalu-
ated bid of each group. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be
compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison,
a bid from group A or group B is the lowest, it shall be selected
for the award.
(d) If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c)
above, the lowest bid is a bid from group C, all group C bids
shall be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group
A after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of the imported goods of-
fered in each group C bid, for the purpose of this further compar-
ison only, an amount equal to (i) the amount of customs duties
and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to
pay for the importation of the goods offered in such group C bid,
or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods if said customs
al


﻿- 35 -
duties and taxes exceed 15% of such price. If the group A bid in
such further comparison is the lowest, it shall be selected for
the award; if not, the bid from group C which as a result of the
comparison under paragraph (c) is the lowest evaluated bid shall
be selected.
D.   Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Civil Works; Preference
for Domestic Contractors
With respect to any contract for civil works included under
Category (2) of the table set forth in Schedule 2 to this Agree-
ment, the Borrower may grant a margin of preference of 7-1/2% to
domestic contractors, in accordance with, and subject to, the fol-
lowing provisions:
(a) Contractors shall be required to prequalify as provided
in Part A.2(i) of this Schedule and applicants for qualification
applying also for such preference shall be asked to provide, as
part of the information for qualification, such information, in-
cluding details of ownership, as shall be required to determine
whether, according to the classification established by the Bor-
rower and accepted by the Bank, a particular firm or group of
firms qualifies for a domestic preference. The bidding documents
shall clearly indicate the preference and the method that will be
followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids to give effect
to such preference.
(b) After bids have been received and reviewed by the Bor-
rower, responsive bids will be classified into the following groups:


﻿- 36 -
(i)       bids offered by domestic contractors eligible
for preference; and
(ii)      bids offered by other contractors.
For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids an amount
equal tc- 7-1/2% of the bid amount shall be added to bids received
under group (ii) above.
