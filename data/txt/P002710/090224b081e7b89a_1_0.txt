ARTICLE IV
Other Covenants
Section 4.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making loans
to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in normal
circumstances, special security from the member concerned but to
ensure that no other external debt shall have priority over its
loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of foreign
exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such member.
To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public assets (as
hereinafter defined), as security for any external debt, which will
or might result in a priority for the benefit of the creditor of
such external debt in the allocation, realization or distribution
of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the Bank shall other-
wise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the Bank, equally and
ratably secure the principal of, and interest and other charges
on, the Loan, and the Borrower, in creating or permitting the crea-
tion of such lien, shall make express provision to that effect.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;
and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking trans-
actions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year after
its date; and (iii) any charges on the General Fund of the East
African Community (hereinafter called the Community) securing a
debt of the Community where the amount of the debt service on such
debt in any financial year together with other debt service on
other debt of the Community payable from such General Fund in such


﻿-8-
financial year does not exceed 2% of the average of customs duties
and excise duties collected by the East African Customs and Excise
Department in the three financial years preceding such incurrence.
For the purposes of this paragraph, "debt service" shall include
payments of the principal of, and interest and other charges on,
debt; and any reference to incurring of debt shall include the
assumption and guarantee of debt and any renewal, extension or mod-
ification of the terms of the debt or of the assumption or guar-
antee thereof.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of the Borrower, of any political or administrative subdi-
vision thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by, or oper-
ating for the account or benefit of, the Borrower or any such sub-
