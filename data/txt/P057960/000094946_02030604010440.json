There are two main project components beside the\n            project management component. The first component finances\n            technical assistance and training activities to build the\n            capacity of local stakeholders, primarily communes and their\n            constituents (including likely project beneficiaries), but\n            also private service providers, county council technical\n            staff, and other stakeholders. The second component provides\n            funding for demand-driven investments prepared for communes\n            and community-based organizations. The component will also\n            finance a public environmental health promotion campaign,\n            and a rural water/sanitation strategy study. In connection\n            with roads, the component will fund studies aimed at\n            improving the broader legal, institutional, and regulatory\n            framework for rural transport and roads."}, "docdt": "2002-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
