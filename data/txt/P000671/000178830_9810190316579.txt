REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECONDIMDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EMECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELORPElT CREDIT
TO THE E1qPIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMEN4T PROJECT
1.        I submit herewith the following report and recommendation on
a proposed development credit in an amount in various currencies equiva-
lent to US $3.1 million to the Empire of Ethiopia to finance the estimated
foreign exchange cost of an agricultural development project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        This is the second agricultural project in Ethiopia to be sub-
mitted to the Executive Directors for consideration.   A $3.5 million credit
(169-ET), for agricultural development in the Wolaxio area of Southern
Ethiopia, was approved in October 1969.
3.        In April 1968, the Imperial Ethiopian Government sought help
from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program in preparing an agricultural project
in the Humera region in the northwiestern lowlands of Ethiopia. Coopera-
tive Program missions visited the project area in April 1968 and December
1968. After reviewing the findings of these missions, an appraisal mission
was sent to Ethiopia in April 1969. A visit by a water supply consultant
in September 1969 completed the field appraisal.
4.        Negotiations for the proposed IDA credit took place in Washington
in February 1970. The borrower was represented by His E-.cellency
Ato Tesfa Bushen, Vice iIinister of Agriculture; Ato Asfaw D.amte, Financial
and Economic Attache iith the Ethiopian rabassy in Washington; and
Ato Shimelis Asfaw, Chief Planning and Programming Engineer of the Imperial
Highway Authority (IHA).
5.        The Bank has made eleven loans to Ethiopia for an aggregate
amount of $97.8 million and four credits for an aggregate amount of $31.9
million. Seven loans are fully disbursed. The following is a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits for Ethiopia as of March 31, 1970:-

1/    Not yet effective.
6.         International Finance Corporation (IFC) has invested US $3.1
million in the Cotton Company of Ethiopia ($2.5 million approved 196h,
$0.6 million approved 1969), US $1.0 million in the Ethiopian Pulp and
Paper Company (as a result of a US $1.7 million maximum underw-riting
commitment, approved 1965) and US $9.0 million in HVA-Hetahara (sugar-
growing and milling, approved 1967).
7.         Except for the 1963 and 1968 loan and credits for highways,
there are no particular disbursement problems. The 1963 credit cannot be
fully disbursed until the Government and contractors have concluded arbi-
tration proceedings arising out of claims concerning completed road con-
struction. Arrangements for arbitration appear to be proceeding in an
orderly manner. The delay in disbursement of the 1968 highway loan results
from slow progress in preparation of acceptable tender documents and con-
tractor prequalification.  Moreover, the small number of responses to the
first tender required a second tender iwith some changed conditions. The
various contracts were finally signed in July and August 1969, and work
is now proceeding normally.

8.        There are no other Ethiopian projects which will be ready for
presentation in this fiscal year. Other operations under consideration
are in education, irrigated agriculture, dairy development, and water and
sewerage.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
9.        Borrower:                 Empire of Ethiopia
Amount:                   US $3.1 million equivalent in various
currencies.
Purpose:                  To provide infrastructure (road and
water supply) and a demonstration farm
to assist farmers in the Humera region
and to prepare studies for the future
agricultural development of the north-
west lowlands of Ethiopia.
Amortization:             In 50 years including a 10-year period
of grace, through semi-annual install-
ments of 1½ of 1% from August 15, 1980
through February 15, 1990 and 1½-2% from
August 15, 1990 through February 15, 2020.
Service Charge:           3/4 of 1% p-er annum
PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       An appraisal report entitled "Humera Agricultural Development
Project - Ethiopia" (PA-30a) is attached.
11.       Agriculture in Ethiopia provides 90 percent of employment, 60 per-
cent of the gross national product and almost all exports.   While modern
commercial farming is increasing, the majority of the population is still
enraved in suibsistence farming on small holdings.  The population pressure
in the highlands and the limits on the exnansion of coffee exrorts (currently
58% of total exports) set under the Intern-itional Coffee Agreement require
that Ethiopia develop the less densely nonulated areas and diversify agricul-
tural nroduction. The proposed nroject would contribute to both these goals.
Simultaneously, the productivity of the subsistence farmers in the highlands
must be improved by programs such as the Wolamo Project (Credit 169-ET),
which will provide feeder roads, credit, and extension and marketing services.



12.       About 100,000 hectares of land in the Tiumera region have been
developed by private entrepreneurs. In this area sorghum, sesame and
cotton are produced by mechanized rain-fed farming.   To date, the Govern-
ment has confined its role to the allocation of land to farmers and general
administration. There is no all-season road link between Humera and Asmara,
where most of the produce is marketed and processed. During much of the
season when cotton and sesame are harvested, the Tekkezi River, which
separates most of the farmers from their markets, can be crossed only by
camel or boat. Water for Humera and the farms is largely supplied from the
Tekkezi River, and enteric diseases flourish.
13.       The proposed project aims at assisting farmers in the Humera
region and promoting further development by: (1) cutting transport costs
by constructing 120 km of all-weather road and bridging the Tekkezi River;
(2) providing water supply for the township of Hu-mera; and (3) establishing
a demonstration farm. Other needed improvements siich as extension and
marketing service, credit, land registration and further infrastructural
improvements to assist the development of about 320,000 ha. of additional
cultivable land, would have to wait until further studies are completed.
The proposed project includes financing for these studies which are expected
to provide the basis for a second phase agricultural project.
14.       The estimited economic rate of return from investment in the road
and bridge is 16%.   The water supply system would provide potable water at
1/12 of present rates and would yield a financial rate of return of about
11%.
15.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US $4.4 million.
The proposed credit of US $3.1 million would finance the estimated foreign
exchange cost of the project, which is about 70% of the total cost. The
Government would finance the remainder, except for the $16,000 cost of
aerial photography of the Humera rer-:ion which will be financed by a United
Kingdom grant.
16.       The borrower would be the Imperial Ethiopian Government.   The
various components of the project would be carried out by the Imperial
Righwaay Authority, the Water Supply Section of the Ministry of the Interior,
and the Ministry of Agriculture, with the planning unit of the Ministry of
Agriculture providing coordination.   The scope and duration of the rroject
does not warrant the creation of a separate organization for uroject
management.
17.       The pronosed Credit Agreement provides for retroactive financing
for the Tekkezi Bridge, for which construction was begun in December 1969.
The bridge will cost US $160,000 and will take a year to build. Delaying
construction until loan signing would have resulted in a substantial loss
of benefits and would have delayed further agricultural development. As
the amount involved was too small to attract international bids, the con-
tract for bridge construction was tendered locally.



18.       Procurement of road construction equipment and Bailey bridges,
and selection of t; contractor for the construction of the water supply
system,will be made on the basis of international competitive bidding.
About $500,000 o4, goods for the project, for which individual contracts
would be too sm4ll to attract international bids, would be procured locally
following agrevd procedures which ensure adequate advertising and effective
Competition.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUTENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.     -.he draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Erpire of Ethiopia, the Recommendation of the Statutory Committee
provided 7or in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
20.       The draft Development Credit Agreement follows the general pattern
of other agreemnents for agricultural projects.
PART V - THE ECONOIMY
21.       A "Memorandum on Recent Economic Development in Ethiopia" was
annexed to my report of April 23, 1969 on a proposed loan for the Finchaa
Hydroelectric project. An economic mission returned from Ethiopia in early
March 1970 and is preparing its renort.
22.       The economy of Ethiopia is greatly influenced by movements in
coffee exports, which account for 55-60' of total exnorts. In the
first half of the 1960's the monetary sector of the economy moved forward
rapidly under the stimulus of increased coffee exports, increased private
investment in construction, and increasing public investment. This trend
was reversed in 1966, when the price of coffee fell, and the rate of growth
declined. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 added to Ethiopia's trade
difficulties. However, with the recent sharp increase in coffee prices
the economy is likely to experience another period of rapid growTth.
23.       The 1966-69 recession had a direct impact on the Governmentts
budget because the receipts of taxes on exports and imports declined and
were not compensated by any increase in revenues from domestic sources.
In order to achieve the targets set in the Third Five-Year Plan the 1968/69
and 1969/70 budget had provided for expenditure exceeding prospective re-
sources and the Government had to apply rather widespread budget reductions.
The Finance Minister has, however, submitted a realistic budget for 1970/71
and, if this is approved by the Council of Miinisters, the Government's fiscal
situation should be greatly improved.
24.       The rise in coffee prices, which is expected to last for three
to five years, will be of great help to economic development. The balance



- 6 -
of payments, which has been under pressure in the recent past, will be more
comfortable. There are indications that private investment is increasing,
and,over the longer termi, the exploitation of substantial potash reserves
appears possible. There are also a number of projects in the public sector
which need to be carried out but the rate at which this will be possible
will depend on the government's ability to mobilize domestic resources.
Although an increase in external trade will produce greater revenues,
there will be a need for new taxes and administrative improvements in
collection. Foreign reserves, which are already equivalent to five monthst
imports, are expected to rise, so that some borrowfing from the Central Bank
will be possible. However, the increase in the current administrative
expenditures (particularly on defense and security) will have to be con-
tained so that an adequate level of current expenditure for economic and
social services can be achieved and maintained.
25.       Ethiopia's total external public debt as of December 31, 1968 was
$236 million, of which $101 million was undisbursed. These figures do not
include $96 million under various "frame agreements" with eastern European
countries, wihich had not yet been allocated to specific projects. The debt
service ratio has been rising slowly and was a little over lOo in 1968.
Although this is not high, Ethiopia is at a very early stage of development
and will require foreign aid for a considerable time, so that as much aid as
possible should be provided on concessionary terms.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOHIMEMDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
