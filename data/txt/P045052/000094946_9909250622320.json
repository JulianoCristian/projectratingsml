The\n            RAP presents mitigation measures to reduce land acquisition\n            impacts on affected populations. The shortest possible\n            length in road design was selected, to minimize land take,\n            and in turn, avoid archaeological/cultural sites, as well as\n            conservation or cultivation areas, allowing adjustments for\n            the right of way. Through the Entitlement Framework,\n            compensation and rehabilitation benefits to affected\n            populations will be ensured. Compensation will cover the\n            costs due to loss of land, and privately-owned assets, as\n            well as adverse individual or collective impacts on\n            subsistence, livelihood, or income-earning capacity.\n            Payments will be in the form of cash lump sums, or two\n            installments, be it for alternative accommodation or final\n            replacement. Capacity-building initiatives will be provided,\n            including training, and Local Consultative Forums will\n            address social issues, inform on grievance resolution\n            mechanisms, and monitor for adequate resettlement practices."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
