The pegging of the road\n            formation areas and ancillary sites enables works to be\n            confined, which reduces the area of disturbance and the loss\n            of productive resources. Vegetation clearance will be\n            controlled to limit the loss of production resources, damage\n            to surrounding features, and ground disturbance and the\n            associated erosion hazard. Retaining walls will enable\n            backfilling of the wall and reduce the likelihood of fill\n            sidecasting below the road formation area. Topsoil will be\n            stripped and stockpiled, and then respread on batters.\n            Excess fill will be disposed of at low impact sites. Noise\n            will be controlled by restricting work and blasting hours,\n            and prohibiting the use of air horns. Finally, compensation\n            will be paid for the loss of land, buildings, and crops or\n            other natural resources; community assets and resources will\n            be repaired or replaced; allowances will be paid and\n            rehabilitation measures extended to displaced households."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
