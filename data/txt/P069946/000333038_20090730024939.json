        risk to development outcome was low or negligible, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            however, given the close inter-linkages between water and\n            wastewater service provision, a clear definition of roles as\n            well as a clear framework and mechanisms to ensure the\n            predictability in the availability of financial resources\n            are pre-requisites in ensuring the long-term sustainability\n            of such institutional framework; 2) given the complexity of\n            operation, continuity within the team and the high level of\n            supervision devoted by the Bank were adequate to ensure the\n            achievement of project outcomes, even though at the\n            formulation of this Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            some of the works were not fully completed. The assumption\n            that a well designed program will need minimal supervision\n            should not be made and adequate financial and human\n            resources must be allocated to complex projects; 3)\n            furthermore, global experience demonstrates that projects\n            that involve significant and complex water infrastructure,\n            such as sewerage networks and wastewater facilities take, on\n            average, almost ten years to implement successfully. The\n            Bank must take this into consideration when designing\n            operations in the sector, as shorter execution periods could\n            impede the achievement of desired outcomes; and 4) it is\n            important to set realistic objectives, especially in areas\n            that are known to be controversial and politically\n            sensitive, such as increase in tariffs and achievement of\n            full cost recovery in a relatively short period of time. In\n            this case, given the fact that the Tehran Sewerage Company\n            (TSC) was newly established and that this already\n            represented a new approach to provision of wastewater\n            services, objectives and targets related to institutional\n            and reform aspects should have been set at lower levels."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
