          system, sewage and sludge treatment facilities, and a\n            sewerage drainage system. Measures to minimize negative\n            environmental impacts include the following: During\n            construction and operation, reduce noise levels by suitable\n            dampening; screening plant air compressors and de-watering\n            pumps with sandbags; restrict work to daytime where\n            possible; issue workers equipment to protect hearing; and\n            restrict construction traffic during nighttime. Mitigate\n            vibration impacts by limiting the use of percussive\n            equipment when excavating sewer trenches and tunnel shafts;\n            and using dead-weight rather than vibration compaction\n            plant. Dust problems will be alleviated by spraying water,\n            covering stockpiles of excavated material with tarpaulins;\n            providing workers with masks to keep from inhaling dust.\n            Noisome odors will be controlled by covering containers and\n            equipment, and designating the area surrounding the site as\n            a greenbelt. Disposal of solid waste in the municipal\n            landfill has been designed to prevent groundwater or surface\n            runoff from contaminating the site. To ensure the health and\n            safety of workers and the public, access to sewage treatment\n            plant effluent will be restricted by installing a fence; a\n            regular eradication program will use biodegradable\n            pesticides for pest control; and other safety measures, such\n            as barriers, flags, and bollards, will be used."}, "docdt": "1999-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
