Tehran area, through the\n            installation of wastewater collection, and treatment\n            facilities, to improve public health, and further enhance\n            irrigation systems in the surrounding areas. The components\n            call for: 1) civil works to install interceptors, and\n            laterals to collect the northern, and southern areas'\n            waste-waters, and in part, the collection of the central\n            area's discharge into the western, and eastern trunk\n            mains; 2) construction, and installation of reinforced\n            concrete pipe for the western trunk main , and related\n            tunnels; 3) installation of the eastern trunk main, to be\n            constructed as a tunnel, to connect to a culvert before\n            reaching the treatment works; 4) waste-water treatment\n            works, to allow an acceptable waste-water quality, to be\n            diluted with surface water, and enable unrestricted\n            irrigation practices in the surrounding areas. Secondary\n            treatment chlorination will dissinfect treated effluents for\n            suitable irrigation purposes, and a further tertiary\n            treatment will be extended if required. Treated effluents,\n            and sludge will be reused for agricultural purposes under\n            the irrigation scheme; 5) strategic operation, and\n            maintenance works will be contracted, under the supervision\n            of the Tehran Sewerage Company (TSC) ; and, 6) technical\n            assistance, to strengthen TSC's capacity, allow private\n            sector participation, and, achieve flexibility for staff deployment."}, "docdt": "2000-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
