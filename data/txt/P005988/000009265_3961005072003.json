DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "3709", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Government of Argentina has\n            undertaken a major reform of economic policy aimed at price\n            stability and sustained economic growth. Measures to focus\n            the state on core public functions and raise the efficiency\n            of revenue mobilization have been essential for improving\n            the fiscal fundamentals. Trade liberalization and the\n            deregulation of domestic markets have improved economic\n            efficiency. These reforms have been strongly encouraged and\n            supported by the World Bank. Complementing earlier public\n            sector reforms, the Bank extended two Public Enterprise\n            Reform Adjustment Loans and a Public Sector Reform Loan\n            (1991-92) along with complementary technical assistance loan\n            (1991). The Government is now in the process of reducing the\n            role of public banks and strengthening private banks. To\n            support these reforms the Bank approved the Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan (FSAL) in February 1993. This report\n            proposes a Capital Market Development Technical Assistance\n            (CMTAP) Project that will help provide term finance from\n            private sources. The Capital Market Development Project will\n            support a backstop facility (BF) that will offer prime-rated\n            banks an option to sell to the BF medium-term US\n            dollar-dominated bonds which will be issued for the purpose\n            of rolling over prior dollar-denominated bonds that those\n            banks had issued to support their longer term loan for\n            productive purposes. A policy and institutional development\n            program agreed between the Government and the bank will help\n            increase market confidence. A complementary technical\n            assistance loan will finance improvements in the capital\n            market supervision and regulation, including enforcement;\n            training of commercial banks to undertake project financing;\n            and implementation of the new, recently approved pension\n            system. These will help improve the policy framework for the\n            project. This report discusses how the project will\n            facilitate the implementation of the capital market\n            development project in an efficient manner by supporting the\n            creation of new institutions and the strengthening of\n            others, by ensuring the development of more effective\n            capital market regulations. In particular, the TA loan will\n            support the institutional strengthening of the securities\n            market regulatory Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV) -- and\n            the reinforcement of security market regulations; b) the\n            implementation of the pension reform legislation that\n            reforms the social security system which promotes the\n            development of independent pension funds and creates a new\n            supervisory agency; and c) early establishment by private\n            training institutions of an advanced progr improve local\n            skills in the area of term financing for investment\n            projects. The project will finance expenditures -- mainly\n            for hiring consultants -- to assist the Government in the\n            following activities: a) developing of the securities\n            markets; b) implementation of the pension and the new\n            pension funds system; c)) training program for long-term\n            financial intermediation; and d) institutional framework for\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "1994-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
