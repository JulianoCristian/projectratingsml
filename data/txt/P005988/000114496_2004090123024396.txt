For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid referred to in paragraph

component of the bid price. Such an increase shall not be taken into account in the 
bid evaluation.
(b)
In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part A, the Fund 
shall use or cause to be used the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the 
Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary

paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first 
payment out of the First Special Account in respect of such contract.
(b)

the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall 
apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of the First Special 
Account, said procedures shall be modified to
ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract together with the other
