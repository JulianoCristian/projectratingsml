CREDIT,TF022723-PHRD-CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "3709", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Capital Market\n            Development Project (CMDP) for Argentina was unsatisfactory,\n            not having met the fundamental capital market objectives; no\n            sustainability can be claimed as only three back-stopping\n            transactions were in fact carried out. As a result of the\n            loan cancellation, the Backstop Fund (BF) is under\n            liquidation; performance was admirable in terms of executive\n            energy, creativity and timeliness. Bank procedures were also\n            made more flexible. Weighing all factors, Bank performance\n            was however deficient in underestimating the risks of low\n            Borrower commitment. Another deficiency can be attributed to\n            the Bank in having been the lead designer of a product\n            ill-suited to high market sensitivity; and the Borrower\n            should have been transparent and articulate in its low\n            enthusiasm for the backstop facility. Inevitably, the\n            resulting managerial inertia caused the backstop product to\n            remain obscure dooming wide market acceptance. Some of the\n            lessons learned included: a) the Bank should be wary of\n            projects which require radical changes to Bank procedures\n            and policies, decision agility and which are to meet the\n            requirements of the fast-moving capital market; b) the\n            shallow interest in the BF concept never strengthened and\n            the desire for a directed credit line was never abandoned.\n            Very few Government of Argentina (GOA) officials came ever\n            to understand the CMDP. From conception through cancellation\n            the leadership for the project was seen to be in the\n            Bank's hands. The GOA twice took the initiative, but in\n            both cases it was, in essence, to propose an abandoning of\n            the longer-term, market-developing and maturity-lengthening\n            functions of the backstop in favor of a short-term,\n            liquidity-providing role; and c) the resulting innovative\n            excitement had two blinding effects. One was that\n            borrower's interests did not receive the priority that\n            they deserved-and were paying for. A second was that\n            technical enthusiasm over the loan probably interfered with\n            the detachment required in a project appraisal."}, "docdt": "1998-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
