Restructuring Project aims\n            to restructure Polish State Railways' (PKP) to increase\n            efficiency, improve finances, and privatize selected\n            activities within a sound regulatory framework. The project\n            consists of three components. The first component will\n            support temporary income support measures, which will be\n            offered as part of the comprehensive restructuring,\n            commercialization, and partial privatization of PKP. These\n            measures are made up of general social benefits from\n            existing general income support programs, and special\n            severance packages anticipated for PKP layoffs. The second\n            component will support the Labor Redeployment Programs,\n            which are made up of re-qualification training as well as\n            professional and social advice and other forms of\n            professional guidance. These include general labor\n            redeployment programs, and special labor redeployment\n            programs anticipated for PKP layoffs. The third component\n            will support technical assistance to advise the Ministry of\n            Transport and the main railway enterprises on the\n            organizational, legal, regulatory, financial, and social\n            aspects of the program."}, "docdt": "2001-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
