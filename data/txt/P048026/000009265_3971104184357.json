agricultural research and extension services by (a)\n            developing location-specific agricultural technology\n            resulting from close consultation with farmers; and (b)\n            improving the technology delivery system. The project\n            consists of two components: agricultural research and\n            extension service. The first component will: 1) strengthen\n            the agricultural research institutions by improving the\n            management information system, priority setting of research\n            programs, and monitoring implementation and evaluating\n            impact; 2) support human resource development by training\n            research scientists, and introduce a results-oriented and\n            performance-based reward system; 3) expand on-farm adaptive\n            research responsive to farmers needs; and 4) provide\n            facilities, infrastructure, and working capital for research\n            institutions. The second component will: 1) strengthen the\n            extension service by decentralizing to the grass roots level\n            and strengthening farmer self-help groups; 2) develop human\n            capital by training extension staff, and implement a reward\n            system based on results and performance; and 3) provide\n            facilities, infrastructure, and working capital for\n            individual participants."}, "docdt": "1997-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
