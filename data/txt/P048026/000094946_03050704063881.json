The design and preparation of\n            these projects must be based on broad-based stakeholder\n            participation, especially the project beneficiaries, and\n            must reflect national priorities, to help establish full\n            borrower ownership. In addition, project preparation should\n            include a thorough institutional and organizational analysis\n            of potential project agencies, to ensure appropriate project\n            implementation arrangements. Major institutional reform and\n            the adoption of new management systems require long-term\n            support and are only possible when there is broad commitment\n            from the borrower. The need for a project coordination unit\n            should be carefully assessed on a project by project basis\n            to ensure line agencies take full responsibility for project\n            implementation. Credit funds should be cancelled judiciously\n            in institutional reform projects, and only after it is\n            certain they will not be needed. The need for technical\n            assistance, especially long term consultancies, must be\n            critically assessed, and where it is needed, it must be\n            fielded on time, and preferably be grant financed. High\n            level training should be undertaken as early as possible in\n            the life of a project."}, "docdt": "2003-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
