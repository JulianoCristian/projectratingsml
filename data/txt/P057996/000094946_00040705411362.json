The report addresses, first, a)\n            legal constraints, namely, the absence of regulatory\n            framework regarding environmental protection, and, b)\n            institutional framework, hindered by weak capacity, lack of\n            technical, and scientific know-how, and the absence of\n            programs to sustain development. Secondly, the EA explores\n            ecological constraints, indicating vast soil, and water\n            erosion, partly due to drainage malpractice, drought, and\n            exhaustive livestock productivity. These adverse impacts,\n            have moreover affected natural habitats, causing\n            deforestation, and bio-degradation. Although the project\n            will be beneficial as a result of improved sanitation, and\n            hygiene, and, in the prevention of endemic diseases,\n            measures to mitigate adversity, call for technical\n            assistance to restore soil, and crop productivity, through\n            reforestation, and rational uses of forestry resources,\n            which would prevent land degradation, and, suggests\n            irrigation practices, to further sustain vegetation. An\n            environmental training component should enhance community\n            participation, assuring agricultural, forestry, and soil\n            conservation best practices, and, institutional capacity\n            should be strengthened to ensure infrastructure maintenance,\n            and adequate management practices."}, "docdt": "2000-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
