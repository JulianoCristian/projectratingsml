improving the\n            living conditions of rural populations in Senegal, through\n            the promotion of decentralized rural development and the\n            strengthening of local governance. There are four components\n            to the project. The first component is the support for\n            decentralized rural development. This component will support\n            and strengthen the institutional, financial and human\n            resource capacity of local government in the rural areas. It\n            includes three clusters of activities. The second component\n            is the Local Investment Fund (LIF). This component will be\n            the mechanism for transferring financial resources to local\n            governments to fund priority public infrastructure micro\n            projects (health and maternity posts, schools, water supply\n            and sanitation, culverts, etc.) identified in their Local\n            Development Plans (LDPs) and Annual Investment Program\n            (AlP). The third component is the community roads program.\n            This component includes three clusters of activities. The\n            first cluster will contribute to improved basic access in\n            the 60 rural community (CR) targeted by the LIF. The second\n            cluster will pilot mechanisms of community road management\n            and maintenance as outlined in the Framework for the\n            national rural transport strategy. The third cluster will\n            assist the department of rural engineering of the ministry\n            of agriculture to better define its mission and reinforce\n            its capacity to assume responsibility for environmental\n            aspects of the project. Finally, the fourth component is the\n            project coordination, monitoring, and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1999-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
