In Senegal, poverty is essentially a rural\n            phenomenon. In addition, over the 1990s agriculture\n            stagnated; attributed in part to limited basic\n            infrastructure, continued state involvement in subsectors,\n            poor quality farm support services, and a lack of\n            empowerment of rural populations in planning, financing and\n            managing local development. In its strategy for development\n            and poverty reduction, the government identified\n            decentralization as critical to improving the living\n            conditions of rural populations. The National Rural\n            Infrastructure Project was designed as the first\u0096or testing\n            phase\u0096of a potentially 12-year program to help strengthen\n            rural Senegal\u0092s local governments and their ability to\n            operate and maintain infrastructure investments \u0096 starting\n            with the building of roads. In addition to institutional\n            support, IDA provided financing for local investments."}, "docdt": "2007-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
