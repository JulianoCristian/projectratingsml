        outcome was highly satisfactory, the sustainability was\n            likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project: To be\n            effective, decentralization must be multi-sectoral. It is\n            therefore not practical to anchor such a project within a\n            technical ministry. Decentralization is a long-term and\n            comprehensive effort that requires political support. The\n            major changes expected are likely to meet resistance from\n            some institutions. Therefore considerable effort is needed\n            for new systems to be established and officials to be\n            educated and convinced to accept changes. The NRIP has shown\n            that the planning process of Government needed to be\n            modified to use a bottom-up approach. To support this type\n            of multi-faceted decentralization program, the importance of\n            the multi-disciplinary team involved in project supervision\n            was critical in achieving project objectives. Sustainability\n            depends on the degree to which the beneficiaries internalize\n            the process. The ability to continue the planning,\n            implementing and monitoring of investments using\n            participatory processes depends on the continuing to raise\n            funds and maintain community mobilization."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
