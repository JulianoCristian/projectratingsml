investment plans.  The principal objectives of the\n            project are to: (i) strengthen the four participating RTOs\n            to enable them to compete effectively by improving\n            productivity and quality of service; (ii) further strengthen\n            project management and the preparation and implementation of\n            sound operational and action plans; and (iii) put the\n            railways on the path towards financial viability through\n            tariff revenues.  On the recommendation of the Bank, the\n            investment plans have been divided into two parts:  Part A\n            consisting of investments which are to proceed as scheduled\n            and which comprise the project; and Part B containing items\n            which will be carried out only after their technical and\n            economic justification has been demonstrated to the\n            satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank.  The principal\n            components of the project are: (i) track overhaul; (ii)\n            procurement of traction and rolling stock; (iii)\n            installation of modern signalling and telecommunications;\n            (iv) electrification; (v) reconstruction of stations; (vi)\n            integrated transport facilities; and (vii) training and\n            technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
