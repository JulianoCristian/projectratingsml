outcomes of the project were unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            changes at the federal level, which are beyond the control\n            of the borrower, can have a major impact on the outcome of\n            sub-national projects. The project's implementation was\n            severely affected by the unstable macroeconomic conditions\n            that prevailed in the late 1990s and eventually resulted in\n            the country's collapse in December 2001. Likewise, the\n            program was negatively affected by periodic strikes, chronic\n            teacher absenteeism, and many other structural weaknesses of\n            the Province of Buenos Aires (PBA) educational system. The\n            experience of this project indicates that\n            'vertical' interventions focusing on individual\n            schools need to be complemented with 'horizontal'\n            interventions with a cross-cutting impact throughout the\n            education sector. The project effectiveness and overall\n            impact will have significantly improved if an intensive\n            cross fertilization and systematic learning strategy had\n            been conceived as part of the project's design. Such\n            strategy will have permitted the identification and\n            dissemination of best practices within participating schools\n            and the PBA in general through training, workshops,\n            seminars, technical assistance, demonstration events,\n            conventions, and publications. The project's design and\n            implementation strategy included clear targeting criteria to\n            focus project activities in schools serving primarily high\n            risk students to improve the equity of the basic general\n            education system in then PBA. This helped ensure that the\n            project benefited the intended population."}, "docdt": "2009-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
