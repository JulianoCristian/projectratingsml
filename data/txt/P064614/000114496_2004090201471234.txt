Resolution No. 3510 dated August 22, 2002 in which the “full day schedule” was modified and renamed 
as “extended daily schedule”, extending the daily school schedule in EGB3 schools in 90 minutes, instead

(o) 
"School and Parents’ Guide" means the guide for parents, teachers and school directors, 
referred to in Section 3.07 of this Agreement, for the implementation of the Extended Day Schedule;” 
 
 
2. 
Section 3.01 is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: 
 
“Section 3.01.  The Borrower declares its commitment to the objectives of the Project, and, to this 
end, shall carry out the Project, through DGCyE, with due diligence and efficiency and in conformity 
with the Provincial Resolution No. 3510 dated August 22, 2002, and with appropriate financial, 
administrative, engineering, environmental, and educational practices, and shall provide, promptly as 
needed, the funds, facilities, services and other resources required for the Project.” 
 
3. 
Section 3.07 is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: 
 
“Section 3.07.  The Borrower, through DGCyE, shall prepare a pedagogical and technical 
information guide on the Extended Day Schedule (the School and Parents’ Guide) for the Selected EGB3 
Schools, satisfactory to the Bank, said guide to include,
