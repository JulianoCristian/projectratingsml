The\n            components include: 1) creation of additional school spaces\n            under the basic general education for grades 7-9 (EGB3),\n            expanding the number of hours, to develop and apply a new\n            pedagogical model of the \"Jornada completa\" (full\n            time schedule), to the poorest urban districts. Classrooms\n            will be rehabilitated in about one hundred and sixty five\n            EGB3 schools, reducing the persistent overcrowding in many\n            urban school facilities. Civil works will be performed in\n            accordance to the master plan, designed following the\n            Government's standards, and regulations; 2) provision\n            of pedagogic equipment, and services, such as school\n            libraries, science and language laboratories, and learning\n            material, for innovative implementation of the full time\n            schedule; 3) local and international seminars, and workshops\n            which would provide support for autonomous school\n            management, and projects in selected EGB3 schools; and 4)\n            complementary financing of the current Project Unit, already\n            implementing other operations, to finance staff for civil\n            works, accounting, procurement, and, technical assistance\n            and training in management, and information technology."}, "docdt": "2000-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
