and outcomes. The\n            project's overall outcome was therefore rated as\n            satisfactory. The general lessons learned from this project\n            are: Public administration reforms require serious\n            government commitment and ownership and are likely to\n            succeed if they are homegrown. Reforms that require\n            coordination between several agencies require a change in\n            work practices and culture. The single-tranche disbursement\n            mechanism provides a clear understanding of the prior\n            actions that the government needs to undertake. The\n            country-specific lessons include: Coordination among\n            agencies to achieve a common objective or goal is difficult\n            in practice especially in Yemen. In a country with\n            relatively low technical capacity, a policy-based adjustment\n            credit also needs to be complemented by technical assistance\n            that supports all affected agencies. The other lessons\n            learned is to set realistic objectives that are clearly\n            associated with Credit conditionality. Moreover, major\n            changes are needed for the future: a focus on outcomes; a\n            focus on poverty reduction objectives in setting expenditure\n            priorities; greater attention to incentives, competition,\n            and public participation; more access to technical\n            assistance in implementation of certain areas; and engaging\n            civil society and political leadership in owning and\n            pursuing reforms to ensure sustainability overtime."}, "docdt": "2001-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
