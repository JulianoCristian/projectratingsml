"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Public Sector Management Adjustment\n            Credit Project aims to a) begin to redefine the role of the\n            state to focus attention and resources on essential\n            functions while developing an incentive framework for civil\n            servants to carry out their new mandates; b) strengthen\n            budget implementation, monitoring, and control by\n            introducing new procedures and systems for monitoring\n            expenditures and for increasing the transparency and\n            coherency of budgetary procedures; and c) improve the\n            efficiency, effectiveness, and poverty focus of public\n            expenditures; and d) improve the tax administration system\n            to increase transparency and enhance and diversify domestic\n            resource mobilization. Potential benefits include improved\n            management of Yemen's economy, modernization of human\n            resource and financial management practices, support to\n            private sector development by starting to reduce cumbersome\n            bureaucracy; and improved public services. More appropriate\n            allocations of public resources will also benefit the\n            population as a whole, and the poor in particular, who\n            currently suffer from the lack of coherence in the public\n            expenditure program targeted to and delivery of essential\n            services such as public health, education, and safety net programs."}, "docdt": "1999-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
