The\n            Institutional Development for Public Administration Project\n            (IDPAP) had the following ratings: highly unsatisfactory\n            outcome, unlikely sustainability, negligible institutional\n            development impact, unsatisfactory Bank performance, and\n            highly unsatisfactory Borrower performance. The Legal and\n            Judicial Development Project had the following ratings:\n            moderately unsatisfactory outcome, unlikely sustainability,\n            modest institutional development impact, unsatisfactory Bank\n            performance, and satisfactory Borrower performance. The\n            Public Sector Management Adjustment Project had the\n            following ratings: moderately unsatisfactory outcome,\n            unlikely sustainability, modest institutional development\n            impact, moderately satisfactory Bank performance, and\n            moderately satisfactory Borrower performance. Experience\n            with these projects highlights the following lessons: (a)\n            when the project environment changes dramatically, the Bank\n            must be ready to restructure key projects in the portfolio;\n            (b) the Bank must be more prepared to stay the course in\n            critical governance sectors; and (c) reforms need to be\n            supported with experienced staff based in the Yemen field office."}, "docdt": "2006-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
