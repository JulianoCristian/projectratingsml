   IEGMission: Enhancingdevelopment effectivenessthrough excellence and Independence inevaluation.

About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activities of theWorld Bankfor two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank's work is producingthe
expected results, andsecond, to helpdevelopimproveddirections, policies, and procedures throughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGannually assessesabout 25 percent of the
Bank's lendingoperations. Inselecting operationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento thosethat are innovative,
large, or complex: thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations:those for which Executive
Directorsor Bank managementhaverequestedassessments: and those that are likelyto generate importantlessons.
The projects, topics, andanalytical approachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluationstudies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion
Report (a self-evaluationby the responsibleBankdepartment)and fieldworkconductedby IEG. To prepare
PPARs, IEGstaff examine projectfiles and other documents, interview operationalstaff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for onsite discussionswith projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to
validate and augment the informationprovidedin the ICR, as well as examine issuesof special interestto broader
IEGstudies.
       EachPPAR is subject to a peer review process and IEG managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
PPAR is reviewedby the responsibleBank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrowerfor review: the borrowers' comments are attached to the documentthat is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has beensent to the Board,it is disclosedto the public.

About the IEG Rating System
       The time-tested evaluationmethodsused by IEG are suitedto the broad rangeof the World Bank's work. The
methodsoffer both rigorand a necessarylevelof flexibilityto adapt to lendinginstrument,projectdesign,or
sectoralapproach. IEG evaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto arriveat their project ratings. Followingis
the definitionand rating scale used for each evaluationcriterion(moreinformationis availableon the IEGwebsite:
http://worldbank.org/lEG/eta-mainpage. html).
       Relevance of Objectives: The extentto whichthe project's objectivesare consistentwith the country's
currentdevelopment prioritiesandwith currentBank countryand sectoral assistancestrategiesand corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategyPapers,CountryAssistanceStrategies,Sector Strategy Papers,

       Efficacy: The extent to which the project'sobjectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relativeimportance. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to whichthe project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the
opportunitycost of capitaland benefitsat leastcost compared to alternatives. Possibleratings: High, Substantial,
Modest,Negligible.This rating is not generallyappliedto adjustment operations.
       Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possibleratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely,HighlyUnlikely, Not Evaluable.
       lnstitutionalDevelopment Impact: The extent to which a projectimprovesthe ability of a countryor region
to make moreefficient, equitableand sustainableuse of its human, financial, and naturalresourcesthrough: (a)
betterdefinition,stability,transparency,enforceability,and predictabilityof institutionalarrangementsand/or (b)
better alignmentof the missionand capacityof an organizationwith its mandate, which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact inaludes bothintendedand unintendedeffects of a
project.Possibleratings: High, Substantial,Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto be
achieved, efficiently.Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately

Preface

        This report evaluates two investment credits andone adjustment credit to the
Republico fYemen over the period 1989to 2000, inthe field o f governance. The first
operation i s the InstitutionalDevelopmentfor Public Administration Project, financed by a
credit o f $10.8 million, approved in 1989 andclosed in1998. The second is the Legal and
Judicial Development Project financed by a credit o f $2.5 million. Itwas approved inJune,
1999, andclosed four years later, inJune, 2003. The thirdoperation i s the Public Sector
Management Adjustment Credit, a quick disbursing operation of $50 million approved in
1999 andclosed inMarch, 2000. The projects were designed andimplementedas part o f a
country strategy which recognizedthe importance o f governance ingood development
outcomes inYemen.

        The PPAR was preparedbythe Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) building
upon ImplementationCompletion Reports, project documents, and related documents.
An IEGmissionvisitedYemen inJuly 2005 to prepare the Country Assistance
Evaluation, for which this PPARwas an input. It held discussions with Government
officials, business andcivil society representatives anddonors on the impact of the three
projects. Their assistance, along with that o fthe staff o fthe resident mission inSana'a, is
gratefully acknowledged.

        The Bank'sRegionalManagement hadno comments.

        A draftreportwas sent to the Government ofYemen for comment, andtheir
comments are attached as Annex B.

        This report was prepared byMr.Mike Stevens (Consultant), who assessedthese
projects inJuly 2005, underthe supervision o fMr.ChadLeechor (Task Manager).

Summary

 1.      The objectives o fthese three projects were sensible: to buildcapacity by
strengtheningcivil service traininginstitutions, to support the rule o flawbytraining
judges andclerks andreviewinglaws, andto initiate a process o f civil service andpublic
financial management modernization. For the most part, designs were sound andproject
components were appropriate. However, the environment inwhich they were
implemented provedexceptionally challenging, underminedoutcomes andcompromised
sustainability. Government commitment was variable. Better project supervisioncould
have mitigatedthis, butnot hlly.

2.      The InstitutionalDevelopment for Public Administration Project (IDPAP) was a
conventional capacity buildingproject, financing the strengthening o fthe country's main
civil service training centre andinitiating some mostlyrelevant studies. The project also
financed investment ina manpower data system. Onthe face of it, the project was an
appropriate first operation bythe Bankincivil service reform inYemen. However,
events, inthe form o fthe unification o fNorthand SouthYemen, the suddenreturn from
the Gulfo fYemeni guest workers inthe first Gulfwar, and an internal civil war
propelledthe civil service on a steep upwardpatho f staffing growth, causing payrolls to
become fiscally .unsustainable, andwhen adjustment came, pay structures collapsed. This
made the project's modest capacity buildinggoals untenable.

3.      The project shouldhave beenrestructuredmuch earlier thaninits closing stages.
Soon after the project started, the Government, faced with unification andother political
andsecurity challenges, putcivil service reform onthebackburner andrevertedto
patronage appointments andusingthe public payroll as a social securitynet. Onits part,
the Bankshould have hada stronger dialogue withthe Government onwage billcontrol
andpublic employment policy. Itdidnot, andwhenthe project ended, the goalo fcivil
service modernization seemedmore distant thanwhen it started.

4.      The Legal andJudicial DevelopmentProject (LJDP) was a modest "testing o f the
waters" for more intensive future support for this key governance sector, comprising
training o f clerks andjudges andreview o f laws. Onthe arrival o f anewjustice minister,
critical o fthe project and Banksupport, the Bankbacked away from the sector and
cancelled the plannedfollow-up operation. This left Ministry of Justice andMinistry o f
LegalAffairs officials, who hadbeenrunningthe project effectively, without external
support, andwill make re-engagement inthis sector more difficult inthe future. The
Bankshould have taken a longerview andremained engagedinthe sector.

5.      The Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit (PSMAC) was the third
adjustment credit extended to Yemen, since economic stabilization began inthe mid
1990s. Itwas also the last (to date) becausethe Government's fiscal grip slackened, and,
with risingoilprices, Yemen's need for balance o fpayments support diminished.
PSMAC, with its delayed companiontechnical assistance credit--Civil Service
ModernizationProject (CSMP) which remains active today, took up the civil service
reform challenge that the IDPAPhad first embraced a decade earlier, but ina more
comprehensive way. The program o f civil service and financial management reforms

                                             X


that PSMAChelped launch had innovative features. Itwas developed ina consultative
way and this made for initially strong local ownership.

6.     However, although PSMACwas successfully disbursed, the program o f civil
service modernizationit supported was slow to get offthe ground, due principally to a
weakening ofpolitical commitment and, again, a change o fminister. This time, the Bank
stayed with the program, but there was rapid turnover o ftask team leaders, and
supervision fiom Washingtonwas spasmodic. Although the project madeprogress, albeit
slower thananticipated, at the technical level, the manpowerdata system that the project
financed revealed that total civil service employment was continuingto grow at an
unsustainable rate, rendering nugatory efforts to create fiscal space for pay reform and
"right size" government byorderlyretrenchment. Inthe PSMACproject document, the
Bankrightly stressedrisksandtheneedto see civil service reformover a longtime span.
Butas numbers grew, realpayeraded, andthe civil service fragmented into donor
protected pay enclaves. This threw into question the viability o fthe reform model. Bank
supervision missions for the CSMF came to see this, but hadno answer other thanto
press the Government to implement the programas designed.

7.     Lessons o fgeneral applicability include:

       Moving quicklyto restructure theproject when country circumstances change,
       andnewfactors emergewhichthreatenprojectoutcomes andrequireaddressing.

       Stayingthe course incritical governance sectors, evenwhen reformchampions
       are replacedbynew leadershiplukewarm to project objectives.

 1.       Introduction

 POLITICALBACKGROUND GOVERNANCE    AND

 1.1      Until1990Yemenwas, inrecenttimes, two countries, comprisingtheYemenArab
 Republic WAR)or North Yemen, andthe PeoplesDemocratic Republic o fYemen (PDRY)
 or South Yemen. Though ithadbeenunderthe suzerainty o fthe OttomanEmpire, North
 Yemenhadbeenanindependent state since, ruledby its traditional leader, the Imam, until
 overthrown inacoup in 1962. Although substantial militaryandtechnical assistancewas
providedby Egyptto YAR's government, its governance remainedtraditional incharacter,
 andthe sizeo fitspublic sectorwas small. Manyofthe institutions ofmoderngovernance
were absentandpublic administration andfinancial management systemswere onlypartly
 developed. The YAR's president since 1978 was H.E.Ali Abdulla Saleh, now President of
the Government o fYemen. Bycontrast, SouthYemenhadbeenadministered since the
early nineteenth century bythe British, who valued theport o f Aden at the moutho fthe Red
 Sea as animportant coaling station onthe searouteto India. They established Britishstyle
governance institutions inthe capital, but rule over the rest o fthe country was largely
indirect. The colonialperiodended abruptly in1967, and a socialist republic was
establishedshortly thereafter. The latter initiated a rapidexpansion o fthe public sector,
mainlythroughthe creationofstateownedenterprises.

 1.2      In1990the two partsofYemenwere unifiedandthe Governmento fYemenwas
formed, with its capital in Sana'a. The new country adopted a democratic constitution,
which provided for free elections andan independentjudiciary. With unification came the
needto fuse the two civil services. Although the South's populationwas much smaller, its
civil service was larger, and on the whole better endowed with technical andmanagerial
skills. Unification, however, ledto duplicationor organizations and functions. This
propelled civil service expansion andwage billgrowth which have continueduntilthis
day. Inthe past decade the civil service wage bill share o f GDP has varied between 11-15
percent o f GDP, an exceptionallyhighratio for a poor country.'

1.3       Public sector employmentwas given a further boost bythe unexpected return o f
some 800,000 Yemenis who were expelled from GulfStates in 1991because o fYemen's
alignment with Iraqduringthe first Gulfwar. Social andpolitical pressures made the
government absorb manyo ftheminto the civil service, causing further expansion.

1.4      In1994ashort butviolent civilwarbrokeout, whichprecipitatedaneconomic
crisis. The Government tried to relieve social hardshipthrough public sector job creation.
Since then, Yemen has beenmore peaceful, though security continues to be anissue.
After September 11,2001, geopolitical factors have increasingly conditionedthe political
environment inthe region. The country's military and security forces are, consequently,
aninfluential factor inthe political equation.




1.Yemenuses abroaddefinition ofthe civil service, which includes all government employees, suchas
administrators, teachers, health workers, police, and staff on the payrolls o f subvented agencies and state
enterprises. The only major exclusion i s the armed forces. Evenso, the ratio is muchhigher than in
countries with similar per capita income levels, where 8-9 percent o fGDP would be considered high.

                                             2


1.5     Although Yemenhas a democratic constitutionwith periodic elections, political
power is exercisedbybuildingalliances andbalancing the interests oftribal leaders,
political andbusinesselites andother important power centers.' The Presidentandmany
government leadershave committedthemselvesto modernization. However, the space for
reform is highlyconstrained. Reformers must contendwith the conservatismo f elites,
tradition mindedreligious andtriballeaders, vestedinterests inthe status quo, a fi-agile
social balanceand ever present security concerns. This has important implications for the
designo fBankfinanced projects andhow their implementation is supervised.

1.6     Corruptionis systemic inYemen andthe country was groupedinthe bottom quintile
ofthe latestWorldBankInstituterankingofcountry governanceconditions. Corruption is
also achallengeto the civil service, where informal practicesundermine formal rulesof
public financial management,includingprocurement. A contributory factor hasbeenthe
erosionofrealpay inthe civil serviceduring the 199Os, dueto therapid expansionof
numbers andhighannualratesofinflation. For low level civil servants, pay andallowances
arebelow alivingwage, andhavebecome, ineffect, a form of socialrelief, withpredictable
effectsonproductivity. Formiddleandprofessional grade civil servantsofficialpay is a
fiaction ofwhat the same skills commandinthe modernprivate sector. Since across the

Economics

1.7     The services sectori sthe largestcontributor to GDP inYemen, followedby
industry andagriculture. Oilbeganto beexportedinthe 1980sinmoderateamounts, and
is the mainsource o frevenueto the Government. However, Yemen's reservesare
modest. Productionhas alreadypeaked, andisnow on adeclining trend, currently masked
byhighinternational oilprices. Scarcity ofwater limitsagricultural production; indeed,
mucho fpresentproduction is unsustainable,beingfed byfossil groundwater, withwater
tables dangerously falling.

 1.8     Duringtheperiod 1991-94realGDP growth averaged4.1 percentper annum,
notwithstandingthe three shocks to the economy causedbyunification, the returnofthe
 GulfYemenis, andthe civilwar. These ledto severeeconomic imbalances, withrising
 fiscal deficits, ahighrate ofinflation, anda deteriorating external position. A turning
point came in 1995whenthe Government adopted a stabilization andeconomic reform
program, whichwas supportedby aIMFStand-byProgram and a IDA Economic Reform
 Credit. Growthacceleratedto 8.3 percentper annumbetween 1995 and 1997, but
 declinedto an averageof4.6 percent for the rest o fthe decade, andhasremained at
 around 4 percent since then. Population growth remainsrapid at over 3 percent. Inrecent
 years increasinginternational oil prices haveboostedgovernmentrevenues and

estimated that the non-oil primary deficit will needto improve by approximately 2 percent

1.9       Growth prospects reside chiefly inagriculture, fishing, tourism and.manufacturing,
butfor these sectorsto realizetheir potentialrequires policyreform andsupportive
infrastructure investments. Domestic andregional security issues are inhibitingthe
growth o ftourism. Excessive andarbitraryregulations inhibit industry andcommerce,
there are difficulties insecuring landtitle, andthe unpredictable and slow performance o f
the legal andjudicial system hanns the investment climate. Furthermore, the generally
weak capacity ofthe government to provide basic health and education services holds
back humanresource development.

1.10      Against this background, addressing shortcomings ofthe legal andjudicial system,
andmoving forwardwith far reachingpublic sector management reforms, to improve
government performance inpolicy making, regulationand service delivery, are seento be
critical to securing fbture prosperity inYemen. This provides the context andjustification
for the three IDA operations evaluated inthis PPAR.

 2.       InstitutionalDevelopment for PublicAdministration
          Project

 BACKGROUND OVERVIEW
                   AND

 2.1      The InstitutionalDevelopment for Public Administration Project (IDPAP) was
 approvedbythe Board o f IDA inMay 1989 andclosed inDecember 1997.' The credit
 amount was $10.8 million, andthe total size ofthe project was $15.4 million. The project
 was designed to strengthen the civil service o fone country, the Yemen Arab Republic
 (YAR) or NorthYemen, butvery quickly found itselfcopingwith capacitybuildingina
 civil service twice the size. Theproject was unsuccessful indoingthis, due partlyto the
 events which followed unification, but also because o f failures o f design and
 implementation, the fault o fboththe Bankandthe Borrower.

 2.2     Until1962, NorthYemenhadbeenatribal stategovernedbyitstraditionalruler,
 theImam. There was no civilservice inanyrecognizable sense o fthe term-officials were
 appointed by the ruler, mostly to collect taxes and ensure law and order. There was little
 service delivery, education was inthe handso freligious schools andhealth services were
 rudimentary. SouthYemen, by contrast, hadbeenunder colonialrule for more than a
 century, untilthe departure o fthe British in 1967.

 2.3     For the first eight years o f its existence the YAR was embroiledincivil war, with
 anEgyptianexpeditionaryarmytied down infightingloyalist forces andother elements
 resistingcentral authority. There were also many Egyptiancivilians occupying positions
 as administrators, healthworkers andteachers (reportedly as manyas 30,000 at its peak).

 2.4     I t was only when conflict had endedthat the new government could turnits
 attention to buildinginstitutions o fmodernpublic administration, which it proceeded to
 do. In 1972 the Central PlanningOrganizationwas established, and the YARbegan an era
o fFive Year Plans -as practiced bymanyother developing countries at that time. A civil
 service bureau was created andthe main sector ministries were formed. In1981the
bureauwas upgraded to the Ministryo f Civil Service andAdministrative Reform
(MoCSAR). In 1988 a Civil Service Code was enacted. At the same time, the civil
service grew, from 25,000 in 1980to 63,000 in 1988, and continued expanding.

2.5      MoCSAR came into existence with a conventionalmandate: to establishpersonnel
procedures and ensure their applicationacross government, to develop a training strategy,
andto approve ministerial anddepartmental organizationalstructures. Itsbroader purpose
was to spearhead the modernizationo fpublic administration inthe YAR.

2.6      However, there were formidable obstacles to dischargingthis mandate. Inthe first
place, there was a shortage o f qualifiedmanpower inthe civil service, necessitating heavy
reliance on expatriates from other Arab countries, especially Egypt. These expatriates
were often inefficiently utilized. There was a lack o f clarity inministerial mandates,

3. Although there is goodproject documentation, notably an excellent Implementation Completion Report
(ICR), the project design teamis no longer on staff, and few ingovernmentcouldrememberthe project, or
the circumstances inwhich it was designed.

                                                        6


    organizational structures, andauthorized staffing levels. Manyof the policies and
    proceduresfor effective managementof a civil service, suchas open and competitive
    recruitment basedonclearjob descriptions, proceduresfor the annualreviewo f staff
    performance andpromotiononmeritwere either absent or stillbeingput inplace. Most
    critically, MoCSAR itself lacked staffwith the skills to spearheadchange andbringinto
    beingamoderncivil service.

    2.7      At the same time, at the policylevelthe governmentrecognizedthe importance o f
    modernizing public institutions, andassignedit highpriority inthe country's Third Five
    Year Plan(1987-91). Consequently, the Government approachedthe Bankwitharequest
    for civil service capacity building.

    DESIGN,IMPLEMENTATIONAND OUTCOME

    2.8      The projectwas designedas aninvestment operation, blending constructionand
    equipmentoffacilities withtechnicalassistanceandtraining. Thetotalcostoftheprojectwas
    $15.1 million, ofwhich the IDA Creditportionwas $10.8 million. Therewere two main
    beneficiaries: MoCSAR andNlPA(later renamedNationalInstituteofAdministrative
    Sciences-NIAS). ForMoCSARtheprojectwas to financethe installation o fapersonnel
    managementinformationsystem(MIS) andthe constructionof abuildingto houseit, staff
    fellowships, mostly abroad, andconsultancystudies incriticalpolicy areas. NIPAwas to
    benefit h masimilarmix o fcapacitybuildinginterventionS. These includedthe expansionof
    theInstitute's facilities inSaua'a andthe ConstructionofaregionalcampusinIbbwith

    provisionofexpahiateTA to filthegapwhile nationalstaffwereabroadontraining, and
    studiesto helpNTPAdevelopitsownconsultancycapacityandtoplanitsfirture.

    2.9      Inthisrespect, theprojectwassimilartoothercivilservicecapacitybuildingprojects
    o ftheperiod.. The BankelsewherehadsupportedcivilservicetraininginstitutionSlike
    NIpA.4Althoughnowadaysdonorsare averseto longtamtrainingfellowships abroad, itwas
    anaccepted vehicle ofcapacitybuildingtwo or three decadesago, andhadproveneffective in
    manycountries. Thepolicy studieswhichaccompaniedthisheavyinputoftraining
    fellowships wereto becarriedoutbyoutsideconsultants, as away ofbringingcontemporary
    practiceto Yemen. Fivetopicswere eventuallydecidedupon: manpowerplanning,job
    classification, wages policy, recordsmanagement,andtrainingpolicy.

    2.10     Onthe face of it, this was areasonableset ofpolicy studies. Althoughmanpower
    planningis no longer infashion, itwas normalpractice, particularly ifthe country hadalso
    embraceddevelopmentplanning into whose five year plansmanpower planningcouldbe
    integrated. Yemen seriously lackedcivil service capacity. Skill gaps required
    quantification and, consistent with the planningparadigm, reflectedinpublic investment
    intraining institutions.' Ifstaffwereto bematchedagainstpositionsaccordingto

    4. For example, the Bank financed a similar mixture offacilities and staffcapacity building for the
    BangladeshPublic Administration Training Centre and the Malawi Institute ofManagement.
    5. Manpower planning, as practiced inthose days, entailed the projection ofprivate and public sectors'
    needs for skilled manpower and the shaping o fpublic investment inthe education system to meet those
    needs. Inmany countries it was associatedwiththe assignmentoftraining institution graduates to positions
    inthepublicsector, typicallyleavingtheresidualto theprivatesector,andaccompaniedbyanational

                                                    7


qualifications and experience, there neededto be a system o fjob descriptions classified
for pay and gradingpurposes. Inturn, this calledfor a salary structure and awages policy
for the civil service. Records management is essential for well functioning public
administration, andthe projectwas one o f the first inthe Bankto recognize this dimension
o f civil service modernization. NIPA needed a training policy so that a more strategic
approach couldbe taken to the curriculum (which undulyemphasized long duration
accreditation courses, mostly pre-entry, over more functionally specific short courses to
upgrade existing staff skills-a situation which prevails also today). The range o fthese
studies demonstrates the interconnectedness o f civil service reforms, andthe design o fthe
project seemedappropriate to the circumstances o f Yemen's civil service at the time.

2.11      The project got offto a slow start, notwithstandingthe creation o ftwo Project
ImplementationUnits (PIUS),one inMoCSAR and one inNPA. However, very quickly
IDPAP'Sdesign assumptions were overtakenby events. While the project's capacity
buildingobjectivewas relevant, the means to achieve it failed to weather events and
proveddeficient.

2.12      The first change inthe project environment was the unification o fNorth and South
Yemen, in 1990. This meant the fusion o f two hitherto distinct public administrations.
This was a challengingundertakinggiventhe differentbureaucratic histories o fthe two
countries, andthe fact that SouthYemen, although smaller inpopulation, had abigger
public sector. Inparticular, SouthYemen had a large number o f overstaffed and loss
makingstate ownedenterprises (SOEs). Ministries were mergedandtheir staffing was
greatly expanded. Evenifthe technical capacity had existed to rationalize structures and
staffing levels, political conditions made the avoidance o f organizational duplication and
over manninga secondary consideration.

2.13      The secondmajor disruptionto theproject was the return o fabout 800,000 Yemeni
workers fiomthe Gulfin1991, This was aconsequenceo fthe YemenGovernment's
decisionnot to alignthe country withthe US ledcoalitionto expel kaqi forces fiomKuwait,
anditresultedinthe GulfStates expellingYemeni guestworkers. Their exodusplacedhuge
pressureonthe government to providejobs inthe public sector. This provedirresistible, and
the size o fthe civil service increasedrapidlywiththe hiringo flarge numberso funskilled
workers, mostly surplus to departmentalrequirementse6

2.14      The third event was the eruption o f a short but violent civil war in1994. Security
concerns andthe war's economic consequences drew policymakers even further away
fiom the civil service modernization agenda, andproject implementation.

2.15     Facedwith laggingdisbursements and an altered context for reform, the Bank
initiated a restructuringo fthe project in 1995. The services o f a local consultingfirm,


incomes policy to prevent skilledworkers inshort demand exploiting their monopoly advantage to bidup
wages.
6. The civil service doubledinthe 1990s. Yemen uses abroad definition-the    term encompasses allpublic
employees includingteachers, healthworkers, central and provincial administrations, state ownedenterprise
employees, and polic-veryone       except the armedforces and militia. In 1990, after amalgamation, the
total size ofthe civil service was 168,000. By 1999it hadrisento 352,000, by 2003 to 430,000 andby2005
to 475,000.

                                             8


Pan-YemenConsultant Services, were enlisted. Pragmaticallythe firm recommended
focusing the project onthose elementswhichhadthe greatest chanceofbeingcompleted
byproject closure, scheduledfor December 1997. As aresult, $3 millionofthe credit was
cancelled.

2.16   As the ImplementationCompletionreport (ICR) tells it,the project was
restructured aroundthe following priority areas:

        Support for simplification of administrative systems andprocedures
        Restructuringofkeyministries
        Reformo f Civil Servicepersonnelmanagement
        Establishmentofthe MIS, linkingMoCSAR to other keyministries
        Selectedstudies
        N I A S (as NPA was renamed) staff developmentthrough fellowships
        Support to N I A S inresearchandconsultancy methods
        Development of a longterm trainingplan
        Constructionof facilities inSana'a andIbb
        Substituteteacherswhile N I A S staffwere away ontraining.

2.17    At the same time, theBankdecidedto intensify itssupervision, whichhadsuffered
from lack o fArabic speakinglocal staff, due to the absence ofaresident mission, and
infrequentvisits fiom Washington-basedstaff.

2.18    While this was a sensible focusing ofproject efforts, very littlewas achieved. No
discemablesimplification ofproceduresoccurred. Some computerswere provided for the
MIS inMoCSAR, but not linkedto other ministries (this i s now happeningunder a new
project, the Civil ServiceModernization Project-CSMP). There was no restructuringo f
keyministries (studies are currently underwayunder the CSMP). Trainingtook place, but
there waspoor selection ofcandidates, coursecontentwas often inappropriate, andwhen
trainees returned, they were oftenpostedtojobs unrelatedto their training. Buildings
were completed, but furniture was notprovided. Fundswere diverted, procurement was
irregular, contractor arrears accumulated, andthe Bankhadto ask the Government to
refund money stolenby the project director who abscondedto Egypt. The building
constructed for MoCSARto housethe MISwas ultimately occupiedbyministry officials,
not bycomputers andtheir operatives(CSMP is now addressingthis deficiency). The
studies were undertaken, but they were o funeven quality. The manpower planning,
wages policyandjob classification studies were generic, insufficiently linkedto Yemen
conditions and couldnot beimplemented. The recordsmanagement study andthe training
planwere donewellbutnot actedupon. Out ofthe total credit of$10.6 million, actual
utilization was $9.6 million, andthe project was closed at the endofDecember 1998, two
andahalfyears later thanenvisagedat appraisal.

2.19     As acapacity buildingproject, the IDPAPsignally failedto achieveits objectives.
Other thanthe bricks andmortar of anew office building for MoCSAR andthe additions
to N U S ' S facilities inSana'a andthe new campus at Ibb, there i s little to show for the
project. N U S itselfcontinuesto focus on longpre-service courses, compensatingfor the
deficiencies ofthe national education system, rather than supplying functionally relevant

                                                      9


short courses for existing civil servants. The easy explanationis that the project's failure
was inevitable given the unforeseen events that changed the project environment-the
unification o fNorthandSouthYemen, requiringthe rapid amalgamation o fthe two
administrations, the suddenreturn o f Yemenis from the Gulfandthe explosion incivil
service numbers, anda civilwar.

2.20      But theprojectwouldhave encounteredproblems even ifthese eventshadnot
happened. There was weak ownership andinsufficient understanding o f thebroader civil
service modernization agendaitwas supposedto support. Specifically:

               There was no clear vision o fthe sort o f civil service Yemen sought to create,
               andthus no roadmap to get there
          0   MoCSARwas unengaged inthe studies andunwillingto implement their
               findings
               There was mistrust between MoCSARandNIPA/NIAS (which was to surface
               again under the CSMP).
              Neither MoCSARnor NIPA/NIAS effectively supervised the PlUs which spent
               the project's money, but had little interest inthe outcomes.
          0    Bank supervision was weak andineffective, untiltoo lateinthe life o fthe
              project  .
2.21      Given the obvious need for capacity buildinginthe civil service, whether o fthe
YAR or ofthe combinedNorthandSouthYemen, how shouldhave the Bankproceeded?

2.22      Withhindsightthe modelofcivil service capacity buildingthe Bankwas tryingto
apply inYemen was deficient. Buildingcivil service training capacity and financing
overseas study fellowships for keyministry staffwas something donors (less so the Bank
since at the time it didnot lendfor civil service capacity building) had done a great deal o f
inthe first decadeofindependence inmanypoor countries-especially inSub-Saharan
Africa. Countries lacked experienced local staff andfor a number o f years after
independence, governments were heavily dependent on expatriate technical assistance,
just as the YAR was. Butthere was animportant difference. Withcolonialrulethebasics
o f sound public administrationhadbeen embedded, and systems o fpublic financial
management andpersonnel administrationwere firmly established.' Thus the formal rules
o fpublic administrationwere inplace, well internalizedby the first generation o f local
civil servants to rise to management positions. Consequently, investments inoverseas
fellowships andthe creationo f local civil service training capacity normally yielded good
returns.

2.23      This was not the case inYemen. North Yemen hadno such tradition andwas
trylngto makethe transition frompersonalrule to a moderncivil service responsive to the


7. For example, while anMIS that facilitates the prompt reporting o fpersonnel actions byMinistries
DepartmentandAgencies is desirable, it is only onepart of asystemofestablishment control, exercisedby
the civil service ministry and linkedto the budget. Ifpatronage i s a risk (as it was) systems o f open,
competitive recruitment against approvedpositions needto be inplace andpersonnel evaluationroutines
establishedto support promotion onmerit. Ifprofessionalism requirednurturing, cadresbasedon schemes
of service could have beenintroduced.

development challenge without the prior entrenchment ofsound administrative systems.
SouthYemenhad experienced colonial rule, but the imperial mandate hadbeen more
strategic thandevelopmental, andhad, for mucho f the country, been indirect. The
departure of the colonialpower was rushed, without an orderly hand-over o f
responsibilities. Furthermore, anybureaucratic traditions that hadbeeninheritedwere
soon erodedby the socialist policies o fthe PDRY. Inthe rushto amalgamate the two
administrations there was thus little institutionalcapital to draw upon.

2.24       The foregoing suggests that beforeprovidinginputs such as training fellowships,
studies andthe construction o f facilities, Bank staff should have engagedthe stakeholders
ingovernment andcivilsociety inintensivedialogue onthe type ofpublic administration
the country was seeking, andundertaken more thorough diagnostic studies onthe
condition o f civil service management systems ahead o fdetailed project preparation.
A roadmap for creating the institutions o f amodemcivil service shouldhavebeen
worked out before the project began.' The IDPAP was too much an "off the shelf' project
to succeedinsuch a complex governance environment as Yemen-even ifthe challenges
posedbyunification, Gulfreturnees and a civilwar hadbeenabsent. Conversely, had
moretime beeninvested indialogue andconsensusbuildingbefore detailed project
design, even with these events, the project mighthave achieved more. The eventual
restructuringo fthe project was necessary, butbythenit was too late to affect outcomes.
Whenit came, itwas moreo fatidyingupo floose ends, than a fundamental re-shaping o f
project inputs to meet the new circumstances. Projectrestructuring shouldhave happened
once itbecame clear that the two administrations were to be merged.

RATINGS

Outcome

2.25       The outcome o fthe IDPAP i s highly unsatisfactory because the project failed to
buildanydiscemable capacity inthe target institutions oftheMoCSAR andN I P A N A S .
Manyofthe capacity problems experienced bythese organizations, notwithstandinga
considerable growth instaff, remaintoday. Stafftrainedbythe project mostly came back
to Yemen, butreturnedto apublic sector environment which didnot use their new skills
well (to the extent courses were relevant). The MISwas installed, but not effectively
utilized, andplayedno role on checkingthe headlongexpansion o fthe civil service inthe
1990s, and a subsequent project (the CSMP) hadto re-invent aMISwhich only now
(2005) is yielding reliable data on civil service employment. A new office block for
MCSAR was built but was occupied by officials and not IT equipment and operatives.
Without improvements inthe relevance o f course curricula, adding additional physical
capacity to NTPA/NIAS achieved little.g



8. This seems to be a lessonwell learnedbythe CSMP, whichusedan Institutional Development Fund
(IDF)to support diagnostic studies andanationalconference leading to anactionplanoncivilservice
modernization, prior to the detailed preparation o f aninvestment project.
9. To this day, NIAS remains primarilyapre-service training institution, focusing onproviding new entrants
to the civil service year-long coursesof, ineffect, remedial teaching to make goodthe educational
deficiencies ofthe secondary school system.

Sustainability

2.26     Since the achievements o fthe project were so limited, sustainability i s moot, but
for the purposes o fproject rating, should be deemed unlikely. The most damaging blow to
sustainability was the headlong expansion ofthe civil service that beganwith the
unificationo f the civil services o fthe Northand South and continuedwith the return o f
the Gulfworkers andthe aftermath o fthe civil war. Large numbers o funqualified and
unnecessary staffwere added to payrolls, causing gross overstaffing and intensified
pressure on the wage bill. Inthe face o fhighinflation, this ledto the collapse o fregular
pay scales, the proliferation ofinformal salary augmentation mechanisms, and the
emergence o f special pay enclaves.

InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

2.27     The institutional impact o fthe project was negligible,partlybecause the
circumstances under which the project was designed changed so dramatically soon after it
commenced, with unification, return o f Gulfworkers, and civil war. Impactwas also
underminedbythe failure to take sufficient account o fthe absence o fbasic systems o f
public administration, around which capacity couldbebuilt. Leadership commitment
dwindled, andthe project lackeda localchampion. Inheritingexcess numbers, collapsed
pay structures and an unsustainable wage bill, IDPAP'Ssuccessorproject, the CSMP,
faces much more difficult circumstances inwhich to pursuecivil service modernization.
Inshort, the institutionaldevelopment goal ofawell hnctioning civil service was more
distantwhen the project endedthanwhen itbegan.

Bank andBorrowerPerformance

2.28     The Bankcannot beblamedfor external events, but shouldhaveundertaken more
diagnostic work andpolicy dialogue prior to project preparation. This would have
resulted inthe project more explicitly supportingthe basic personnel control and
management systems that a well functioning civil service i s built upon. Inturnthis would
have focused subsequent training, both abroad and inNIPA/NIAS. Hadthere been strong
supervision from the outset, some o f these deficiencies might have beenmade up, but
supervision was weak inthe early years o fthe project, andthe Bankshould have acted
quicker to restructure the project and step up supervision. Absence o f a resident mission
with Arabic speakingstaffable to readproject reports andinterpretthe local setting ledto
Washington-based staff takingPIUreports on trust, which was misplaced. Furthermore,
the Bank couldhave exercised greater quality control over the studies, Thus the Bank's
performance was unsatisfactory, partlybecause o f faults inpreparation, but mainly
becausesupervisionwas inadequate (the same rating as the ICR).lo



10. The ICR review ratedBorrower performance as Highly Unsatisfactory, partlybecause o finadequate
supervision, but also because of deficient approach and design appropriateness. However, while the ICR
Review felt that the design was too ambitious for the country's level o f development, the PPARtake o n
design is different. IDPAP's design was not too ambitious, rather it was too conventional, andmade
assumptions about the existence of basics systems and institutions of civil service management that were not
inplace inYemen. Withproperdiagnostics, the focus oftheprojectshouldhavebeenthe buildingofthose

                                                         12


 2.29     The Borrower's performancewas highly unsatisfactory (the rating ofthe ICR
 Review). First,because it took little interest inthe outputs o fthe project, failed to
 supervise the project PIUs, managedproject financesbadly, andignoredthe studies the
 Government had sought andthe project hadfinanced. Morebroadly, it forsook the reform
 premises ofthe project. For much ofthe 1990sthe Government abandonedthe goal o f
 civil servicemodernization, andpreferredto usethe civil service as aninstrument o f
 employment creation andpoliticalpatronage. This destroyedthe basisassumptiono f
 capacity building onwhichthe project hadbeendesigned. Bythe time the wheel had
 turned full circle andthe governmentwas ready inthe late 1990sto once moretake up the
 challenge of civil servicemodernization, the task hadbecomemore complex anddifficult.
 Undoubtedly, the politicalandsocial pressuresonthe governmentto expandcivil service
 employment byusing the public sector as employer oflast resort were huge. But,judged
 bythe goalsofthe project, the resultwas to makethesemore distant at the endofthe
 project thanthey were at the beginning. Inthe periodthe project was beingimplemented,
 the Government's expansionofthe payroll, regardlessofwhether the new employees
 possessedskills, had ajob to do andcouldbe afforded, hadthe effect of destroying
'whatever existing institutional capacity existed at the start o fthe project, throughthe
 departure ofprofessionals h mgovernment (some to donor-financed project enclaves),
 andthe filling ofdepartmentswithpolitically appointedunproductiveemployees. This
 made the eventualtask of civil servicemodernization severaltimes more difficult."

  descriptions andestablishment control mechanisms, and open. competitive entry andpromotion onmerit.
  11.Bythe early 2000's the wage billfor boththe civil service andthe armedforces, for example, hadrisen
  to about 15percent o f GDP, at the same time the real value o f government pay had collapsed, necessitating
  informal supplements for key staff so that they could work fulltime. Yemen now faces politically difficult

 3.       Legal andJudicial Development Project

 BACKGROUND OVERVIEW
                  AND

 3.1     The Legal andJudicial ReformDevelopmentProjectwas approved inJune 1999 at
 atotal cost o f $2.9 million, andwas financed with an IDA credit o f $2.5 million. It closed
 four years later, inJune 2003.

 3.2     The legal andjudicial system inYemen i s a fusion o f several traditions, reflecting
 the country's variedhistory. SouthYemen inherited apredominantlycommon law
 system, established when Aden was administered byBritish Indiaduringthe nineteenth
 century. InNorth Yemen the legal system was shapedby Ottoman influences.
 Overlayingthese formal structures is a deep rootedtradition o freferringboth criminal and
 civil matters, and commercial disputes to tribal authorities. Since unificationthe
 Government o f Yemen has faced the challenge o f combining these elements into a single
 coherent national system. This work is still underway. Although manynew laws have
beenpassed since unification, there are still gaps inthe legal framework, particularly in
the areas offinance andcommerce. Another challenge has beento improve the
implementation o fthe law-raising       the capacity o fprosecutors, improvingthe knowledge
o fjudges, strengthening court administration, renovatingbuildingsandmodernizing
equipment, and eliminating corruptionamong lower courtjudges andclerks. As a result,
concerns over the discretionary applicationo f laws, lack o fprotection for propertyrights,
anduncertaintyabout the enforcement o fcontracts have adversely affected bothdomestic
andforeign investor attitudes towards Yemen."

3.3      The 1990Constitution provides for the independence o fthejudiciary, but the
performance o fjudges and courts detracts from the investment climate inYemen.
Particularlycostly are delays inobtaining court decisions for commercialmatters andland
disputes, andthe quality o f decisions whenjudgment is rendered i s often questionable.
Consequently, the private sector, which will go to great lengths to keep disputes out o fthe
courts, has little confidence inthejudicial process. These deficiencies are recognizedby
the Government which has made legalandjudicial reform animportant component o f
Yemen's governance refom agenda.

3.4      Under the leadership o fthe Ministryo fJustice (MoJ), which i s responsible for the
deployment o fjudges andthe administrationo f courts, a strategy for legal andjudicial
reformwas developed and approved by the Council o fMinisters in 1997. The strategy
called for strengthening the independence o f thejudiciary, exposingjudges to modem
legal concepts through external training, andmore efficient andtransparent court
administration. The strategy also identified a need for modernizing the legal framework
(the responsibilityo fthe Ministryo f LegalAffairs-MoLA), and enhancing the oversight
role o fthe Supreme Judicial Council.

3.5     I twas against this background that the Government o f Yemen approached IDA for
assistance intaking the strategy forward.

Design,ImplementationandOutcome

3.6     Rather than embark on a conventionalinvestment credit ina completely new
sector, the Bank decided to test the waters for legal andjudicial development with a
LearningandInnovation Credit (LIC). Ifthis provedsuccessful, the Bankwould follow
withalargerAdaptable ProgramCredit (APC)operation. This was a sensible strategy,
givennotjust the lacko fprior engagement inthe sector inYemen, butalso the relative
newness o f LJD operations inthe Bank. The project's designers were aware that the risks
were great, andthat highlevelpolitical commitment to the reform strategy was critical.
These conditions appearedto exist, giventhe Government's development o f a LJD
strategy, andits endorsement bythe Cabinet. At the same time, the team and its
counterparts ingovernment were aware that there couldbe opposition to reform.
Traditionalists, those withvested interests inthestatus quo andothers hostile to the
Bank's engagement insuch a sensitive sector could derailthe project's objectives.

3.7     The project, as designed, hadthree components:

    A. Capacity buildinginMoJandthejudiciary ($2.2 million), specifically:
                ..  Trainingofsittingjudges
                w   Curriculumrevision inthe SupremeJudicial institute (SJI)
                    Designofaprogramo fcourt renovation

    B. Capacity buildinginMoLA($0.6 million)
                m   Diagnostic assessments o f legalframework for business, economic and
                .   financial activities
                    Draftingoflawsinthese areas
                    Diagnostic assessments o flegal, administrativeandregulatory
                    fiamework for land
    C. Baselinesurvey o fpublic attitudes to law andjudiciary inYemen ($0.1million)

3.8      Itwas decided to implementtheprojectthroughtheregular staffofthe two
ministries, rather thancreate a parallelProject ImplementationUnit (PIU). This turned
out to bethe right decision. The two ministries administered the project capably, and
ownership was correspondingly greater than ifa PIUhadbeen createdto runthe project.

3.9      The choice o f a LIC was appropriate, given the risks to reforminthe legal and
judicial sector, andthe need for boththe Bank andthe Government to learn from an initial
modestly sized project, before deepening support for the sector. Thus, the project's design
was simple, relevant to the country's needs, andits implementationwas inlinewith the
country's capacity.

3.10     The projectwas declared effective inJanuary 2000 and closed inJune 2003. Most
o fthe project components were implemented satisfactorily. Some 212judges received
training incommercial law andpenal law at the Supreme Judicial Institute inEgypt

                                                    15


  (which generously waived fees, enablingthe project to increase the number o fjudges
  trained). A further 650judges, arbitrators and clerks were given training inthese subjects
. inYemenat the HighJudicial Institute (HJI) and the Yemen Arbitration Centre, by
  lecturers from Egypt andJordan. And some 375 judges, prosecutors and clerks received
 training at the Justice InformationCentre inYemen. All told some 80 percent of Yemen's
 judges received trainingunder the project.

  3.11 The diagnostic assessmento fcourt administrationwas carried out. However, the
  surveyofcourt house infrastructure renovationandequipment needs was notundertaken.
 Thus the project addressedonlypart o fthe "enforcement gap" identified across the Region
 as a factor inhibitingthe rule o flaw. Andthe plannedrevisiono fYemen's Higher
 Judicial Institute(HJI) curriculum didnot take place.

 3.12     The two diagnostic studies o fthe legal frameworks for finance andbusiness, andof
 landmatters, that were the responsibilityofMoLAwere carriedout satisfactorily, aswas the
 baseline survey o fpublic attitudes to the law andthejudiciary. Furthermore, MoLAstaff
 attendedcourseson commercial law at the Supreme Judicial Institute inEgypt.

 3.13    As outputs go, theprojectwas mostly successful. The maincomponent ofthe
 project, the training o fjudges, resultedinthe exposure o f four fifths o fYemen's judiciary
 to new concepts o f law andjustice, particularly inthe areao fbusiness law. However,
 notwithstandingthe goodperformance o f officials inbothMoJ andMoLA, project
 implementationprovedproblematic. Halfway through implementation, reform-minded
 officials inthe Ministry o f Justice who hadbeenpivotal indeveloping Yemen's LJD
 strategy were replaced by those who believed the traditional system worked fine for
 commercial cases. The new management was ambivalent about the project's objectives,
 anddidnot share its predecessor's positive attitude to cooperation with the BankonLJD.
 There was a hiatus inthe implementation o fthe MoJ components ofthe project, andthe
 sendingofjudges abroad from training ceased. Thishadunfortunaterepercussions. The
 inability o fthe Bankto resume a constructive dialogue and get the project going again
 causedthe countrymanagement to eliminate the follow-up APC from the country lending
 program. After a period, there was a further shuffling o fportfolios, the minister changed
 again, andthe training o fjudges resumed. However, without the incentive o f a follow-up
 project which would have providedfinance for court renovation, work on the
 identificationo frenovationneeds andthe preparationo fdesigns ceased.

 RATINGS

 Outcome

 3.14    While the outputs ofthe project were mostly achieved, the change inMoJ
leadership andthe Bank's decisionto cancel the follow-up APC, caused the LJD
momentuminYemen to stall. Measuredagainst the KeyPerformanceIndicators (KPI) in
theproject logframe, the outcome was clearlyless thanhopedfor byproject designer^.'^


 13. The K P I s inAnnex 1 ofthe PAD expected that supervisionreportswould be able to determine whether
court administration, the performanceofjudges, andrecourseto arbitrationhadimproved,throughcourt

                                                   16


3.15      Although the baseline survey ofpublic attitudes to the law andthejudiciary was
carried out, no follow-up surveys were done, andthere are no metrics onwhich to
determinewhether the performanceofjudges andthe courts improvedthrough training
and diagnostic work. MoJofficials interviewed inthe course o fthis PPARmaintain
strongly thatjudges havebenefitedfrom training, andcase administrationhasimproved.
Chamber o f Commercerepresentatives, onthe other hand, could detect no improvement in
the court system as aresult o f the project.

3.16      Evenifresults are difficult to demonstrate andother constraints onjudges'
performance, such as pay and conditions, remain to be addressed, exposing 80 percent o f
the country's judges to training bylecturers from legallymore advancedArab countries
(feedback bytrainees was verypositive) musthave hada longterm benefit. Nevertheless,
it is clear that reform momentumwas lost, andthe underlyingrationale ofthe LIC, to test
approaches, achieveinitial success, beginto changepublic perceptions, andbuild
knowledge, was not fulfilled. Onthis basis, the outcome o fthe project was moderately
unsatisfactory    14.


Sustainability

3.17      Bythe sametoken, sustainability must bejudged as unlikely. Without arenewalof
Banksupport for the sector, the reformmomentumthat clearly existedwhen theproject
started i s unlikelyto beregained. Although, intheory, the Government could use its own
budget resourcesto take reformforward, inpractice, there aretoomanycompeting
demandson scarceresources. LJDisunlikelyto happenwithout a committed external
partnerwho canbringbothfinancialresourcesandgood practiceknowledge from
comparablereforming countries.

InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

3.18      The institutional development impact ofthe project isjudged to bemodest. This i s
notbecausethe outputso ftheproject were not, inthe main, achieved, butbecausethe
reformmomentum stalled. First becausethe Government replacedreform minded
officialswith more traditional ones, unsympatheticwith boththe direction o freformand
the Bank's presenceinthe sector, andsecond, becausethe Bankwithdrew the APC.

3.19      Here a comment onthe yardsticks usedto judge project success is inorder. The
PAD lists bothoutput andoutcomeperformance indicators inthe project logframematrix,
andmost ofthe latter were not fulfilled. Buta LIC is a first intervention, aimed at
achieving some initialoutputs, testing approaches andbuildingknowledge andpolitical
commitment. Moretangible outcomesthanthese come later inthe reformprocess. The
training o fjudges opensjudicialminds to modern concepts, but noticeable improvements
incourt performance aremorelikelywhencomplementary actionsaretakenoutsidethe



statistics and surveysofbusinesses. But court data were not timely, and follow-up surveys were not
undertaken.
14. The ICR Review's ratingwas moderatelysatisfactory onthe groundsthat some ofthe projectoutputs
were achieved. While this is true, the broaderpurpose ofthe project,as a LIC, was to pave the way for
larger scale Bank supportto LJD, which didnothappen, and the Government's LJDstrategy languished.

present project to renovate buildings,providebasic equipment, and improve the pay and
working conditions o fjudges andcourt staff.

Bank andBorrower Performance

Bank Performance

3.20    The project team helpedthe Government develop the LJDstrategy andthen
proceededto prepare the project in a sensitive and highlyparticipatoryway, takingcare to
consult withrelevant stakeholders. Itwas also able to supervise the project effectively,
despite interruptions inmissiontravel to Yemen due to security concerns inthe aftermath
of 9/11, Notwithstanding the exemplaryperformance ofthe project team, the Bank's
performance i s rated unsatisfactory (the same as the ICRReview, the ICR itselfrated
Bankperformance assatisfactory)". This arisesfromthe countrymanagement's decision
to eliminate the follow-up APC from the lendingprogram, which hadthe effect o f
undercutting the rationale o fthe LIC. While this was anunderstandable reaction to a
reversal inministerialownership, it was a hasty decision, giventhat the setback proved
temporary. Although implementation slowed, before the project closed the minister had
again changed, commitment was renewed, andthe training o fjudges abroad resumed.
The LIC was an initial project, and the fblfillment o f its goals largely depended upon
moving seamlessly to a follow-up APC.

3.21    Unevencommitment o fthe Government to LJRwas, infact, anticipatedby the
design team, which signaled that theproject was highrisk. For this reason, it was decided
that the Bank's initial venture into this sector inYemen shouldbe a modestly sized LIC.
Hadproject implementationbeen slow andproblematic prior to the change inminister,
cancellation o fthe APC would havebeen inorder. But project implementationwas good,
there was ownership amongthe officials o fMoJ administeringthe project, and MoLA's
commitment to theproject remainedunaffectedand solid. Duringpreparation, the project
team had undertakenextensive stakeholder consultations, andknew that there were
traditionalists and others with vested interest inthe existing order opposed to LJD. They
also knew that progress would not be linear, andthere mightbe setbacks. When this
happened, the Bank should have beenmorerobust. It shouldhave stayed the course, at
least untilthe preparation o fthe APC suggestedotherwise. Bydisengaging from LJD, the
Bankbackedout o fasector which ithaddeemed criticalfor bothgovernance andthe
investment climate-two      o fthe mainpillars o f the country assistance strategy. Country
management should have expected setbacksto reform insuch a problematic political
environment, and should have beenmore prepared to take the longer view.

Borrower Performance

3.22    Undoubtedlythe Government's performance was uneven, but it is nevertheless
deemedsatisfactory, since withdrawal o fpolitical commitment to the project inMoJ,
althoughhighlyregrettable, was time limited. Commitment was renewed, andthe bulko f


l5The ICRReview considered the Bank's performance unsatisfactory because o f weak supervision. The
PPARconcludes that supervision bythe TM was generally good, but that the decisionby sector and country
managementto withdraw from the successor project was ill-judged.

                                             18


project outputs were achieved. Additional positive factors are the participatoryway in
which the Government developed the LJD strategy, on which the project was based, and
the goodperformance ofMoJandMoLA officials inadministeringthe project effectively.
Identifying and sending four fifths o f a country's judges for externaltraining i s no small
achievement.

 4.      Public Sector ManagementAdjustmentCredit

 BACKGROUND OVERVIEW
                 AND

 4.1     The Public SectorManagementAdjustment Credit (PSMAC), a $50 million
 adjustment operation, was approvedbythe Board ofIDA inMarch 1999, became
 effective inSeptember ofthat year, andclosed at the endofMarch2000. Although itwas
not the first quick disbursingcredit extendedto Yemen (it hadbeenprecededby an
Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) andaFinancial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) in
the precedingyears), it was the first adjustmentoperation focusedonpublic
administration. Moreover, PSMAC was supposedto bethe first o f a series o fpublic
sector adjustment credits, aimedat supporting the Government's program o fpublic sector
managementreform. At the same time, the Bankintendedit andits successors to bethe
mainvehicle for dialogue onreformpolicy.

4.2      PSMAC was a single tranche credit, designedto disburse infull on effectiveness.
Bymakingdisbursementconditional onup-front actions, the Banksought to avoid the
risks o f amulti-tranche operation. At the same time, the public sector reformprogram it
was supporting was seen as a longterm process, and succeedingcredits would provide an
opportunity to agree on a Mher set o freform actions.

4.3      PSMACwas accompaniedby a technical assistancecredit, the Civil Service
ModernizationProject (CSMP), awell testedcombination often usedbythe Bankto
support public managementreform. However, due to delays inpreparation and
negotiation, CSMP didnot get submittedto the Board untilthe middleo fthe following
year, bywhichtime the PSMAC, fully disbursed, hadclosed. Fortunately, aproject
preparation facility enabled a start to bemadewith technical assistance.

4.4     PSMAC's origins are inthe mid-l990s, whenthe Government o fYemenbeganto
stabilize the economy, anddevelop a strategy for the modernization o fpublic
administration. Stabilization had followed aperiodof administrative turmoil (describedin
more detail earlier inthis report). This beganwith the unification ofNorth and South
Yemen, whichrequiredthe fusion oftwo civil serviceswith quite different administrative
traditions, and continued, with the forced return of 800,000 Yemenis from Gulf States
duringthe first GulfWar andthe absorption ofmanyinto the civil service, anda shortbut
violent civil war in 1994.

4.5     The Government's reformprogram, launchedin 1996, aimed at (i)      economic
stabilization, (ii)
                  structural changes to promote investment and growth, and, (iii)measures
to protect the poor from the adverse effects ofthe adjustmentprocess. Supportedbythe
Bankandthe IMF,this programwas highlysuccessful. The fiscal deficit, 17percent in
1994, was reducedto 2.3 percent in 1997. Inthe same period, inflationfell from 71
percentto 6.3 percent, andthe exchangerate stabilized. Accompanying the economic
stabilization programwere measuresto improve trade policy through tariffreform, reform
o fpublic enterprises including closures andprivatization, strengtheningo fthe investment
regime,particularly withrespectto foreign direct investment, and financial sector reform.
At the same time social protectionmeasureswere taken, suchas the creation ofthe Yemen

                                              20


  Social Fundfor Development andthe Public Works Project, a special agencyto undertake
  infrastructure projects ina labor intensiveway.

  4.6     Although the economic reformprogram was successfulinreducingmacro
  economic imbalancesandlaying the foundations for investment, economic growth and
  poverty reduction, the Governmentwas awarethat sustainableimprovement depended
  uponraising the performance of government itself, through capacity buildingand the
  reform of core systems. Inthe meantime, erodedbyinflationandconstrainedbythe fiscal
. situation, realpay ofthe now greatly expandedcivil service fell to below a livingwage.
  Thus aprogram ofcivil service andfinancial managementreformwas launched, initially
  usinganInstitutional Development Fund(IDF)grant with additional assistance from
  UNDP. Studies were undertakenandthere was extensive stakeholder consultation. The
  outcome was acomprehensivereformplan, the Strategic Framework for Public Sector
  Reform, approvedbythe Cabinet in 1998.

  4.7     Inrecognitionofthe longtermnature ofpublic sectorreform, andthe needto
  buildpoliticalsupport for reforms as they were implemented, a step-by-step approachwas
  taken to the designandimplementationofthe reforms, infour principalareas:

      0   Public administration strengthening
          Budget andfinancial managementreform
          Public expenditure rationalization
          Revenuemobilization andadministration,

  4.8     The programofreforms ineachoftheseareas contributed the first year actionsto
  be supportedbythe credit. The stabilization andadjustment program supportedbythe
  W ' s ESAF providedthe macro-economic underpinnings o fthe credit, andthe sharp fall
  ininternationaloilpricesin1998and1999suppliedanadditionalreasonforuntiedbudget
  support. Giventhe importance assignedto governance inthe country assistancestrategy,
  the project fitted the country's needswell.

  Design, ImplementationandOutcome

  4.9     The ambit ofPSMAC, as indicated above, was broad. It entailedlaunching
  reforms inthe areas o f civil service andpublic financial management. It also aimed to
  rationalize spending, and lessenthe government's dependenceon oil for budgetrevenues.

  Civil servicereformincluded:
              undertakingfunctional andprocessreviewsinfour pilot agencies, with aview
              to expanding the numberlater,
              developing an employeedatabaseto remedy the lack o fpersonnelinformation
              that hadbedeviled efforts inthe past to control numbers,
              designinganewwages structureto replace the excessively compressedpay
              scales,
              Cleaning the payroll andcreating an exit mechanism, the civil service fund,
              wherebyretrenchedworkers couldbetaken offdepartmentalpayrolls while
              severancepayments andpensions were processed.

                                                21


Budget and financial management reforms entailed:
            takinginitial stepstowards aMedium TermExpenditureFramework(MTEF),
            byestablishing aMTEFUnitinthe Ministryo fFinance,
            beginunifyingthe dualbudget system andagreeing anewbudget
            classification,
            drawingup specifications for an integrated financial management system-
            AFMIS,
            a new Finance Law setting out the respective roles o fthe finance andplanning
            ministries, and the civil service ministry.

Public expenditure reforms envisaged:
            focusing fundingon highpriority projects, deferring lower priority ones and
            shiftingrecurrent type activities suchasmaintenance fiom projects to the
            recurrent budget,
            cleaned up the project implementationplan(PIP), improving ,project cost
            data,
            Developingsector strategies.

Revenuereforms included:
            a new income tax law,
        0   amendments to the excise law,
        0   introducing a taxpayer identificationnumber,
        0   initiatingtax administrationreforms.

4.10    Thus, PSMAC laidout anambitious agenda, inretrospect overly so. Butthere
were cogent reasonsfor the comprehensiveness o fthe reforms. Inthe first place, the
Government had developed the reform programitself, andthere was strong ownership
among technocrats, who sought support fkom the Bank and other donors. Second, boththe
Bank andits counterparts inthe Government saw thesereforms as a longtermprocess,
which could take up to ten year to implement. Under the PSMAC, manyo f the conditions
for Boardpresentation either reflectedactions already taken, or commitments to "begin" a
reform process ina particular area. This was a sensible approach under the circumstances.
Third, as is oftenthe case inpublic sector reform, actions were interconnected. A new
public sector wage scale with paybetter relatedto responsibilities andnational labour
market realities requires the retrenchment o f surplus staffandthe elimination o fpayroll
fraud, otherwise it i s unaffordable. It also requires departmental organizational structures
which linkpositions to jobs, and inturn this entails a department by department review o f
mandates, functions andprocesses, so that organizational structures and staffing levels can
beproperly defined. Fourth, civil service reform, inturn, bothfacilitates andis facilitated
bypublic financial management reforms. Rationalizingprojects andimprovingtax
administrationincrease fiscal space for improvingpay andworking conditions, and
development o f a MTEF shouldhelp prioritizationo f spending. Furthermore, inan
uncertain governance setting, opportunities to move forward are not always predictable,
andprudent technocrats try to have alternative lines of advance, incase some areblocked.
Thus, while the underlying reformprogram at first glance might seem too ambitious, on
closer examination, it was a rationalresponsebythe Bank's counterparts to local

                                                 22


circumstances that favoured reform, butwhose limits were uncertain andrequiredtesting
across abroadfront.

4.11 Giventhat PSMACwas a single tranche operation, with disbursementconditions
to be met prior to Boardpresentation, conditionality hadbeenmet once the credit had
been approved. Inthis sense, PSMACwas designedto be implemented, andits outputs
achieved.

4.12    Viewed inthis light, PSMAC succeeded. Disbursing its single trancheimplied
effectiveness, bothinterms o fthe civil service andfinancial managementreforms it
initiated, but also macro-economic performance. But single tranche operations conceived
as the first inseries needto be evaluatednotjust interms o fwhether they met their
disbursementconditions, but also whether they contributed successfblly to the larger
reformprocess they sought to launch. Here, the record is mixed. The public sector
modernization programthat PSMAC launchedhas continued, not always at expected
speed, andwith interruptions untilthe present. At the level o ftechnical process
development, the recordi s one of qualified advance. The accounting andfinancial
managementinformation system ( A F M S ) experienced contract delays and difficulties,
butits developmentisnowmovingahead. So far, though, it hashadlittleimpact onpublic
financial management. There hasbeen an improvement inbudgeting, but though
macroeconomic forecasting capacity has improved, Yemen has yet to develop aMedium
TermExpenditure Framework to discipline policymakingwith costs, guide annual
budgeting andhelp Yemen beginthe substantial fiscal adjustmentsneededto bringpublic
finances to amore sustainableposition as oil reservesare depleted. The few sectoral
strategieswhichhavebeendevelopedwere drivenmorebyneedsthan availabilities, and
thusprioritizationchoiceswere generallynot faced upto. Functionalreviewsofthe four
pilotministries are nownearingcompletion, andthe MoCSIfor the first time has awell
functioning personneldatabase. A new salary structure hasbeendevised, though not yet
implemented. The most progresshas been inthe revenue area, with improvements intax
administration and amendmentsto the income tax law includingelimination of
exemptions anddeductions, accompafliedbyreforms to indirect taxes.16

4.13     However, ina largersense, real changehasproved elusive. The culture of annual
budgetingremains incremental andinvestment decisions are taken without sufficient
attention paidto incrementalrecurrent costs. Policies are made without serious
consideration o fthe longruncosts, andfinancial managementremains accommodating of
impropriety andtolerant of laxity. Studies o f the four pilot ministries were pursued
without vigor, and, while the new manpower data base is a significant achievement, what
itreveals is continuedrapid growthinnumbers, andthus afailure of establishmentcontrol
which cast doubt on the entirereform process. It also makes the Civil Service Fundan
exerciseinfutility.

 RATINGS

 Outcome

 4.14     The outcome o fthe project is deemed moderately unsatisfactory (the same as the
 ICRReview)17 While the project did launchthe Government into aprocess o fpublic
 sector reformacross a broad fiont, throughthe up-fiont actions requiredfor credit
 effectiveness, the totality o fthese actions have subsequently provento be less thanthe
 sum o f their parts. The objectives o fthe project were to begina process o fredefiningthe
 state, strengthening budget performance, improving the efficiency; effectiveness and
 poverty focus ofpublic expenditures, andstrengthentax administration. Although ineach
 o fthese areas, reforms didmove forward, they have yet to make a difference to civil
 service performance or public financial management. Arguably, with the total size o fthe
 civil service nearlytwice what it was whenPSMAC started, the goal o f a modem, well
 performingcivil service i s now further away.

 Sustainability

 4.15    Viewed narrowly, sustainabilityo fthe project appears likely given that the actions
 taken under PSMAC as a condition o fBoardpresentation, such as elimination o f double
 dippers, andrevenue mobilizationreforms are unlikely to bereversed. Studies are now
nearlycompleted for thepilot agencies selected under the project for reform o f
 organizational structures, processes and staffing. A computerizedEmployeeDataBase
hasbeen established, and the government i s now moving to integrate biometric
information. Although not yet implemented, a merit based salary structure has been
devisedandapprovedby the cabinet. Therehasbeen some reductiono fillegal payroll
entries, andthe Civil Service Fundi s now operational, even ifinsufficiently fimded at
present. But ina larger sense, the continuedincrease inpayroll numbersputs inquestion
whether there has been any realprogress towards the goal o f a better performing civil
service. Sustainability, inthis light, is viewed as unlikely.

InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

4.16     The institutionaldevelopment impact o fthe project i s rated as modest. This is a
cautious rating, since the civil service reformprogram(and the parallel reforms to PFM) i s
still ongoing. Incountries like Yemen, progress will always be uneven, because o fthe
country's complex governance situation, andthe politicalpressures for maintaining the
status quo. While there has been some progress at the technical level, ina larger sense the
civil service inYemen remains drivenbypatronage considerations, andthe tradition o f
regarding government employment as socialwelfare still dominates. This inturnaffects
how public financial management systems are inpractice operated.



l7The ICRReview ratedthe outcome moderately unsatisfactory because the project's objectives, being
mostly studies and initiating process changes, were too modest to constitute adjustment. The PPAR's rating,
made with the benefit o f greater hindsight,judges the project also moderate& unsatisfactory because the
process changes went very slowly, andhad little discernable effect on government performance. The ICR
itselfrated the outcome as satisfactory.

Bank andBorrowerPerformance

Bank Performance

4.17     Bankperformancewas good during the designofthe adjustment operation andthe
companion CSMP, with the latter's task team leader basedinSana'a andthe PSMAC TTL
visiting frequently. Thisresultedinathoughtful andwell structured program design, the
outcome of a wide consultative process. Inturn, this created strong country ownership of
the civil service andPFMreformprogramsthat bothPSMAC andthe CSMP were
supporting. However, Bankperformance deteriorated duringproject implementation, due
to a changeintask managementresponsibilities, andan inability o fthe Bankto place
enough resourcesbehindthe Washington-basedstaffresponsible for supervision. As a
result, although the credit was quickly declared effective and disbursed, the underlying
civil service andpublic financial managementreformprograms the credit was supporting
got offto aslow start, andthe policy dialogue that the credit was intendedto support
suffered. It also ledto a tensionbetweenthe CSMP PIUandWashington that was
detrimental to project goals, eventually to surface a review o fthe CSMP.18Andthere
were also tensions betweenthe PTUinMoCSAR andthe PTUresponsible for the PFM
reforms inthe Ministry ofFinancewhich couldhavebeen assuagedby on-the-spot
supervision.

4.18     The Bank's andthe Government's decision not to follow PSMAC with a second
operation. wasjustifiedinmacro-economic terms (government revenues hadsharplyrisen
with oilprices), butleft theMinistryo fCivil ServiceandInsurance withinsufficient
resourcesto processsurplus staffthroughthe Civil Service Fund, andwithout anew
adjustment operationto prepare, the intensity o fdialogue on criticalreform issueswas
less. Complex institutionalreform programs likethe one PSMAChelpedlaunch (and its
companionproject, CSMP,was intendedto sustain) needclose support incountries with
weak institutional capacity. Missingfor mucho fthe periodwas the technical advice and
encouragement, best providedbyexperiencedinternational staff secondedto the resident
mission. The Bank's performanceis therefore deemedmoderate& satisfactory.

Borrower Perform ance

4.19     Borrower performance was moderatelysatisfactory, inthat the actions takenprior
to credit effectivenesswere timely, andenabledthe processo fpublic sectormanagement
reform to begin. Since then, however, there was limitedfollow-up implementation to
achieve the goals envisaged.


18 This unusually long document, ,arguedthat the CSMPPSMAC emphasis onretrenchment and
quantitative performance indicators putthe PlUina "vulnerable" position, implementing project priorities
ofWashington, not Sana'a, and that muchmore emphasis shouldhave beenplacedonbuildingcapacity
withinMoCSIfor managing change. The MTRis best interpretedas a smokescreenfor a slow start to the
project -there were plenty o fresources inthe project for capacity buildingand change management-but it
is also an implicit criticismo fthe way the project was supervised inthe early stages, after the CSMP task
manager who had pilotedthe programthroughpreparation and approval, passedonher responsibilities to a
Washington-based TTL. Hadthere beencontinuity o f supervision from the resident mission, these
misunderstandings would havebeenavoided.

 5.      Overall Progress and Lessons

 OVERALLPROGRESS

 5.1    Overallprogress duringthe period coveredby the three credits was uneven, with
 gains at the technical level outweighed by the fact that throughout the review period,
public employment inYemen kept expandingat a fast rate, underminingthe goal o f a
 more effective civil service. We cannot be sure that ifthe Bank hadbeenmore engaged
with policy adviceandproject support when thetwo civil services were unified after 1990,
the rapid expansion innumbers wouldhave beenmuchreduced, but more mighthave
been done to strengthen control systems, limit organizational duplication, anddiscuss with
the government the tension betweentreatingpublic sector employment as a social safety
net andbuildinga civil service that could meet the government's service delivery goals.
Conditions for civil service modernizationwere muchmore difficult at the end o fthe
decade thanthey were at the beginning, whentotal numbers were less than half, wage bills
were more affordable, payroll fraud less andretrenchment andpensioncosts lower. In
turn, this madecapacity buildingfor public financialmanagement andlegalandjudicial
development more difficult.

5.2     Nevertheless, duringthe period, some progress was made inlaying the foundations
for modernizationon boththe civil service, public financial management andlegal and
judicial sides of government. The process will take several decades, duringwhich time
there will be many setbacks, when governance conditions are unfavorable. The first
project, the IDPAPwas misdirected, overtaken by adverse unforeseen events, andhad a
marginalimpact. The second project, the Legal andJudicial Development Project, was a
modest andreasonably successful "testing o fthe waters", but faced with temporary
adversity, the Bankdrew back, andfailed to take the long view the sector required. The
thirdproject, PSMAC, launchedanimportant process ofpublic sector reform, which
broadly continues at the technical level, but ina larger sense, with the tensionbetween
traditional andmodernstyles o f governance still to be resolved, has yet to meet
expectations.

LESSONS

        Restructuringwhen countrycircumstanceschange: Whenthe project
        environment changes dramatically, the Bank shouldbe readyto restructure key
        projects inthe portfolio. When Northand South Yemen were unified, andthe new
        country faced the challenge o fintegrating two distinctly different civil service
        traditions, the Bank shouldhave moved quickly to discuss the new circumstances
        with the government, andhavebeenpreparedto restructure the IDPAP. Resources
        could have been shifted to new priorities as required. The Bank eventually did
        restructure the project, but only inits closing stages when the relevance o fwhat it
        had originally set out supportinghad diminished. An opportunitywas lost to play
        a more constructive role inthe fusing o f the two civil services. The consequences
        inthe form o fexcessnumbers andanunaffordablewage billmadetheBank's
        subsequent efforts to assist with public administrationreform more difficult.

                                     26


 Staying the course in critical governance sectors: Havingcorrectly concluded
 that legal andjudicial reformwas vital to improvinggovernance and economic
 performance, the Bankdrew up a clear strategy for sector engagement,
 commencing with a LIC with aview to succeedingit with an APC. The Bank
 should havebeenmore preparedto stay the course, notwithstandingthe
 unexpectedappointment of aminister less committed to reform. Although the LIC
 didnot achieveall its goals, the maincomponentswere adequatelyimplemented,
.lessonswere learned, and a good basis established for going forward. The Bank's
 withdrawal from the sector leR their counterparts inthe sector ministries (MoJ and
 MoLA) unsupported, andwill make re-engagement instrengthening the rule of
 law more difficult.

 Supporting reforms with experienced staff based inthe Yemen field office:
 The PSMACproject andthe program of civil service andfinancial management
 reform it launchedillustrate the need for close supervision andtechnical support in
 countrieswhere the Bank's counterparts are exploiting a window ofreform
 opportunity. This type o f support canbeprovidedonlyby experienced and
 dedicatedstaffbasedinthe resident mission, possessingglobal as well as country
 expertise, andwith quick accessto back-up from Washington. This was available
 duringPSMAC andCSMl?preparation andearly implementation, butnot
 thereafter andimplementation suffered as aresult.
