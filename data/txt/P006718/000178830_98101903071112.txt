INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOFMENT
REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED IDAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF COlOMBIA
FOR THE FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$17.2 million to
the Republic of Colombia.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2,        The Bank has been closely associated with highway development
in Colombia since 1951, having made four loans totalling US$66.85 million
equivalent in 1951, 1953, 1956 and 1961, respectively.  In addition an
IDA credit of US$19.5 million was made in 1961. The emphasis of these
loans was on the reconstruction, improvement and expansion of existing
roads to meet rising traffic demands and on improvement in the maintenance
of the Colombian highway system generally,
3.        The proposed loan would continue this process of upgrading of
priority trunk highways, on some of which work began under earlier loans.
The loan would also finance the implementation of consultantslrecommenda-
tions for the reorganization of the Ministry of Public Wbrks.
4.        Apart from lending for highways, the Bank has also been active
in financing the Colori,bian National Railways (CNR), having provided four
loans totalling UJS$76.3 million equivalent between 1952 and 1963. A
project for a further loan of US$18.3 million equivalent is being pre-
sented together with the proposed highway loan.
5.        The Project was appraised in April 1968. Negotiations of the
proposed loan took place in Washington June 12-14., 1968. The Colombian
Government was represented by Dr. Bernardo Garces, Minister of Public Works,
who was assisted by Dr. Oscar Mejia, a private consultant.
6.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits to Colombia as of June 30, 1968:

7.        Twenity-three loans have been completely disbursed and four have
been repaid in full. On the remainder, disbursements-are proceeding nor-
mally except on Loan 345 CO (Acerias Paz del Rio,pS.A.). The Executive
Directors recently approved an extension of the Closing Date on this loan
by one year to October-31, 1969 to allow for further disbursements, mainly
of contract retentions.

8.        Together with this report, I am submitting to the Executive
Directors a proposed loan of US$18.3 million equivalent to the Colombian
National Railways for the Fifth Railroad Project. These two loans, if
made, would raise the Bank's total lending to Colombia to US$535.5 mil-
lion. In the near future I expect to present to the Executive Directors
a loan of about US$7.6 million equivalent to the Government for secondary
education and a loan of about US$16.0 million equivalent for Power Inter-
connection.
9.        IFC has made 21 investments and underwriting commitments in
13 enterprises in Colombia totalling US$14.7 million.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
10.       The main features of the proposed loan are as follows:
Borrower:          Republic of Colombia.
Amount:            The equivalent in various currencies of
US$17.2 million.
Purpose:           To finance the expansion and construction of
510 km of important truik highways, the
construction of a major bridge, consultants'
services for the supervision of construction
and for the reorganization of the Ministry
of Public Works, and pre-investment studies
and detailed engineering of further high
priority highway projects.
Amortization:      Loan would be for a term of 2b years, includ-
ing a b-year grace period ending in 1972.
Repayment would be in forty semi-annual install-
ments from November 15, 1972 to May 15, 1992.
Interest Rate:     6½ percent.
Commitment charge: 3/4 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       A detailed description of the Project is given in the attached
report entitled "Appraisal of Fifth Highway Project, Colombia" (TO-650a).



- 4 -
12.       The Project provides for the construction of important sections
of the highway system, including the completion of the main trunk highways
linking Medellin and Cali, both important centers of industry and agri-
culture, with their natural port outlets at Cartagena on the Atlantic and
Buenaventura on the Pacific. The Project would also cover the preparation
of pre-investment studies and detailed engineering for other priority
roads selected on the basis of the Harvard Transportation Investment
Survey, the conclusions of which are expected to become available this
summer. In addition, the Project would include Phase II of the Management
Study, prepared by consultants under Credit 5 CO, which involves the
implementation of the consultantstrecommendations for the reorganization
of the Ministry of Public Works. The Project would also provide for
miscellaneous laboratory and workshop equipment needed in carrying out
the reorganization. The executing agency would be the Ministry of Public
Works assisted by consultants.
13.       The total cost of the Project is estimated to be Ps 64h million
(US$39.5 million). The proposed loan would cover the actual foreign
exchange cost of consultantst services and equipment and the estimated
foreign exchange component of construction costs, amounting to 45 percent
of total construction costs. The local currency cost of the Project
would be financed through the National Highway Fund. This Fund was
established in December 1967 to administer revenues from fuel taxes,
which had been increased sharply at that time, and from the Government's
budgetary allocation for highway construction. In 1968, two-thirds of-
the National Highway Fundis total resources of close to Ps 1 billion
represent fuel tax revenues, This share is expected to increase in
future years.
14.       Ongoing contracts to be included in the proposed loan were let
in accordance with bidding procedures acceptable under the previous loan.
On all other contracts, procurement would be on the basis of the Bankls
bidding procedures. The consultants who prepared the engineering studies
will advise the Government on the pre-qualification of the contractors
and supervise construction. It is proposed to permit retroactive financing
of expenditures on ongoing contracts and on Phase II of the Management
Study from May 1, 1968; the-amount of such financing is expected to be
about US$500,ooo equivalent.
15.       The individual highway works included in the Project yield a
rate of return varying between 11 and 21 percent on the investment.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and
the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.



- 5 -
17.       The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions generally used
for highway projects. The implementation of the reorganization of the
Ministry of Public Works, on the basis of the consultants' recommenda-
tions and in accordance with a program acceptable to the Bank, is part
of the Project which the Borrower would undertake to carry out.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
18.       The judgments provided in the section on the Colombian economy
in the recent Presidentts Report on the Development Finance Companies
Project (P-592, May 2, 1968) continue to be valid.
PART VI - COMPDLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGJREEMENT
19.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
20.       I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:
RESOLUTION NO.
Approval of Loan to the Republic of Colombia in
the amount of the equivalent of US$17.2 million
for Fifth Highway Project
RESOLVED:
THAT the Bank shall grant a loan to the Republic of Colombia,
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to seventeen million two
hundred thousand United States dollars (US$17,200,000), to mature on and
prior to May 15, 1992 to bear interest at the rate of six and one-quarter
percent (6-l/40ho) per annum, and to be upon such other terms and condi-
tions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions
set forth in the form of Loan Agreement (Fifth Highway Project) between
the Republic of Colombia and the Bank, which has been presented to this
