project provides for the\n            construction of important sections of the highway system,\n            including the completion of the main trunk highways linking\n            Medellin and Cali, both important centers of industry and\n            agriculture, with their natural port outlets at Cartagena on\n            the Atlantic and Buenaventura on the Pacific. The project\n            would also cover the preparation of pre-investment studies\n            and detailed engineering for other priority roads selected\n            on the basis of the Harvard Transportation Investment\n            Survey, the conclusions of which are expected to become\n            available this summer. In addition, the project would\n            include Phase II of the Management Study, prepared by\n            consultants under Credit 5C0, which involves the\n            implementation of the consultants' recommendations for\n            the reorganization of the Ministry of Public Works. The\n            Project would also provide for miscellaneous laboratory and\n            workshop equipment needed in carrying out the\n            reorganization. The executing agency would be the Ministry\n            of Public Works assisted by consultants."}, "docdt": "1968-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
