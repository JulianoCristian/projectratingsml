participation of Liberians in the economy and stimulate\n            output and employment by providing: (a) term resources\n            through NBL to existing financial institutions to finance\n            SMEs; and (b) technical assistance to NIC to develop a\n            capability to promote and assist SMEs. Direct beneficiaries\n            would be small and medium Liberian entrepreneurs; lower\n            income groups would benefit from increased job\n            opportunities.
