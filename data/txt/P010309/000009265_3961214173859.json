The\n            project achieved its main objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is uncertain at this time, and both the Bank\n            and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, maintenance management\n            needs to be improved to ensure the sustainability of road\n            improvements. Second, measures should be put in place for\n            the control of land use within the road right-of-way and on\n            slopes above and below the road where indiscriminate\n            farming, quarrying, and irrigation could destabilize the\n            slope and road structure. Third, while a number of project\n            delays were outside the full control of either HMGN or IDA,\n            others could have been avoided through decisive actions to\n            expedite project execution. Fourth, efficient contract\n            management can be enhanced through a number of measures,\n            such as increased delegation of decision-making to the\n            project manager. Finally, the introduction of\n            bio-engineering works on a large scale to assist in the\n            stabilization of hillsides was an important factor in the\n            successful outcome of the rehabilitation works."}, "docdt": "1996-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
