support for the ongoing reform process at Tribhuvan\n            University (TU) by supporting the implementation of a\n            package of policy changes in higher education, including the\n            initiation of much-needed systemic changes in the\n            administrative, financial, and management processes of the\n            university.  It finances activities designed to: (a) assist\n            institutional development, decentralization of management\n            authority and strengthening of campus-level management; (b)\n            improve selected facilities at three key campuses; (c)\n            improve instructional delivery and rationalize the\n            centralized student examination system; (d) assist the\n            Ministry of Education and Culture to prepare for higher\n            secondary education reform; and (e) develop TU's\n            maintenance capacity.  Facilities development will give\n            priority to upgrading laboratories and library resource\n            centers plus the rehabilitation of existing facilities at\n            the main Kirtipur campus, and two other lead campuses\n            expected to become the nuclei of regional universities in\n            the future."}, "docdt": "1993-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
