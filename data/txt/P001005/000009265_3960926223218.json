The aim is to achieve\n            this objective through building on and improving the\n            institutional framework in Government for macro-economic\n            decision making. In particular, the project will: (a)\n            strengthen the analytical and planning capabilities of the\n            key economic ministries and agencies; (b) strengthen\n            macro-economic management capabilities through more\n            effective mechanisms for setting priorities, allocating\n            resources and managing the government's policies; (c)\n            upgrade personnel skills through on and off-the-job\n            training; and (d) attract and retain senior management and\n            technical civil servants by providing financial assistance\n            for staff housing."}, "docdt": "1988-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
