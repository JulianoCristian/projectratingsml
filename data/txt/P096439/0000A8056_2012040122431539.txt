                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to enhance livelihood security and sustainability by scaling up institutional mechanisms that reduce the vulnerability of
                         communities throughout Mongolia. SLPII will scale-up nationwide the effective mechanisms and processes piloted under the first phase in the local communities and
                         governments. A wide range of environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive and economically viable project activities would help to preserve the ecological conditions
                         and improve rural people's livelihood in a sustainable manner.
