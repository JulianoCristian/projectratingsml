The Second\n            Sustainable Livelihoods Project (2008-2012) is a part of a\n            three-phase program, which aims to enhance livelihood\n            security and sustainability by scaling up institutional\n            mechanisms that reduce the vulnerability of communities\n            throughout Mongolia. The project was launched in 2008 and\n            has already benefited a total of 1,763,432 people and\n            505,745 households. Over 50 percent of the beneficiaries\n            were women; 16 percent were below the poverty line and 19\n            percent were herders. A third phase of the program the\n            Sustainable Livelihoods Project will be implemented from\n            2013 to 2016. The project will institutionalize appropriate\n            mechanisms used in phase I and II to reduce the\n            vulnerability of rural communities throughout Mongolia and\n            fine-tune innovations for long-term sustainability."}, "docdt": "2011-09-13T09:30:01Z"}
