                         communities throughout Mongolia. SLPII will scale-up nationwide the effective mechanisms and processes piloted under the first phase in the local communities and
                         governments. A wide range of environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive and economically viable project activities would help to preserve the ecological conditions
                         and improve rural people's livelihood in a sustainable manner.
