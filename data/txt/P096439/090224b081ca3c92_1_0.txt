                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to enhance livelihood security and sustainability by scaling up institutional mechanisms that reduce the vulnerability of
                         communities throughout Mongolia. SLPII will scale-up nationwide the effective mechanisms and processes piloted under the first phase in the local communities and
                         governments. A wide range of environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive and economically viable project activities would help to preserve the ecological conditions
                         and improve rural people's livelihood in a sustainable manner.

                         Overall progress toward achieving the PDO is satisfactory as most of the key performance indicators have been achieved. The project has enhanced livelihood security by
                         strengthening the capacity of herder families to better manage environmental, financial and social risk to reduce vulnerability. This was achieved through: (i) the development of a

                         provision of micro-loans for investments in rural off-farm micro-enterprises and livestock improvement to diversify sources of income. The end of project target indicators for 4 out of
                         5 were exceeded. The loan beneficiaries increased by 68 percent (target 35%), the percentage of citizens satisfied with outcomes is 87 percent (target 80%), the perception of
                         herders on improvement in pasture conditions attributable to project intervention is 87 percent (target 85%), and the percentage of herders and soum governments taking actions to
                         mitigate pastoral risk was also 95.6 percent (target 85%). Information is being gathered to document the status of the last remaining indicator "increased income of loan beneficiaries
                         at soum level and below". Another important outcome of the project was the passage of the Integrated Budget Law (IBL) in December 2011 by parliament which effectively
                         institutionalizes the project approach of decentralized fiscal and service delivery and includes community (citizens) participation in local development, budgetary, procurement and
                         monitoring processes.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The third phase of the Sustainable Livelihoods Program (SLP3) which is under preparation, is the final phase and being designed to enhance sustainability of the best practices and
                         lessons learned during implementation of the initial two phases, particularly theimplementation of the Integrated Budget Law and the institutionalization of the micro-finance program.
                         The Government will have to take a decision on the future of the Micro-Finance Development Fund by legalizing and making it an autonomous and independent agency operating as

                         an apex institution for all Non Bank Financial Institution in the country prior to the effectiveness of SLP3. In addition, the retention of key project management staff to ensure smooth
                         transition and start up of SLP3 is required. The completion of a social and cost effectiveness study will highlight the impacts of the project and provide data for missing indicators. A
                         consultant has been engaged and is currently in the field collecting data. The same consultant will assist the Government to prepared their own implementation completion report
                         (ICR) and will also report on the missing indicators by June 30, 2013;
