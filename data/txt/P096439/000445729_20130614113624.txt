  A. SUMMARY

The proposed changes would entail reallocation of project proceeds necessary to allow
final reconciliation of capacity building activities undertaken for the implementation of
the Integrated Budget Law (IBL), which is a major reform of the public budgetary and
expenditure system of the country. These activities have gone ahead beyond in some
cases the specific disbursement category ceiling, and these categories need therefore to be
correspondingly adjusted.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily and is on course to attain its
development objectives. The Project has been scaled up nation-wide, and the fiscal
decentralization that is the backbone of the Project has now become institutionalized with
the passage of the IBL into law by Parliament. The IBL is currently under
implementation with Government budgetary transfers in 2013.

The Project has been estimated to have benefitted over 1 million citizens through
December 2012. Over 29,000 were provided with temporary jobs, and 1288 with
permanent forms of employment. Public facilities that were rehabilitated included 395
hospitals/clinics, out of which 200 were in the soums (rural districts). These hospitals
also received various equipment including ultrasound equipment, beds, ambulance and
laboratory equipment. Some 563 secondary schools were also reached by the Project
through rehabilitation and provision of equipment and teacher learning skills. Other
facilities provided included cultural centers, public baths, water wells and sanitation
facilities. In addition, 1880 sub-projects were undertaken to improve livelihoods and
environmental protection. These included production of forage for livestock feeding,
household gardening, dam construction, and storage facilities. In addition, the
Microfinance Development Fund under the Project provided over US$49 million to
46,091 beneficiaries throughout the country, ensuring the development of livelihood
income-generating activities.

The Project has made satisfactory progress towards achieving the development objectives
as outlined in the PAD, even though data is not available for one of the four PDO
indicators (that which measures the percentage increase in beneficiaries’ annual income).
The indicators show that the remaining targets have been reached and even exceeded.
The loan beneficiaries increased by 68% (target 35%), while percentage of citizens
satisfied with outcomes is 87% (target 80%), and the perception of herders regarding
improvement in pasture conditions attributable to project intervention is 87% (target
85%). The share of herders and soum governments taking actions to mitigate pastoral risk
is also 95.6% (target 85%). Total financing for the Project now stands at US$60.42

                                            4
million equivalent, and disbursement stands at US$60.4 million (99.97%). The audit
report for FY2011 was satisfactory and FY2012 audit is due to the Bank for review by
June 30, 2013.

  C. RATIONAL FOR REALLOCATION

The proposed reallocation is necessary to complete and fully reconcile capacity building
activities for the implementation of the IBL. The Law includes fiscal decentralization
with far greater responsibility placed at the local level. Of particular relevance to the
Project was the inclusion of a new mechanism for transferring capital budget to the soum
level via Local Development Funds, which have largely been modeled on the community
initiative funds developed and rolled out under this Project. The training covers
procurement, financial management and community participation in planning, budgeting,
monitoring and evaluation.
