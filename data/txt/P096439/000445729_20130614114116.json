SLPII will scale up\n            nationwide the effective mechanisms and processes piloted\n            under the first phase in the local communities and\n            governments.  A wide range of environmentally sustainable,\n            socially inclusive and economically viable project\n            activities would help to preserve the ecological conditions\n            and improve rural people's livelihood in a sustainable\n            manner. The restructuring changes will entail reallocation\n            of project proceeds necessary to allow final reconciliation\n            of capacity building activities undertaken for the\n            implementation of the Integrated Budget Law (IBL), which is\n            a major reform of the public budgetary and expenditure\n            system of the country. These activities have gone ahead\n            beyond in some cases the specific disbursement category\n            ceiling, and these categories need therefore to be\n            correspondingly adjusted."}, "docdt": "2013-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
