structural\n            reform program, establish the conditions for a strong supply\n            response, and help meet the basic social needs of the\n            population. The ERL will provide urgent support for the\n            reform effort by continuing the progress achieved under the\n            two previous adjustment loans, and by laying the groundwork\n            for the preparation of future adjustment operations. The\n            project will support a broad program of policy reforms to\n            accelerate Algeria's transition to a market economy.\n            The key components of the program include macroeconomic\n            stabilization, trade and price liberalization, private\n            sector development, privatization, restructuring of the\n            public enterprise sector, public expenditure reform,\n            financial sector reform and strengthening of the social\n            protection system."}, "docdt": "1994-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
