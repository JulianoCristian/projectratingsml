The project did not\n            achieve its main objectives, its impact has been modest,\n            sustainability is unlikely, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed unsatisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, in project design, complex\n            institutional arrangements should be avoided to minimize\n            problems of project coordination, management, and\n            monitoring. Second, care should be taken in assessing the\n            data of crop yields, the opportunities for increasing both\n            yields and areas under cultivation, and the availability of\n            relevant technology. Third, policy conditionality should be\n            included in the design of crop specific projects to maintain\n            the competitiveness of these commodities with potential\n            substitutes. Fourth, if key institutional arrangements are\n            not implemented, more decisive action should be taken by IDA\n            to induce corrective action. Fifth, for complex projects, it\n            is essential that a full time coordinator be appointed for a\n            sufficiently long duration to provide the needed continuity.\n            Sixth, research programs should be tailored initially to the\n            needs of the predominant farming system, to be followed\n            later by more specialized programs. Lastly, adequate staff\n            allocations should be made to ensure timely compliance with\n            auditing covenants."}, "docdt": "1991-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
