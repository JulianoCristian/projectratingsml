The project comprises the\n            installation of three combined cycle power stations located\n            at Kawas (Gujarat), Anta (Rajasthan), and Auraiya (Uttar\n            Pradesh), as well as associated transmission lines for\n            connection to the transmission grid.  This project will\n            introduce combined cycle operation as a new technology as\n            well as the use of natural gas as a fuel for power\n            generation in India.  The gas will be provided primarily\n            from the offshore South Bassein gas field and through the\n            Hazira-Bijaipur-Jagdishpur (HBJ) pipeline."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
