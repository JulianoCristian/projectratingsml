Lessons\n            suggest that the ultimate success of the project was due to\n            three positive factors in the greater environment of the\n            country: strong political support; strong alignment of the\n            interests of economic development, and industrial\n            modernization; and, prior sector analysis, and strategy\n            development at the national, and international levels.\n            However, and regardless of success, negative lessons can be\n            drawn about a certain lack of realism in three items, agreed\n            upon during project negotiations: a) the difficult\n            relationship, and dialogue with the Ministry of Health,\n            seemingly suggests that strong funding support could have\n            facilitated access, and, that access across sectors\n            reinforces the interdependence of key sectors to achieve\n            objectives; b) the short implementation period, highlighting\n            the constructive aspect of project extensions, which often\n            compensates unforeseen factors that come into play during\n            implementation; and, c) the unnecessarily onerous conditions\n            of effectiveness, could have been arranged through a more\n            phased approach, avoiding irritant situations of managerial concern."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
