The Bank's performance was good but the Bank\n            was not so successful in the more difficult areas of\n            strengthening the Liberia Electricity Corporation\n            (LEC)'s management and training of their staff. One of\n            the probable reasons for this was inadequate supervision.\n            The average time between consecutive supervision missions\n            was twelve and one half months which was not adequate to\n            follow up the implementation of so difficult a project. Some\n            programs started and stopped between missions without the\n            possibility of assistance or intervention from the Bank. The\n            Third Power Project succeeded in creating an efficient\n            planning unit in LEC, in completing the investigation of the\n            major hydro resources within easy access of the main load\n            center of Monrovia, in preparing a detailed five-year\n            investment plan and in helping to lay the foundation for the\n            establishment of a long range plan for the power sector. The\n            project was not successful, in making any substantial\n            contribution to the strengthening of management or training\n            of LEC's staff."}, "docdt": "1982-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
