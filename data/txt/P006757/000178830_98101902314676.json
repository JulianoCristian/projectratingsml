the 1978-82\n            national power expansion program and it includes: (a)\n            consisting of two surface powerhouses, each with three\n            generating units totaling 600 MW, and tunnels and penstocks,\n            as well as a pumping station for an existing head pond, and\n            three 230 kV transmission lines; (b) strengthening of the\n            Sesquile dam against possible future earthquake damage; (c)\n            an asset valuation study; and (d) technical assistance to\n            EEEB on financial planning and staff training. The project\n            is an unusually low-cost power development, as large dams\n            are unnecessary. The Mesitas facility would meet about 95%\n            of projected incremental energy demand in the EEEB system\n            during 1982-84, including that attributable to 70,000 new\n            subscribers to be connected annual over this period.\n            Improvement of EEEB's structure of tariffs and rates\n            would be a major institutional focus of the proposed loan.\n            The project is subject to the risks normally associated with\n            underground civil works under difficult geological\n            conditions. However, the actions that have been taken to\n            minimize risk should ensure that the project will be carried\n            out as scheduled."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
