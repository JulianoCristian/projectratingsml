Block 1: Project Description
1. Project Development Objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
Background: The Bethlehem 2000 project (B2000) builds on the initiatives of the existing Municipal
Infrastructure Development Project (MIDP, FY96), extending these initiatives to the four new municipalities
(Bethlehem, Beit Sahor, Beit Jala & Doha). Together these municipalities comprise the Bethlehem area (the
Area Municipalities) and have a population of about 100,000. MIDP focuses on high priority infrastructure
rehabilitation as well as municipal capacity building. The latter has a national as well as a local dimension.
The national dimension focuses on legal, institutional and financial reform involving, for example, such issues
as: decentralization (central/local relationships); revenue mobilization and sharing; regional investment
programming; and the role, structure and capacity of the Ministry of Local Government (MLG). This initiative
represents the first attempt in recent years at significant local govermnent sector reform. The local (municipal)
dimension focuses on: improving financial planning and management; modernizing accounting systems;
improving revenue mobilization and cost recovery; strengthening service delivery; and rationalizing,
commercializing and privatizing service provision.2
A Unique Opportunity: B2000, while also focusing on high priority infrastructure rehabilitation and municipal
capacity building, is unique. Bethlehem has an economic and cultural base anchored in history, religion and
tourism. The year 2000, signifying as it does the end of the millennium and the 2000' anniversary of the birth
of Christ in Bethlehem, is a quite special year. These two sets of factors give rise to a unique opportunity.
B2000 seeks to capitalize on this opportunity to accelerate progress towards the achievement of a number of
important sectoral and national developmental objectives (see below). Recognizing the significance of the
anniversary and the opportunity, the Palestinian Authority (PA) plans to stage celebrations over the sixteen (16)
month period beginning December 1999 and to invite the world to participate. To plan and manage the
celebrations, it has established the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority3 under the direct supervision of President
Yasser Arafat.
Objectives: The primary objectives of B2000 are to: 1) strengthen the economic and cultural base of the
Bethlehem Area Municipalities and foster their sustainable development through tourism promotion and
product development; 2) strengthen the infrastructural, fnancial and managerial base of these municipalities
through a program of investment, reform and capacity building; and 3) begin to foster the preservation of
cultural assets in the West Bank and Gaza (assets of worldwide importance and value) by initiating a national
process of policy and institutional reform and capacity building.
Key Performance Indicators: The key performance indicators are: Strengthening the Economic and Cultural
Base: (1) the production of world class media events on or about Christmas days 1999 and 2000, with live
international television broadcasts from Bethlehem; and (2) a significant increase in the numbers of tourists
visiting and the percent of tourism expenditure captured by the local economy during the celebrations and in
the post celebrations decade (2001-2010); Strengthening Infrastructural, Financial and Managerial Capacity:
(I) Increase in number of households provided with reliable water and sanitation services; (2) reduction of
travel time on key sections of the road network; and (3) significant increase in revenue mobilization and cost
recovery by area LGs in the post celebrations period; Preserving of Cultural Assets: (I)  initiation of a
dialogue on national conservation policy and institutional arrangements; and (2) increase in the number of
historic buildings rehabilitated and/or sustainably reused in the Bethlehem Area.
2 MIDP capacity building encompases five pilot (or selected) municipalities: Nablus, Jenin, Hebron, Gaza and Rafah.
Authority established by Presidential Decree dated March 20, 1998.

3. Benefits and Target Population:
While widespread benefits would accrue to the Bethlehem area population, significant benefits would also
accrue to the national population from the major lift provided to the tourist industry and the general
improvement in urban efficiency. The benefits to the area include: increased tourism earnings by both private
and public sectors; improvements in infrastructural services including reductions in vehicle operating costs and
travel times, increase in the number of households provided with reliable water and sanitation services;
improvements in public health and environmental conditions; employment generation (about 600 person years,
direct); preservation of local infrastructure and cultural assets; improvement in the conditions for private sector
investment and development; improvement in the fiscal efficiency of the Area Municipalities and increase in
the long term potential of Bethlehem as a tourist destination. The wider benefits include: increased foreign
exchange earnings from tourism; reduction in the demands made on the PA's Budget by the area LGs';
increased preservation of national cultural assets; increased international awareness of Palestine as a Tourist
destination and Palestinian and Arab culture and increased international recognition and understanding of the
problems and opportunities of Palestine.
Economic Benefits:
a) Quantified for Economic Analysis: These include the incremental tourism expenditures accruing to
Palestine during the celebrations and subsequent years (to 2010) as a result of the combined effect of increased
visitation and per capita spending--in turn, a result of marketing, events and improved tourism product; time
and vehicle operating costs as a result of road investments; and increase in water supply availability.
b) Non-Quantifiable Economic Beneffs: These include preservation of cultural heritage assets for future
Palestinian generations; deepened and broadened tourism product; demonstration effect that is likely to pull
more private resources into tourism product development; cultural heritage preservation; and increased private
sector investment as result of improvement in the enabling environment (better infrastructural services).
Target Population: The project is targeted at the worldwide tourism market, particularly the religious and
cultural heritage segments of this market. This market numbers several hundreds of millions, but the
immediate target is the potential visitor to the Holy Land for the Millennium celebration. This is estimated to
be a maximum of four million in the year 2000'. Closer to home, the project is targeted at the approximately
100,000 persons in the Bethlehem area who would benefit directly from the investments. Closer still are those
private companies and individuals directly involved in providing goods and services to visitors. They would
benefit by increased incomes and investment opportunities.
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
Implementation Period: The project would be implemented over the three (3) year period beginning in
November 1998 and ending December 31, 2001. The closing date would be June 30, 2002. Time is of the
essence; thus the project would be implemented in a carefully sequenced manner. The focus during the first
year would be on those components (events, marketing, infrastructure, etc.) which are essential for the
effective staging of the celebrations. When this is well in hand, say by end- 1999, the focus would begin to shift
to the municipal and cultural heritage capacity building issues.
Executing Agencies: The Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority6 would be responsible for all activities directly
related to the celebrations and physical works. The Area Municipalities and MLG would be responsible for the
Municipal Capacity Building component and each of the Area Municipalities and MLG would enter into an
Implementation Agreement in this respect. The execution of these Agreements on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA is a condition of Effectiveness. The Department of Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism
and Antiquities would be responsible for the Cultural Heritage Capacity Building component in consultation
with the Ministry of Culture.

Project Coordination: The main components of the project would be implemented by the Project Authority in
consultation with Area Municipalities and the DOA. These components ("1", "2" & "4(b)") include high-
priority infrastructure rehabilitation; event development, marketing, sponsorship, financing, strategic planning
and overall construction and project management7. In preparing and managing the infrastructure components,
the Authority would be assisted by leading international and local consultants supported under B2000,
(Recruitment would be in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Consultants, 1997.). It would also be assisted,
where necessary, by PECDAR, whose capabilities were established under earlier Bank projects. The municipal
capacity building component ("3(a)") would be implemented by the Area Municipalities with the assistance of
MLG and local and international consultants supported under the project. The cultural preservation capacity
building component ("3(b)") would be implemented by the MOTA (DOA) and MOC, with the assistance of
local and international consultants supported under the project and UNESCO. Component "4(a)" would be
implemented by MLG. A detailed computerized critical path program developed by the Bethlehem 2000
Authority would provide the operational framework and the mechanism for planning, monitoring and control.
(Draft of Project File.) This would be supplemented by close, on-ground Bank support, geared to the
complexity and intensity of activities.
Project Oversight and Policy Guidance: Guidance for the major components would be provided by the
Bethlehem 2000 Ministerial Committee (see section No. 6 below). MLG would provide oversight and
guidance for the municipal capacity building component, and MOTA (DOA) and MOC for the cultural heritage
capacity building component. UNESCO will also assist with the latter.
Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements: While the B2000 Project Authority would
keep its own accounts which would be audited annually, for reasons explained below (next para), MLG would
be responsible for the overall consolidation of the project accounts. This responsibility would reside with the
Capacity Building Unit (CBU) of MLG (established under MIDP) assisted by consultants supported under the
project.  The CBU would ensure that: professionally acceptable computerized accounting systems are
established and maintained; that monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements are prepared reflecting all
project activities and transactions; and that these accounts be audited annually in accordance with Bank
Guidelines by a competent firm acceptable to the Bank. The quarterly reports would be forwarded to the Bank
within one month of the end of each quarter. Audited financial statements would be submitted to the Bank
within six (6) months of the close of each financial year.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements: Since the duration of the project may be greater than the life of
the Project Authority, MLG would also be responsible for overall project monitoring and reporting. However,
in this capacity it would rely heavily on inputs from the Project Authority. Thus CBU would undertake overall
project monitoring, including progress, technical and financial, and performance indicator monitoring. It would
also be responsible for overall project evaluation, with the assistance of the Project Authority, the Bethlehem
Municipalities, MOTA (DOA) and MOC. Environmental monitoring and evaluation would be the
responsibility of the Project Authority, assisted by the Palestinian Environmental Authority (PEnA). All of
these activities would be supported under the project.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS Objective(s) Supported by the Project
Country Strategy: The World Bank Strategy is set out in the Board paper "A World Bank Group Strategy for
the West Bank and Gaza and Request for a Replenishment of the Trust Fundfor Gaza and the West Bank" (R98
- 96) dated April 28, 1998. The strategy sets out the key themes around which the future work program will be
focused. Three of these themes are particularly relevant here:
*  improving the environment for private sector development and supporting public/private partnerships;
* improving public sector management and governance; and
*  institution building.
The Authority is already being supported with USS I .OOm in funding provided from MIDP, and would be further supported under B2000.

The Bethlehem 2000 project specifically addresses both of these themes by providing public infrastructure as a
platform for private sector tourism development in Bethlehem; helping realize the considerable tourism
potential of Palestine's religious, historic and cultural assets; and setting the stage for the emergence of self-
governing institutions on the local and national levels in order to support sustainable economic development.
6. Main Sector Issues and PA Strategy:
Context: The recent history of WBG has been one of occupation; under-investment; hopes of peace and
political settlements; repeated political crises and attendant violence; increasing unemployment as a result of
repeated border closures; severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods; lack of authority over
resource allocation; increasing disillusionment regarding political possibilities; and economic decline brought
about by political uncertainty. This is a context of very high uncertainty and risk These factors require the
Bank to provide very close on-ground support, and to be flexible and responsive to changing circumstances.
Issues: The main sector issues are:
*   Tourism Promotion and Development: Increasing net revenues by developing and effectively marketing
the tourism product; establishing a sound policy framework; and establishing the political, economic,
institutional and infrastructural conditions for sustained private investment;
*  Infrastructure Rehabilitation: Reducing the backlog; establishing a sound strategic framework for
development; and developing a sustainable system of financing improvements and maintaining existing
assets;
*   Urban and Local Governance: Rationalizing roles and responsibilities; developing an efficient legal and
institutional framework; strengthening fnance, accounting and management capacity;
*  Cultural Preservation:  Establishing a sound policy and institutional framework; and developing
appropriate and efficient practices and sustainable fnancing mechanisms.
PA Strategy:
While the PA has yet to develop a fully coherent strategy in any of the above areas, the recently completed
Palestinian Development Plan, 1998-2000 (PDP) presented to the December 1997 Consultative Group (CG)
meeting in Paris is an important step in this direction. Rehabilitation and improvement of infrastructure are
critical objectives of the PDP, together with increasing reliance on the private sector and improving
governance. Furthermore, under MIDP, MLG is working to develop a strategy and a framework for the local
government sector. Finally, under the Technical Assistance Trust Fund for WBG studies are planned which
will assist the PA to develop policies and strategies to promote tourism, private sector investment and cultural
heritage preservation' These studies have been long delayed but are expected to begin shortly. Outputs from
these studies would be taken into consideration during project implementation and adjustments made to project
design where necessary.
a) The B2000 Project Authority: As noted above (Section "1"), the PA has established the Bethlehem 2000
Project Authority as a special purpose organization with a limited life to plan and manage the celebrations. The
Authority is comprised of a Ministerial Committee headed by President Arafat and four Interministerial Sub-
Committees, one each for finance and fund raisings, events and marketing, infrastructure and cultural heritage,
and private sector and tourism. The activities of the Interministerial Sub-Committees and the day to day
activities of the Authority are overseen by a Minister of State who also is the general project coordinator. The
Project Authority itself is comprised of about twenty professionals in three main clusters: 1) finance, private
sector and tourism; 2) events, marketing, public relations and religious affairs; 3) infrastructure, systems and
services. The entire structure together with its technical consultants would be supported under the project8.
b) The B2000 Fund: Supplementing and supporting the Project Authority and an important constituent part of
the overall structure, is the B2000 Fund. The Fund would act as a vehicle for resource mobilization and
allocation. It would have a highly respected Board of Trustees who would provide oversight and guidance on
the use and investment of resources, and would be managed professionally by a competent and highly respected
international firm.
Additional consulting support is being septely provided to the Project Authority by Arithur Andersen consultants.

c) The B2000 Business Plan: The Plan and its supporting documentation are the basic guiding documents for
the Authority and the celebrations. (See Annex 2(a) for the Executive Summary of the Business Plan.) This
plan was originally prepared for a joint B2000/EU/UNDP/UNESCO/World Bank Fund Raising Conference
held in Brussels on May 11-12, 1998. It lays out the basic aims and objectives of the celebrations. While the
budget has been significantly modified and elements of the organization framework slightly altered the Plan as
a whole remains valid.
7. Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices:
As noted earlier, the proposed project seeks to capitalize on the unique opportunity and significance of
Bethlehem 2000 to accelerate progress towards the achievement of a number of important objectives. These
include tourism promotion, municipal reform and capacity building, and cultural heritage preservation (see
Section 1). B2000 does not attempt to create an extensive framework for tourism development, nor does it
attempt to resolve the more entrenched issues of private sector development. These are strategic choices. The
political, legal, institutional, financial and technical issues involved in formulating comprehensive tourism and
private sector development strategies and unblocking current systemic rigidities are too complex to be tackled
within the current project framework. The project does however provide a considerable push in these two vital
areas, and will help establish the basis for their sustainable development.
Private Sector Components and the IFC: B2000 does not aim to provide direct financial or technical support
to the private sector. This task would be undertaken by IFC in close consultation with the Bank, the Bethlehem
2000 Project Authority and Area Municipalities. Two hotels are currently being considered for financing in
Bethlehem by the IFC, and other investments are under consideration. These include a car/coach park, which
would be ajoint public-private partnership, and a cultural/entertainment center.
8. Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection:
In mid-1997 the Bank recognized that the celebrations, while having a religious focus, were of unique
worldwide historical and cultural significance and also had the potential to advance the long-termn sustainable
development of the tourism sector. It was further recognized that significant cultural preservation issues were
at stake. However, the political, economic and technical risks were significant and Bank resources were
limited. In developing a strategy, five alternatives were considered. These ranged from a narrow focus on
infrastructure rehabilitation (the minimalist case), to total program support (long term tourism/private sector
development, the maximalist case). The former was clearly insufficient given the significance of the occasion
and the problems then being encountered by the Bethlehem 2000 Steering Committee (the Committee initially
established by the PA to prepare and coordinate the celebrations)9. The maximalist option was clearly beyond
our capacity to prepare and manage effectively given time, budget and other constraints, and would in any case
have overburdened the project.
The on-going MIDP provided the obvious point of departure, but it was quickly realized that the PA by itself
was unable to adequately prepare the celebrations and realize the potential thereof. Some donors showed great
interest in supporting individual infrastructure and cultural components, but none showed much interest in
helping to support the organizational, technical and financial prerequisites for successfully preparing the
celebrations. Also, few showed any interest in supporting the municipalities or helping to realize the long-term
potential of the celebrations.
With the real possibility that the entire effort could be stillborn or reduced to very limited infrastructure
improvements, Dr. Ashrawi, then the Minister of Higher Education and Chairman of the Bethlehem 2000
Steering Committee, requested The World Bank to assist When the options were reviewed it was decided that
the Bank should go beyond simply extending MIDP and help the PA to establish the organizational, financial
and programmatic framework for the celebrations. This included helping to provide critical world-class
expertise through technical assistance The longer-term and highly complex tourism and private sector
development issues were left for the future and to others. The cultural preservation issues were considered
integral to Bethlehem, however; hence an important but modest start was proposed in this area.
9 lhe Steering Conmnittee is now defuncL It has been succeeded by The Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority.

10. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design:
During the course of implementing projects in WBG, including the first five in the Assistance Program, the
following key lessons have been learned:



Project Appraisal Document                                                                      Page 9
West Bank and Gaza                                                              Bethlehem 2000 Project (B2000)
* there must be strong ownership by and good dialogue with the PA and its constituent organizations, if necessary
implementation decisions are to be taken on a timely basis;
* adequate "slack" time must be provided if the vicissitudes of border closures (political risks) are to be weathered;
* the provision of operating support to implementing units is critical to establishing managerial and technical
capacity.
* close on-the-ground supervision and willingness to be flexible in adapting the project to local realities is
essential;
These lessons have all been built into the project design. In particular, good working relationships have been
developed with the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority and the Area Municipalities.
B2000 faces two unique risks: (i) time is of the essence; and (ii) visitor access to Bethlehem can be shut off
entirely at a moment's notice by unilateral border closures. The first factor would be addressed by accelerated
preparation and the employment of construction management consultants. The second factor would be addressed
primarily by focusing strongly on the "media" dimension of the celebrations. Thus even in the event ofprolonged
closure the international media show would go on. The risks would also be addressed through dialogue with
critical Israeli stakeholders namely, the hotel and tour operators who stand to benefit.
11. Indications of Borrower and Recipient Commitment and Ownership:
The key indicator is that President Arafat, himself, heads the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority. Also the PA has
announced publicly that the celebrations are a high priority national effort. Finally, key steps have been taken by
the PA in establishing the institutional and operating framework for the celebrations (see Section No. 6 above and
Annex 2(a)) and providing budget support.
12. Value Added of Bank Support:
Without Bank support the celebrations would be unlikely to realize their potential. By working in very close
consultation with Palestinian counterparts the original conceptual, institutional, managerial, financial and
operational framework of B2000 celebrations has been transformed. Bank involvement has helped also to
strengthen Palestinian managerial capacity. Finally, it has helped to generate confidence among donors and the
private sector whose support is essential to the success of the celebrations. It should be noted here that UNESCO
and the Italian government have also contributed significantly in undertaking preliminary work on the Bethlehem
2000 project. Their Emergency Action Plan provides the basis for infrastructure programming. UNDP and a
number of other donors have also provided important operating support to B2000. Nevertheless, Bank support has
been pivotal.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the Project File. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment  [x] Cost-Benefit Analysis:        []  Cost Effectiveness  []   Other
(see Annex 4):               NPV=US$         million;           Analysis:
ERR= >14%
The main objectives of the B2000 project are: (i) to promote tourism development which will generate
employment and foreign exchange eamings; (ii) to strengthen the infrastructural, financial and managerial base
of the included municipalities; and (iii) to preserve cultural heritage sites.
There is a strong rationale for proceeding with the B2000 project as a public intervention; the project
counterfactual of a private sector project to promote the B2000 project on commercial terms is not viable given
the need for infrastructure and cultural heritage investments and institutional strengthening to sustain the
benefits from the project. The B2000 project is also an appropriate form of intervention given that alternative
interventions such as subsidies to tourism development, private sector investment in infrastructure and
regulatory based preservation of cultural heritage are not seen as viable under the present economic and financial
circumstances.
The main economic benefits from the B2000 project come from the development of the tourism sector in
Bethlehem that will generate employment and enhance foreign exchange earnings. The components of the
project, which will substantially influence the number of visitors and their spending pattern, are the events and
their marketing. However, infrastructure rehabilitation and cultural heritage preservation are essential pre-
requisites for visitors to come. Three scenarios have been outlined regarding visitor numbers and spending up to

West Bank and Gaza                                                                    Bethlehem 2000 Project (92000)
the year 2010. Scenario "I' is the optimistic case assuming a successfully implemented events program and new
attractions with long term sustainability. Scenario "2" assumes a more restricted marketing effort. Scenario 113N
is the situation without the B2000 project and with continued political deadlock. This is the base case against
which the two first scenarios are compared. For the economic analysis the four major components of the B2000
project have been analyzed separately: (i) the celebrations support to the B2000 Project Authority; (ii) cultural
heritage; (iii) road projects; and (iv) water projects.
B2000 Project Authority Support: This component provides support for the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority
for developing and staging the events program. Without a successful events program the increase in visitors and
spending is unlikely to materialize. The economic rate of return, though largely indicative because of date
limitations, clearly illustrates the size of potential benefits. Even assuming a quite moderate visitor response the
economic rate of return is above 14 percent, our threshold rate. (It should be noted that this rate is above the
opportunity cost of capital (10-1 1%) but is thought appropriate given the risks and data uncertainties.) If the
more optimistic scenario regarding visitor numbers can be realized the economic rate of return doubles.
Sensitivity analysis shows that the component is very sensitive to assumptions regarding visitor spending (and
number of visitors) whereas it is less so to cost overruns.
Cultural Heritage: This component focuses on cultural heritage rehabilitation in the old cores of Beit Jala and
Beit Sahor. This will make these old city cores more attractive for visitors. The quantifiable economic benefits
primarily come from an increase in the number of visitors (and related spending) to Beit Jala and Beit Sahor.
The non-quantifiable benefits are also large. The most important of these are: (i) preservation of Palestinian
heritage to the benefit of present and future Palestinian generations; (ii) a deepened and broadened tourist
product; and (iii) a demonstration effect that is likely to pull in more resources for cultural heritage preservation.
Because the non-quantifiable benefits are likely to outweigh the quantifiable benefits no attempt has been made
to estimate the impact in terms of cost-benefit analysis.
Roads: A total of fifteen (15) proposed road projects has been analyzed by a combination of cost benefit and
cost effectiveness analysis. Out of these, four (4) projects have been selected for inclusion in the B2000 project.
The road rehabilitation projects all show high economic benefits with economic rates of return in the range of
25-33%. The projects are quite resilient to changes in cost and traffic assumptions.
Water: A total of eleven (11) proposed water projects has been analyzed again by cost benefit and cost
effectiveness analysis. Of these, four (4) projects have been selected for the B2000 project. Generally, the larger
projects have the lowest economic rates of return. Still, all four projects have rates of return above the threshold
rate of 14%. The water projects are quite sensitive to cost assumptions.
Summary: The overall average economic rate of return is summarized in "Annex 4." As indicated there, the
rate of return in the base case is quite high at 22.8%. Even when adjusted to a worst case outcome for all
projects the average economic rate of return, at 17.1%, is above the threshold rate of return of 14%.
Level of risk:. All Bank operations in the West Bank and Gaza are exposed to a high level of risk (see Section
No. 6). In addition, there are a number of project specific risks. The main risk is that a further deterioration of
the peace process will adversely impact the flow of visitors to Bethlehem as well as be a deterrent to attempts to
increase the number of overnight stays. Secondly, an insufficient product development and marketing effort by
the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority, the MOTA and the private sector could lead to a lower number of
visitors and a reduced revenue stream for the Project Authority. Thirdly, to increase the economic benefits for
the Palestinian economy, it is essential that the private tourism industry develop further. This requires a positive
private sector response in the form of new investments in hotels (accommodation), restaurants, shops, tour
operators and other tourism facilities. A better commercial tourist product, in addition to a well preserved
cultural heritage, is required to attract tourists to stay longer in Bethlehem and thereby increase the value added
generated by the tourism industry for the benefit of the Palestinian economy. However, a continued relatively
low level of productive private sector investments could be an impediment to realizing this goal.
Fiscal impact (for alprojects): The net fiscal impact of the project cannot be precisely calculated at this time.
It will depend partly on the number of visitors, their spending, and the extent to which local economy and
governmental institutions are able to capture a share of the anticipated incremental revenue. On the whole the



Project Appraisal Document                                                                      Page 11

impact can be expected to be quite positive, particularly if the private sector responds to the investment
opportunities provided and the municipal financial reform and capacity building components are effectively
implemented.  The latter would ensure that the Area Municipalities pay greater attention to revenue
mobilization, cost recovery, and asset utilization and maintenance.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)   NPV= N.A.; FRR= N.A.
The total estimated cost of the entire Bethlehem 2000 Celebrations Program is about US$212m net of financing
charges. The proposed credit of US$25.Om would cover 11% of total program costs. The balance would be
covered from: other donor contributions'°; the PA (including a small contribution by the Area Municipalities);
licenses, royalties and rights; ticket sales and sponsorships; and fund raising. The project cost (US$25.0m) is net
of VAT and other taxes. The foreign exchange component is estimated at about 46% of the total project cost.
Physical contingencies have been allowed for at 10% of base costs and price contingencies at 3% per annum in
accordance with World Bank/IDA guidelines over the three-year implementation period beginning November
1998. Approximately 60% (US$15.0m) of the proposed IDA credit would be used to finance the rehabilitation
and improvement of high-priority infrastructure and cultural heritage assets; 24% (US$6.0m) would be used to
support the preparations (technical assistance and consultancies, planning, management, operating costs, etc.) for
the celebrations; 14% (US$3.5m) would be used to support municipal and cultural heritage preservation capacity
building; and 2% (US$0.5m) would be used of overall project monitoring and reporting. Given the urgency of
the project and the need for accelerated preparation and implementation, retroactive cost financing has been
agreed of up to 20% (US$5.0m) of total project costs, for works and studies undertaken prior to project
effectiveness. The detailed project cost table is presented in Annex 3. Preliminary estimates on the overall
B2000 Celebrations Program cost and financing are presented in Annex 5. These estimates were discussed at
Negotiations and will continue to befiurther refined as the project develops.
15. Technical Assessment:
The project is technically sound.  Preliminary technical assessments were made of some seventy (70)
Infrastructure sub-projects. These were screened for: priority for the celebration and for the community;
contribution to reducing the backlog on the major infrastructure networks; contribution to resolving major
Infrastructure network bottlenecks; and readiness for implementation. A similarly intensive review was
undertaken of the cultural heritage works sub-component, in consultation with B2000, DOA and UNESCO.
Based on this screening about thirty (30) of the highest priority sub-projects were subjected to detailed technical
and economic analysis. From this set the fnal sub-project list was selected, representing the highest priority and
most feasible sub-projects, given the choices of other donors. Final sub-project selection was closely coordinated
with the Project Authority, the Area Municipalities and the DOA. Technical reviews were undertaken with the
assistance of competent local and international consultants. The capacity building components have also been
thoroughly reviewed by competent local and foreign consultants. UNESCO, in particular, has assisted in
defining and reviewing the cultural heritage preservation component. The municipal support component is an
extension of work already in progress under MIDP and was closely coordinated with MLG. In the case of the
B2000 Project Authority support component, assistance has been obtained from competent international
consultants, including one of the main consultants to the London Millennium celebrations project. Finally the
project draws on the successful experience of implementing five projects on the ground in WBG.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a) Executing Agencies: The key institutions involved in the project are: The Bethlehem 2000 Project
Authority; The Ministry of Local Government and the Area Municipalities; and the Department of Antiquities of
the Ministry of Tourism.
The B2000 Project Authority: This organization has already been described in Section 6 (see also Annex 2"a").
It is new and relatively untested, but it is very ably led and strongly supported by the PA. It would be further
supported under the project through the recruitment (according to Bank Guidelines) of competent local and
international consultants in the areas of finance, marketing, tourism, sponsorship, events and construction
management. Also it would be able to draw on systems already established in other local institutions under
existing Bank projects. Finally it will be assisted through very close on-ground support from the staff of the
resident mission. The Authority is in the process of establishing systems and staffing up. It is expected that by
'° A number of Donors including Italy, Norway and EIB have shown interest in cofinancing jointly or in parallel. So far no agreements have been
reached.

October 1998 all the key positions will be filled with competent professionals. These positions include the
directors in charge of fnance and marketing. The recruitment of these professionals and the establishment of
project control, accounting and reporting systems satisfactory to IDA was agreed at Negotiations and are
Conditions of Effectiveness.
MLG and the Area Municipalities: These institutions are relatively weak. However, MLG is currently
receiving major capacity building support under MIDP and the projects of a number of donors including
USAID, UNDP and the Netherlands.  This assistance should enable MLG to effectively exercise its
responsibilities. The CBU in MLG has been singled out for special support under the project since they will
play an important role in assisting the Area Municipalities and in overall project monitoring and reporting. In
particular, CBU's accounting staff would be strengthened as well as its accounting and computer systems. The
employment of a qualified project accountant and the establishment of computerized accounting, project,
planning, control and monitoring systems acceptable to IDA was agreed by Negotiations, and are Conditions of
Effectiveness. With respect to the Area Municipalities, an extensive program of support is planned (see detailed
description in Annex 2(c)). This support would be delivered with the assistance of MLG, and under the
implementation agreements (see para "4" above).
MOTA (DOA): This institution, acting in consultation with MOC, would be responsible for initiating
implementation of the cultural heritage preservation component. It is weak, but it would be the beneficiary of
major capacity building support efforts under the project. Assisting in this important task would be UNESCO
and consultants supported under the project. A fundamental medium term objective is to transform DOA into an
effective institution for safeguarding Palestine's cultural assets and harnessing these assets for national
development as well as for the enjoyment and education of both Palestinians and visitors. A letter of PA
Cultural Heritage Preservation Policy was presented to the Bank at Negotiations (see Annex 5).
b) Project Management: As noted repeatedly above (Sections 1, 4 and 6), the major responsibility for project
management would lie with the B2000 Project Authority. They would be responsible for implementing
components which together account for 84% of total project costs. Infrastructure and cultural heritage
preservation and rehabilitation works account for about 70% (by value) of this responsibility. To enable the
Project Authority to effectively undertake its tasks it would be assisted by construction management and a
number of other internationally recruited consultants supported under the project. (See also discussion above and
in Sections 4 & 6.)
In sum, the local institutions are weak but would be intensively assisted by local and international consultants
hired under the project, through support from UNESCO, and through very intensive resident mission support.
The mission support task will not be easy, but given our experience in WBG over the last four years it should be
doable. Finally, the PA is very highly committed to the success of the project and is providing very able
leadership. This will make a considerable difference by ensuring that problems, when they arise, are addressed
quickly and effectively.
17. Social Assessment: A full, formal social assessment is not required at this time as the project investment
components are limited to public infrastructure, facilities and spaces, and unoccupied buildings. Nevertheless
consultation with, and participation by several community groups has been a feature of the development of this
project. In addition, studies on Palestinian community attitudes towards cultural heritage influenced the design
of the policy and institutional development components. These have deliberately built in significant community
influence on future activities, especially with regard to cultural heritage. This is in recognition that the
sustainability of the cultural heritage program, and hence the tourism strategy, is dependent on that program
being responsive to community interests.
18 Environmental Assessment:    Environmental Category  1]  A      [x]   B       [I   C
The proposed Project would support enviromnental improvements in the Bethlehem region through: (a)
rehabilitation of roads, reducing current serious congestion problems and associated air pollution and noise
impacts; (b) provision of a good quality, reliable domestic water supply for commercial and household use; and
(c) preservation of cultural heritage through rehabilitation and conservation measures. Since most of the
investment activities to be supported by the proposed Project deal with rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, it
has been placed in environmental screening "category B" in accordance with World Bank Operational Policy
4.01 (January 1998). As per Bank requirements, a detailed Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been

prepared and is included in the Project File. The Environmental Data Sheet is presented in Annex 6. The EMP
would support: (a) site-specific environmental screening for sub-projects and Project supported activities for
rehabilitation of roads, rehabilitation of water supply and preservation of cultural heritage sites; (b)
establishment of an Environmental Unit within the construction management section of the B2000 Project
Authority; (c) training of staff of B2000 and other sector ministries involved in Project implementation; and (d)
monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measures identified in the site-specific reviews. All activities related to
the EMP would be closely coordinated with the Palestinian Environmental Authority (PEnA) and other relevant
sector ministries. Funding for the plan has been incorporated in the overall project budget and a tentative
implementation schedule has also been included. The Project design process included extensive discussions
with mayors and other representatives of the Area Municipalities. Consultations were also held with the main
religious organizations such as: Middle East Council of Churches (MEC); the major community groups;
Bethlehem University and local and international nongovernmental organizations working in the area. All
works have been carefully selected; hence there will be no displacement of households.

20. Sustainability:
The Palestinian Authority has indicated that B2000 is one of their highest priority projects, and MLG and the
Bethlehem Municipalities recognize the potential benefits involved. The MOTA (DOA) and MOC also
recognize that this is an excellent opportunity to effect major and long awaited institutional and policy change.
Further, the Israeli travel trade recognizes the opportunity for increased earnings since the largest share by far of
the tourist "spend" accrues to them. Thus all stakeholders have strong incentives to implement the project
successfully and to insure the sustainability of project benefits.  As important, the municipal, cultural
development and related tourism components are part of on-going strategies and programs in these sectors. The
project by its design is intended to reinforce these efforts by raising the profile of Palestine, expanding its market
and creating the preconditions for accelerated and sustained private investment.

Overall project risk rating
Overall Risk Rating             S    Although overall risk rating is "S," close Bank supervision and
collaboration with key stakeholders should mitigate the risks.
WBG is a high-risk country. Despite this, the Bank's program
is currently being satisfactorily implemented.  The high
potential payoff makes this project a very worthwhile one.
M = Moderate, S = Significant, H = High
22. Possible Controversial Aspects: There are no issues of significance.
Block 4: Main Loan Conditions
At Negotiations agreements were reached with the B2000 Project Authority on the overall program fnancing
strategy, action plan, the appointment of the directors of finance and of marketing; and the establishment of
accounting, planning and project control systems. Agreements were reached with MLG on the appointment of
a qualified project accountant and the establishment of accounting, planning and project control systems.
Understanding has also been reached with MOTA and MOC on a letter of Cultural Heritage Preservation policy
(included as Annex 5). There are no conditions of Board.
23. Effectiveness Conditions
The Conditions of Effectiveness are as follows:
1) The B2000,Project Authority:
a) Appointment of the directors of finance and of marketing;
b) Installation of computerized accounting systems;
c) Installation of computerized project planning, control and monitoring systems;
2) MLG:
a) Appointment of a qualified project accountant;
b) Installation of computerized accounting systems;
c) Installation of computerized project planning, control and monitoring systems;
d) Execution of Implementation Agreements with each of the Area Municipalities.
These would all need to be satisfactory to the Bank.

ANNEX 2
Detailed Project Description
Components
Project Component 1: Celebrations Support (US$6.0m, 24% of totalproject cost):
This component provides broad support to the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority to prepare for and manage the
celebrations. The following items would be supported:
A. Development and Promotion Expenses (US$3.0m): 1) technical assistance and consultants' services to help
develop and stage international and local events (including cultural, social, religious and major media events) for the
celebrations; 2) technical assistance and consultants' services to develop and implement effective marketing and public
relations programs in support of the celebrations and the tourism promotion; 3) technical assistance and consultants'
services to protect and maximize the benefits from property and intellectual rights arising out of the celebrations
(including feasibility studies and the preparation, negotiation and execution of contracts); 4) ancillary expenses
associated with the above including publications, travel, subsistence, equipment, materials and supplies.
B. Construction Management Expenses (US$1.6m): 1) technical assistance and consultants' services to help plan
coordinate, monitor and manage the construction activities of the various agencies and contractors engaged in
preparing and implementing the infrastructure and other works required for or associated with the celebrations,
including ensuring compliance with environmental standards and regulations; and 2) ancillary expenses associated
with the above including publications, travel, subsistence, equipment, materials and supplies.
C.  Capital and Operating Expenses (USS1.4m): 1) purchase or rental of essential office, furniture, equipment,
computer networks and vehicles for the Project Authority to enable it to adequately prepare for and manage the
celebrations; 2) salaries and benefits for staff of the B2000 Project Authority engaged in preparing and managing the
celebrations; 3) essential supplies, services and utilities (including stationery, consumables, printing, publications,
translation, international travel, communications, hospitality, transportation, accounting, and rent) to enable the Project
Authority to adequately prepare for and manage the celebrations.
(See Annex 2(a) for Summary of the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority, Business Plan. Though the cost and revenue
estimates have been revised downwards and the organigram slightly modified, on the whole this document is still valid
andprovides the basicframeworkfor the celebrations and the B2000 Project Authority.)
Project Component 2: Infrastructure and Cultural Heritage Rehabilitation Works (US$15.Om, 60% of total project
cost):
This component supports physical rehabilitation works and includes two sub-components. These are described below.
A.     Infrastructure Rehabilitation Works ($12.52m): This sub-component provides support to the Bethlehem
2000 Project Authority and Area Municipalities for the rehabilitation and improvement of high-priority infrastructure
and services. It includes two sub-components: 1) Roads: This sub-component includes the following: The
Jerusalem/Hebron and Beit Sahor main roads; Bethlehem roads improvement (maintenance, traffic management and
signage) works arising out of on-going traffic studies, Bus parking lot in Beit Sahor. 2) Water and Sanitation: This
sub-component includes the following: Bethlehem reservoir; and pipelines to the Bethlehem reservoir, from
Duhaisheh to Ayda junction, and from junction to Ayda Camp.
While the above works have been programmed and are under advanced preparation, in order to be of maximum
assistance to the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority it may become necessary to substitute some of the above specified
investments with others of equal merit. This possibility arises particularly with respect to need to adjust to the
priorities of cofmanciers. Another possibility is that Israeli Authorities may decide to rehabilitate the Northern
(Jerusalem) section of the Jerusalem/Hebron main road themselves, freeing IDA resources for other infrastructure
items. Thus some flexibility in the final choice of sub-projects is allowed, subject to IDA's prior approval, but in any
case IDA resources would not be used on any kinds inside Jerusalem boundaries.

Country: West Bank and Gaza                                                      Bethlehem 2000 Project (B2000)
B.     Supportfor Cultural Heritage Rehabilitation Works ($2.48m): This sub-component provides support to the
Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority, Area Municipalities & DOA for the rehabilitation of the historic cores of Beit
Sahor and Beit Jala, as well as the rehabilitation and adaptive reuse on a pilot basis of one historic building in Beit
Sahor (Dar Qumsieh).  The sub-component also makes a provision for safeguarding "chance finds" during
construction. The rehabilitation of the historic cores will include: improvement of services (water, sanitation, lighting
and electricity); the repaving of roads, paths sidewalks using traditional materials (stone) and the rehabilitation/
repair of adjacent facades (walls, shutters, doors, windows, awnings, etc.). Efforts will be made to encourage property
owners benefiting directly from the improvements to improve their own property or contribute to the cost of doing so
(15% - 20% of the total cost of the sub-component).
The Dar Qumsieh Pilot: In the case of Dar Qumsieh, the project would support the cost of essential internal repairs.
It is planned that this building, which is currently dilapidated and unoccupied, be leased from the existing private
owner by the Department of Antiquities and the Ministry of Culture. It would then be rehabilitated and sublet to
private investors who would establish and operate an arts/crafts center cum museum/coffee shop/restaurant, etc., on a
commercial basis. The main lease would be for a term of 10-15 years (renewable) after which the property would
revert to the owner. The details of the lease are still being developed and will be subject to IDA's prior approval. The
project would (separately) provide technical assistance to the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority for feasibility studies
and for preparing and executing the above transactions (see component "I" above). The basic strategy here is to
mobilize community participation and private investment in revitalizing the old historic cores and realizing their
touristic potential. IDA resources would be directed to this end and to developing a sustainable and replicable model.
Archeological "chance find" protection (US$0.10m): This sub-component, included in "B" above, supports the
protection of finds arising out of works under "A" and "B" above.
(See Annex 2(b)forfurther details on this components "A " and "B" andfor cofinancing potentials andpriorities).
Project Component 3: Capacity Building Support (US$3.50m, 14% of totalproject cost):
This component provides capacity building support to Area Municipalities and Cultural Heritage Authorities. The
sub-components are described below.
A.      Support to Bethlehem Area Municipalities ($2.3m): This sub-component provides support to the four
Bethlehem Area Municipalities for strengthening their capacity to plan, finance, manage and maintain municipal
infrastructure and services. It includes technical assistance, consultants' services, equipment materials and supplies to:

needs, resources and potentials, and bearing in mind the need to rationalize services delivery and improve municipal
resource allocation; 5) develop and begin implementing a plan for regional sharing of key municipal services (for
example, solid waste collection, water, sanitation and road maintenance) on an efficient and cost-effective basis; 6)
assess the potential for and feasibility of increasing the revenue yield to the municipalities from the tourism industry;
and 7) assess the business development potential of, and prepare a business development strategy for enhancing the
competitiveness of the area in the national, regional and global market place.
(See Annex 2(c) for outline TORs).
B.     Support Cultural Heritage Preservation (USS1.20m):  This sub-component provides support to the
Department of Antiquities in the Ministry of Tourism and to the Ministry of Culture for policy and institution reform
and development. It includes technical assistance, consultants' services, training support, equipment, materials and
supplies to: 1) review the legal and institutional framework for cultural heritage preservation and management and
develop an appropriate package of reforms; 2) prepare and hold regional seminars on cultural heritage preservation
policy and practice aimed at sharing experience and building a consensus on an appropriate framework for Palestine;
3) begin implementing the agreed reforms arising of " 1 " above (including operational, software, hardware and training
support); 4) prepare an emergency action plan for Hebron and Jericho (with the assistance of UNESCO) along the
lines of that prepared by UNESCO for Bethlehem 2000; 5) prepare a plan for the promotion of Palestinian culture

ANNEX 2 (a)
B2000 Business Plan, Executive Summary'2
* The Bethlehem 2000 Vision and Program
Occasion: As guardians of the birthplace of Christ, the Palestinian people wish to share their celebration of the
2000th anniversary of his birth. Also, as the end of the millennium approaches, they commit themselves to
renewing his vision and universal message.
Invitation: Palestine is issuing an invitation to the world for all to visit Bethlehem. The celebrations will be held
during the sixteen (16) month period beginning Christmas 1999, but all are invited thereafter to make Bethlehem
their annual place of pilgrimage.
Objectives: The immediate objectives are to attract widespread participation (targeting 3 million visitors) and
successfully stage the celebrations. The longer-term objective is to leave a legacy which will promote the
sustainable development of the tourism industry in Bethlehem and Palestine as a whole.
Themes: The key themes will be: peace, hope andjustice.
Program: The overall program includes the following main components: a dignified, varied and high quality
program of live and media events--some to be broadcast to a worldwide television audience; development and
implementation of marketing, public relations, sponsorship and tourism promotion strategies; rehabilitation and
improvement of critical infrastructure and services; culture heritage preservation; private sector mobilization;
program financing; and the establishment of managerial capacity.
Program Cost: This program is expected to cost some US$200 million and be implemented over the three years
beginning January 1998.
* Events, Marketing, Public Relations and Sponsorship
Events: A broad, varied, entertaining and informative program of events is proposed over the sixteen (16) month
period, stressing enduring religious as well as broad, universal human values. Some of the highlights will be:
*   Catch the Star, a 24-hour multi-media event broadcast live to the world from Bethlehem on Christmas Eve
1999.
*   New Year's World Party, a world-class international music festival on the eve of the year 2000 with ten
thousand torches and a minute's silence sending a message around the world.
*   The Passion, a closing celebration on Easter 2001 performed by the Royal National Theater of Great Britain.
Venues: There will be multiple centers of attraction, including Manager Square and the Church of the Nativity, a
Hope Center in the Solomon's Pool area (a few kilometers to the south of Manger Square), Shepherd's Fields, and
the old city coimmercial center.
Marketing and Public Relations: Bethlehem is the true source of the millennium. No other celebration can
make this claim. The watchword, therefore, will be authenticity, and Bethlehem will capitalize on this unique
quality in appealing to a broad international audience. The catch phrase will be Bethlehem, the Star of the
Millennium. A well thought out and carefully sequenced multi-year marketing and public relations program has
been developed to support the celebrations. The core target audience will be the large worldwide constituency of
Christians (numbering over one billion), but the entire program will be designed to appeal to visitors of other
religious persuasions and varied interests.
Sponsorship: Supporting the program of events will be carefully crafted sponsorship strategy aimed at attracting
maximum support from well-known and prestigious international corporations.
* Infrastructure, Cultural Heritage and Support Services
Existing: Bethlehem possesses a tremendous cultural heritage, the most famous part of which is the Church of
Nativity. However, this heritage has not been well maintained and many valuable assets are in a state of near
12 As of July 1998.

collapse. In addition to this, years of neglect have left Bethlehem with hopelessly inadequate infrastructure and
services.
Proposed: It is the aim of the program to preserve, rehabilitate and, where possible, appropriately reuse all
important buildings and monuments. Basic infrastructure and services (roads, water, sewerage electricity,
telephones, garbage collection, security, health, etc.) will also be improved, beginning with those which are most
critical to the success of the celebrations and longer term development of the economy.
* The Tourism and Private Sector Development
Holy Land Total: Credible sources estimate the likely visitation to the Holy Land during the celebrations will be
in the order of four (4)million, assuming the political and security situation does not deteriorate.
Bethlehem: This estimate implies that approximately two (2) million visitors to Bethlehem during the period.
Through a variety of marketing and other initiatives, the program aims to maximize the number of visitors to three
(3) million visitors.
Expenditure Share: The program also aims over time to increase the currently low share (less than 6% of total)
of visitor expenditure accruing to Palestine by building up tourism stock (hotels, restaurants, etc.), improving the
tourism product and improving infrastructure and services.
Private Sector: The private sector has a vital role to play in the development of tourism. The program aims to
provide them with the necessary investment and infrastructural support.
- Organization, Management and Finance
Project Authority: The Palestinian national Authority has established the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority to
plan and manage the implementation of the key activities and events associated with the millennium celebrations.
This authority is headed by HE President Yasser Arafat.
Trust Fund: A special Bethlehem 2000 Trust Fund has also been established to act as a vehicle for international
fund raising.
Finance: As noted above, the entire program is estimated to cost approximately US$ 212 million as follows:
Program Element                                                      Est. Cost - July 1998

Total                                                                        212
* Closing Remarks
The Star: Bethlehem will be the Star of the Millennium. Peoples of all faiths are invited to participate and share
the celebrations with the Palestinian people, and to make Bethlehem their place of annual pilgrimage thereafter.
The Hope: These celebrations offer a chance to renew hope, promote sustainable development and help build the
Palestinian economy. Most of all, it offers a chance to help promote peace and stability in a troubled world.

Annex 2(b)
Infrastructure and Cultural Heritage Component (Works)
The following is a brief description of the IDA components, and a listing of those projects reviewed in detail by
IDA as high priority candidates for cofinancing. Further details are on the Project Files.
Description of Sub-projects
Roads
1. Jerusalem- Hebron Rd. (Highway No. 60): The project involves upgrading Highway No. 60, which passes
through Bethlehem and Beit Jala area. Work also includes construction of the necessary water, sewerage, storm-
water system, and street lighting systems. This project is composed of two main segments, the first of 1.0 Km with
traffic count of 8430 vehicle per day and an economic rate of return of 25% as base case and 20% as the worst case.
The second segment is of 4.2 Km with traffic count of 9242 vehicle per day and an economic rate of return (ERR)
of 27% as base case and 22% as the worst case.
2. Beit Sahor Rd: The project involves upgrading the main road crosses Beit Sahor from east to west. Storm-
water, water, sewerage, street lighting, and retaining structures are to be included in the project, in addition to the
necessary islands and traffic control devices. The project length is 4.35 km with traffic count of 12424 vehicle per
day and an economic rate of return (ERR) of 33% as base case and 28% as the worst case.
3. Inner roads of Bethlehem: The project involves upgrading of the inner roads in different lengths within the
city. Work includes services, pavement, road's geometry and in some areas to increase the width of the road. No
traffic counts have been undertaken for this project because it is not yet very precisely defined. Thus no ERRs have
been calculated, but based on experience in Palestine and elsewhere ERRs are expected to exceed 30%.
4. Bus parking lot in Beit Sahor: This project involves upgrading existing parking lot in Beit Sahor in addition to
landscaping works to accommodate tourist buses visiting the municipal core.
Water and Sanitation
1. Bethlehem Reservoir: The project involves of demolition of an existing, leaking reservoir and the construction
of a new 2500 m3 concrete reservoir to provide enough storage capacity for the town. Based on its 40,000
beneficiaries, the project economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated to be 14% as base case and 10% as worse case.
2. Water Pipeline: The project involves of construction of a 16" diameter, 1300 m. steel water pipeline from 30"
diameter main pipeline to Bethlehem reservoir. Based on its 90,000 beneficiaries, the project economic rate of
return (ERR) is estimated to be 58% as base case and 42% as worse case.
3. Water Pipeline: The project consists of the construction of a 30" diameter, 2300m steel water pipeline from
Duhaisheh 10,000 m3 new reservoir. Based on its 100,000 beneficiaries, the project economic rate of return (ERR)
is estimated to be 15% as base case and 10% as worse case.
4. Water Pipeline: The project consists of the construction of a 16" diameter, 2000m steel water pipeline from
Ayda camp junction. Based on its 70,000 beneficiaries, the project economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated to be
33% as base case and 25% as worse case.
Cultural Heritage
1. The Historic Core of Beit Sahor: The projects proposes pedestrianisation of the main routes; upgrading the
services and infrastructure, pavements and walkways; restoring and repairing stone facades, timber and metal
elements; and providing street lighting and furniture. The work proposed is distributed into four sub-projects:
Wasat El-balad, Hosh Banora, Dakhlet el-Furon and Dar Qumsieh. The latter, includes rehabilitation and adaptive
reuse on a pilot basis of a historic building from the 18dh century.

elements; and providing street lighting and furniture. The work proposed is distributed into three sub-projects:
Shari' Assouk, Haret Addir and Mary's church. The latter, includes rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of the gardens
for open-air cultural activities and upgrading of the existing space for public concerts.
The economic rate of return (ERR) on these components were only partially estimated. The non-quantifiable
benefits are believed to be high and dominate the quantifiable.

Annex 2(c)
Capacity Building: Support to Bethlehem Area Municipalities
(Please see paper "The Bethlehem Municipalities" in Project Files).
This component consists of a number of measures to strengthen municipalities and improve the planning and
management of service delivery in the Bethlehem region within the jurisdiction of its four main municipalities
(Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahor, Al Doha - the BAM). Despite being small and contiguous, each municipality
duplicates efforts to manage the provision of a number of services which could be more efficiently and effectively
managed jointly - a point of view shared by the municipalities. In addition, there is substantial mismatch between
revenues and expenditures among all the municipalities and their revenue structure does not allow for cost recovery
of tourism related expenditures for services. The Bank supported program will be in two parts. Part I will focus on
efforts which provide common benefits to the four municipalities as a group while Part 2 will deal with the
individual requirements of the separate municipalities. The elements of Part I constitute a sequence of studies which
lead to a new, common tax; the design and implement a joint service program for the BAM through a Joint Services
Council (JSC) and support the implementation of the joint service plan; and a unified development strategy to
increase their competitiveness.
These studies are grouped into three packages:
* A Tourism tax study and implementation plan: This study will identify tourism taxes and charges that are
appropriate to be applied in the BAM, including the desirable rates, the collection and distribution mechanisms, and
the public education and capacity building programs needed for effective implementation. Required draft legislation
is also would be prepared.
* JSC program support and studies. These include: A regional plan to locate sharedfacilities and services: a
study needs to be done that updates the various plans underway (for example, for road improvements and traffic
management and water supply and sanitation, currently being done with French Government assistance, for the
B2000 program); and identifies suitable locations for the facilities and services desired by the BAM. Pre-feasibility
studies to size and prioritize joint services: studies will provide the JSC with the information necessary to enable
them to prioritize their implementation program. These studies also would determine the desirable dimensions of
priority facilities so that the investment requirements may be estimated and the cost recovery implications clarified.
Individual studies to design the institutional arrangements for service delivery of priority joint services: Services
selected as priorities will be studied to determine the most efficient modality for implementation. Where possible, in
order to improve the quality of services, competition in the provision of these services or for the right to deliver a
service, would be part of these arrangements. Investment plans for priority services: where a service is to be
delivered by the public sector, the investment plans would be prepared using this facility. Strengthen emergency
services and trqffic management: this would build on the Bethlehem municipality emergency services and extend it
to the other three municipalities, as well as implement measures recommended in the French-assisted traffic
management study. TA to strengthen Joint Services Council to plan and manage program: Technical Assistance
will be provided for systems development, training and other measures required for capacity building.
* Competitiveness strategy: The BAM would like to take maximum advantage of the opportunities that are to
become available as a consequence of the B2000 program. They wish to develop a strategy with the private sector
to facilitate growth that is specifically suited to their context. The project would facilitate this by extending the
approach being developed in Nablus to these municipalities.
Part 2 of the program will assist the individual municipalities in the following areas:
* New accounting system: A new municipal accounting system is being developed for WBG municipalities under
MIDP. It is currently scheduled to be piloted in Gaza and Nablus. The BAM would be included in the second round
of rollouts of the system.

* O&M program: An operations and maintenance program for existing and expanded facilities will be a vital
necessity for the BAM. Technical assistance will assist in its accelerated design and inplementation.
* Three year investment program preparation: To facilitate a coherent and concerted exarnination of revenue
and expenditure structure and programs, the five municipalities participating in MIDP are being assisted in
developing three year investment programns. These include internal capacity building. This support would be
extended to the BAM.
MLG would assist the BAM to execute this component, and would enter into an Implementation Agreement with
each of the Municipalities to this effect. The Implementation Agreements will lay out the duties, responsibilities
and rights of each party.

Annex 2(d)
Capacity Building Component: Support to Cultural Heritage Preservation
(Please see Paper "Cultural Heritage and Development in West Bank Gaza" in Project Files)
In the context of cultural heritage, the West Bank and Gaza is remarkable. Over 1600 major archeological site are
located there. It is known world wide as the birthplace of the three great monotheistic religions and home to some of
the most powerful and evocative artifacts of their collective history, including the tomb of Abraham, the father of
the three religious families, in Hebron and the birthplace of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem. Both before and since the
pivotal historical event of the birth of Jesus Christ, important civilizations have shared and/or disputed these lands
that continue to be pivotal in human history.
The PA wishes to manage this cultural heritage as an intrinsic part of its development strategy; it is, however, a
complex undertaking. The range of requirements include: the technical tasks of archeological preservation,
scholarship and presentation; the economic policies, strategies and incentives necessary to ensure that appropriate
levels of benefits of this cultural wealth is realized to the people of WBG; the critical engagement of local
communities in understanding and decision making with regard to proper preservation and exploitation of their
cultural heritage; the political management necessary to satisfy potentially competing interests; the policy and
institutional framework within which this development agenda would be elaborated and function effectively; and,
capacity building programs to support all aspects of these requirements.
This component will support the establishment and development of a policy, institutional and financing framework
for the management of cultural heritage in the development agenda of WBG. Because of the importance of the
cultural heritage preservation task to national development, existing managerial structures will have to be
considerably enhanced and new structures may have to be developed. It is not possible to definitively specify these
actions or structures at this time. However, we expect DOA to be the core around which additional capacity would
be built. Furthermore, we expect that all central government departments currently undertaking cultural heritage
preservation functions will be brought under one umbrella. This enhanced structure would be managed by a highly
qualified Executive Director.
In order to assist MOTA and MOC to thoroughly examine the organizational and managerial options and to reach a
consensus on the appropriate framework, MOTA and MOC would establish a cultural heritage preservation
"Advisory Committee" whose terms of reference would be to propose an appropriate institutional structure. This
Committee would be chaired by a highly respected Palestinian with considerable knowledge of the cultural
preservation field, and would have representatives from key ministries (including the ministries of finance and local
government), agencies and the private sector. The findings and recommendations of the Committee would form the
basis for defining the future organizational structure of the sector. It is envisaged that this Committee would be
established by November 1, 1998, and would make its findings and recommendations on a new cultural heritage
preservation organization (NCHPO) to MOTA and MOC before July 1, 1999. These finding and recommendations
would thereafter be transmitted to the PNA for consideration. Until such time as new or enhanced structures are
decided upon, MOTA and MOC would closely coordinate their activities in this field.
A critical aspect of the strategy for cultural heritage management is the involvement of local communities. The
CHA will establish with municipalities and community groups, Municipal Cultural Heritage Program Boards
(MCHPB) which will participate in the decision making on, and oversee local programs. A system of incentives and
a financing program geared to eventual self-sustainability will be developed to support the Cultural Heritage
Development Management strategy. A legal framework to enable all aspects of the CHDM also will be developed
with the assistance of UNESCO. At negotiations the PA presented to the Bank a policy letter confirming this
strategy (see Annex 5).
Bank support will be provided in three packages - a legal and institutional reform (LIR) package; a capacity
building (CB) package; and, a program development (PD) package.

Table I above reports the average rate of return for the B2000 project. The rate of return in the base case is quite high
at 22.8 percent. This reflects the large benefits from the project, however, it also suggests that a couple of outliers
might distort the results slightly. Particularly, the high rates of return for the Beit Sahor Main St. and the 16" water
pipelines have a large impact on the average rate of return. Since it is possible that the benefits for these three projects
have been slightly overestimated (given the quality of the data) the overall rate of return might also have been
overestimated. It is therefore useful to look at the worst case scenario. Even here, where we assume the worst case
outcome for all projects, the average economic rate of retum at 17.1 percent is above the threshold rate of return of
14%. It should be noted that this rate is above the opportunity cost of capital (10-11%) but is thought appropriate
given the risks and the data uncertainties.
Main Assumptions:
The following are the main assumptions underlying the economic model used to estimate the value added from
increased visitor spending.
Table 2. Expected Spending per Visitor, 1998-2010
(Constant 1998 prices)
US$               Average spendfor day visitors         Average spendfor overnight visitors (3 nights)

1998            10            10             10           180           180            180
1999            15            12             10           195           195            180
2000            25            22             10           240           240            180
+2001           20            20             10           210           210            180
The unit spending per visitor has been conservatively estimated as shown in Table 2 with the data in constant 1998
prices. The increase in unit spending primarily reflects a better and more interesting tourist product.

To derive at an estimate of the value added for the Palestinian economy from visitor spending the assumptions shown
in Table 3 have been applied. This assumes, for example, that 35 percent of spending on food and accommodation will
benefit the Palestinian economy. The relatively low estimates for value added reflect the large "leakage" of benefits
from tourism going to the Israeli economy. Again quite conservative estimates have been applied in the analysis given
the quality of the data available.

Subject:     Letter of Sector Policy, Cultural Heritage Preservation and Development in West Bank Gaza'
Introduction
The Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (MOTA) and the Ministry of Culture (MOC) of the Palestine National
Authority (PNA) would like to inform you of the policy and institutional arrangements through which it intends to
guide and strengthen the preservation and management of cultural heritage in the development plans of Palestine. In
order that you may fully appreciate the policy and institutional framework we envisage, we would like to begin by
setting out the background, philosophy, structures and programs that have informed our decisions.
Background
In the context of cultural heritage, the West Bank and Gaza is a treasure trove. Over 1600 major archeological site are
located here. It is the birthplace of the three great monotheistic religions and home to some of the most powerful and
evocative artifacts of their collective history, including the tomb of Abrahamn, the father of the three religious families,
in Hebron and the birthplace of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem. Both before and since the pivotal historical event of the
birth of Jesus Christ, important civilizations have shared and/or disputed these lands that continue to be pivotal in
human history.
An important consequence for the development of WBG is that this rich history, its archeological evidence and current
manifestations continue to have meaning to millions of diverse people around the world. By preserving this evidence
and appropriately managing its use and access to it, we Palestinians can simultaneously make substantial contributions
to our economy, identity and to the larger world.
Nevertheless, managing our cultural heritage as an intrinsic part of our development strategy is a complex
undertaking. The range of requirements include: the technical tasks of archeological preservation, scholarship and
presentation; the economic policies, strategies and incentives necessary to ensure that appropriate levels of benefits of
this cultural wealth is realized to the people of WBG; the critical engagement of local communities in understanding
and decision making with regard to proper preservation and exploitation of their cultural heritage; the political
management necessary to satisfy potentially competing interests; the policy and institutional framework within which
this development agenda would be elaborated and function effectively; and, capacity building programs to support all
aspects of these requirements.
There is urgency to develop the necessary institutional and policy framework and build crucial capacities. Important
aspects of this heritage are threatened by urban expansion, by re-development of old areas of ancient cities and by the
decay and deterioration of long neglected structures. However, the greatest urgency lies in the opportunity costs of
delay. The WBG economy has been buffeted by the political conflicts and violence that has been associated with the
slowdown of the peace process, and despair and frustration has been replacing the hope that accompanied the Oslo
agreements. Effective management of cultural heritage in the development agenda of WBG offers real possibilities for
interdependence in the sector and even a shared tourism strategy between the neighboring countries.
The aspect of cultural heritage referred to in this letter relates to the physical dimension only, specifically:
Archeological Sites and Artifacts, Historic Buildings; Ethnographic Architecture, and Cultural Landscapes

Country: West Bank and Gaza                                                Bethlehem 2000 Project (B2000)
We recognize these complex requirements and have therefore sought the assistance of the wider world community in
these tasks. As we will elaborate later, we already have programs supported by a number of donors, including the
World Bank. Under the Bethlehem 2000 project, we intend to utilize further UNESCO and World Bank assistance in
designing a strategy and institutional framework for the management of this important development agenda.
Existing Programs in Cultural Heritage in WBG
Despite the difficult circumstances of the last three decades, considerable work has been done in the past two years by
the PNA and in particular by MOTA & MOC to set the stage for effective management of cultural heritage. Draft
legislation has been prepared and planning for the technical and to some extent, community aspects of the
management requirements has begun in conjunction with the MOC. UNESCO, which has been involved in a multi-
year Program of Assistance to the Palestinian People, has been requested to comment on the draft legislation. The
World Bank has been supporting work on the managerial and technical requirements.
In addition to the work on the institutional issues, the Department of Antiquities (DOA) within MOTA has undertaken
a number of excavation and restoration projects with the assistance of various donors including, Italy, the Netherlands,
Japan and UNESCO. Restoration of sites within Bethlehem is among the projects underway. Moreover the
Directorate of Cultural Heritage (DCH) at MOC have developed an active program of cooperation with international
institutions working in cultural heritage including (UNESCO, ICOM, ICOMOS, ICCROM). Parallel cooperation has
been developed with governmental bodies in the Mediterranean region through a number of projects under the Euro-
Mediterranean cooperation program on cultural heritage supported by the EU. As a result, there is a proven base of
institutional as well as operational work on which to build.
Tbe Issues We Face
Despite this, there are many issues to be addressed in the context of the complex requirements outlined earlier. With
regard to the technical tasks of archeological preservation, scholarship and presentation, there are substantial
organizational deficits, which need to be remedied. Thus capacity building is an urgent requirement. However, the
level of effort needed will be extensive and will need to be prioritized in order to be manageable. Restoration and
rehabilitation projects need to be executed, documentation and scholarship with regard to the sites and artifacts within
WBG is to be carried out, museums and other media for presentation and education must be developed, and a variety
of staff must be trained. We propose to utilize approaches that, to the extent possible, accomplish multiple objectives.
Economic policies, strategies and incentives necessary to ensure that appropriate levels of benefits of this cultural
wealth is realized to the Palestinian people must encompass several aspects of tourism and its linkages to the people in
their local communities. Incentives which provide linkages to direct benefits such as loans and grants to encourage
rehabilitation and reuse of historical buildings, for example, as bed and breakfast accommodations, must be coupled
with incentives at a community level that promote the collective benefits of items as diverse as preservation of public
spaces to discouraging the theft or sale of archeological artifacts. In addition, the management of cultural heritage
must yield adequate income to support the technical and professional work around which the program is organized.
We are pleased that the Bethlehem 2000 project will include specific elements to address these issues.
The engagement of local communities in understanding and decision making with regard to proper preservation and
exploitation of their cultural heritage is at the heart of the PNA strategy for the management of cultural heritage. This
emphasis is critical to overcoming the past alienation of the elements and manifestation of cultural heritage from the
Palestinian people. Archeology, for example, have been experienced by some Palestinians as a political weapon used
against them, while for others, the preservation of historical buildings has been an instrument of expropriation.
However, not only must the negative be overcome, the positive also needs to be recognized. A vibrant tourism
industry based on cultural heritage will promote the development of quality public services necessary to that market -
water and sanitation, health care, security and public safety, roads and traffic management, parks and recreation - as
well as provide incomes for other services such as schools and libraries. In addition, we intend to promote the
recognition that the Palestinian people share an extraordinarily rich heritage as a source of pride and nation building.
Finally, increasing direct contact between the Palestinian people and the rest of the world will help to clarify the status
of WBG and increase public support worldwide. It is also for these reasons that we have ensured that the Bethlehem
2000 project also supports mechanisms which will address this crucial set of issues.

necessary to tailor growth in tourism to absorptive capacity, if frustration and disappointment of both tourists and
residents are to be avoided. Exploitation must keep pace with, not outrun, preservation. Public education and support
and participation must be maintained at all times. Investments in public services must keep pace with demand.
We intend to continue to involve the international community in assisting us, for the transfer of knowledge and
experience they are able to provide in addition to as well as other resources. In particular, we expect to draw on the
rich and relevant experience of neighboring countries.
The Task Ahead
The policy and institutional framework within which the Palestinian development agenda with regard to cultural
heritage is to be elaborated and implemented must take into account all of the preceding considerations. As it is clear
that much of the program remains to be defined and will emerge over time, the framework must allow for this
dynamic and for learning and adjustment. The architecture of this framework must therefore be somewhat open even
while the fundamental principles outlined above are fixed. The proposed framework is outlined in detail below.
Every aspect of this program requires capacity building programs to support its requirements. In the same manner that
other aspects of the program will need to be prioritized and phased, so too must the capacity building program.
MOTA & MOC are pleased that some critical elements of this capacity building program have been identified and
been agreed with the World Bank to be supported under this project.
The Policy and Institutional Framework
The institutional framework consists the guiding development philosophy; the policy context; the legal and regulatory
framework - to be further developed with the support of UNESCO and the World Bank; and the organizational roles,
responsibilities and relationships.
Development Philosophy
The PNA recognizes both the extraordinary value of the cultural heritage of Palestine and the critical necessity to
involve the Palestinian community especially at the local level, in the preservation, rehabilitation, management and
exploitation of that rich resource. Several elements will be needed to achieve this latter objective of community
involvement. These include building the recognition among the community that this heritage is their resource and that
its appropriate use will provide a broad array of benefits to themselves as individuals and as a community. This, in
turn, requires a unique and critical role for our technical managers in the institutional framework; in addition to a
thorough understanding of the technical requirements for cultural archeological preservation, documentation and
presentation, they must anticipate the reservations and issues of the community with regard to the proper management
of cultural resources and develop proposals which respond to legitimate community concerns. They also must educate
the community with regard to appropriate rehabilitation and use of cultural resources including historical buildings
and public spaces, the programs to support such rehabilitation and use, and the role that the community may play
effectively in the management of cultural heritage. Finally, they must be effective in listening, and responding to the
communities so that these communities assume ownership of their local resources.
Policy Context
The PNA has outlined a number of policy objectives which follow from its development philosophy. These include:
*  protect, enhance and manage the cultural heritage of WBG to the benefit of the Palestinian people and to the
world at large;
*  provide appropriate mechanisms for implementing the policy including a regulatory framework, incentives and
technical guidelines and advice;
*  ensure coordination and effective management of policies, programs and activities across related sectors and
between levels of government;
*  develop Palestinian technical skills and capacity through research and study, training programs and coordination
of technical development in various institutions;

* ensure the provision of adequate resources to the overall program;
*  attract private investment in support of and/or complementary to cultural heritage programs;
*  ensure a partnership approach involving public and private sectors as well as community based organizations in
the protection, enhancement and management of cultural heritage; and
*  ensure community commitment to the program through public education and meaningful participation
The Legal and Regulatory Framework
A number of laws and regulations will be needed to guide and support programs for the appropriate management of
cultural heritage. These need to cover, inter alia, all aspects of preservation, restoration, documentation and display of
cultural artifacts; the planning and management of live heritage including urban historical areas; incentive packages;
financing and fiscal instruments; and, organizational roles and responsibilities.
As noted earlier, considerable work has been done on a draft law on Palestinian Antiquities that is now being reviewed
with the help of UNESCO. Priority will be given to a complementary package of legislation including local planning
and controls that provide incentives to ensure that the planning and management of live heritage including urban
historical areas operates in support of the cultural heritage development agenda. These incentives will apply to
individuals and groups who own or wish to invest in historical buildings and will encourage their appropriate
rehabilitation and reuse. Incentive will be designed as well as to encourage the support of communities who would
indirectly benefit from rehabilitation and appropriate use of public or common spaces.
We intend to use financing and fiscal instruments to support organizational roles and responsibilities and plan that the
legal and regulatory framework will ensure this support. We propose to carry out the necessary studies in order to
dimension financial and fiscal requirements; these will be done while the strategy for the elaboration and
implementation of the various organizational structures is being developed. Nevertheless, it is clear that a share of
tourism revenues need to be available to local governments in order to recover the costs of local public services
provided to their benefit. In addition, several public organizational entities (discussed below) will provide the
ingredients for this program. Some of those that interact directly with tourists will be able to charge fees for services,
goods or access. A financing system will be devised which will eventually be able to support the entire network of
institutions. We are aware that such mechanisms are used by our neighbors in the region (e. g. Tunisia) however, we
must establish an enabling framework for the appropriate solutions. For this reason we are pleased that the World
Bank will support studies to establish a fiscal and financial system to sustain this program over the long run.
Organizational Roles, Responsibilities and Relationships
A substantial amount of work has been done on various aspects of organizational requirements for managing cultural
heritage in Palestine. However, much of that work has focused on detailing the structure of particular individual
organizations within the existing framework. As our understanding of the issues and opportunities have grown we
have found it necessary to revise the old framework. We therefore will focus first on defining and assigning overall
roles, responsibilities and relationships in the new framework and tackle the elaboration of individual structure over
the next several months as the cultural heritage program develops.
The critical roles we have defned and assigned are: overall policy guidance; overall management of the cultural
heritage program; management of specific, critical aspects of the programs; community level program management;
project management; and, entities management. (In this regard, the DOA is currently the main vehicle.)
Policy Guidance: Considerable efforts are required to build the capacity to effectively manage and develop Palestine's
cultural heritage, and to harness this considerable heritage for the task of national development. MOTA and MOC are
working together to defne the most appropriate distribution of roles and responsibilities and the structure best suited
to fulfill this important mandate. Nevertheless, we envisage that an appropriate institutional structure concerning
cultural heritage preservation would be established to help provide policy guidance for the sector; and that key sector
ministries, agencies, organizations and the private sector would be represented in that structure.
Program Management: Because of the importance of the cultural heritage preservation task to national development,
we envisage that existing managerial structures will have to be considerably enhanced and new structures may have to
be developed. It is not possible to definitively specify these actions or structures at this time. In any event, however,
we expect DOA to be the core around which additional capacity would be built. Furthermore, we expect that all

central government departments currently undertaking cultural heritage preservation functions will be brought under
one umbrella. This enhanced structure would be managed by a highly qualified Executive Director.
In order to assist MOTA and MOC to thoroughly examine the organizational and managerial options and to reach a
consensus on the appropriate framework, MOTA and MOC would establish a cultural heritage preservation "Advisory
Committee" whose terms of reference would be to propose the envisaged institutional structure concerning cultural
heritage preservation. This Committee would be chaired by a highly respected Palestinian with considerable
knowledge of the cultural preservation field, and would have representatives from key ministries (including the
ministries of finance and local government), agencies and the private sector. The findings and recommendations of
the Committee would form the basis for defining the future organizational structure of the sector. It is envisaged that
this Committee would be established by November 1, 1998, and would make its findings and recommendations to
MOTA and MOC before July 1, 1999. These finding and recommendations would thereafter be transmitted to the
PNA for consideration. It is also envisaged that the Bank would be periodically informed on the progress of the
Committee's deliberations, that its findings and recommendations would be shared with the Bank. Until such time as
new or enhanced structures are decided upon, MOTA and MOC would closely coordinate their activities in this field.
We appreciate the technical assistance that the Bank is providing under this project to support the work of this
Committee.
It is currently envisaged that any new or enhanced cultural heritage organization (NCHPO) would be responsible for:
1. developing and recommending policy for the preservation and restoration of historic monuments (including all
enviromnental aspects)
2. developing and recommending policy for urban conservation and rehabilitation of historic centers
3. implementing policy on protection of all antiquities and control over all excavations/exploration activities in
archeological sites by establishing an effective system for the protection and preservation of cultural heritage
4. developing and recommending a national museum policy for the creation, protection and management of national
and local museums;
5. establish a national archives for cultural heritage resources
6. prepare a management and maintenance plan for Palestinian cultural resources
7. design, recommend and ultimately implement a financial mechanism to support agencies and individuals involved
in the protection of cultural heritage including incentives for users and residents of historic buildings
8. coordination and consultation with relevant authorities at the international, national and local levels
9. organizing programs and projects to:
*  restore and  rehabilitate historic monuments, buildings and sites and improve their presentation and the
surrounding environment according to international standards and conventions;
*  enhance and improve the physical condition of historic towns;
*  establish local/satellite conservation/rehabilitation units to all historic centers to ensure the implementation of
these programs through WBG;
*  monitor and update where required implementation of the preservation policy in all historic sites according to
characteristics of each locality and the changing conditions;
*  improve the accessibility of cultural heritage sites and property for both the Palestinian public and their visitors;
*  use these cultural assets for education and awareness of the Palestinian public of their heritage and history and to
educate visitors and tourist about the rich history of Palestine;
*  make available in a manner consistent with preservation policy, Palestinian cultural assets to attract local and
international tourism and encourage investment;
*  initiate programs and processes for strengthening the capacity of national and local authorities and institutions for
planning and implementing conservation and rehabilitation policies.
Organizational Options: We envisage several options with regard to how the organization could be structured below
the level of the Executive Director for the management of specific, critical aspects of the programs. Among these are
suggestions that semi-autonomous Institutes be established for each major program area. These suggestions have merit
in that they have been modeled on other successful approaches such as the Smithsonian in Washington, D. C.
However, a detailed strategy based on priorities, work program and financing would need to be developed before
implementation. We are pleased that the development of such a strategy is to be supported under the project.

Community Involvement:
As we have emphasize throughout this letter, we consider the community level program management as a crucial
element of a successful strategy for managing cultural heritage in the development agenda of WBG. It is vital that the
organization at that level should represent a partnership between the proposed enhanced on new structure2 , concerned
municipality and the affected community. That partnership also will be represented by a Board for each municipality
(the Municipality Cultural Heritage Program Board - MCHPB). The role of the NCHPO on the MCHPB is to provide
it with technical guidance and bring to it technical expertise as indicated in the development philosophy outlined
earlier and incentives including financing. Community members will constitute the majority of Board members. The
MCHPB in consultation with NCHPO would be responsible for reviewing and approving the programs and projects of
cultural heritage management within their communities especially with regard to the priorities and modalities of
implementation. In addition the MCHPB in consultation with NCHPO would oversee the implementation of these
programs and projects. Because of the technical nature of the work involved, project management will be the
responsibility of a professional body approved by the MCHPB. In cases where specific projects will be financed by
donors, especially in the early years of the program, the procurement rules would need to reflect their requirements.
Finally, we hope that individual museums, sites, bookstores, authorized replica stores, etc. may be efficiently managed
by local entities management, as this would strengthen community benefits and commitment to the cultural heritage
program. Any such arrangement would have to be approved by the MCHPB in consultation with NCHPO, however,
because of the responsibilities involved and to ensure adequate capacity and performance, the NCHPO will have veto
powers over the appointment of any such group, and may require their removal at any time on the basis of
unsatisfactory performance.
The Priority Program
The PNA will continue implementing the archeological and rehabilitation projects already agreed with donors as well
as undertaking those planned under the Bethlehem 2000 project. However, priority will now be given to elaborating
and implementing the policy and institutional framework set out in this letter. The elements required to do so include:
1. an organizational development and management plan and program for the NCHPO
2. the development and implementation of capacity building programs for the NCHPO and its program management
entities, as they are introduced
3. critical training for individuals and groups within and outside of the NCHPO framework
4. development of appropriate incentive programs for individuals and communities to collaborate and participate in
the cultural heritage program within the policy framework established
5. establishment and management of MCHPBs beginning with the Bethlehem municipalities
6. fiscal and financial mechanisms to support the operations of the entire cultural heritage management system.
We believe that it is crucial to leanm from and collaborate with neighboring countries in preserving and managing
cultural heritage. As a result we propose that the World Bank and UNESCO convene a policy seminar for regional
policy makers dealing with cultural heritage and development to exchange information and experiences, discuss the
issues involved and explore potential collaboration among us.

We will continue to develop the cultural heritage program development under the strategy we have outlined in this
letter. Our immediate priority will be to initiate the programs of rehabilitation and development of cultural heritage
sites in Hebron and Jericho and to prepare a program for the promotion of cultural heritage in Palestine for which we
have agreed World Bank and UNESCO assistance.
As we pursue these and other items in our strategy and program we hope we will be able to count on the continuing
support of the World Bank.

Major Project Components: The Project would assist Palestinian authorities in the planning, organization and
staging of the Bethlehem 2000 celebrations which will attract worldwide attention and participation. The main
objectives of the Project are to: (a) strengthen the local economic base and foster sustainable development of the
Bethlehem region through well planned tourism development; (b) strengthen the planning, financial and
managerial base of Bethlehem and adjoining municipalities through a program of investment, reform and capacity
building; and (c) foster the conservation of cultural heritage through a process of policy, institutional reform and
capacity building. The main physical investment components of the Project include: (a) rehabilitation of water
services; (b) rehabilitation of roads; and (c) preservation of cultural heritage by physical rehabilitation and adaptive
reuse of structures. All activities would be undertaken in the Bethlehem region of the West Bank which includes
Bethlehem, Beit Sahour, Beit Jala and Doha.
Major Environmental Issues (identified or suspected in project): The Project has been placed in environmental
screening category "B" consistent with the provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental
Assessment" due to emphasis on rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and the restricted scope of potential
environmental impacts. The primary potential impacts associated with the Project are construction and operational
phase issues related to rehabilitation and upgrading of small scale water and road infrastructure and localized
disturbance associated with the restoration of selected cultural heritage sites. Implementation of the Project would
result in significant improvement in the management of water and wastewater services in the Bethlehem region.
Rehabilitation of the road network would improve surface drainage, thus reducing flooding in municipalities and
soil erosion. In addition, resulting efficiencies in travel patterns would decrease the incidence of serious
congestion; reduce local traffic related air and noise pollution; and improve road safety for motorists and
pedestrians. Project activities for the preservation of cultural heritage would reduce risks to sites of international
significance. Project funded activities would be undertaken with the advice of UNESCO and would be conducted
in close cooperation with stakeholders to ensure satisfactory outcomes at the local level. A review conducted by
cooperating Palestinian organizations and the World Bank has not identified any currently proposed subprojects
that would require involuntary resettlement on a permanent and/or temporary basis. However, this issue will be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis through the subproject screening process.
Other Environmental Issues (of lesser scope associated with project): Some activities under the Project will
cause local disruption from dust and noise during the construction phase associated with trenching operations for
upgrading of water supply, excavations required for road rehabilitation, and activities associated with conservation
of cultural heritage sites. Project supported subprojects will increase local demand for building materials and their
transport to construction sites. Excavation activities for subprojects may result in the chance find of buried
materials of archaeological significance.

Proposed Actions (to mitigate environmental issues described above): In order to address potential impacts and
support capacity building, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared in cooperation with the
Palestinian Environmental Authority, Department of Archaeology of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, and
Ministry of Culture. The EMP includes: (a) conduct of site-specific environmental screening for Project supported
subprojects and activities for rehabilitation of water supply, rehabilitation of roads and preservation of cultural
heritage sites; (b) establishment of an Environmental Unit within the implementing agency; (c) environmental
training of staff of the Bethlehem 2000 Authority and other Palestinian organizations involved in Project
implementation; and (d) monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of mitigation measures identified in the
site-specific reviews. The EMP includes provisions for the use of archaeological "chance find" procedures in case
unknown archaeological sites are encountered during excavations and construction activities supported by the
Project. In addition, the environmental screening documents will be submitted for review and clearance by the
Palestinian Environmental Authority, Department of Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities,
Ministry of Culture, and World Bank. This procedure for environmental review of subprojects adopted under the
EMP would be extended by the Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority to activities supported by other international
and bilateral organizations.
Justification/Rationale for Environmental Category (presents reasons for environmental category selected and
explanation of any changes from initial classification, including whether any changes relate to alternatives): The
activities to be supported under the Project comprise: (a) small and medium subprojects for the rehabilitation,
upgrading, extension and maintenance of water services and roads; and (b) site specific measures for preservation
of selected cultural heritage sites. In both cases, potential environmental impacts can be anticipated and effective
measures taken to address these concerns in subproject design; supervision can be adopted on a subproject basis.
Reporting Schedule: An Environmental Management Plan has been prepared, reviewed and approved by
Palestinian authorities. The EMP is available at several locations in the Bethlehem region and is provided in the
Project File.
Remarks (give status of any other environmental studies, lists local groups and local NGOs consulted and where
Category A environmental assessments were made public locally, tells whether Borrower has given permission to
release EA, etc.): Implementation of the Project would be done in cooperation with the Palestinian Environmental
Authority, Department of Archaeology of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the Ministry of Culture. In
addition, advisory support for the cultural heritage activities will be provided by UNESCO. The project
preparation process has included extensive work with mayors and other representatives of the municipalities of
Bethlehem, Beit Sahour, Beit Jala and Doha. Consultations were also held with the main religious organizations
concerned with the celebrations including the Middle East Council (MEC) and Jerusalem Interchurch Committee
for the Jubilee. Consultations were also held with many community groups including Bethlehem University, Arab
Orthodox Club, Alternative Tourism Group and Catholic Relief Services. The Borrower has given permission to
release the EMP and has made it available to the public in the West Bank.

Annex 7
Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority Program
Note on Preliminary Cashflow Budget
The estimated B2000 Program Budget is summarized in the attached tables. Two revenue scenarios have so far been
examined. The total revenue is the same in both scenarios but the timing of the inflows differ. The Optimistic
Scenario assumes relatively early inflows of ticket sales and sponsorship; licenses royalties and rights; and non-
infrastructure related fund raising monies. The Pessinistic Scenario assumes that these inflows will mostly come in
2000 - 2001. But for this difference, the revenue scenarios are the same. There is only one expenditure scenario. The
program as a whole, aims to at least break-even. Other important assumptions are:
1. Infrastructure and Cultural Heritage works expenditures will be fully offset by Donor contributions;
2. Events costs will be fully offset by ticket sales and sponsorship revenues;
3. Other shortfalls will be offset by fundraising efforts;
4. Interest rate on Bank borrowing is 10%;
5. Interest charge in 1998 is based on 4 months only;
6. A minimum desired cash balance of US$1.0m.
In general, non-infrastructure related fund raising is assumed to be the balancing item.
Given the above assumptions, a number of conclusions can be drawn (see Table l(d)):
1. Even in the Optimistic Scenario there would be a net program deficit of about $lm. In the case of the Pessimistic
Scenario the net program deficit would be of the order of $5.5m. These deficits arise because of the need for
short-term Bank borrowing, even in 1998, and the consequent interest charges.
2. The estimated borrowing requirements and net surplus (deficit) would be as follows:
1998         1999         2000        2001      Net Surplus
(Deficit)
Optimistic Scenario        US$11.2m    US$25.2m    US$1 1.5m          -        (US$1.1m)
Pessimistic Scenario       US$11.2m    US$43.9m    US$42.0m           -        (US$5.5m)
3. To break-even on the program as a whole, the non-works fund raising effort would have to be increased from the
current estimate of US$15m to US$18-25m. Alternatively, inflows would have to be accelerated or expenditure
on consultancies, supporting activities, projects and services reduced.
Background Note
Several Donors are assisting Bethlehem prepare for the Millennium Celebrations including, inter alia, Austria,
Belgium, Sweden, Greece, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Finland, Japan, France, The Vatican, Knights of Malta,
UNDP, EIB, USAID, UNESCO and the Bank.
Infrastructure: Some US$14m has already been committed to on-going infrastructure projects and US$44m has been
pledged, excluding proposed Bank funding under B2000 (US$15m). Another US$40m is being sought by the B2000
Project Authority for essential infrastructure rehabilitation. It is not clear whether this additional funding can be
secured from donors, but it is expected that the most critical components will be covered. In this event, the issue will
be implementation capacity and not fnance.
Offlce Operating Costs: This will be partly covered by Bank support under MIDP (US$0.38m) and B2000
(US$1.4m). Other donors have so far provided about US$ 0.3m. It is expected that the PA will fund the balance of
about US$2.6m.

Consultancies: These cover marketing, PR, events, legal, accounting, etc. Here about US$12m is required and only
about US$5.8m is pledged, mostly by the Bank (US$4.8m). Thus about US$6m needs be to raised by the Project
Authority.
Supporting Services: These include police and emergency services. Here about US$6.6m is required and only about
US$1.8m has been pledged by donors. The PA is expected to provide about US$2.4m, leaving about another
US$2.4m to be raised by the B2000 Project Authority.
Events: This is budgeted at US$53.5m and expected to be self-financing. However, there will be significant up-front
costs which will have to be covered by borrowing from commercial sources.
PA Contribution: This is planned at US$5.0m, including US$ I.Om from the Area Municipalities.
Summary: There is a significant financing gap of the order of US$27m, excluding financing charges (probably
another US$2-5m). This includes about US$1 8.6m in contingencies (provided for at 10% of base costs). This points
to the need, on the one hand, for urgent fund raising efforts by the B2000 Project Authority and, on the other, for
careful financial planning and management.
The above issues were discussed with the B2000 Project Authority at Negotiations and the overall program financing
strategy agreed.

Annex 8
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
The Credit would finance selected activities requiring the procurement of: (a) works, i.e. the construction or
rehabilitation of road, water and cultural heritage sites; (b) goods, including computers, telecommunications, office
equipment, vehicles and maintenance equipment for subprojects; (c) consultancy services for studies, training,
institutional reforms and cultural heritage subprojects; and (d) incremental operating expenses for the B2000 Project
Authority, MLG Capacity Building Unit, and MOTA and MOC. Procurement under the Credit would be carried out
in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for "Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits". January 1995, revised
January and August 1996 and September 1997 and for "Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers". January 1997 and revised September 1997. IDA's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) would be used
for all procurement under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and, with modifications acceptable to IDA, in
Arabic language, also for National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Simplified documents would be prepared for use
under the Credit and apply to National and International Shopping (NS/IS), relatively low-value works contracts and
low-value consulting contracts. Credit components not financed by IDA would be procured in accordance with PA
regulations or the guidelines of cofinancing institutions. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) would be advertised in
"United Nations Development Business" (UNDB) not less than eight weeks prior to the publication of the first
Specific Procurement Notice (SPN) and bidders who have expressed an interest would be notified directly by
Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority and/or MLG.
Works: Taking into account the nature of construction, state of subproject preparation and the goal of fostering the
development of the emerging local construction industry, several bid packages would be prepared according to the list
of subprojects shown in Annex 3. Bid packages with an estimated contract value above US$3 million equivalent
would be procured using ICB procedures and documents and advertisements in UNDB and in local newspapers.
(With the exception of those works requiring special construction expertise, contracts of less than US$3.Om are not
expected to attract International Bidders). Bidders would be subject to post-qualification in accordance with IDA's
SBD Procurement of Works, Smaller Contracts - January 1995. Bid evaluations would be submitted on IDA's
Standard Bid Eva[luation Form: "Procurement of Goods and Works" - April 1996. Bid packages with an estimated
contract value above US$100,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of approximately US$8.5 million equivalent,
would be procured using NCB procedures and documents and advertisements in at least two local newspapers.
Contracts below an estimated value of US$50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$1 million equivalent,
would be procured using (i) advertisements in a local newspaper and announcements posted in a public place, (ii)
simplified bidding documents and evaluation procedures agreed with IDA, (iii) public bid openings, (iv) and contract
awards to the lowest evaluated bidder. Prequalification would be necessary for all contracts procured under ICB and
all contracts above US$ 1.0 million equivalent procured under NCB procedures. For contracts below US$ 1.0 million
equivalent it would be discretionary. An open prequalification process and explicit qualification criteria would be
used. Subject to prior agreement with IDA in each case and practical considerations, works below an estimated value
of US$50,000 may occasionally be implemented, instead, by using direct contracting with the nearest available source
or force account construction through PA personnel and equipment.
Goods: To the maximum possible extent, the procurement of goods would be carried out through bid packages
comprising several lots of similar items. Bid packages with an estimated contract value above US$500,000 equivalent
would be procured using ICB procedures and documents, and advertisements in UNDB and in local newspapers.
Bidders would be subject to post-qualification in accordance with IDA's SBD for "Procurement of Goods" January
1995. Bid evaluations would be submitted on IDA's Standard Bid Evaluation Form "Procurement of Goods and
Works" - April 1996. Bid packages with an estimated contract value above US$50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate
of approximately US$300,000 equivalent, would be procured using NCB procedures and documents and
advertisements in at least two local newspapers. The procurement of goods and supplies below an estimated value of
US$50,000 per contract or purchase order, up to an aggregate amount of approximately of $200,000 equivalent, would
follow NS/IS procedures, using requests for quotations which would indicate the description, quantity and required
delivery time of the procured goods. At least three quotations would be solicited from local suppliers, when these
goods are readily available locally at competitive prices; otherwise, quotations would be solicited from at least three
international suppliers in two different countries. The evaluation of quotations would follow procedures agreed with
IDA. Incidental goods and supplies below a cost of US$5,000 per purchase, up to an aggregate amount of

approximately US$100,000 equivalent would be purchased directly from the nearest available source or, if available,
through the PA Government Supply Catalogue maintained by MOF. Under ICB procedures, bids offering goods
manufactured in West Bank/Gaza would be granted a margin of preference of 15% when compared to goods
manufactured elsewhere. In the comparison of bids to establish eligibility for Domestic Preference, the provisions of
Appendix 2 of IDA's Procurement Guidelines would be followed.
Services: For consultancies above an estimated contract value of US$100,000 equivalent, the selection method would
be Quality and Cost-Based (QCBS). For consultancies above an estimated contract value of US$50,000 equivalent,
the selection method would be Quality-Based (QBS) or Least-Cost Selection (LCS). Consultants' Qualification-Based
(CQ) and Single-Source Selection (SS) methods would be used for all specialized, short-term or low-cost contracts
with consultants. Furthermore, all consultancies with an estimated contract value above US$200,000 would be
advertised in UNDB and in local newspapers.
Incremental Operating Expenses: These project related expenses would include salaries, office rent, utilities,
vehicle operating costs, stationery, consumables, printing, translation services, publications, communication services
and travel expenses. Repair and replacement costs for office equipment and vehicles would also be covered.
Prior Review: The first two contracts in each category (works, goods and services), irrespective of the estimated
contract value, would be subject to IDA's prior review, in accordance with the applicable guidelines. Thereafter, all
procurement of works and goods, which is subject to ICB procedures, would be subject to IDA's prior review. Also,
any contract for works with an estimated contract value above US$100,000 equivalent and any contract for goods with
an estimated contract value above US$100,000 equivalent would be subject to IDA's prior review. Contracts with
individual consultants in excess of US$50,000 equivalent and with consulting frms in excess of US$100,000
equivalent, as well as all single-source contracts, would be subject to prior review. The prior review process would
cover about 60% of total works goods and services contracts, which would be reasonably achievable under the
circumstances. All other contracts would be subject to post-review on a random basis during supervision missions and
procurement audits.
Procurement Responsibilities: The B2000 Project Authority would be responsible for all procurement activities
related to Components "I" (Celebration Support), "2" (Infrastructure and Cultural rehabilitation Works) and "4 (b)"
(Environmental Training and Monitoring) of the Project. MLG's Capacity Building Unit (CBU) would be responsible
for all procurement activities related to Components "3 (a)" (Capacity Building Support) and "4 (a)" (Programming,
Accounting Services, Emergency Services, etc.) of the Project. MOTA and MOC would be responsible for
component "3 (b)." The initial Procurement Plan is shown in Table D. It would be updated periodically and jointly by
B2000 Project Authority, CBU and MOTA/MOC, which would also jointly prepare the standard bidding documents to
be used for all subprojects. Each unit would retain responsibilities for advertising bids, issuing bidding documents,
opening and evaluating bids and awarding contracts with regard to its assigned components. The procurement skills
of B2000 Project Authority, CBU and MOTA staff would be upgraded through a training program.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
The project funds are expected to be disbursed over a period of three years beginning November 1998 and end
December 31, 2001. The closing date for the credit would be June 30, 2002. It is estimated that Bethlehem 2000
Project Authority would be able to disburse at average of US$1.0 million per month during the first year of the
project. All IDA funded disbursements towards civil works are expected to be completed within two years from day
of project effectiveness. To facilitate disbursement against eligible expenditures, Bethlehem 2000 Project Authority,
MLG and MOTA/MOC would each establish a Special Account under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. An
initial deposit of the US$3.00m will be made into B2000 Project Authority Special Account and $0.2m into the MLG
Special Account, and US$0.lm into the MOTA/MOC Special Account all from the IDA credit Bethlehem 2000
Project Authority, MLG and MOTA/MOC would submit replenishment applications for their respective Special
Accounts on a monthly basis.
