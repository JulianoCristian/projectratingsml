Power Project\n            will consist of a thermal power station with four 330-MW\n            lignite-fired units delivering 7,920 GWh p.a. to the\n            interconnected system at a plant factor of 74 percent. The\n            project will also include about 288 km of 400-kV\n            transmission lines connecting Turceni with the city of Cluj\n            to the north. The project will be a second stage extension\n            to the first four 330-MW thermal power station at Turceni,\n            which is now under construction in southwestern Romania. The\n            basic fuel to be used will be lignite. The project will\n            consume about 11 million tons of lignite p.a. at full\n            operation starting in 1984-85, and will require the opening\n            of new mines. Lignite production from existing known\n            deposits will be capable of supplying this estimated\n            consumption. Thus basic fuel supply is adequate and\n            satisfactory arrangements to open the required new open cast\n            and underground mines have been made. In addition to\n            lignite, the Turceni station will also burn fuel oil for\n            start-up and stabilization of lignite burning at partial\n            load. The Government will furnish every six months lignite\n            production data for the previous six-month period and\n            production estimates for the next six-month period\n            immediately following as was agreed for the first Turceni project."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
