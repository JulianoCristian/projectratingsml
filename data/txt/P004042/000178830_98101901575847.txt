1.        Although Korea Develo-ment Rinan.ce Corporation (KDFC) was incorporated
in April 1967, its financing was completed only in Februa:ry 1968, when the sub-
scri"ons of the forein. inrves+tr.S and IFC were pa-id4 An.  T  f-rst+ Bnk loa
and the loan from United States Agency for International Development also became
effective at thfe samte -time. VnLx  ap-proved its 4' rst lloans and invtestMen-t i
July 1968.
2.        The performance of the Korean economy has continued to be impressive.
Real GPlr rose 59 in 1967 and 13% in 1968 largely because of the very high rate
of growth in the industrial sector, where private enterprise is dominant.
J1anufacturing contributed about %)7o to GuNP in i9600.  Private sector investurnent
grew by 107% over the First Plan period 1962-66. It amounted to an estimated
Won 86 billion ($3i5 million equivalent) in 1968 showing an increase of 88%
over that in 1966.
3.        KDFC's management is competent and has a high reputation in govern-
ment, business and banking circles. Its staff is dedicated and capable. Office
procedures, including appraisal and follow-up, are thorough and meticulous.
4.        In its operations KDFC has made a sound start although,
justifiably, a slow one. Its operations are gathering momentum.
Up to Ilarch 31, 1969 KDFC had approved a total of $4.6 million equi-
valent in loans and investments, of which $2.5 million was in foreign exchange
and $2.1 million equivalent in domestic currency. The quality of KDFC's present
small portfolio appears sound.
>).       As of December 31, 1968, KDFC's assets consisted predominantly of
bank deposits. Loans and investments were a very small part of the total assets,
and the company had no long term debt except the subordinated Government loan.
rts income for the year, derived almost entirely from interest on deposits,
amounted to 23% of the year-end equity, but this nominally satisfactory return
1xas significantly reduced by continuing inflation at the rate of roughly 10%.
ner annum.  As of December 31, 1968, KDFC's shares had a book value equal to
-40% of par.
6.        KDFC in not exnected to face the nroblem of lack of business.   KDIC's
iomestic currency lending and investments may be limited by the difficulty c,f
replenishing won resohrces.  KnFG does not fnresee a similar difficulty in
reolenishing its foreign currency resources.
7.        K'FC's commitments of foreign currency loans up to the end of 1970
-r_ estimated at $21.0 mllion, and about 2t9 million Up to Julne 30, 1971. As
of January 1, 1L969, it had uncommitted foreign exchange resources amounting to
$9.5 million.  The need for additional foreign exchange resources is therefore
11.5 million to meet estimated commitments up to December 1970, and $19.5

8.        The Bank appears to be the main potential lender of foreign exchange to
Kl-FC in the next two years. A loan of  I90   million would be fully conwi tted bir
about the middle of 1971. The loan should be made on termis and conditions sUnilar

I.  DlRODuCTION
1.        This report examines the suitability of KDFC as a borrower for a second
Bank loan. The first loan of US$5 million was approved by the Executive Directors
oII January 30, 1968. The report concludes that IDFC is justified in seeking a
second Bank loan towards meeting its estimated requirements of foreign exchange
'Auring the next- two years and that it is a suitable institution for the Bank to
lend to. This conclusion, and the report, is based on the experience of a close
relationship between the Bank Group and KDFC, its sponsors and management since
inception of the company; and on the findings of a mission that visited Korea in
January-February 1969 to reappraise KDFC.
25.       Although KDFC was established as a legal entity in April 1967, its
financing was completed in February 1968, by prior agreement between the Bank
Group and KDFC, when the subscriptions of the foreign investors and IFC were
Raid in.  The Eank and AID loans also became effective at that time.   KDFC
approved its first loans and investment in July 1968.
II.  ENVIR0MENT
General Economic Setting
3.        A recent review of the economv of Korea is found in the renort dated
March 10, 1969 "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the Republic of
Korea." EAP-La.
Li.       The current Second Five-Year Plan was launched in 1967 and covers a
reriod up to and including 1971.   The plan envisaged a growth rate of 7% per
atrrnum. Mining and manufantniring was exr^eeted t.o 'h theh mro.t dvnv-nimrit
growing at an average rate of about 13% per annum. In 1961 manufacturing

this sector to GNP increased to about :22% in 1965;  the Second Five-Year Plan
envisages that by 1971 it will increase to 27%. One of th.e basic elements
of the strategy of development adopted at the beginning of the Second Plan was

e-timated 13% during 1968, in spite of droughts which adversely affected agri-
ct-Ue duri-g the per-od. Tihe increase was mrainly due to the very high grc-wth



-2-
pa .e of the industrial sector. Plining and manufacturing grew at the rate of
22.5% in 1967 and at an estirated 26.2% in 1968, accounting in that year for
aimost 25% of the GirP. 11(nufacturing also accounted for an increasing share in
Korea's exports which rose from an annual average of US$ 87 million in 1962-64
to US$ 320 million in 1967 and to about US$ 500 million in 1968. Yianufactured
goods accountecl for $ 215 million or 67% of Korea's total exports in 1967, and
according to provisional estimates represented an even higher proportion in 1968.
6.        As part of its development strategy, the Government has placed great
reliance on the private sector to increase its investments in the mining and
manufacturing sector, and has provided various encouragements and incentives.
Investment in the private industrial sector during the First Plan period (1962-6')
increased by about 107% (compared with an increase of about 65% in the public-
sector investment), and amounted to about W 48 billion in 1966. During 1967
investment in the private sector increased further to about W 79 billion and,
according to provisional figures, amounted to W 86 billion (US$ 315 million equi-
valent) in 1968. This trend is expected to continue during the remaining period
of the Second fPlan and beyond.
7.        The private sector is nredominant in the manufacturing field though the
Government has some industrial investments in such heavy industries as petro-
chemicals. fert-iltzer and engineering, Thring t.he last. few vyars; producer-gaoods
industries have expanded more rapidly than consumer-goods. industries, although
the latter are still dominant.   The textile industry 1 (cotton, Synt+het-c  rawy
silk, clothing, footwear) contributed about 30% of the manufacturing sector's
gross value added inv 1097 and cont,-r.ue  to be the largrest+ i,,dustc.-r.  A featunre
of the manufacturing sector is the increasing average size of industrial en1;er-
risesQoc*. The sShare of larg=-scale                  1 t  - .s   (those fa.  t total  ab.or force
of 200 or more) increased from one-third of gross value added in 1960 to more
than one=half in 1966.    The share of small-scale enterprises (less than 50
employees), on the other hand, decreased from 47% of gross value added to 271
during the same period;   though the number of such enterprises was still ri.sng.
The share of medium-scale enterprises has remained more or less unchanged.
O .       The extraordinary growth in the manufacturing sector has been rade
iossibLe by the qualities of Korean entrepreneursh`n and labor, as we"l as hieavy
capital investment.   Industries such as electronics and textiles, which are
labor J ienslve, have deruonsrated a nigh degree of international compeiU'l±verneu..
i'roduction costs are relatively high in the case of those capital-intensive
irdustries where the size of individual units is limited by the relative small-
ness of the market.   (.Machinery and petrochemical industries are examples.)
Tariff protection to industries has been accorded on a selective and rational
basis: the higher the real value-added of the industry concerned, the higher ir
,e tariff set because such industry contributes more to the domestic economy
,;han an industry with a low real value-added.
Effective October 1, 1968, the negative interest rate structure, undej
:;,iich banks had been paying higher rates on deposits than they received on loar2.
as modified by the Government.   The maximum deposit rate, now 25.2%,matches the
,,te for commercial bank lending.   The Government-owned   long-term lending



-3 -
institution, the Korean Reconstruction 3ank (paragraph 11), also revised its
lending rates at the same time. It now charges 20% and 23X for capital equip-
ment loans and working capital loans respectively. It continues to charge
concessional rates, however, for industries such as utilities, coal mining,
iron and steel and shipbuilding.
10.       The rise in the level of prices slowed somewhat in 1967 and 1968.
The wholesale price index and the Seoul consumer price index increased by
6% and 10% respectively in each of the years 1967 and 1968, as compared with
9% and 12% respectively in 1966.
Industrial Financing Institutions in Korea
11.            The financial institutions providing medium- and long-term industrial
fiin2nning in Korea, other tharn KnFG, are the K'oren PRecontiCti n RTnk (KXR)
and the Medium Industry Bank (MIB), bothl Government-owned and managed. KRB is
by far the biggest institution, both in ter.  of siz  of resources and vo_l-me
of operations.  It was established in 1954 and initially concentrated its
operatior.s 0or. reha1b4ilitat-ion ofP- aCili-1 -eS dam.aged du-rng tShe lor-ar war.  Since
its inception KRB has followed a policy of supplying only such funds as other
banking institutions find difficult or impossible to extend.  The Government has
used KRB for implementing a variety of programs. For instance, KRB has served
as a veicle for ,makir,g loarns for Goverunment -iLi ,aJe. inu Iutuurial pjec-L - L
has also been a principal source of housing construction loans. During 1967,
KRn[s total investrents amounted to iT 13.6 obiiion (about $66 million) in respect
of 234 projects. Fresh resources made available to KRB during that year amounted
to W 20.7 billion (about $74 miilion). According to KRB:s operational progrEaII
for 1969, yet to be approved by the Government, total investments in 1969 are
expected to be W 35.3 billion ($ 126 mi:Llion). Mining and manufacturing sector
i- estimated to account for about 34% of the total. In the manufacturing field,
a.R3, under Government directives, will give priority to steel, heavy machinery,
f'eel and petro-chemical industries.
1?.            MIB was established in 1961 to provide finance to smaller scale
industries. As of June 30, 1968, it hadl total loans outstanding amounting to
W 22.3 billion of which about 95% was in the manufacturing field. Of the total
amount outstanding as of June 30, 1968, about 70%o was in respect of working
canital loans; only about 30% was in respect of plant and 'equipment loans.
Ac-ording to MIB's operational program for 1969, now approved by the Government,
Prijl's total investment during the year wgill amount to W 12.5 billion (US$ 44.5
million) provided its resources are substantially increased.
13.            A new institution, Korea Investment Development Corporation (KIDC),
was established in December 1968. Its authorized capital, US$ 5 million equivalent,
has been subscribed by the Government; one-third directly; one-third through KRB;
and one-third by the commercial banks, which are predominantly Government-owned.
KT!C's main objective is to develop a capital market in the country.



- 4 -
and to encourage a healthy growth of the stock exchange.      KIDC will underwrite
share and bond issues, and assist and encourage the publi.c marketing of shares in
established companies which are presently closely held.      The Governor of KIDC
is also a director of ITFC, and the two institutions expect opportunities of
close collaboration.
14.       At the time KDFC was set up, the Government stated that it expected
KDFC to become the principal source of medium and long term financing for the
private sector.   While KRB and IQB are active in their respective fields, and
have relatively large resources, KDFC's operations have not suffered from
competition.
KDFC's Relations with Government, the Business Community and Other Financia:L
Institutions
'5.        KDFC, sponsored by a group of leading Korean businessmen, was establi-
shed with the active cooperation and support of the Goveinment.      The Government
provided KDFC with a subordinated loan amounting to 1.5 times its naid-in canita-
(paragraph 22) and exempted IFC and thie foreign shareholciers from the application
of certain restrictive provisions of the Foreign Capital Inducement Law.       Thle
Government believes that it is in the best interests of K.orea that KDFC should
remain independent in its policins and onerations. Tnevitablyr. KDFG's
management has from time-to-time encoumtered pressures from both public and
orivate sources.   A notable examlpj wES the effnrt to prsuade it to lower its
lending rate on Won loans.    The Board initiated a series of studies and dis-
cussiones as a resumlt of which it rldneditri nnt tn change KnFC's rates at the
present time;(see paragraph 43).

III. DESCRIPTION OF KDFC
Objectives
18.       The objectives of KDFC, a private development finance company, are to
assist in the creation, expansion and modernization of private industrial enter-
prises; to encourage, sponsor and secure participation of private capital, domestic
as well as foreign, in such enterprises; to assist in the expansion and stimulation
of the capital market; and to improve technical, financial, managerial and adminis-
trative practices of private enterprises in Korea. It mav extend long and medium
term loans, male equity investments, underwrite and sponsor equity and debt
securitv issues;. and guarantee, couanter-guarantee or otherwise secure the payment
of loans and other debt obligations.
Share Capital and Ownership
19.       When KDFC was established in April 1967, its share capital was W820
million, all subscribed by Korean nvestors    U.en inFC'S financing was cmr!l e
in February 1968, the paid-in capital was raised to VJL,350 million, with a group
of. foreig priVLat- c  investors subscribin.LLg WV)  I) I. Jlon an L T'C VV2.5 - lJ-ion..
Of the total paid-in capital, 15% is held by Korean commercial banks (predomi-
na4ntly GovernmInt -owvned), 5l% by insrarnce companies, and 31% by Korean private
investors, most of whom are members of the Federation of Korean Industries.
Foreign investors hold 25% of the tJotial paid-in capital.  ACXS holding ($0.71
rillion equiva:Lent) is about 14% of the total capital.  A list of major share-
holders is given in Annex I.
resources
2u.       KDFC7s long term resources consist of its paid-in share capital, reserve5
.?nd retained earnings, a subordinated government loan, a loan from US AID, and
a loan from the Bank.
21.       Share capital and reserves.  As of December 31, 1968, KDFC1s equity
amounted to W1,693 million (US$6.76 million equivalent).  No dividend was paid
for the year 1'968 and all the earnings were retained to strengthen the equii;y
base.
22.       Subordinated Government loan.  As part of IDFC's initial capitali:sa-
t,on, the Government granted KDFC a loan amounting to W2,025 million (equivalent
of US$7.5 million at the exchange rate obtaining at that time.)  The loan is
for a period of 40 years including 10 years' grace. It will rank subordina-te
to all other debt and panr passu with the share capital in the event of
liquidation of the company. KDFC pays interest on the loan at the rate of h1% per
annum. By agrtsement with the Government at the time the loan was made, IKFC
has deposited the proceeds of the loan with KRB and receives interest on the out-
s-tanding balance at the rate of 10% per annum. The net income to KDFC on this
loan is therefore 6% per annum until funds are withdrawn by KDFC for long term
investments. A simple procedure has been devised for the withdrawal of funds
by KDFC.



23.       Foreign exchange loans.   Two foreign exchange loans were part of PDFC's
initial capitalization:
i) $5 million loan from AID.   This is a two-step loan with AID
lending to the Government for 40 years and the Government re-lending to KDFC
for 15 years with a grace period of 3 years from the date of first disbursement
under the loan,, KDFC pays interest at the rate of 6% per annum. Disbursements
under the loan are tied to procurement in the U.S.A. As of May 31. 1969, art
amount of $495,ooo had been committed. KDFC expects that the full amount of' the
loan will be oommitted in early 1970..
(ii) ,35 million loan frnm the Banke The loan was made on terms usual
for such loans to development finance companies, except that, since KDFC was a new
institution at the tim  the loan was made- ths Loan. Agreement provides for the
commitment charge to be levied only on amounts actually credited to the loan
account. ,As of May 31, 1969, the Bank had credited $2.714 million to iDFG's Loan
Account.   KDIt expects that the full amount will be committed by July/August. 1969.
Organization, bnagement and Staff
24.       Board of Directors.   The initial Board elected in April 1967 corsisted of
9  orean d-rect;ors. At the timle ofP coii,iletion of Ihe f".nanc--g  .Fburl68

three new directors representing the foreign investors and one representing IFC
were elected. The present Board Puinex II) consists of 13 directors with the
following composition:
President                       1
Korean private shareholders     >
Korean banks and insurance
companies                    3        9
IFC                                      1
Foreign shareholders                     3

By a voting agreement, the shareholders have agreed to maintain the above compo-
sition of the Board. The Chairman of the Board is Mr. C. S. Hong, one of the
leading industrialists of Korea, who was until recently also the Chairman oi' the
Federation of Korean Industries.
25.       Executive Committee. An Executive Committee consisting of 4 directors
has been authorlzed by the Board to approve individual investments up to $5C0O,OOO
equivalent. The decisions of the Committee are taken by majority vote but any
nemnber of the Committee may request that a matter be referred to the full Board
f'or decision.  Investments of more than US$500,000 equivalent require the affirma-
tive recommendation of the Executive Committee before being submitted to the Board.

26.       Management.  KDFC's managemernt presently consists of the Chairman,
the President and tlJo Vice Presidents, assisted by an AdvJisor.  It is a strong
management.
27.       The President of KDFC, MIr. C., H. Kim, was formerly Governor of the
Rank of Korea. 11lr. Kim has already proved himself an able chief executive of
KDFC. KDFC's Dractices and procedures are so arranged that the company does noth-
ing significant without U1r. Kim's prior knowledge and consent.
283.      Consultation between the President and the Chairman is frequent and
close. The Chairman's continuing support of the President on large and contro-
versial issues is vital.
29.       KDFC's Vice Presidents are HJr. M. J. Choi and 1r. C. K. Lee.  Mr. Choi
was formerly a director of IMB where he acquired considerable knowledge and
ex-nerience of long term lending.  r. lJee, who Joined KDFC in March 1969, is a
banker by profession. Immediately before he joined KDFC, he was Executive Vice-
President of Bank of Seoul. a leading commercial bank in Korea.
30.       Tn romnliance with a condition of the Bank Loan Agreement, KDFC en;aged,
in harch 1968, an Advisor.  He is Ir. C,. L. Terrel, who has had long experience in
industrial financing and related fields in a nmber of develoning countries,
including Ghana, Migeria and Taiwan.  Mr. Terrel is making a valuable contri.-
bution to management decisions, projec1; appraisal and staff training.  His
initial contract was for two years, but it is being renewed.   This is in KDFC's
interests.
31.       Organization and Staff.  The staff is grouped in 4 departments, each
headed by a department manager respons:Lble directly to a 'Vice President.  The
LApartunenLts are:  (i) InvestmenLt Appraisal; (LLJ) OperatJions (end=use Supervision)
(iii) Planning and Control; and (iv) Administration. The organization chart
is sho-w in Annex iII. Apart from the managerment, the professional staff numbers
19. There are also 5 professional trainees who recently graduated from college.
i-`. Kim has chcsen the staff carefully, and its rme.,.bers a7ppear to be competent
and dedicated.  Given the volume of business available, three or four more
professionals writh between five and ten yers of relevant experience are needed.
-FC's management is seeking to recruit them.
Procedures
3,2.      Appraical of Investment Proposals.  An applicant files a preliminary
olutline of proposal together with the latest available financial statements,
where appropriate. The staff review of the proposal is recorded and considered
by the Vice Presldents and President.   It is they who decide whether or not KDFC
w4.11 proceed further.  If the decision is to proceed, an interview is arranged
w-Lth the applicant.  He is given a formal application form together witn a copy
of KDFC's "Guide for Applicants."  The interview is conducted by the M5anager of
t.he Investment Appraisal Department and KDFC's Consultant Engineer, who works
part-time for KDFC. The formal proposal (in the preparation of which KDFC
frequently helps its clients) is processed simultaneously by three professionals;
ar engineer, a financial analyst and a marketing man. They aim to draw up Et



- 8 -
preliminary feasibility report within a period of 1-2 weeks on the basis of
which the President decides whether or not a full appraisal will be made.    If
the decision is to go ahead, the applicant is asked to submit recent financial
accounts audited by a CPA. The engineer makes one or more site inspections.
The marketing man subsequently writes the overall report.   The departmental
N.anager, or the individual officers working on the proposal, consult the Advisor
as need arises. The management is also kept concurrently informed. The coRpleted
report is reviewed by the Advisor, after which it goes to the President for hi.s
final approval before being presented to the Executive Committee.
33.       The quality of KDFC's appraisal work is good in most respects.    The
coverage of the! engineering, financial, marketing and management aspects of a
project is usually comprehensive and analytical. The appraisal reports indicate
that KDFC also gives some thoug:ht, but not alwavs sufficient thou7ht, to the
economic aspects of the projects iv finances.   The calculation of tUe effects of
exnut!^n of each pro ject on TYr.onrIo ba1lan  of p2de'nt  and on employment :s a
standard pract:ice.  An attempt is alsco made, when approprLiate, to assess the
Ad  -   -  4-d ind:rect bene-lts accruing, f,rom tre  nt-roduction of mo -odei- technolo Y-'>
KDFC's appraisals do not, however, always consider the international compet:L-
4ti4veness of" produc4-ion cost-s.  Thi4s is b-ein, discussed w..th- ImFC.r
34.       Follcw-up.   Ih some respects, the work of the Operations Department
starts eren bef'nre a loan nrnopoa1 is pnut to thet Fxcrutive Committee or Board.  As
soon as the management has decided to undertake a full appraisal, the Operations
Department starts its evaluation of the security for the proposed 12njn which
.is usually a se!nior mortgage.  By the time the proposal goes to the Executive
Ccrmgm.ttee, the evaluation of +the    tr^ is- rrm- c0mplete, and, - the draftl+  of loan
papers is in hand.  The Department helps the borrower to draw up procurement
crntracts, to a.rrange in   ance,and to- obtain +henecea y     mrt pemits.
The borrower is required to submit quarterly reports to KDFC. Those reports
are prom-aptly analyzed by YnFC's staf4, and submitted to the management with a
recommendation for action when appropriate.
3.5.      As in. other aspects of its work, KDFC has made -a good start on end-
.se supervtision.  The adequacy of its procedures wlll have to be reassessed .when
they apply to a. portfolio larger than 'KDFC's present very small one.
IV.  POLICIES, OPERATrIONiS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
Policies
36.       As a guideline to KDFC's operations, the Board has adepted a Statement
ol Investment and Operational Policies (Annex Dv).   It provides that KDFC will
make its investment decisions on the basis of sound investment criteria; will
diversify its loans and investments; will turn over its portfolio as it can;
wi.ll not take a controlling interest i-n any enterprise it finances; will limit
its debt to prudent amounts; will lend and invest in a manner best calculated to
maintain the value of its capital; will protect itself against foreign exchange
risk; will build up a staff suitable to its objectives; will follow a sound

reserves policv; will have an annual independent audit, etc.  The Policy State-
ment also provides that while KDFC's primary field of activity is in the manu-
*a n   ~ nnA -the n-ocessLrngi ndustrie, -i lt may invest. also in other tvnes nf
enterprises, including transport, tourism and large-scale commercially oriented
37       TIn term. of the existing Bank LaTn Age+r.t with TMr., nn,y _vvadnrnP.e+.
of the Statement requires prior approval of the Bank. Th-,e 3tatement of
Investment and Operational Policies is both- appropria`e anu adequ --te.
Cperations
38.       Lending activity.  KDFC made its first investment decisions in July
1968.  Up to 1earch31, 1969 h'C had approved ll loa's ar.d one equity invest-
ment for a total amount of US$ 4.6 million equivalent (1580 million and $2.5
million).  As of =the same date, the amount com-itted was  z550 million in
domestic currertcy and $1,216,000 in foreign exchange.  Disbursements against
foreign exchange loans amounted to $257,000 as oI March 3i, 1969; tose ag-ainsL
domestic currency loans and equity investment amounted to W4l16 million.   As of the
the same date, KuFC had under active consideration loan applications amounting
to WI746 milliorn in domestic currency and $6.3 million in foreign exchange. A
summary of KDFC s operations up to March 31, 1969 is as follows:

39.       Size of Loans.  IDFC's smallest and biggest loans so far have been in
domestic currency, the s7allest being ,440 million ($1h3,000 equivalent) and the
biggest W200 million ($714,000 equivalent). The average size of all the loans
made by KDFC up to aiarch 31, 1969 is W107 million ($384,000 equivalent).  The
amounts of the smallest and biggest foreign exchange loan,s made up to the same
date are $155,0CO and $495,000 respectively.
40.       Period of Loans.  The Deriod of the foreign exchange loans made by
KDFC so far is usially d years; that for the dornestic currency loans is usually
5 years.  The most common grace period is 2 vears.
4ll.      Security for the Loans.  A se=nior mortgage on the nnnlicant's factory
is the usual sEcCurity obtained by KDFC.  This is often supplemented by personai
guarantees by the snonsors of the projects.   Tn a few cases, 1nFC obtained a
commercial bank's guarantee as the principal security for its loans.
1h2.      Rate of Interest and Other Charges.   KDFC charges 10% on foreign
currency lonns and20onwon loans.      :rt a"-- charges a co-tmen+ ree of 3/l of-P '
on foreign currency loans.  There are no other charges or fees.
L3.       KDFC's Board frequently reviews its interest rates.   The rates of 10%
and 20% for foreign exchange and won loans respectivelywere adopted wh.en KDFC
made its first investment decisions, in July 1968, and have not since been changed.
F0ownl  g its rmostt recetu re-view, in Deuernber I9Yo, thle Board decided that the rate
of 20% on domestic currency loans was the lowest that couLd be justified in view
of (a) the structure of prevailing interest rates in Korea, (b) the danger that
K;FC funds would be diverted to low priority uses if too low a rate were charged,
a-id (c) thle li.kely level of inflation and consequent thieat of iimpci.slent of'
MYDFC's capital.  L.s stated in parPq-|aph 10, the rate of inte;-est curiently paid
by Korean corLnr'3rcial banks on deposits is 25.2%.
44.       Equity Investrmients.  As of Mlarch 31, 1969, KDFC had made one equity
Lnvestment of hiJl07 million in a synthetic textile company, and was considering
another of W200 million, in a glass manufacturing company.   KDFC is actively
seelcing opportunities for additional investments. It wilL meet the usual
uifficulty that arises when most of the leading entrepreneurs prefer the shares
of the companies to be family-held or controlled by a suall group. On the other
hand, efforts are presently being made in Korea to induce a wider dispersal of
shareholdings. KiFC should be able to increase its equity investments through
the opportunities so created.
45.       Industrial Diversification.  Of the 12 loans and equity investment
approved by KDFC up to iarch 31, 1969, seven went to textile enterprises, in a
total amount of about $2.5 million equivalent. The projects financed were in
various branches of the textiles industry: cotton, synthetic fibers and raw
silk. Other loans have been made to the glass, food processing, electrical
equipment and metal industries. The present emphasis on the textiles industry
in part reflects the fact that textiles is the biggest industry in Korea.   It
is also highly competitive in international markets.   The approval of projects
presently being considered by KDFC is :Likely soon to make its portfolio more
diversified.



46.        FC's portfolo4 is at present+ smal' an new.    T(n'f is r  anPrting in a
seller's market, however, and has appraised and selected all its investmentEs with
particular care.  Given the care in appraisal and in *rew of the              2nd
profitability records of the client companies, KDFC's portfolio appears to be good.
Financial Resu:Lts and Position
47.       Although KDFC was formally established in April 1967 and its financing
w'as completed :Ln February 1968, it did not make its fit-st ivestment tecisions
until July 1968. Its assets therefore consist predominantly of current and tinie
deposits, and its income so far has been derived almost exclusively fiur,m int;erest
on such deposi-ts.  Balance sheets as of December 31, 1967 and 1968 are given in
Ai2nex V and are summarized here:

As is apparent from the above summary, KDFC's liquidity position as of December 31,
-968 was vnnr cmfort2blej and it had no long term debt except the Government
loan. Loans and investments were still a very small. nart of the total assets.
.hese features are as exrected for aa ievelopnment finance company which has not
yrt completed its first full operating year.
)U8.      KDFC's net income in 1967 and 1968 amounted to W107 million and
,     4U 4llio  rsetvl     rr-enting a return on share c2pit21 and endltx

49.       Cost of resources and spread.   The average cost to IKFC of its foreign
exehange resouXces i.s eurrently  .25%.  Wi+.h the lending rate set at 10%, K1DFC
gets an average spread of 3.75% on foreign exchange loans.   On domestic currency
loans, the spread appears large because of the relatively low cost Governmenlt
loan to KDFC an.d the generally high structure of interest rates in Korea. S'o
lon.g as +'the proc,'teeds of the (rover +  1 loan <e k  Ft on clpst~ with WRPR,

in 1968, it did not pay a dividend, because its income WEas derived almost totally
fr-om iterest on deposit of funds. As of December 31, 1968, huFC's share had
a book value equal to 14.0% of par.
V. PROSPEuTS
51.       As noted in paragraphs 4-8, the Korean econoriy is moving ahead strongly
with enphasis on the manufacturing sector, where private enterprise is dominant.
Investment in the private sector has increased rapidly in recent years and is
expected to grow further.   Compared with the provisional figure of investment in
the private sector in 1968, WB6 billion ($315 million equivalent), the Government
estimate for 19691/ is W95.8 billion ($351 million equivalent). KDFC is not
expected to face the problem of lack of business. Its operations so far have
been limited, and are expected to continue to be limited in the near future,
more by its staff resources than by demand for financing.,
52.       The demand for foreign exchzmge appears to excesed that for Won loans.
1DFC foresees considerable difficulty, however, in replenishing its won resources
during the next three or four years. IDFC does not consider it feasible in the
near future to augment its won resources except by increases in its equity. It
proposes to increase its paid-in capi-tal in 1971 and 1973. KDFC is therefore
following a policy of rationing the use of its domestic currency resources at a
rate of commitment which will make them last until new resources can be raised.
It does not foresee a similar difficulty in raising new foreign currency resources.
As a result KIFC's projection of the volume of business for the years 1969-1973
shows a ratio of 3.7:1 for foreign currency commitments to won commitments.
CR.       A statement showing the forecast of KDFC's loan and equity approvals,
commitments arnd disbursements is given in Annex VII.  The estimates of approvals
aid commitments for the year 1969 are made on the basis of pronosals alread.y

before KDFC and in various stages of investigation.   Estimates for the years
1970 through 1973 thake into accornt the total estim2ted d-innri of the private

rlFC should be able to achieve them. A sunoary of past and projected fw_ign
exchange loan approvals and commitments is given below:

5h.       As of January 1, 1969, KEFC had uncommitted foreign exchange resources
amounting to $9.5 million.  Foreign exchange conmitments   from January 1, 1b99,
uo to end 1970 are estimated to aimunt to $21.0 million.   Commitments up to
Jume 30, 1971 are estimated to amount to about $29 million.   KDFC will therefore
need additional foreign exchange resources of the order of $11.5 million to meet
estimated commitments to the end of 1970 and of $19.5 mil-Lion through June 30D,
l1'71.
55.        .non-; potent-i2l lendei's of forei-n exch&n7e other than IBRD, only
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) appears at present to be a possible source.
KDFC hoped for a small loan from ADB in 1969, but the Jovernment apparently
decided that other projects in Korea had a prior claim on any funds that migh,t
be forthcoming from ADB for the present. ADB has concu-fed in this view.
56.       Other potential lenders to IDFC are Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW) and AID.  KDFC intends to approach XfW at an oppurttme mement
after enlistin,g the support of its German shareholder, Deutsche Bank.  However,
K1MFC is unlikel;y to obtain a loan before the second half of 1971. AID too does
not expect to make a second loan to KDFC in the next two vears.
57.       KDFC recently entered into an arrangement with Caterpillar Far East
Ltd., under wjhich the latter has agreed to provide a line of credit amountinp
to $5 million to KDFC to finance purchases of Caterpillar equipment from the
United States. The arrangement renresents an exneriment on the nart of X.PFr
to diversify its sources of foreign exchange funds. There is no basis for KDFC,
yet, to estimate the neriod over which it coumld reasonably eh epected- to utiIi2e
the Caterpillar loan.  As the loan will be tied both as to country of procure-
ment (the U     llanrn an  to supplier (Caterpillar), for the purchase ofalirited
range of equipment, it is unlikely materially to affect KDFC's requirements of
freefreg     ecane

potential lender of foreign exchange to KDFC in the next two years. KDFC would
need about 20 million to cover its foreign excnange requirementzs until laid 1971,
on a comnmitment basis.
59.       Projected Income and Profitability.   Projected income statements for
the years 1969-1973 are given in Annex VIII.   KDFC!s net profit (after tax) is
expected to increase from $1.4 million in 1969 to $2.9 million in 1973. As a
percentage of share capital it would amount to approximately 29% in 1969 and
approximately 20% in 1973. As a return on total equity (end of the period)
the net profit would amount to 18.4% in 1969 and 16.7% in 1973.    The decrease in
profitability in relation to both share capital and equity is due partly to the
planned increases in KDFC's share capital in 1971 and 1973, and partly to the
higher incidence of taxation in 1973. The real return orL the shareholders'
equity will be considerably less, however, when inflatiorn is taken into account.
KDFC presently proposes to start paying a dividend in 1970, in respect of the
results of 196'3.
60.       Debt/Service Coverage.   Projected cash flow statements for the years
1969 through 1973 are g4ven in Amnex IX. These and the projected income state-
ments show thatl the debt service cover would be adequate. Annual interest payments
throughout the period of the forecast will not be more t1on half the amount of
EDF`'s annual profit before financial expenses. Repayments by KDFC in any one
vear will at the most amomnt to 0.7 times thp collections received bv it during
the same year.

increase from i.3:i in i969 to 3.7 :  in 1972 and tnen deciine slightly in 1973 to

ceiling allowed, 3:1, throughout the period of the estimates. It is estimated to
reach its highest point in 1973 when it will be 2.1:1.    A summary Of forecast

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
63.       KDFC has made a sound start.   The management is competent and has ably
handled the aff'airs of the company in its initial period.  It has succeeded in
assembling a capable staff whose potential is high. Appraisal standards are good
and end-use and other procedures are thorough and meticulous. The quality of
the present smrll portfolio is sound, and KDE'C's operations have been profitable.
64.       With the overall economic outlook favorable, there should be increasing
investment in the private industrial and allied sectors.   The demand for medium-
and long-term linancing from these sectors is also expected to continue to xise.
KDFC was set up) to be the principal source of such financing. The demand for
the tyDe of financial assistance KDFC offers is heavv and is expected to continue
to be so. Provided that it gets the proposed second Bank loan, its operations
will continue, at least in the near future. to be limited by its staff resources
rather than by lack of business. The management is making adequate ef'forts to
train and rpnrmiit st-qff.

SQV.      The Bank is expected to be the principal source of KDFC's foreign
exchange requirements for at least the next two years. KDFC's needs for additional
foreign exchange resources for the period up to mid-1971 are assessed at about
$20 million.
AO        Under the first Bank Loan Agreement. the i'free limit" was $l0.000.
As noted in paragraph 39, KDFC's smallest foreign exchange loan so far is $155,000,
and accordinglv the Rank kas examined everv loan proposal reouirina the use of
Bank funds.   In view of the quality of JDFC's management and staff, of its loan

close supervision of KDFC's use of Bank funds to examine loans using about

of $5 million on the aggregate amount to be used for projects below the free Limit.

71.       The following summarizes the recommendations concerning the proposeld
loan:
(i)  the amount recommended is US$ 20 million;
(ii)  the terms and conditions should be similar to those
of recent Bank loans to development finance companies
including the standard commitment charge;
(iii)  KDFC!s free limit should be raised to $300,000.

promote the expansion of private enterprise in the Republic of Korea,
will be guided by the policies set forth below:
I.  The Scope of Investment Activities
1)  KDI'C will invest only in productive enterprises.  While its
primary activity will be manufacturing and processing industry,
it may invest also in other types of enterprises, including
transport, tourism, and large-scale commercially oriented
agriculture. However, trade, real estate and small-scale
alrriculture will be excluded.
2)  KDFC will finance only private enterprises which are properly
organized and managed. KDFC will not invest in undertakings
which are Government-owned and operated, but a Government
holding of not more than 15% of the voting stock of a private
enterprise shall not make such enterprise ineligible for finan-
cial assistance from KDFC. KDFC will finance both new enter-
prises and existing ones for expansion or improvement.
3)  In its operations, KDFC will give due regard to the Government' .
general ecc)nomic plans and policies. The following categories
of industries will receive high priority, in accordance with
the Government economic policies and objectives:
a) export industries;

c)  industries producing raw materials necessary for production
of export comA4oditieS an innmport-substituts ;

ipznts in such investment, as also to the interest of the
concern whose shares are involved.

14) KDFC will not take a controlling interest in any enterprise in
which it has invested, or any other interest which would give
it primary responsibility for management, except that in the
case of jeopardy, it may take such action as may be necessary
to protect its interest. To this end it will not take up more
than 25' of the share capital of an enterprise, except as the
result of an underwriting commitment undertaken in the expect-
ation that the investment would in fact be within the limit
cited.
15) In accordance with normal banking practice, KDFC will require
its borrowers to provide and to maintain adequate security,

pay satisfactory dividends. It will seek profits on its equity
investments and will impose interest rates, fees and other

achieve that level of profitability.   It will build and maintain
reserves consistent with sound financial management. It will
