The Moroccan\n            government's request for Bank assistance in this\n            project provides a unique opportunity to shape a regulatory\n            and institutional framework, formulate an environmental\n            policy, and develop appropriate economic and financial\n            instruments to ensure integrity and effective policies."}, "docdt": "1993-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
