Project
Description:        The project supports the strategy folaied by the
Government, within the framework of its structural
adjustment program, to develop primary education through
more efficient and effective utilization of education
resources by:
1.   Reduction in Unit Recurrent Coste and Improvements
in Quality and Relevance of Primary Education by:
(a) limiting the recruitment of "instituteurs"
and thereby the growth in average teacherst
salaries through (i) provision of in-service
training to improve the qualifications of
existing teachers and (ii) improvement of the
quality of pre-service training of
"instituteurs-adjoints";
(b) promoting a more efficient use of existing
teachers through extending the use of
multi-grade teaching in rural areas and
introducing the use of double-shift teaching
in urban areas; and
(c) improving the efficiency of the learning
process through a strengthening of the
national capacity to develop and adapt
low-cost textt-oks and teacher guides, and to
procure and d.stribute them.
2.   Reduction in Unit Capital Cost  anud Improvement Sn
Accesa to Primary Education by:
(a) developing designs and construction
techniques for low-cost primary school
buildings and constructing 750 classrooms
using these designs and techniques;



- vi -
(b) rehabilitating 3,000 existing clasatoome; and
(c)  promoting the development of a community-
based school maintenance system.
3. Promotion of More Coat-Effective Use of Education
Resources by:
(a) strengthening the Ministry of Educatlon's
(MENESR) capacity to manage and control use
of human, physical and f mancial resources at
central and local levels;
(b) reinforcing the planning and monitoring
capabilities of the Directorate of Planning
and Prograiming (DEP) vithin the NENESR; and
(c) establishing a capacity vithin MENESR to
prepare and implement education projecta.

Project Benefits
and Risks:        The project vould in.rease primary school enrollments by
about 34,000 pupils (an incremental annual growth of
about 2% between 1987 and 1992), and improve quality of
education for nost primery students through provision of
boetter trained teachers, improvgd availability, relevance
and quality of textbooks and improved school buildings.
The project would also promote more cost-effective use of
education resources, increased participation by local
communities in primary school construction and
maintenance, and development of policy formulation and
institution building as a base for longer-ternm sectoral
development.  Together tnese measures would arrest the
decline in the primary school enrollment ratio and lay
the foundatlons for future growth. The main risks arise
from (a) the Ministry of Education's lack of experience
in Implementing Bank projects and its inadequate
technical capacity in executing a large program of
low-cost construction, and (b) pressure to recruit more
costly teachers ("instituteurs") rather than to improve
the quality of education through more cost-effective
meaaures. To minimize the former risk, the project would
equip the Ministry vitk a Project Coordination Unit and
vith a Bureau that will plan and monitor implementation
of the school construction and rehabilitation program.
To address the latter risk, the project would improve the
quality of existing teachers, strengthen in-service
teacher training for "instituteurs-adjoints," and provide
for the development, procurement and distribution of
textbooks and teacher guides. Furthermore, at
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that its
recruitment and promotion policies vili reflect the need
to limit future increases in average teacher salaries.

REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPIIENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Goverument of Niger has requested IDA assistance tn financing
a project to reduce unit CostS and improve quality as vell as managerial
capability within the education sector. Total project costs are estimated
at US$26.2 million equivalent (net of taxes and duties), with a foreign
exchange component of US$15.1 million. The Government would contribute
US$1.4 million, the Federal Republie of Germany and Norway would cofinance
-vith, respectively, US$1.7 snd 4.7 million equivalent; and the remainder,
US$18.4 million, would be fiuanced by IDA.
1.2       The project would be IDA's second contribution to education ln
Niger, and the first in support of primary schoollng. The project supports
Niger's structural adjustment program by improving public resources manage-
ment in the education sector. The specific measures proposed in education
vere developed through a sector policy dialogue conducted with the Nigerien
authorities during the past two years. The Basic Data Sheet is in Annex 1.
II. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
A.   Educational Structure
2.1       A six-year primary cycle is followed by four years of lower and
three years of upper secondary schooling, and by higher education et the
University of Niamey, the National School of Administration or abroad.
Teacher training is provided at the upper secondary level and at the
University of Niamey. Koranic achools are found in most villages. Agri-
cultural and vocational training are available in several small centers.
About 90% of public expenditures on education are channelled through the
Ministry of National Education, Righer Education and Research. Other
Ministries are responsible for their ovn training programs. Annex 2-1
shows the structure of the education system.
B.   Issues in Primary Education Development
1. Access and Equity
2.2       At 14%, Niger's adult literacy rate is one of the lowest in the
vorld. Its gross primary enrollment ratio of 25%, one of the lowest ln
Africa, is dovn from 27% in 1980.  Access to prlmary education differs
markedly by sex snd by district. Girls account for 36% of primary enroll-
mente and the enrollment ratio for the 39 districts ranges from 7 to 65%.
Enrollment growth in urban areas ls severely constrained by limite<. educa-
tion capacity as wituessed by overcrowded classes (generally more than 55
pupils per class) and restrictions on new admission at the start of each



-2
school year.  Increased rural to urban migration resulting from the recent
drought has caused further overcrowding of urban claserooms and smaller
classes in many rural school8.  Enrolluent growth in rural areas is con-
stra'ned by a combination of demand and supply factors. Low population
density makes supply of education costly (clase 8ize iS generally below 35)
and necessitates large catchment areas for each school which, in turn, has
a negative effect on demand. Decllne in rural incomes, and low perceived
private benefits resulting from poor o.portunities for admission to the
next level of education and for entry to vage employment, are further
causes for the slackening in demand for rural primary education observed in
recent years. If allowed to continue, this virtual stagnation at v low
level of human resources development would have serious detrimental effects
on the country's long-term economic growth prospects. Research evidence
from other developing nations points to a poverful beneficial impact of
schooling on factors such as agricultural productivity, physical health,
nutrition and fertility as well as on certain sets of social, political and
personal values which promote development. Improvements in all these areas
are necessary to attain sustained economic gro-4th in Niger. Annex 2-2
gives statistics on enrollment, teachers and finance in Niger. Annex 2-3
provides comparative education indicators for other countries, and
Annex 2-4 presents an analysis of returns to primary education in Niger.
2.   Financial Constraints
2.3       Rigid budget ceilings.  Despite Niger's low enrollment ratios,
the share of the goverument budget devoted to education (21%) is above
average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Simulations of the effecte of alternative
policies regarding the allocation of the severely constrained resources
both vithin the sector and between education and other sectors show that
prospects for even modest improvement in access to primary education depend
largely on the extent to which education resources can be used more effec-
tively. If present policies remain unchanged, the primary school enroll-
ment ratio vould decline (from 25% in 1985 to 14% in year 2000) even under
the optimistic assumption of a 2% real annual growth in the education
budget (Annex 2-5).
2.4       High unit recurrent costs.  At about US$77 per student, Niger's
recurrent unit costs in prirary education exceed the already high average
for Western Africa. Teacher salaries account for 84% of the primary educa-
tion recurrent budget. The vage bill required to sustain a given enrollment
depend3 on (a) the number of pupils per teacher; and (b) the average salary
per teacher.  The pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools has declined from
41 in 1980 to 36 in 1984; a gradual rise to 45 pupils per teacher would
permit an increase in enrollment oy 25% vithout augmenting the number of
teachers. This would require larger class size and increased use of multi-
grade teaching in rural areas as vell as more effective use of teachers and
classrooms in urban areas through double-shift teaching.
2.5       Current practices for recruiting and promoting teachers result in
a strong upvard pressure on average teacher salaries. Niger has three main
categories of trained primary school teachers: "instituteurs" (I),
"instituteurs-adjoints" (IA), and "moniteurs".- The third category is nov
being phased out and training is provided only for the I and IA grades.
Three policy variables govern the development of average teacher salaries:



-3-
(a) the distribution of new recruitment among the three categories, because
the starting salaries of the I and IA categories are 2.27 and 1.50 tlmes
that of the "moniteurs"; (b) the range of the three salary scales, because
the maximum salary for each category le about twice the starting salary;
and (c) the pace of movement upward through the scales because each scale
has ten steps and a teacher is promoted automatically every two years and
may also be upgraded from one category to another. Annex 2-6 describes
Niger's teacher traini.:g system and shows that the present capacity of this
system fs likely to be sufficient to meet tie demand for primary achool
teachers until the early 1990s. Annex 2-7 compares starting salaries and
range în salary scales for different categories of teachers in eight West
African count ries.
2.6       HiSh capital costs.  In 1984, the cost of a primary school class-
room made from cement blocks and tin roof was about US$1O,000.  This is
about five times the coste of einploying "banco" which la the most commonly
used local building material (a mixture of clay, straw and earth). The
share of all claserooms constructed from local materials declined from 47%
in 1975 to 27% ln 1985. To reverse this trend, it is necessary to develop
improved building designs and techniques based largely on locally available
materials. lu addition to reducing construction coasts, a greater reliance
on local materials would help establish a pattern whereby school construc-
tion and maintenance would largely be the responsibility of each village.
2.7       High student subsidies.  Student subsidies account for 31% of the
budget for secoaiary education, 60% of that for higher education, and 20Z
of the total public education budget (Annex 2-2). Considering the bleak
prospects for gainful employment for graduates and the fact that many of
those who benefit from subsidies belong to the better-off social groupe, a
gradual reduction in the scholarship budget would seem justified from an
economic as vell as from an equity point of view.  Furthermore, over time
this would facilitate a gradual increase in the share of the education
budget devoted to primary education (40% in 1986).
3.   Quality of Primary Education
2.8       The MENESR considers the quality of the primary education
teaching force inadequate. Although the quality ne doubt is low, 84% of
Niger's prîmary school teachers have at least two years of teacher tralning
followlng completion of lower secondary education. Therefore, to minimize
training and salary costs, the quality of the teaching force should be
improved through a more rigorous selection of entrante to teacher training
programs and through a strengthening of the quality of these programs
rather than through an extension of the length of the training.  The
quality of instruction is also adversely affected by an acute shortage of
textbooks and teachers' guides. Even when pedagogical materials are
available ln limited numbers, they are outdated, the language and approach
to learning used are outmoded and the content is not adapted to Nigerien
culture and custome since these materials have been developed abroad for
the West African region in general and not specifically for Niger.  Other
physical facilities such as school buildings are in great need of repair.
internal efficiency of primary schools is low -- 14% of all pupils are
repeaters and only 20% of those who sat for the primary school leavlng
exmÎination ïn 1985 passed.  Thus, action to improve resource utilization
should be accompanied by measures in support of quality and relevance.

4.   Planning and Manaement
2.9       The Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research
(MENESR) emplays more than half of Nigerls permanent civil servants and
manages about 21% of the Government's recurrent budget. The Ministryts
ability to use these resources cost-effectively is hampered by its veak
capacity for planning, personnel management, and budgeting and cost
control. In late 1985 the Goverument established a potentially more
efficient administrative structure by (a) merging the Ministry of Higher
Education and Research with that of National Education. to form the MENESR,
and (b) creating eight new inspectorates in rural areas. The former
decision facîlitates a more efficient use of personnel -- MENESR has 10
directorates as compared to 13 in the former two Ministries -- and a better
coordination of education policies. The latter decentralizes existing
inspectorate staff, thus allowing a better support to and control of rural
primary schools. However, for these organizational changes to improve
resource utilization, the MENESR needs to revise its planning, budgeting
and management procedures and the inspectorate staff must be provided with
office space and essential equipment. Annex 2-8 gives the organizational
charts of the two former Ministries and of the MENESR.
C.   The Government's Sector Adjustment Strategy
2.10      The Government has launched a structural adjustment program aimed
at increasing the efficiency of resource use and strengthening the
country's resource base, as vell as improving the balance of payments and
public finance position. This program includes an education strategy which
has the twin objectives of preventing the Government's tight financial con-
straints from causing further decline in the already low enrollment ratio
in primary education, while laying the foundations for medium- to long-term
education developments in line with expected resource availability and
labor market conditione. To implement this education strategy the Govern-
ment has initiated several measures designed to: (a) reduce unit recurrent
costs (through containment of the increase in teacher salaries and allow-
ances, and through more efficient use of available resources); (b) reduce
unit capital costs (through development of low-cost school construction and
maintenance); and (c) recover cost& (through reduction in scholarships in
higher education, introduction of charges for school supplies, expansion of
fee-charging private schools and increased financial contribution by local
communities to primary school construction). Following the decline in the
succesa rate at the primary school leaving examination in 1985 (para 2.8),
the Goverument also established (in October 1985) a Commission to review
the training and status of primary school teachers. The Commission's
Report (issued in Mardh 1986) reconmmends several measures aimed at
improving the quality and working conditions of teachers. The Government
has not yet considered the Commission's recommendations.
2.11      In sum, the Government's strategy calls for adjustment from a
small, costly and essentially elitist education sector for the few to a
more equitable, relevant and efficient system vith an expanding primary
education base and a development of secondary and higher education in line
vith expected resource availability and labor market conditions. Implemen-
tation of this strategy needs necessarily to be phased over several years
and muet be concurrent with a strengthening of the managerial capacity of



MENESR. Furthermore, its financial implications require careful moni-
toring. Although not yet fully articulated ln ail its aspects, the
strategy responds to development needs and deserves support as an integral
part of the country?s broader structural adjustment program. The proposed
project would assist the Government in its implementation.
D.   The Bank Group's Role
2.12      Niger had received 29 IDA credits totalling US$344.7 million as
of September 30, 1986. In February 1986 the country received a Structural
Adjustment Credit of US$60 million including $20 million from IDA. Only
one of previous credits has been in the education sector -- an agricultural
education project (Cr. 1151-NIR of May 1981 for US$21.5 million). Project
implementation has not faced serious problems. However, the project ls
essentially one of civil works carried out by foreigu contractors (67% of
total project costs). During the last two years a concerted effort has
been made to promote a dialogue on education policy and to improve the Bank
Group understanding of the sector as well as the Government's appreciation
of the Bank Group's criteria for education financing. Within the context
of the overall structural adjustment program, the formulation of the
Government's adjustment strategy for the education sector has been promoted
through this effort. Recognizing that a broader educational base i8 an
essential condition for sustained economic development in Niger, the Bank
Group supports the high priority given in the Governmentts strategy to
primary education. Given the issues outlined above, support for expansion
of primary education would be provided directly, through assistance in
facilities, teacher training and textbook production, and indirectly,
through support for policies designed to reduce unit costs and to reallo-
cate education resources in favor of primary educatlon, as vell as to
encourage the efforts of local communities.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives and Description
3.1       The project would support the education strategy formulated by
the Government (paras 2.10-2.11) vithin the framework of its structural
adjustment program. The implementation of this strategy is expected to
result in a more equitable, relevant and efficient educational system where
priority is given to the expansion of primary education and where secondary
and higher education vill develop in line with expected resource avail-
abillty and labor market conditions. Te ensure the implementation of the
education features of the adjustment program, during negotiations IDA and
the Goverument discussed and agreed on the general composition of a three-
year education investment program and its recurrent cost implications. At
negotiations the Goverument gave assurances that it vill (a) discuss with
IDA annually each fiscal year's recurrent budget for education as vell as
discuss and agree with IDA annually on the composition of the investment
budget for the coming three years; (b) recruit and promote teachers in a
manner guaranteeing that the percentage of "instituteurs" teaching in
prlmary ochools does not exceed 14% of total teaching staff in such schools
throughout the execution of the project; and (c) reduce the nominal
scholarshlp budget for higher education by at least 3.7% per year from



-6-
FY 1988 thro,ugh FY 1991, and not grant other subsidies for non-academic
servicts to students to compensate for this reduction. In order te monitor
progress on the above policy issues and on project implementation, the
Government alseo gave assurances that it will, not later than June 30 each
year, starting ln 1987, organize an annual project and education sector
review meeting with IDA.
3.2       In addition to supporting the government's structural adjustment
program generally, the nroject i8 speciflcally desîgned to: (a) reduce
unit recurrent coats in primary education while improving quality and rele-
vance; (b) reduce unit capital costs and improve access to primary educa-
tion; and (c) promote a more cost-effective use of education resources.
These three major project components are discussed below.
1.   Reduction in Recurrent Unit Costs and Improvements in Quality and
Relevance of Primary Education
3.3       To reduce recurrent unit costs without imrairing educational
quality, the project would:  (a) assist in restrtcturing the primary
teachlng force; (b) promote the use of multigrade teaching and double-shift
schooling; and (c) enhance the national capacity to develop, adapt, procure
and distribute appropriate low-cost textbooks and teachers' guides.
3.4       Restructuring the teaching force.  To contain future increases in
average teachers' salaries, the project would limit the need for recruiting
high-cost "instituteurs" by improving the quality of existing teachers and
of the pre-service training of "instituteurs-adjoints" (para 2.5). The
quality of existing staff would be enhanced through in-service training to
upgrade the qualifications of 420 formally untrained but experienced
teachers, and through refresher courses for about 1,800 semi-qualified or
qualified teachers and 1,250 primary school directors. The quality of pre-
service training would be improved through specialist workshops for the
staff of the teacher training colleges. The contents of the in-service and
pre-service training would include topics relating to other aspects of the
project such as the use of textbooks, multigrade teaching techniques,
school maintenance, management and timetabling. The project would provide:
(a) specialist services for developing and conducting the above courses and
workshops; and (b) about 800 staffyears of local training. At the annual
project and sector review meeting (para 3.1), the Government will discuss
wvth IDA and agree on the annual program for ln-service training. Details
of the activities to restructure the teaching force are given in Annex 3-1.
3.5       Double-shift and multi-grade teaching techniques.  To achieve
more intensive resource utilization, the project vould extend the use oe
multi-grade teaching in rural areas and introduce the use of double-shift
schooling in urban areas (para 2.4). To this end the project would improve
the training of teachers in multi-grade techniques and experiment vith
different methods of double-shift schooling in about 40 urban classes to
help develop suitable policies for extending the use of this method.
Details of the trainlng and experimentation are given in Annex 3-2.
3.6       The project vould finance:  (a) specialist services to design,
manage, evaluate and carry out the'experimentation with double-shift
teaching; and (b) in-service training for the teachers of the experimental



-7-
schools. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it vill:
(1) not later than September 30, 1987, discuss and agree vith IDA on the
detailed program for the experiment with double-shift teaching; (ii) start
the experiment not later than October 31, 1988; (iii) review with IDA the
ongoing results of the program not later than September 30 of each year,
and take into consideration IDA's comments; and (iv) diseuss the final
results of the experiment and their policy implications vith IDA prior to
September 30, 1991, and agree on subsequent actions.
3.7       Provision of textbooks and teachers' guides.  To further ensure
(in addition to improved tratning of teachers) that the cost reduction
measures outlined above do not impair educational quality, the project
vould: (a> establish a national capability to develop new textbooks and
teachers' guides where no suitable materials exist, and to adapt such
suitable imported materials whose adaptation rights may be acquired; and
(b) strengthen the capabilities to procure, store and distribute training
materials. To this end, a publications unit, an author training and
advisor5 -crç1ce, and an educational evaluation unit would be established
vithin the National Institute for Pedagogical Documentation, Research and
Promotion (INDRAP). The Institute's existing printshop vould be renovated,
the procedures for textbook procurement would be improved, and the storage
and distribution facilities at the central and the inspectorate level would
be renovated and equipped.
3.8       Textbooks are to be loaned free of charge, one for every two
pupils, and would last three years.  A limited cost recovery scheme for the
related provision of consumable materials and supplies has been introduced
by the Government. Under the project, the budgetary and equity impact of
these measures vould be evaluated to help the Government develop a suitable
cost recovery policy for textbooks. Textbook related training vould be
provided through pre- and in-service training (para 3.4). The project
vould provide for the development of 44 titles in five subject areas by a
national education publishing unit, and the printing of about one million
textbooks and teachers' guides in French, science, mathematics, geography
and history. The responsibility for curriculum development and the defi-
nition of the contents of pedagogical material is vith INDRAP. An informal
National Textbook Committee of the Ministry of Education - on which INDRAP
is represented -- approves both teachers' guides and pupils' texts. INDRAP
has developed revised materials in mathematics and geography as vell as
experimental texts in five local languages. The majority of the 44 titles
scheduled for production vill be originated by national author teams.
Annex 3-3 provides the list of titles by subject, grade level and source as
vell as the schedule for textbook preparation, adaption, development,
procurement and distribution.
3.9       The project vould finance:  (a) civil vorks to extend and impro"e
the existing INDRAP premises, to improve the Directorate of Financial
Affaire' varehouses and to extend or improve the inspectorate storerooms
(b) furniture, equipment and one vehicle; (c) the acquisition of adaptation
rights or the cost of co-publishing arrangements, (d) specialist services
and training for the development of the selected titles; (e) the printing
costs of the textbooks and teachers' guides; and (f) operating co0ts (book
distribution). At the annual project and sector review meeting (para 3.1),
the Governuent vill discuses vith IDA and agree on the number of textbook



-.8 -
and teachers' guides to be developed as originals by national authors and
the number to be adapted or co-published from suitable imported materials.
During negotiations the Goverument gave assurances that it will
(1) establish ana maintaln a publication unit, a training service for
authors of educational publications, and an evaluation service at INDRAP by
December 31, 1987; and (ii) prior to carrying out any new project fortthe
extension of INDRAP's printing capacity, submit to IDA for comments and
exchange of vieve an economic and financial study of such project.
2.  Reduction in Unit Capital Costa and Improvement in Accesa to
Primary Education
3.10      To reduce unit capital costs and improve access to primary edu-
cation the project would: (a) develop designs and construction techniques
for low-cost primary school buildings relying largely on local materials
and labor, and implement a construction program to build 750 classrooms
based on these designs and techniques; (b) rehabilitate 3,000 existing
classrooms badly needing repairs; and (c) promote the development of a
community-based school maintenance system.
3.11      Low-cost construction program.  A prototype of a low-cost clase-
room has been developed using local materials (ie. bricks made mainly from
locally available laterite stabilized with 5% cement, compressed by hand-
operated presses). The roofing is based on a vault structure which elimi-
nates the need for timber, and reduces the need for imported metal for
doors and windows. This design - which has already been tried out in
Senegal - is expected to allow for a 25-year economic life with limited
maintenance.
3.12      The construction program would be under the responsibility of the
NENESR Bureau of School Infrastructures and Equipment which vould be
atrengthened under the proposed project (para 3.21). Of the 750 classrooms
to be financed, about 500 would be built by the "travaux communautaires" (a
force account organization under the Office of the President of the
Republic), and about 250 by the "ateliers scolaires" (the workshops of the
inspectorates). Self-help schemes and negotiating contracts with samall
local contractors vould be extensively used in both cases. The "ateliers
scolaires" vould also produce simple furniture for the new and rehabi-
litated classrooms. Prior to the launching of the construction program,
one or more prototype classrooms will be constructed in order to train the
masons of, respectively, the "travaux communautaires" and the "ateliers
scolaires" as vell as the building technicians of the Ministry of Public
Works, placed at the district level, in the use of this new construction
technique.
3.13      The cost per classroom is estimated at about US$5,400 which is
about 55% of that of classrooms made from cement blocks and tin roof
(para 2.6). It is expected that - through developing a replicable low-
cost school design and the skills at the community lev-l required for
construction based on this design -- the project will help speed up the
current trend whereby the main responsibility for primary school construc-
tion is transferred from the Government to local com-munities. Annex 3-4
gives a summary description of the construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance program.



-9-
3.14      The project vould finance:  (a) construction of 750 new primary
school claserooms; (b) production of furniture for these classrooms by the
"ateliers-scolaires"; and (c) local training for masons and building tech~-
nicians. Prior teo negotiations the Goverument (i) bullt and assessed the
prototype of the new construction design, and (il) presented a program for
mason training and for the first year of construction. At the annual
project and sector review meeting (para 3.1), the Government vill discuss
with IDA and agree on the annual construction program, including site
selection. Annual agreement on this program as vell as on the composition
of the education investment program for the coming three years (para 3.1)
vould be a condition for disbursement for classroom construction.
3.15      Primary school rehabilitation.  A recent Government survey showed
that of the some 6,500 primary classrooms in Niger, over 50% need repair.
and that school furniture often is lacking or in poor condition. The
project would rehabilitate about 3,000 classrooms, and repair and/or
replace furniture in these schools. The renovation program would be the
responsibility of the MENESR Bureau of School Infrastructures and Equipment
and vould be carried out by the "travaux communautaires". The project
would finance: (a) material, labor and transport costs for the renovation
of the 3,000 classrooms; and (b) repairs or replacement of the furniture of
these classrooms.  Prior to negotiations the Government presented a rehabi-
litation program for the first year. At the annual project and sector
review meeting (para 3.1), the Government would discuse with IDA ant agree
on the annual rehabilitation program.
3.16      Schonl maintenance system.  The project vould promote the
development of a community-based maintenance system which vould assist
school users in repairing minor damage to furniture and buildings which, If
left unattended, coald require costly repair, and improve the capability of
the "ateliers scolaires" to make any major repairs (para 3.19). To promote.
maintenance by achool users, the project vould finance:  (a) the prepa-
ration of a manual for teachers and achool directors describing the ways
and means of identifying and repairing common minor damages and giving
instructions for reporting major damages to the "ateliers scolaires";
(b) training of teachers in maintenance procedures (para 3.4); and (c) the
provision of maintenance tool kits for schools. During negotiations the
Government gave assurances that school maintenance procedures and manuals
vill be prepared, discussed with IDA and introduced not later than
September 30, 1988, and that maintenance subsequently vill be adequately
supervised by the inspectorates.
3.   Promotion of More Cost-Effective Resource Utilization
3.17      To promote more cost-effective resource utilization the project
vould strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Education (MENESR) to
(a) manage and control the resources at its disposal; (b) plan and monitor
education development; and (c) coordinate the implementation of IDA-
financed education projects.
3.18      Strengthening of human and financial resource management.  The
project vould support the reorganization of mENER (para 2.9) and lmprove
its capacity to manage and control resource utilization in the education
sector. To this end, the project vould, through provision of specialist



- 10 -
services, training and equipment, assist the Government to review and
improve budgeting and administrative procedures, and computerize the
records of the Directorates ln the Ministry responsible for: (a) personnel
management; (b) budget preparation and control; (c) scholarship allocation
and monitoring; and (d) administration of examinations and school guidance.
In addition, the project would train the staff of the inspectorates and
provide them vith essential facilities ln order to strengthen their
capacity to (i) control resource use at the departmental and schoo3 level;
(iL) support teachers and monitor the quality of instruction; and
(iii) execute and supervise primary school construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance. Anaex 3-5 describes the organizational setup of the inspec-
torates and how the support provided by the project vould improve their
performance.
3.19      The project vould finance:  (a) construction of facilities for 16
inspectorates (eight are currently in rented offices and eight are newly
created and vithout facilities) including workshops for seven "ateliers
scolaires"; (b) furniture and equipment for the 16 inspectorates and work-
shop tools for the seven new "ateliers scolaires"; (c) micro-computers for
the Ministry; (d) specialist services in the field of personnel and finance
management and for computerization of records; and (e) training in use of
micro-computers.
3.20      Strengthening of educational planning.  To enhance the MENESR's
capability to plan and monitor education developuent, as vell as to develop
and implement cost-effectiveness measures, the project would, through
provision of specialist services, training and equipment, strengthen the
capacity of the Directorate of Educational Planning (DEP) to: (a) compile,
analyze and publish education statistice; (b) develop and monitor the
implementation of policies promoting more cost effective resource use;
(c) establish 6nd maintain a country-wide school map; and (d) plan snd
supervise school construction and maintenance.
3.21      The project would finance:  (a) civil vorks to renovate an unused
former secondary school dormitory to serve as offices for the DEP's Bureau
of School Infrastructures and Equipment (BIES); (b) furniture, equipment
and two vehicles for that Unit; (c) specialist services in educational
planning including funds for preparation of future education projects;
(d) training in educational planning, statistics and school mapping; and
(e) operating costs for the BIES. Prior to negotiations the Government
(i> issued a decree defining the responsibilities and functions of the
BIES; and (ii) confirmed that the BIES has been strengthened by the
appointment of an architect and three building supervisors snd the purchase
of one vehicle. At the-annual project and sector review meeting
(para 3.1), che Government vill discuss with IDA and agree on the work
program of DEP. Further details on DEP's organizational setup, work
program and project support are given in Annex 3-6.
3.22      Establishment of a prolect coordination unit.  This vould be the
first IDA-financed project to be implemented by MENESR.  To amplify the
institution-building effects of the project, its various components would
be implemented by the concerned MENESR Directorates.  To ensure overall
coordination of project activities and to serve as liaison between the
Governuent and IDA, a Projecet Coordination Unit (PCU) vould be established



a il -
directly under the Ministry's Secretary General.  The Unit would:
(a) assist in the preparation of annual work programa and budgets;
(b) oversee and assist ln the procurement of goods and specialist services
and in the implementatîon of the fellowship program; (c) process credit
withdraval applications and maintain project accounts; and (d) consolidate
project progress reports. The Unit would be headed by a Nigerien director
who vould be asslsted by a specialist in project management and au accoun-
tant as vell as by support staff.
3.23      The project vould finance:  (a) civil vorks to renovate an unused
former secondary school dormitory to serve as offices for the Unit;
(b) furniture, equipment and two vehicles; (c) specîalist services for
project management and audit; and (d) operating cost. Prior to negoti-
ations the Goverument (1) issued a decree establishing the PCU and
appointing the project director; and (ii) confirmed that procedures for
recruituent of the project management specialist and of supportiug staff
have been initiated.
B.   Project Cost and Financing Plan
3.24      The total project cost over the seven years of implementation la
estimated at US$26.2 million equivalent (net of taxes and duties) vith a
foreign exchange component of US$15.1 million or 58%. Base cost estimates
are at December 1985 prices.  The project would b3 financed by IDA (US$18.4
million equivalent or 70% of total cost), a grant from Norway (the equiva-
lent of US$4.7 million or 18%), a grant from the Federal Republic of
Germany (US$1.7 million or 7X), and budgetary allocations from the Govern-
ment (US$1.5 million or 5%).  The grant from the Federal Republic of
Germany vould finance a part of the primary school construction program.
The Norvegian grant vould finance procurement of te~-books and rehabili-
*tation of primary schools including school furniture. The Goverument vould
finance local construction material (laterite and sand) and operating
coste. The major assumptions in arriving at the cost estimates, as vell as
the detailed project costs by component and cost category and the way these
vould be financed are given in Annex 3-7. Details on furniture and equip-
ment are given in Annexes 3-8 and 3-9.
3.25      The savings resulting from the measures included ln the project
are likely to exceed the incremental recurrent costs that the project
generatea in any fiscal year during project implementation. For the firet
year after project completion (1994), the annual cost of operating the 750
classrooms eonstructed and the textbook program developed are estimated at
CFAF 745 million in constant 1985 prices, equivalent to about 4% of the
MENESR's FY 1986 recurrent budget. Of these costs, 80% constitute teacher
salaries.  In 1994, the savings resulting from the project are likely to be
at least 2.6 times the incremental recurrent costs generated (Annex 3-10).
C.   Project Preparation and Execution
1.   Present Statue of Preparation
3.26      Each project component i  supported by an annex and the textbook
(paras 3.7-3.9) and construction components (paras 3.10-3.16) al8s  are
supported by Working Papers.  Designs for the civil works included in the



- 12 -
project have been developed, and the building of the prototype (para 3.11)
vas completed in Auguet 1986. Suitable sites have been identified for the
textbook development, educational planning esd management components.  Site
selection for the annual classroom construction program vill be revieved by
IDA each year (para 3.14). The Government has strengthened the Bureau of
School Infrastructures and Equipuent (para 3.21), and has issued a decree
establishing the Project Coordination Unit and appointing its director.
Prior to negotiations, the Goverament took the measures lîsted in
paras 3.14, 3.15, 3.21 and 3.23. At negotiations, the Csvernment gave the
assurances listed in para 3.1.
2.   Implementation
3.27      Implementation responsibility.  Implementation features of each
project component are further described ln Annexes 3-1 through 3-6.  The
operational responsibility for project implementation would be given to the
relevant MENESR Directorates. The Project Coordination Unit (para 3.22)
vould serve as liaison vith IDA and vould support the Directorates ln the
areas of procurement, financial administration, documentation, monitoring
snd reportiug. The project management is described in Annex 3-11.
3.28      Implementation schedule.  Based on the capacity of the MENESR,
the "travaux communautaires"  ud the "ateliers scolaires" as vell as the
measures taken to expand it, the execution of the project can be realis-
tically scheduled over a five-year period from credit effectiveness, with
allowance for one more year for the closing of the accounts. Hovever,
experience with previous IDA-financed projects in Niger suggests a longer
implementation period. Therefore, implementation of the project has been
prudently planned over a seveu-year period and disbursement over eight
years. This corresponds to the Regional profile for the education sector.
Annex 3-12 gives the implementation schedule.
3.29      Specialist services and fellowships.  The project vould provide a
total of 178 years of specialist services (of vhich 84% by local staff) and
a total of 884 years of training (of vhich 97% by local training and in-
country fellowships). During negotiations, terms of reference for the
specialist po8ts vere agreed upon with the Govetnument and assurances
obtained that Government will require the staff trained abroad under the
project to remain ln their assignment for a period of three years following
completion of training. Details regarding specialist services and fellow-
ships are in Annexes 3-13 and 3-14.

3.31      Because of their relatively small size and the vide dispersion of
classroom construction and rehabilitation, civil vorks contracts totaling
US$9.1 million vould not be likely to attract foreigu firme and would be
carried out on force account or through negotiated contracte with local
artisans (para 3.12) according to procedures acceptable to IDA, or through
contracte avarded following local competitive bidding (LCB) for work
described ln paras 3.9, 3.19, 3.21 and 3.23. Equipment and printing of
textbooks (total value at US$2.7 million) would be grouped to tlie extent
practicable to facilitate competition in bidding; packages of US$50.000
equivalent or more would be awarded after international competitive bidding
(ICB) according to procedures acceptable to IDA. Goods manufactured
local y vould be given a preferential margin of 152 or the applicable
customs duty, whichever î8 less. Procurement packages (announcements,
bidding documents and propos9d avards) exceeding US$50,000 equivalent would
be subject to IDA's review prior to awurd. For contracte valued at between
US$15,000 and US$50,000 equivalent, tvo conformed copies of each contract
vould be subject to post-review by IDA before vithdrawal of funde from the
Credit Account. Contracte valued at less than US$15,000 equivalent vould
be held by the Borrover for review by IDA uuperviîsion missions and for
audit. Specialist services and fellowships would be procured in accordance
vith IDA guidelines. Construction of primary school classrooms for about
US$1.7 million (including school furniture for about US$0.3 million) to be
financed by the Federal Republlc of Germany, vould follow procedures
acceptable to the Republic which are economical and efficient. During
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will apply the
procurement procedures and arrangements outlined above.

a/  The activities included in, respectively, Parts I and Il of the project are explained in
para 3.30.
Annex 3-15 shows the disbursement profile. Annex 3-16 provides a summary
of Government contributions to the project.
5.   Special Account
3.33      To facilitate disbursement,  US$400,000 vould be advanced from
the proposed IDA credit and deposited in a Special Account held in a local
bank and operated by the Project Director. The Special Account would cover
about three months of expenditures. Replenishment applications to IDA
would be grouped into packages of at least US$50,00Q equivalent and be
fully documented, except for expenses related to in-country training, fees,
incremental operating costs, and contracts valued at less than US$25,000
equlvalent. These expenses vould be relabursed against certifled state-
ments of expenditures, for which documentation would be retained for review
by IDA supervision missions and project auditors. Reinbursement applica-
tions woule also include a etatement of account movements since the last
application, vith the balance certified by the bank holding the account,



- 16 -
aend a reconciliation showing that the balance represents the original
amount le8s payments avaiting reimbursement or amall working advances.
Should any disbursements made subsequently be disallowed by IDA, the
Government would redepoait the corresponding amount.
6.   Accounting, Auditin& and Reporting
3.34      The Project Director vould establish and maintain accounts for
each project component. Late submission of audit reports has been experi-
enced in the First Education Project (Cr. 1151-NIP) in recent years.  To
ensure punctuallty, the proposed project provides for specialist services
to audit project accounts. During negotiations, the Government gave
aseurances that: (a) all project accounts wlll be audited annually and all
diebursement against statements of expenditures vill be audited semi-
annually by an independent auditor, acceptable to IDA, and that the audit
reports will be sent to IDA for review vithin six months of the end of the
Government's fiscal year, starting in 1987; (b) the Project Director vill
submit to IDA semi-annual progress reports starting by the period ending
December 31, 1987; and (c) vithin six months of the project closing date a
final reèort on project achievements vill be prepared and submitted to IDA.
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
4.1       Benefits.  The construction of 750 classrooms would permit an
enrollment increase of about 34,000 pupils by 1992 (an increase of about
13% as compared to 1985 enrollments). Moreover, rehabilitation of 3,000
classrooms, restructuring of the teaching force, reduction in construction
cocts, increased participation by local communities in construction and
maintenance, reduction in the volume of scholarships, and improved resource
management ln the education sector are expected to result in considerable
fiscal savings and, thus, in a substantial increase in access to primary
education (para 3.25 and Annex 3-10). In addition, the institution build-
ing supported by the project is expected to provide the basis for a more
carefully planned long-term education development in line with the needs of
the economy and the budgetary resources of the Government. Finally, Most
of the about 251,400 pupils àlready enrolled in public primary school,
vould benefit directly from the project through better trained teachers,
laproved availability, relevance and quality of textbooks and improved
school buildings. Anzex 4 presents an economic analysis of project
benefits.
4.2       Risks.  The project has two main risks.  Firstly, the Ministry of
Education has no experience in implementing IDAlinanced projects, and
inadequate tecluical expertise in low-cost classroom construction.  To
address this problem, the project would equip the Ministry with a Project
Coordination Unit to monitor overal. project implementation, and vith a
Bureau of School Infrastructures and Equipment to implement the construc-
tion and rehabilitation program. Secondly, there is some pressure from
vithin the educational establishrmnt to recruit more costly teachers
("instituteurs") rather than to improve the quality of education through
more cos,-effective measures   It i  expected that-the Government's commit-
ment vitlhin the context of its structural adjustment program to limit the
grouth in recurrent expenditures, vill result in a teacher training and



- 17 -
recruituent policy that will contain the growth ln average-teacher
salaries.  To facilitate the implementation of such a policy the project
would provide in-service training for existing teachers, improve the pre-
service trainlng of "instituteurs-adjoints", and strengthen the EXuistry's
capacity to develvp, procure and distribute textbooks and teachers' guides.
Furthermore, at negotiations the Government gave assurances that it will
recruit and promote teachers in a manner guaranteeing that the percentage
of "instituteurs" teachaing in primary achools does not exceed 14% of total
teachlng staff in such schools throughout the execution of the project. In
the achool year 1985-86, "instituteurs" accounted for 14.6% of the primary
school teaching force.
V. AGREENENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1       Prior to negotiations, the Government:  (a) provided IDA with a
revlew of the experience vith the prototype classroom, a program for
masons' training and for the first year of classroom construction and reha-
bilitation (para 3.14 and 3.15); (b) issued a decree defining the responsi-
bilitles and functions of the BIES and confirmed that the BIES has been
strengthened by the appointment of an architect and three building super-
visors and the purchase of one vehicle (para 3.21); and (c) issued a decree
establishing the Prcject Coordination Unit and appointing the Project
Director, sad confirmed that it had initiated procedures for recruitment of
the project management specialist and of supporting staff (para 3.23).
5.2       During negotiations IDA and the Government discussed and agreed
on the general composition of a three-year education investment program sad
its recurrent cost implications (para 3.1).
5.3       Durinu  negotiations the Government gave assurances that it vill:
(a) not later than June 30 each year, starting in 1987, organize an
annual project and sector review meeting vith IDA (para 3.1);
(b) discuss wvih IDA annually each fiscal year's recurrent budget for
education as vell as discues and agree annually on the compo-
sition of the investment budget for the coming three years
(para 3.1);
(c) recruit and promote teachers in a manner guaranteeing that the
percentage of "instituteurs" teaching in primary schools doos not
exceed 14Z of total teaching staff ln such achools throughout the
execution of the project (para 3.1);
(d) reduce the nominal scholarship budget for higher education by at
least 3.7% per year from FY 1988 through FY 1991, and will not
grant other subsidies for non-academic services to studentge to
compensate for this reduction (para 3.1);
(e) not later than September 30, 1987, discuse and agree with IDA on
the detailed program chosen for the experiment vith double-shift
teaching; start the experiment not later than October 31, 1988;



- 18 -
review with IDA the ongoing results of the program not later than
September 30 each year and take into consideration IDA's com-
menta; and discuse the f-inal results of the experiment and their
policy implications with IDA prior to September 30, 1991 and
agree on subsequent actions (para 3.6);
(f) establish and maintain a publication unit, a training service for
authors of educational publications, and an evaluation service at
INDRAP by December 31, 1987 (para 3.9);
(g) prior to carrying out any new project for the extension of
INDVAP's printing capacity, submit to IDA for commente and
exchange of views an economic and financial study of such project
(para 3.09);
(h) prepare school maintenance proceduree and manuals, discu88 them
vlth IDA and introduce them not later than September 30, 1988 ant
cause the inspectorates to provice adequate maintenance super-
vision thereafter (para 3.16);
(i) require the staff trained abroad under the project to remain in
their assignuent for a peri.d of three years after completion of
training (para 3.29);
(j) apply the procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in
paras 3.30 and 3.31;
(k) cause the project accounts to be audited annually and disburse-
ment against statements of expenditures to be audited semi-
annually by an independent auditor, acceptable to IDA, and
forward the audit reports to IDA for review vithin six months of
the end of the Governient's fiscal year, starting in 1987;
(para 3.34); and
(1) submit to IDA semi-annual project reports starting by the period
ending December 31, 1987, and, vithin six months of the project
closing date, a final report summarizing the project achievements
(para 3.34).
5.4       A condition of credit effectivenesa would be that conditions for
effectiveness of the cofinancing by the Federal Republic of Germany has
been fulfilled.
5.5       A condition of disbursement against the primary achool ccr;truc-
tion program would be agreement each year between IDA and the Government on
the annual program for classroom construction as well as on the composition
of the education investment program for the coming three years (para 3.14).
5.6       Subject to the conditions set fortft il paras 5.1 to 5.4 above,
the project is suitable as a basis for an IDA credit of US$18.4 million
equivalent on standard terms.

REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPNENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC RETURN TO PRINARY EDUCATION Is NIGER
}.        The ObJectives of the Analysis.  No study of the impact of
education on factors such as labor productivity, fertility rates sad health
is available for Niger. Neither i8 there comprehensive research on the
cost and benefits of education.
2.        A simplified cost-benefit analysis, hovever, vas cerried out în
1984 by the University of Dijon vith the objective of examining the optimal
distribution of resources vithin the education sector by estimatiug private
and social returus to different levels of education. This analysis
estimated vage and productivity differentials on the basis of the civil
service salary scale and preliminary data on agricultural incomes.
Alternative estimates are carried out based on alternative assumptions
concerning repetition and completion rates. The principal findings are
that the social return on primary education varies betveen 30% and 15%
(depending on assumptions concerning repetition rates) while returus on
lover secondary, upper secondary and higher education are respectively 6%,
13% and 62.
3.        The Bank staff has reviewed and extended the cost-benefit
analysis carried out by the University of Dijon vith the folloving
objectives: (a) to explain sluggish demand for education in rural areas;
and (b) to test the sensitivity of returns teo costs. In revieving and
extending the University of Dijon analysis, the Bank staff has updated the
baseline information, particularly as concerns rural income on the basis of
a recent household survey and fine-tuned certain technical assumptions on
the basis of more detailed data on the regulations governing civil service
employment.
4.        The Bank Staff Analysis.  Benefit streams have been estimated on
the basis of life-time earuing differentials on the folloving "core"
assumptions:  (a) a 30-year vork life starting at the age of 13 in
agriculture and at age 18 in the civil service; (b) earnings for primary
education leavers vith certification equivalent to those required for
employment at the lowest levels (janitors, messengers) of civil service
(used as a proxy for vage employment as no other reliable data are
available); (c) foregone earnings in agriculture equivalent to estimated
annual income in rain-fed farming from age 24 onvards (half from age 13 to
age 24). These assumptions are conservative in that generally Nigeriens at
the lovest level of public service employment (or equivalent) continue to
vork in, and derive an income from, rain-fed farming albeit reducing their
labor iuput and, tlus, their owm agriculture revenue.  In addition, the
assumptions take no account of primary education impact on less
quantifiable variables (i..., fertility rates, health); these variables are
particularly important in rural areas. Several estimates of the benefit
streams vere carried out on the basis of the "core" assumptions to take



- 28 -                        ANNEX 2-4
Page 2 of 3
account of the probabilities that those sltting for the exaaminatlons have
of (a) obtaining the certificate and (b) finding vage employment.  The
extremes range from urban achool leaver vith certificate and job from age
18 to rural school leaver with only 35% probability of obtaining a
certiflcate and, once certified, ouly 50% probabillty of findlng a job in
vage employment. For achool leavers who do not obtain a job in vage
employment (vith or vithout certificate), life-time earnings vere based on
those in rain-fed agriculture.
5.     - Private cost streams have been estimated equal to parents'
payments for school supplies plus foregone earnings assumed to be half the
annual inccoe in ralnfed farming.  This opportunity cost has been applied
from age il until completion of primary education. It does overstate
foregone earnings because of videspresd underemploymentlin both rural and
urban areas and because youngsters are usually employed vithin the family
farming activities for menial tasks. Ira addition, nov allovance has been
made for on-the-job trainîng costs. The overestimation captures some of
the inefficîencles of the primary education sector. Following standard
practices, the computation of social returns vas made adding public
expenditures to private costs.
6.        The "core" estimates of private and social costs have been
modified to take account of repetition, one of the eost elements most
amenable to quantification. Estimates have been made of private and social
costs concerning primary school pupils with up to four repetitions and vith
age of leaving schools ranging from 13 to 17. No allovance has been made
for distributional objectives even though primary achool leavers who do not
continue their education usually belong to the lover income groups.
7.        In brief, the analysis tends to underestimate benefits and
overestimate coste. Therefore, returns are to be considered minimum
estimates. lu addition, in assessing them, account has to be taken of
that, although no comprehensive estimates of the social discount rate of
Niger has been carried out, social returns on public investments in the
country are considered to be comparatively low.
8.        The Results and Their Interpretations.  Over 20 rate of returna
have been estimated. The outcome of some of the computations is summarized
below:

Private      24% 14% 9%        22% 13% 8%        21% 11% 7%         19% 8% 5%
A - On assumption of 100% probability of both certification and wage
employaent.
B - On assumption of 35% probability of certification and 100% probability
of vage employment.
C - On assumption of 35% probability of certification and 50% probability
of vage employaent.
9.        Firstly, these estimates show that primary education may produce
satisfactory private and social returna; for those who complete the course
and get a job in vage employment, these returns are comparatively high even
in the extreme case of four repetitions.
10.       Secondly, the results indicate that returns to primary education
are sensitive to the quality of education as reflected by the probability
of successfully completing the primary cycle. However, improvement at the
primary achool leaving examination would not necessarily produce higher
social and private returns since the tight labor market situation may cause
the average probability of getting vage employment to decrease.
1I.       Thirdly, and most significant, the analysis suggests a wide
disparity between private and social returns. As both the success rate at
examinations and the probability for obtaining vage employment are much
lover in rural than in urban schools, the estimates under column C above
may be takenW a proxy for returns in some rural areas while those under
column A are more likely to reflect the situation in urban schools. Thus,
in the former, private returns may be as low as 5% whilst in the latter
they may reach 24%. The social returns in u:.`'an areas are high (16%). The
social return estimates for rural areas should be discarded because the
methodology used in the analysis does not take account of primary
education's impact on less quantifiable variables such as increases in
agricultural productivity and in acceptance of improved farming practices
and the differentials in rural incomes.

REPUBLIC 0F NIGER
PRIMARI EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF EDUCATIONAL POLICIES
1.        Background.  To further the education sector dialogue between
Niger and the Bank Group, IDA organized lu November 1984 a seminar in
Niamey to review, together vith Goverument officials, alternative policies
designed to accelerate the development of primary education. The
discussions vere supported by findings derived from an education simulation
model used to study the effects en primary school enrollment of alternative
policies regarding (a) resource allocation both vithin the sector and
between education and other sectors; and (b) unit costs lu primary
education. The discussions continued during IDA missions to Niamey in
February, June and September 1985, and, especially, during a three week
visit to Washington in August 1985 by three high-level officials from the
Ministry of National Education. lu the course of this visit, new and more
comprehensive simulations vere prepared by the Nigerien officials assisted
by IDA staff. These analyses and exchanges of views between IDA and the
Goverument constituted an Important input into the formulation of the
Goverument's Education Strategy (Annex 2-9) and served, in turn, as
background material for the preparation of the proposed second education
project as vell as for the element of the Structural Adjustment Credit
dealing with the education sector.
2.        Assumptions Behind Simulations.  The simulation model used allous
the analysis of the effect on primary school enrollments of changes in the
folloving parameters:
(a) annual rate of growth in the Goverument's recurrent budget (GB);
(b) share of GB devoted to education (EB);

3.        Parameters (a) and (b) goveru the share of the country's
resources devoted to public recurrent expenditures on education, (c)-(h)
govern the allocation of educatinn resources between levels of education
whereas parameters (i)-(m) determîne unit costs in primary education.
Schematically, the model vorks in the following way.  For given initial
values and future annueal growth rates of GB, EB and BUD1 to BUD6, the model
computes as a residual the amount of resources available for primary
education. Next, for given values of paramcters (i)-(m> the model
calculates unit salary cost per pupil in primary education, taking duely
account of the distribution of the teaching force by qualification and by
step in the salary scale for each qualification category. Adding to this
unit salary cost the unit costs for material and administration gives the
total recurrent unit cost for primary education. Division of the total
recurrent budget for primary education on the unit cost thus derived gives
the total number of primary school students that can be accommodated for a
given budget and unit cost.  The model also gives other outputs such as new
entrants to the primary cycle, primary enrollment ratio, teacher
requirement and construction costs.
4.        Lessons.  To study the scope for expanding primary school
enrollment through more effective and efficient use of existing education
resources, a number of simulations vere carried out. The results of eight
of these computations are summarized in Table 1, each highlighting the
effects of diZterent policy packages. The base year for the simulation is
the school-year 1984185, and all eassumptions regarding growth rates in
budgets are in real terms.
5.        Simulation I shows that, if the policies governing intrasectoral
resource allocation and unit costs vere to remain unchanged, even under a
2% annual growth in Niger's education budget, the primary enrollment ratio
vould decline from about 25% in 1984 to 142 in year 2000. A freeze at the
1984 level of the budgets for all other education subsectors, and
allocation of the total 2% annual increase in the overall education budget
to primary education, vould permit increasing enrollments from 251,400 to
376,400, but this vould not suffice to prevent a decrease in the enrollment
ratio (from 252 to 21.4X, confer SDI II).  The remaining simulations show
that, apart from incr.asing the share of government budget devoted to
education (SDI JII), the only vay teo prevent a decrease in the enrollment
ratio is to reduce unit costs, either through reduction in the present
practice of automatic promotion every tvo years (SIM V) or through some

Page 3 of 4
form of double-shift teaching (SIN VI-VIII), or through a combination of
the two.
6.        Finally, the estimated reduction in unit cost obtalned from
limiting the recruitment of new teachers to "instituteurs-adjoints"
(compare SIM III and SIMI IV) is derived by comparing the present situation
where 13% of primary achool teachers are "instituteurs" vith a situation
where all new teachers are recruited as "instituteurs-adjoints".  However,
the share of "instituteurs" in the teaching force has increased sharply in
recent years (Table 2 of Annex 2-2). This means that, if not contained,
this trend Would lead to a share of "instituteurs" in new recruitment
considerably higher than 13% and, consequently, to a considerably stronger
upward pressure on average teacher salaries than suggested by these two
simulations.

REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ANALYSIS OF THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR PRIMARY SCUOOL TEACHERS
1.        Description of Niger's Teacher Training Programs.  Niger trains
its primary school teachers in two types of teacher training programs --
short-cycle programs and long-cycle programs -- both of vhich require
completed junior secondary education as minimum entry requirement. The
short-cycle program last8 for two years, and graduates recelve the
Certificat de fin d'études normales pour instituteurs-adtoints (CFEN-IA),
which gives them the rank of instituteur-adjoint (associated teacher) and
qualifies them to teach in primary schools.  The long-cycle program laste
for four years, and graduates receive the Dipl8me de fin d'études normales
(DFER) whîch gives them the rank of instituteur. Whereas the DFEN
qualifies for primary achool teaching, a substantial number of those
holding this diploma are presently employed in teaching or administrative
posts in junior secondary education. l/ The firet three years of the
long-cycle program have the same curriculum as the lycées, and all students
take the baccalauréat exam.  Those with the best results graduate luto the
School of Pedagogy at the University of Niamey while the others continue
for a fourth year devoted to pedagogical subjects.
2.        Capacity of Teacher Training Colleges.  Short-cycle programs are
provided in three teacher training colleges (located in Dosso, Maradi and
Tahoua) while long-cycle programs are provided in two colleges (Zinder for
boys and Tillabery for girls). To reflect the slowdown in the primary
school enrollment growth in recent years and the resultlng slackEning in
the demand for teachers, the lntake of new students has been reduced and
the five teacher training colleges are currently running below their
maximal enrollment capaclty. One of the three short-cycle achools (Maradi)
is used for i-service training only. It has been estimated 2/ that the
three short-cycle schools could produce a total of at least 540 graduates
per year while the two long-cycle achools are equipped to produce at least
200 more. The output could be increased through improvement of the schools
internal efficiency. For example, with a class size of 40, the maximum
output from the three short-cycle schools (assuming no repetition and
dropout and using all the 40 available classrooms) is 800 graduates.
Il   In the achool year 1984/85, the Ministry of Education had 1,871
instituteurs on its payroll of whîch 900 (48%) vere teaching ln
primary achools.
2/   These estimates are taken from a study conducted by the Ministry of
Plaoning/European Economlc Communlty and are quoted in "Niger -
Education Sector Assessment Report," prepared by the Pragms
Corporation for USAIDÂ April 1984, p. 6-5.

3.        Demand for Primary School Teachers.  Table 2 throws light on the
magnitude of the demand for primary school teachers in Niger until 1991.
The table presents six different calculations representing the need for new
teachers under different hypotheses concerning (a) enrollment growth and
(b) changes in pupil-teacher ratio. The first three rows show the need for
nev recruitment assuming that the pupil-teacher ratio remains constant at
the 1984 level (36.2) throughout the period 1986-1991 while the three last
rows assume that the ratio incroases to 36.5 in 1985, 37.0 in 1986, 38.0 in
1987, 39.0 in 1988 and 40.0 in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The three different
levels of enrollment growth illustrate, respectively, the implications of:
(a)  continuing the average annual enrollment growth of 2.4% observed
during the period 1980-1984;
(b)  achieving an average annual rate of enrollment growth during the
period 1986-1991 equal to that of the population of school age
(4.02), which would permit to maintain unchanged the 1984
enrollment ratio of 25S;
(c)  achieving an average annual rate of enrollment growth of 8S
during the period 1986-1991, which would permit to increase the
enrollment ratio from 25% in 1984 to 33% in 1991.

a/   See explanation in text.
All calculations include an annual vastage rate of 2%. This comparatively
low level of vastage vas chosen because of the young age-structure of the
teaching force (the annual retirement rate would be below 1% for the period
considered) and the fact that the possibilities for alternative vage
employuent tor teachers are likely to be very limited in the foreseeable
future.
4.        Balance between demand and supply.  lI addition to meeting the
demand for nev teachers as indicated in Table 2, the teacher training
facilities have to Cater for the im-service training program financed under
the project. As shown in Annex 3-1 this program vould require 250 places
for each of the three school years 1986/87-1988/89 and 350 places for each
of the two achool years 1989/90 and 1990/91. This would roughly correspond
to the capacity of the short-cycle college at Maradi which is currently
used for in-service training only. Bearing this in mind, a comparison
between the capacity of existing teacher training facilities and the demand
for new primary school teachers shows that:
(a)  If the low enrollment growth experienced between 1980 and 1984
were to continue, the present capacity of the three short-cycle
achools would be more than sufficient to meet the need for both
initial and in-service teacher training. This conclusion would
also hold if enrollment vere to grov at an annual rate of 4%
although the pupil-teacher ratio in primary education may need to
be increased slightly above the. 1984 level towards the end of the
period; and
(b)  If the annual enrollment growth vere to be as high as 8%, steps
vould need to be taken to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in
order for present teacher training capacity to suffice both for
pre-service and in-service training needs. Such an increase
ratio could be achieved through the activities foreseen in the
project to promote more extensive use of multi-grade teaching and
to lntroduce double-shift schooling.

5.        In conclusion, the present capacity of Niger's facilities for
training primary achool teachers îs likely to be sufficient to meet the
country's need for such teachers during the next five years.

REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPHENT PROJECT
TRE GOVERNNENT'S EDUCATION POLICY
-1.       As part of the structural adjustment program being assi8ted under
Credit 1660-NIR, the-Government has developed an education strategy
directed at the principal issues of the sector. The strategy has the twin
objective of preventing that the tight financial constraint would cause a
further decline in the veak primary education base, vhile at the same time
laying the foundations for medium- to long-term developments in line vith
expected resources availability and estimated needs for trained manpower.
2.        The main elements of the strategy vere formulated in the suumer
of 1985 by an Interministerial Committee for Structural Reform, chaired by
the Ministry of Planning, and outlined in a Letter of Development Policy
(LDP) discussed w'th IDA ln connection with Credit No. 1660-NIR; the
relevant sections aze reproduced in the attachment. These elements have
been further clarified at the beginning of the 1985-86 school year when the
Government initiated measures of major importance for positive adjustment
and reform in the education sector. The core of the strategy is the
reduction of co0tS throughout the sector and the redeployment of resources
ln order to reverse the recent decline in the primary education enrollment
rates. To contain the increase in salary costs, the Goverument has agreed
to give priority to the training and recruitment of "instituteurs-adjoints'
instead of the more costly "instituteurs" and to improve the quality of the
teaching force through in-service training of "moniteurs" and "moniteurs
auxiliares". As a firet measure to rationalize and improve planning and
management of the sector, in September 1985, the Government unified
administrative responsibility for education under one single Ministry and
introduced cost recovery measures such as charges for school supplies and
increased tuition fees for private schools.
3.        More significant than these steps are the far reaching reforme
expected to stem from the work of a high-level Education Commission
established ln August 1985 by the Head of the State to review the training,
statue and vorking conditions of teachers. The Commission, chaired by the
President of the National Development Council is made up of representatives
of the education sector, trade unions, opinion makers and rural development
leaders. Bank Group staff has had technical discussions with the
Commlssion. Preliminary indications are that the Commission"s report, due
in the Spring of 1986, vill recommend major revisions in teacher training
and recruitment policies to increase relevance to local conditions and
allow for a gradually lncreasing rate of primary education expansion with
full cognizance of the financial constraint.
4.        In parallel with these policy changes, the Goverument is tackling
the issues concerning the physical facilities at the disposal of primary
education: vith the assistance of consultants financed under
Credit 1151-NIR, it has carried out a survey and formulated a carefully



-42-                        AIO    2-9
Page 2 of 5
de8igned program of low cost construction, rehobilitation sad improved
maintenance.
5.        To provide for the expansion and Improvement of primary
education, cost reductions are being made ln secondery and higper
education.  At the start of the 1985-86 school year, fellowehips vere
reduced by about 15X in real teres as compared vith their level in 1984-85;
in addition, their administration is expected to be improved to ensure that
assistance vill be directed essentially to the needy and able students
baing trained ln aroas required by Niger developuent. Cost reductions are
also expected on the construction aide through the phased implementation of
a acheme to restructure lover secondary education vith African Development
Fund assistance; the implementation of this scheme snd of other investments
planned for secondary and higher education is belng scrutinized ln detail
to fit the resources constraint.
6.        In sum, the Government9s policy and strategy call for positive
adjustment from a amall, costly and essentially elitist education sector
for the few to a more equitable, relevant and efficient system vith an
expanding primary education base and more economical secondary and higher
educatlon to meet clearly identified maupover requirements. Implementation
of this positive adjustment policy needs necessarily to be phased over
several years in line vith strengtheued managerlal and administrative
capability as vell as vith improved resources availability. Although not
yet fully articulated in all their aspects, the Government's policy and
strategy are respo»sive to development needs and deserve support as an
integral part of the broader structural adjustment program.

EDUCATION
13.               In the education sector, Niger is confronted vith a
double iibalance between (i) the current development trends of the sector
and the long-ternm training needs of the country on the one hand, and
(iI) the obiectives of the education system and the economic and financial
realities of the country on the other. This double imbalance has, over
time, been aggravated by the higb unit cost8 of training at all levels and
by an lnefficient allocation of available resources. Notvithatanding the
significant share of the government budget allocated to education (21%),
Niger"s priinry enrollment ratio (25>) 18 one of the veakest ln Africa.
Horeover, although the post-primary enrollment ratio remains poor, the
modern sector of the economy vill not be able to absorb all the graduates.
Concurrent vith the groving unemployment among these graduates, Niger
continues to cope vith a serious shortage of certain categories of mlddle
and higher level technicians.
14.       Conscieus of these lmbalances and of the degradation in the
educational system provoked by the economic and financial criise- the
Goverument has decided to substantially adjust sectoral objectives and
resource allocation.
15.       Absolute priority vill be given to stemuing the decrease in the
enrollment ratio of primary education and, subsequently, to its progressive
increase.  To that effect, the Covernument has decided to postpone its plans
for extending the primary education cycle, to undertake a thorough reform
to improve the effectivenesas of the taeahing staff, to give priority to
training associate teachers, and to adapt the training programs to the
realities of the country.  The Governaent has also decided teo encou:age the
creation ;f primary schools in the private sector and to expand the primary
education capacity througb a lov-cost school construction program, making
better use of local reinturced construction material.  A more rational
utilization of existing infrastructure in the rural areas as vell as the
physical rehabilitation of certain schools vill alseo allow an increase ln
the number of students.
16.       The refoeusing of priorities on primary education vill be
combined vith a deliberate slov-dovn on the expansion of secondary and
higher education. As much as possible, aU  future expansion of secondary
education should be concentrated on the lover leval and pursued through the
decentralized construction of schools, vhich vould reduce drop-out rates,
construction costs and, particularly, unit operating costs, due to fever
needed scholarships.  The qualitative improvement of the teaching staff
vill be pursued through a reform of the teacher training college, vhich is
being prepared, and through retraining of certain teachers.
17.       Access to higher education vill be based strictly on individual
qualifications as vell as on the needs of the economy and tie
admiuistration.

18.       The economic development of Niger vill depend to a large extent
on the availability of technicians and specialized labor.  Nevertheless,
taking into account the high co0t8 of training, the Government vill
carefully assesa the needs of the country before establishing any new
technical and higher level training.
19.       In view of its f nancial constraints, the Government vould not be
able to aliocate a larger share of its resources to the education sector,
especially as far as operation and maintenance are concerned. Assuming
that official development assistance vill finance most of the iuvestments,
operation and maintenance of the system vill have to be financed largely by
the Government and the beneficiaries. The qualitative and quaatitative
improvement of primary education vill, therefore, only be possible to the
extent to which the Government - through a coibination of more efficient
utilization and reallocation of existing resources vithln the sector - is
able to free itself from the constraints of a rigid budgetary ceiling and
rapidly increasing cost8. The folloving measures, vhich aim to realize
savings and to transfer a larger share of operation snd maintenance costs
to the beneficiaries, vill be introduced:
(a)  Construction of primary schools vith local reinforced materiala
and adapted to local conditions, starting ln school year 1985/86
(costs of a classroom vill be reduced from 4.3 million to 2.5
million CFAF).
(b) Construction of small secondary schools, starting in 1985/86.
The unit costs for a school (four classrooms, one administrative
building, a laboratory, and housing for four teachers) vill be
reduced from 280 million to 107 million CFAF.  Moreover, for most
of the students scholarships vill no longer be needed (36,000
CFAF per student per year).
(c)  Participation of the b#neficiaries in the construction and
maintenance of classes (underway).
(d) Gradual restructuring of the teacher staff ln primary education,
emphasizing the training of associate teachers
("instituteurs-adjoints"), vill start in 1985/86 (savings per new
teacher: 261,000 CFAF per year).
(e) Retire from service those teachers recognized as unfit for the
profession (underway).
(f)  Eliminate teaching allovances for administrative staff
(anticipated savings: 72 million CFAF In 1986).
(g) In urban centers, transfer to the parents the cost of school
supplies beginning in 1986/87 (anticipated savings: 64 million
CFAF p.a.).
(h)  A commission has been created to sttdy and revise the scholarship
system, including the amount and conditions of scholarships.
Stipende are no longer being paid during vacations to those
students who have not successfully completed the annual exams.

PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPHENT PROJECT
RESTRUCTURING 0F TUE PRDARY TEACHING FORCE
1.        Background.  Although as many as 84% of Niger's primary achool
teachers are qualified by Government standards, the NESR considers the
quality of the teaching force inadequate. The current attempte to improve
the quallty of thae teaching force through recruitment of high-cost "'Isti-
tuteurs" results i'n a strong upward pressure on average teacher salaries.
Vithout some attempt to restructure the primary teaching force through
changes ln both the recr«itment entry level and the progression and promo-
tion of primary teachers from level to level, the effect on the salary bill
vill be more and more pressing vhlle no real improvements in the effective-
ness of teachers vill have taken place. There is therefore an urgent need
to restructure the primary teaching force.
2.        Objectives. The project aime to support the Government's efforts
ta restructure the primary level teaching force and hence to contain future
Increases in average teacher salaries by limiting the need for high-cost
"instituteurs" through improving the quality of existing teachers and the
pre-service training of qualified but less expensive teachers. Inter-
mediate objectives are to:
<a)  Re-examine and redefine the role and profile of the primary
teacher;
<b)  In the light of the results of (a), to review and revise the
pre-service teacher training system;
(c) To improve the quality of serving teachers through an expanded
in-service teacher training program;
(d) Tighten and improve the upgrading and promotion requirements for
teachers;
(e) Improve the quality of primary achool inspection, control and
pedagogical support &iven by the Inspectorates; and
(f) Develop a capacity for sound management practice at the level of
the 1chools.
3.        Required outcomes.  The required outcome of thls project element
vould be (a) the definition of a new profile and role for primary teachers,
and (b) a restructuring of the composition of the teaching force vhich
vould place lese emphasls on the importance of the "instituteursg, elimi-
nate underqualified "Moniteurs auxiliaires" primary teachers, while at the
sme  time substantially lmproving the quality of currently serving
teachers. The revised teacher training system and restructured teaching
force vill help limit future increases lu average unit costs of primary



-47                          M      ANEX3-1
Page 2 of 7
education by changing the relative importance of instituteurs in the
teaching force and by sloving the overall rate of promotion to this grade.
4.        Strategy.  The project vill support several specialist vorkshops
to upgrade the qualification of key education personnel involved in the
planning and management of priaary teacher training. lu addition, the
sub-component includes specialise seminars for the pedagogical staff of the
inspectorates, the completion of the ongoing upgrading in-service courses
for the unlerqualified but experienced teachers (moniteurs auxiliaires),
and the introduction of a regular In-service refresher course for currently
serving teachers. Details of project activities relating to specialist
workshops and seminars for revision of the pre-service teacher training
system and the definitifn of the nev primary teachers profile are given in
Table 1, while full detalls of the regular in-service upgrading and
training of teachers and school directors are given in Table 2.
5.        Coordination and vanagement.  The coordination and management of
the restru-turing of the primary teaching force includes: supervision and
control of the speciallt seminars and %ortshops on the revision of the
teacher training system and the pre-service teacher training curriculum;
the running of in-service training courses for the inspectorates, the
upgrading of underqualified teachers and the regular in-service retraining
of both teachers and achool directors. These activities vill be coordi-
nated and managed by the Directorate of Primary Education of the Ministry
of Education vhich already has administrative responsibility for the
training of teachers and the primary achool inspectorates. A national task
force to coordinate the above activities and to undertake, vith the help of
short-term international consultants, the revision of the curriculum of the
pre-service teacher training curriculum vill be set up. Key personnel from
the Ministry of Education, Directorate of Primary Education, the five
Primary Teachers Colleges and INDRAP vlll assist in the management of the
teacher training activities and the revision of the certification and
examination program for prlmary teachers.
6.        Costs.  Tables 3 and 4 give suimary information on quantities and
base costs of, respectively, the teacher restructuring and the pre-service
training activities. The cost calculations are based on the following
assumptions:

REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
EXPERIMENTATION WITH DOUBLE-SRIFT TEACHING
1.        Background.  In Niger primary school class size differs markedly
between urban and rural areas. In the former, classes are generally
overcrowded reflecting a strong private demand for education caused partly
by increased rural to urban migration following the recent drought. In
rural areas, classes are comparatively mall due to low population density,
sluggish private demand and out-migration.
2.        At the departmental level, average class-size ranges from 26 in
Diffa to 61 in Niamey; the national average is 41. However, the
urban/rural difference only becomes apparent at the sub-department level.
In the Department of Maradi (departmental average of 41) the average class
size ln the commune (urban area) is 48 while in one of the rural
arrondisements, Dakora, it is 28. At the school level the overcrowding is
more easily identified; in Maradi Commune there are four schools with an
average chas. size above 52 pupils/class. The overcrowding ls particularly
etriklng in the capital city where 48 out of a total of 54 schoole have 55
or more pupils per clase, 13 of which have average class sizes of more than
65. No statistlce are available on clase size by grade vithin each school.
However, average class size of this magnitude suggests some very large
urban classes, especially in the beginning of the primary cycle.
3.        To address the problem of inefficient resource use in rural areas
due to saall class sl2i, the Government has promoted the use of multi-grade
teaching in rural schools. The small average number of classes per rural
school of 3.5 confirms the Government analysis tnat many schoole have
adopted this technique to compensate for the low enrollment by grade,
thereby making more effective and rational use of teachers snd classroome.
To encourage more extensive use of multi-grade teaching, the project would
etrengthen the pré-service training of teachers in this technique and help
identify more primary schools where multi-grade teaching could be
introduced.
4.        The results of the education simulation model (Annex 2-5) show
that one way of responding to the strong demand for education in urban
areas that is both efficient and consistent with the Government's budgetary
constraints, ls to reduce unit costs through the introduction of
double-shift teaching in primary education. This approach has se far not
been applied in Niger.
5.        Objectives.  The overall objective of this project element is to
assist the Government develop and adopt a policy promoting double-shift
teaching which would lead to a reduction ln the salary cost per pupil



~ 54          ~            ANNEX 3-2
Page 2 of 4
through an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio. 1l  To this end the project
would, folloving a careful reviev of different f esible options for
double-shift teaching in an urban primary school enviroument, select for
experimentation a limited number of approaches including one based on a
reduction in the number of hours of instruction in the first three grades
of primary school.
6.        Reguired outcome. The required outcome for this project element
in to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in urban areas through the adoption
by the Government of double-shift teaching for urban primary echools,
suitable to the Nigerien situation.
7.        Strategy/approach.  The strategy adopted is based on an
eight-point program:
(a) Creation of the National Task Force;
(b) Design and preparation of the experiment;
(c) Sensitizing of public, teachers, etc.;
(d) Identification and selection of experimental and control achools,
classes and teachers;
(e)  Training of the experimental teachers through annually organized
vorkshops;
(f) Experimental teaching;
(g) Monitoring and annual quantitative evaluation of the
cost-effectivenesa of experiment; and
(h)  Summary evaluation of the experiment and recorAmendations for
policies regarding introduction of double-shîft teaching on a
large scale in urban areas.
8.        The National Task Force vill be a part-tlme group of four
nationals drawn from the Ministry of Education, INDRAP and one of the
Primary Teacher Training Colleges. They vill be assisted in the design,
preparation and runnaing of the experiment by three consultants: a primary
education curriculum expert, an educational researcherlevaluation expert
and a specialist in school organization and timetabling. Prior to
experimentation the Task Force vill examine the economic, educational and
social consequences of different approaches to double-shift teaching vith
different modela of room-teacher-cohort combinations, reductions In the
number of contact hours at the lover grades, a more rational school
calendar, "rotating" class groupa rather than "home-based" class groups,
and revision in the curriculum to allow reductions in the school timetable
of the lover grades. The experimentation should test a limited number of
such approaches and should be designed so as to allow the Government
sufficient information to choose between the different options.
Il/ It fa recognized that, in schools vith severely overcrowded classes, a
part of the potential for increasing the pupil-teacher ratio through
doubleshift teaching may be used for lovering the class size. In such
cases, the benefits derived from this technique vould be in the form.
of better-quality instruction rather than lover unit costs.

Page -3 cf 4
9.        To ensure that parents, primary pupils, the schools and their
staff understand the reasons behind and the objectives of this experi-
mentation vith double-shift schooling, a short campaigu vili be mnounted to
sensitize public opinion to the importance of the experiment.
10.       The experimentation, vhile liaited to the urban primary schools
in Niamey, vill attempt to have a representative sample of teachers vorking
in different locations vithin the city. Forty currently serving primary
teachers, of different backgrounds, qualifications and grades, vill be
chosen as experimental teachers and vill attend specialist training
vorkshops for seven days each year from 1988 through 1990. The veekly
number of teacher-pupil contact hours, teacher preparation time, pupil
achievement and other relevant indicators vill be measured on a regular
basis and the annual seven-day training in 1989 and 1990 vi}l be used to
introduce modifications and improvements to the experimental teachers.
il.       A detailed monitoring and evaluation procedure vill be adopted
and the achievement of pupils in the experimental classes vill be measured
regularly and compared to a control group. The monitoring and evaluation
of the experiment vill be carried out by the task force with the assistance
of the specialist consultants.  The task force vill produce an annual
comprehensive report on the experiment. The report should be submitted to
the Government and discussed with IDA before the beginning of each achool
year. At the end of the experiment, the Task Force vill produce a final
report vith formal recommendations as to the model of double-shift teaching
suitable for adoption urban primary achools in Niger.
12.       Time-table.  By September 1987, the Task Force vill prepare a
report examining d1fferent feasible approaches to double-shift teaching in
urban primary achools in Niger, and selecting a limited number of
approaches for experimentation. The experiment should start not later than
October 31, 1988, the ongoing results of the experiment should be reviewed
vith IDA not later than September 30 each year, and the final results and
their policy implications should be revieved vith IDA prior to
September 30, 1991.
13.       Administration aud management.  The experimentation vith
double-shift teaching vill be administered by the task force, assisted by
consultants. The task force vill report through the Director of Primary
Education to the Secretary General of the Ministry of Education; however,
members of the task force are expected to liaise with other institutions to
endure a comprehensive and coherent approach, e.g. the evaluation unit of
INDRAP, the curriculum team vorking on the teacher training program, and
Ministry of Education services such as the Planning Dlirectorate. Such
liaison vill be channeled through the Directorate of Primary Education.
14.       Detailed costs.  Details of the quantities, theîr units and the
program over time are given in the attached table. The national task force
members are part-time and vill be paid the standard Goverument research
allovance for the estimated three months per year that they are expected to
devote to the experiment. The 40 teachers selected and trained as
double-shift teachers vill receive the research stipend during the period
of the school year that they function as double-shift teachers. This has
been estiaated as 60% of the total year.

REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TEXTBOOK DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
1.        Background.  At the primary edueation level, the Goveranent
supplies, free of charge, pupil textbooks for French and teachers' guides
for all subjecta. Hovever, the ratio of students per book for French
varies between two and four and the provision of teachers' guides in not
always adequate. Books currently used are, with few exceptions,
unsuitable.  Most were written for the Francophone West African region in
general, moat vere manufactured and published abroad and imported into the
country. Many vere published from 10 to 20 years ago and are often
outdated. The average cost of primary level books te high at 1510 FCFA and
through lack of control over the publishing procesas, no cost/book-life
ratio has been established and the durability of books is poor.
2.        Each year the Directorates of the Ministry of Education
responsible for, respectively, Primary, Arabic and Secondary and Tecbnical
Education, prepare lista of their book requirements for the coming achool
year. The annual requirements are based on the number of pupils, the
previcus number of books distributed, the number of books stored in the
inspectorates and the budgetary allocation. Book procurement ls the
responsibility of the Dlrectorate of Financiai Affaire (DAF) which issues
Invitation each April for the oupply of books to the central varehouse in
Niamey. The Directorate of Primary Education (DEPD) requires that books be
consolidated into separate cartons for each of the primary inspectorates.
The DAP cails in the lorries of the primary inspectorates, repaira and
services them and supplies them with fuel to deliver books, other achool
supplies and equipment to all the inspectorates. Distribution of books and
other supplies from the inspectorates to the achools is the responsibility
of the district inspectors; however, different means are necessary,
including collection by the head teacher, delivery by the inspector or the
sous-prefet.  Recent annual expenditures on the current textbook program
included 140 million FCFA for about 92,000 primary level books and 11
million FCFA on repaira, service and fuel costs fer the textbook related
activities of the inspectorates' transport.
3.        Since educational publishers are overwhelmingly foreign,
Nigeriens have not had the opportunlty to develop the specialized skills
involved In planning, writing, editing, revising, designing, illustrating,
producing and promoting the correct use of textbooks and teschers' guides.
A fev books have been vritten by Nigeriens for Niger, however often the
author is given as the National Institute for Pedagogical Documentation,
Resea,ch sad Promotion (INDRAP) and the publishers have been French because
the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) has financed these publications.
Teachers are not using some books as efficiently as they might in the
classroom as they have received insufficient training in the use of books
as te4ching aida.

4.        %Jectivee.  The overall objective of tkts project element te to
*ouure that the project camopeents aimed at reducing unit recurrent and
capital co«te do not tapair .ducatioual quality. The project element vill
therefore (æ) dev.lop a national capability to create nev textbooks aud
teachers' guides where no suitable materials exist, and to adapt such
suitable imported materials vhose adaptatton rights way be acqulred, ed
(b) strengthen the capabilities to procure, store and distribute training
materials.
5.        More specifically, the project aims at:
(a) adding about 940,000 puplS textbooks and 66,000 teachers' guides
to the books already in use in primary school, and to make them
iore educatioually and culturally appropriate;
(b)  training teachers lu the classroom use of the noew books and lu
the managem_nt of physical resources;
(c) developing a national capacity for a future improved book
provision by training local staff in the planning, developeent,
vriting, revision, editing, design, illustration and production
cf educational books, thereby creatiug sn infrastructure for
local publishing able to respond to future needs;
(d)  strengthening the existing distribution system through
iprovement of varehousing, transportation and staff;
(e) safeguarding available books through the provision of suitable
storage facilities at prlaary school inspectorates and in
classorom*.
6.        Repuired outcome.  To ensure that a nucleus of competence is
created in educational publishing and that, by the end of the project, one
textbook betweeu tvo pupils i available in primary echools, in at least
flve core subject areas.
7.        StratogyfApproach. The textbook element of the project covers
three main groupe of activities:
(a)  Textbook development, adaptation sud publsihing:  developuent
over thes modium teir of a wanagerial and tecinicai capability
vithD IN DRAP to adapt such suitable imported materials vhose
adaptation rights may be acquired and to create new book$, for
teachers or pupils, where not suitable materials exist, in the
core subjecte - French, math, science, geography and hlstory;
(b) Textbook proecurement and distribution: strengthening the
capabilities to procure and distribute textbooks and teachersi
guides; and
(c) Textbook storage: iprovement of storage for textbooks at the
central, district and clasaroom level.

programmes de constructions scolaires (CS) du MENESR. Il est
aussi responsable de l'établissement de normes pour les CS et de
leur application dans les écoles tant publiques que privées; la
préparation et du suivi des programes de grosses réparations; et
la représentation du NENESR à la Commission de l'Urbanisme;
(b) Travaux Publics (TP) Les TP réalisent sur demande du BIES les
constructions secondaires et supérieures pour le compte du
MENESR. Ils disposent de personnel qualifié détaché dans les
Arrondissements (voir par. (e) ci-dessous);
(c) Travaux Communautaires (TC). Les TC sont une entreprise d'Etat
placée sous l'autorité de la Présidence et chargée de la
construction de bâtiments sociaux. A ce titre, les TC
construisent les écoles primaires financées par le budget
national, à la demande et sous le contr8le du BIES.
Présentement, leur capacité de réalisation est de 100 à 150
salles de classe par an. Au temps du boom de l'uranium, la
capacité des TC pouvait atteindre 4 ou 500 salles de classe par
an. Depuis, leurs moyens comme le budget ont diminué.
Cependant, leur compétence technique et logistique reste
qualitativement élevée. Les TC font généralement sous-traiter
les travaux de construction par de petites entreprises ou des
tâcherons auxquels ils procurent et livrent les matériaux, et
surveillent l'exécution. De maême, les TC s'occupent des grosses
réparations demandées par le BIES;

(d) Ateliers Scolaires (AS). Les AS sont rattachée aux Inspectorats
pour assurer des services de maçonnerie et de menuiserie Tois et
m6tal, surtout réserves à la construction de table-bancs et autre
mobilier. Les AS sont sous utilisés présentement. surtout les
maçons, par manque d'outillage, de matière première et
particulièrement de direction technique.
(e)  Conseils Sous-Régionaux de Dévelopement (CD). Les intérgts des
Communautés Locales sont représentés aux CD qui sont charges de
récolter la Taxe d'Arrondissement (450 FCFA par habitant
non-scolarisé et de 14 ans et plus). Le produit de cette taxe
annuelle est utilisé suivant les besoins de la communauté et sur
décision du CD à des réalisations prioritaires telles que
dispensaires, puits et salles de classe primaires. Le CD est
formé des agents techniques de l'Arrondissement, dont
l'Inspecteur scolaire, et placé sous la présidence du
Sous-Préfet; il gère un budget annuel variant de 50 à 100
millions de FCFA suivant la population. Jusqu'à 20 salles de
classe par an peuvent être réalisées par de petites entreprlses
locales sous la surveillance des agents TP des Arrondissements.
C'est le choix des CD parmi d'autres besoins qui en détermine le
nombre.
3.        Le coQt de construction varie selon les techniques de
co&struction eiployés, comme suit:
(a) Constructions "en dur". Ce sont les bâtiments correspondants aux
normes NEN!<R. Les murs sont en parpaings de 20cm d'épaisseur
enduits de deux faces sur un plan de 9,40 x 7,40m, soit 63m2
utiles. Les murs sont reliés par des chatnages en béton armé
verticaux et horizontaux. La toiture est formée de bacs en
aluminium posés sur des profils en acier IPN. Un plafond
suspendu en bois contreplaqué protège la salle de la chaleur
diurne due au rayonnement solaire sur la toiture. Le sol est
constitué d'une chape de ciment posée sur une dalle de béton.
Les fenêtres sont en menuiserie métallique à perslennes. En 1984
le coût d'une salle de classe construite en dur était de 3,7
million FCFA ou 57.800 FCFA/m2. Environ 70X du coût représente
ls matériaux importés. Environ 44S des constructions primaires
a_    r sont "en dur".
(b) Constructions "en semi-dur". M>me caractéristiques que sous (a)
mais, par économie, les parpaings sont remplacés par des blocs de
banco (terre malaxée avec un peu de paille et de l'eau,. et séchée
au soleil). En conséquence les enduits de ciment intérieurs et
extérieurs sont fixés par des treillis agrippés au banco pour
assurer leur adhésion. En 1985, le coGt d'une salle de classe
construite en semi-dur était de 2,6 millions FCFA. Environ 29%
des constructions primaires au Niger sont "en semi-dur." Les
constructions "en dur" et "en semi-dur" sont financées par des
fonds publics, dont 10-15% par les CD.
(c) Autres types de constructions. Il s'agit des salles de classe
construites par les populations soit en banco, soit en paille -



-65 -                   ANNEX 3-4
Page 3 of 12
les paillotes. Le plan est généralement limité en largeur à
4-5m, en raison des portées obtenues par le bois de ronier
(palmier résistant aux termites environ 5 à 6 ans, mais de plus
en plus rare) ou en bois de brousse. Sur une longueur de 9mp le
nombre des table-bancs est réduit à 14, ce qui oblige à serrer 3
élèves par table au lieu de 2 normalement. Le banco est le
matériau usuel des habitations. Les murs ont 40cm d'épaisseur et
la toiture plate est également recouverte d'environ 23cm de
banco. L'écoulement des eaux de pluie est assuré par des
barbacanes en tôle. Le confort de ces habitations est excellent
grâce à l'inertie thermique du matériau, répondant au climat du
Niger. Ces bitiments peuvent durer longtemps à condition que les
habitants prennent constamment soin de faire les réparations
nécessitées par les attaques de termites ou par l'érosion durant
la saison des pluies. Environ 16% des salles de classe au Niger
sont construt.tes en banco. Les paillotes ont les memes
caractéristiques en plan mais sont précaires. On les qualifie de
temporaires. Si elles ne sont pas remplacées par des structures
plus durables, elles doivent itre refaites chaque années après la
saison des pluies pour la rentrée scolaire. Ces salles de classe
abritent au Niger environ 11% des classes du primaire. Il est
difficile d'en estimer le coût. Leur valeur nominale est peu
élevée: de l'ordre de 100.000 FCFA pour les paillotes et
5-700.000 FCFA pour les salles de classe en banco. Cependant
leur valeur réelle est plus élevée dans la mesure où ces
bâtiments sont à refaire entièrement chaque année pour les
paillotes et partiellement pour ceux construits en banco. C'est
pourquoi les populations demandent leur remplacement.
4.        D'autres modes de construction bien adaptés au climat et
cohérents avec lez cnditions économiques du pays ont été développés
récemment au Niger:
(a)  Tamazalak (région Agades).  Il stagit d'un ensemble construit
pour un centre de formation agricole de base, réalisé sur le mode
de construction en banco traditionnel mais protégé par des
enduits de ciment grillagé pour les murs et pour la toiture par
une chape cimentée. Le tout repose sur des fondations de béton
léger sur un compactage de rocs. L'ensemble est mieux protégé
contre les intempéries que la construction traditionnelle.
Cependant, comme pour ces dernières, les portées sont franchies
par du bois, matériau de plus en plus rare et limitant la largeur
des espaces couverts. Le coût en 1982/83 était de 15.000 FCFA/m2
avec un financement suisse;
(b)  V,linque (N-E Niamey).  Réalisation de divers bâtiments pour le
projet "Tapis Vert". Conçu pour développer la protection des
arbres et la reforestation, ce projet se devait entre autres
d'encourager des méthodes de construction permettant d'éviter
l'emploi du bois. Ce sont les concepts développés par le célèbre
architecte égyptien Hassan Fathy qui ont été appliqués. Les
qualités de résistance à la compression du banco sont mises à
profit pour couvrir les portées entre murs par des d^mes, des
arches et des voutes. Des maçons locaux ont été formés à ces



-66-                 AMM  3-4
Page 4 of 12
techniques, qui ont été ensuite répétées dans un autre projet de
protection de l'environnement, dans la région d'Iferouane. Les
rapports mentionnent des coGts faibles, mais sans précisions.
(Financement canadien et Wl)>
(c) Habitat à Niamey. Le projet a été financé par l'USAID pour
réaliser des prototypes de logement à coOt réduit en recherchant
l'emploi maxifam de matériaux locaux, tout en assurant une
durabilité plus grande que celle de la construction
traditionnelle en banco.  Ici aussi les d8mes, arches et voûtes
ont été utilisés afin d'éliminer le bois, et le banco a été
remplacé par la latérite stabilisée avec 5% de ciment et pressée.
Cette solution tout en minimisant les problèmes d'érosion, permet
d'éliminer les enduits, sauf pour le revatement de toiture.
L'expérience a été conduite par les services des TP. Le coût
incluant la formation des maçons et les essais de résistance en
laboratoire a été en 1983 de 27.000 FCFA/m2. Ces projets
démontrent l'intérat que porte le gouvernement du Niger au
développement de méthodes de construction artisanales visant
l'emploi des matériaux locaux améliorés.
5.        Stratégie proposée par le projet.  Présentement le BIES ne peut
s'acquitter que de la partie administrative de ses taches, faute de
personnel technique qualifié. Le projet prévoit en plus de l'architecte
spécialiste l'adjonction au personnel de troîs techniciens (profil TP)
chargés de normalisation et conception; préparation, procédure technlque
des marchés; et contr8le et supervision. Ce personnel sera équipé et doté
de moyens de transport. Cependant il est évident que ce personnel n'aura
jamis la capacité d'assurer toute la surveillance requise par la
construction de salles de classe primaires par définition très dispersées.
Ils ne pourront le faire qu'avec la collaboration coordonnée d'agents TP
d'Arrondissement déjà chargés de la surveillance des travaux financés par
leur CD respectifs.
6.        Vis-a-vis do NMESR, les TP n'interviennent en principe que dans
la réalisation des bStiments d'enseignement secondaire et supérieur. Mais
en ré' 'ité, ils interviennent également par le truchement des agents TP
d'Ar, :>.dissement dans la réalisation de salles de classe primaires lorsque
celles-ci sont financées par les CD. Dans ce cas les agents TP sont
compétents pour préparer et faire passer les marchés avec les petites
entreprises locales. Après approbation des marchés, ils assurent la
surveillance des travaux. L'inspecteur scolaire de l'Arrondissement
propose la localisation des nouvelles salles de classe au CD et se charge
d'obtenir du NEDESR que des enseignants soient attribués aux salles de
classe approuvées, qui d`s leur mise en service, seront recensées dans ses
rapports annuels. Compte tenu de la faible proportion (environ 10%) des
salles réalisées à ce niveau d'autorité, il reste une réserve de
compétences que le projet s'efforcera d'utiliser pour augmenter les
ressources limditées du BIES. Avant tout le projet offrira, par le
prototype de salle de classe primaire et le cours de formation auquel
participeront les agents TP des Arrondissements, un modèle avantageuw que
les CD seront encouragés à utiliser pour leur propre programme.

Page 5 of 12
7.       Les ateliers scolaires (AS) placés sous l'autorité des
inspecteurs manquent généralement d'outill4ge et de matière première. Mais
surtout leur travail s'effectue souvent en dehors de toute surveillance
technique. Le projet s'efforcera de remédier à cette lacune en établissant
un lien par l'intermédiaire de l'inspecteur entre les agents TP de
l'Arrondissement et le travail de l'AS concerné. Les maçons des AS
suivront la tme formation que les agents TP, et en meme temps qu'eux, sur
les méthodes de construction du prototype développé pendant la préparation
de projet. Les agents TP assureront l'encadrement et la surveillance des
travaux de construction de salles de classe exécutés par les maçons de l'AS
et assignés par le BIES qui fera assurer l'achat et la fourniture des
otlitillages et matériaux de provenance commerciale. Les matériaux locaux
(latérite, sable et gravier) seront fouruis par les villages recevant les
nouveaux batiments.
8.       Les Travaux Comunautaires (TC) en dépit d'une baiese de capacité
depuis les années du boom de l'uranium, ont conservé leur compétence
technique et logistique. Cependant, comme les autres parties prenantes,
ils ont utilisé jusqu'a présent un modèle de construction coûteux, à base
de maté5riaux importés, et inadapté aux conditions climatiques et
économiques du Niger. Le projet leur offre un nouveau modèle qu'ils auront
pu étudier lors de la réalisation du prototype et pendant le cours de
formation également. Sur les 750 salles de classe à construire par le
projet, le BIES leur en fera réaliser 500-les 250 autres seront
construites par les AS. Les TC serort aussi chargés de faire exécuter les
réparations de 3.000 salles de classe existantes endouagées, dont la
technique "en dur" ou "en semi-dur" leur sont familière.
9.       Construction des nouvelles salles de classe. Le plan est de 6.8m
x 9.2m utile, soit de 1.5a   1.2m2 pour 40 à 50 élèves. Il comporte 6
fenetres et 2 portes selon les normes du NISR.  De plus, la salle de
classe est équipée d'un tableau noir peint incorporé et d'un placard à
c8té. La technique de construction répond aux objectifs suivants:
élimination du bois dans la structure; inertie thermique suffisante pour
neutraliser les effets du rayonnment solaire et de ce fait élimination de
tout second oeuvre tel que plafond; durabilité, et dureté suffisante des
matériaux pour permettre un ancrage solide des scellements; réduction
autant que possible des matériaux importés; matériaux abondants dans le
pays; technique de construction siple à acquérir au moyen d'une courte
formation à la portée des maçons et tâcherons locaux. A ces fins, pour le
modèle adopté et expérimenté sur prototype, on s'est inspiré des avantages
des réalisations en service au Niger, mentionnées au par. 4 ci-dessus.
10.      L'élimination. du bois dans la structure  tout en mialmisant
l' emloi de mat riaux  ort s est r aMis e par 1utilisation d'arches pour
franchir la portee transversale, et de voûtes pour couvrir les espaces
entre les arches, soit 3 fois 2.80m. Le tout est épaulé par des
contreforts. Le dôme a été évité car il est difficile à réaliser
artisanalement pour couvrir de plus grands espaces simples que de l'ordre
de 4m, mieux adapté k l'habitation qu'à des salles de classe. L'inertie
thermique est oircenue par des murs d'une épaisseur de l'ordre de 30   40cm
de toute façon nécessaire pour la stabilité. De plus une orientation
obligatoire des batimets N-S permet d'éviter la pénétration des rayons du
soleil à l'intérieur. Le matériau le plus abondant est généralement la

Page 6 of 12
latérite (également utilisée pour la construction des routes). Stabilisée,
selon l'expérience des TP. par l'adjonction de 5% de ciment pour la
superstructure (10% pour les fondations) et comprimée sous forme de briques
29/10/14 par ex. au moyen d'une presse à main, elle offre la durabilité et
la dureté nécessaires pour éviter les enduits et permettre de bons
scellements. Les m&ies résultats peuvent être obtenus en stabilisant et en
pressant le banco sur les lieux ot ce matériau est accessible. Les
fenêtres et les portes soit d'accès soit de placard sont réalisées
artisanalement en menuiserie métallique persiennée selon le modèle familier
au Niger. Par économie, le sol est prévu en latérite compactée.

Soit, pour une surface construite de 70m2 et une valeur d'environ 26.660
FCFA/m2 ou $EU 77/m2.
12.       Le stockage des matérikux ne posera pas trop de problèmes.  Les
matériaux seront fournis annuellement aux TC et aux AS. Les TC disposent
de leurs propres entrepôts centraux et de leurs propres moyens de
transports. Compte tenu de la très faible quantité des bâtiments à
exécuter annuellement par les AS individuels (2 par maçon) les moyens de
stockage dont ils disposent seront suffisants pour les matériaux qui leur
seront l.vrés directement.
13.       Réparation de salles de clasne existantes.  En dehors des salles
de classe construites en banco ou les paillotes censées être réparées par
les populations concernées, les bâtiments "en dur"t et "en semi-dur"
endommagés sont classés en deux catégories de réparations suivant la
gravité des dégats: (a) petites réparations, et (b) grosses réparations.
Les petites réparations seront réservées à la moitié du programme et
comprendront principalement la réfection des peintures et, surtout pour les



-69-                         ANNEX 3-4
Page 7 of 12
bâtiment8 "en semi-dur", la reprise des scellements des portes et fen#tres,
et des chapes. Les grosses réparations pour l'autre moitié comprendront,
en plus des interventions précédentes, les remises en état visant des
dégâts structurels tels que toitures partiellement arrachées; murs
fissurés; et/ou affouillements partiels dus aux eaux de ruissellement
(souvent résultant d'une erreur d'implantation). Les interventions seront
à justifier par une utilisation intensive des batiments. Les dégâts
majeurs et irréversibles devront entratner une procédure de rewlacement et
de révision de l'implantation.
14.       Le BTES sera responsable du programme de réparation.  Il établira
les listes d'interventions annuelles qui seront à faire approuver par le
MENESR. Les critères de choix devront tenir compte du groupement des
localisations pour faciliter l'accès et l'approvisionnement. Le BIES
assurera la préparation technique des marchés de fourniture et de livraison
des matériaux. Le BIES préparera et négociera les contrats annuels de mise
en oeuvre et de surveillance avec les TC. Les travaux seront faits par des
tâcherons engagés par les TC, qui approvisionneront les chantiers par leurs
propres moyens de transport.
15.       Il va de soi que dans le cadre du projet, les procédures de
passation de tous les marchés suivront les directives a appliquer selon
l'Accord de Crédit par la Direction du projet.
16.       Le coût de réparation d'une salle de classe est estimé à 92.270
FCFA pour les petites réparations (dont 8% de main-d'oeuvre et 8% de
transports). Pour les grosses réparations, le coût est estimé à 142.400
FCFA (dont 18% main-d'oeuvre et 5% de transports).
17.       Tableau Récapitulatif des Coûts.  Le Tableau 1 donne un résumé
des quantités et cots de base du programme de construction scolaire
financé par le projet. Des informations correspondantes sur les programmes
de rénovation et d'entretien sont données au Tableaux 2 et 3
respectivement. Le Tableau 4 donne les coûts unitaires estimatifs pour
l'ensemble des travaux de construction financés par le projet.

PRIMAIY EDUCATION DEVELOPHENT PROJECT
SUMN&RY OF SUPPORT TO STRENGTREN RUMAN
AuD FINANCIAL RESOURCE NANAGDERNT
1.        ObMective.  To enhauce NESR's capabilities lu the area of human
and financial resource mangement the project vould reinforce (a) prtimary
school inspectorates; sud (b> NINESR Directorates respousible for buman and
finncial, resource umagemant.
Reinforcement of Primary School Inspectorates
2.        Eack  ound. Vithin the MENESR tbe Directorate of Preschool and
Primary  ducation or.ction de l'enseignement pré    !aire et du premier
degré-DEPD) is respousible for mauaging priaary education. This task is
largely carried out through a network of 35 primary achool inspectorates
(one in each district or "arrondissementn) including seven which bave the
statue of departmental inspectorates (confer Chart 1). Eight of the 35
inspectorates vere established at the start of school-year 1985186 and are
so far not operational as they lack required physical facilities.  Another
eight inspectorates are lodged in rented facllities.
3.        The creation of the eigbi nov inspectorates reflects au effort oun
the part of tIe Goverument to improve its support to and control of rural
primary schools througb a further decentralization of the existing
inspectorate staff. The distribution of this staff by inspectorate li
given la Chart l.  At the end of the school-year 1984185. the inspectorates
had a total of 300 staff (32 inspectors, 59 pedagogical advisors, 70
primary sachool teaciers performing administrative and supervisory tasks,
and 39 administrative support staff. The inspectorate staff haudle
personnel matters, advisc on curriculum and supervise teachers, collect
education statistics, and decide ou construction of nov classrooms. lu
addition, 18 i»spectorates have vorkshops ("ateliers scolaires") totalling
113 skilled staff - carpenters, electricians, painters and asons - and
about 50 unskilled laborors. The vorkshops produce and repair school
furniture. They vill also play a key role in the construction of 250
classroome under thus project and in the school maintenance program
(Aunez 3-4).  Seven of these 18 vorkshops lack buildings asd equipment sad
four others are ouly partially equipped.
4.        Strate*. The project vould assist the MENISR in strengthening
the primery school iuspectorates sad thereby iaproving their capability to
(a) control the use of resources at the departuental sad school level; (b)
support teschers sad monitor the quality of instructicn; and (c) initiate
and supervise school construction, rehabilitation ' td maintenance financed
throngh the project as vell as by local communities.
5.        Xeaso.  The project vouLd finance:  (a) construction of office
facilities (Mludtng storage rooms for textbooks) for 16 inspectorates,



- 76 -                        ANNEX 3-5
Page 2 of 6
lodgings for 14 inspectorates, and vorkshops for seven "ateliers
scolaires"; (b) furniture for the 16 inspectorate offices and 14
inspectorate lodgings, equipment for the 16 newvinspectorates and tools for
the seven new inspectorate vorkshops and additional tools for four existing
workshops; (c) eight lorries and 16 landrovers (eight of these vill be
reserved for the nev insepetoraes while the remaining 18 vill be allocated
to existing inspectorates as needed); sad (d) 10 staff months of local
seminars to train inspectorate staff în administrative matters. Summary
information on quantities and base cosets of support provided by the project
la given in Table 1. Purther details concerning the construction,
including architectural dravinge, are given in Working Paper No. 2.
Annex 3-8 gives details on furniture, Annex 3-9 on equipment and Annex 3-14
on the trianing of inspectorate staff. The Directorate for Primary
Education vill be responsible for managing the implementation of this
sub-component (Annex 3-11).
Reinforcing the MENESR Directorates Responsible for Resource
Management
6.        Background.  MENESR employs about half of Niger's permanent civil
servants and manages about 21% of the Government's recurrent budget. The
development of MENESR's managerial, administrative and analytic capacities
have not kept pace with the growth in aize and complexity of the education
sector. To create a more efficient administrative structure, the Govern-
ment established in late 1985 the MENESR by merging the former Ministry of
Higher Education and Research vith that of National Education. Hovever,
while this action promotes ;. more efficient use of administrative personnel
-- MNEbESR has 10 directorates as compared to 13 in the former two
Ministries (Anne% 2-8) -- and facilitates a better coordination of overall
educational development, MENESR lacks the trained personnel and equipment
required to improve its budgeting and management procedures.
7.        Strategy.  The project vould assist in strengthening the NENESR
directorates responaible for (a) personnel management; (b) budget prepa-
ration and control; (c) acholarship allocation and monitoring; and
(d) administration of examinations and achool guidance. To this end the
project would review and improve budgeting and administrative procedures
and computerîze the records regarding personnel, finance, equipment,
furniture, scholarships and examination reaults.
8.        Means.  The project would finance (a) six micro-computers
(including equipment for emergency pover supply), one each for the
folloving six Directorates 1/: Directorate of Preschool and Primary
Education, Directorate of Secondary and Technical Education, D:rectorate of
Financial Affaire, Directorate of Administrative and Legal Affai a,,
Directorate of Examinations and School Orientation and Directorate of
Righer Education; (b) furniture; (c) 60 staff months of scholarships abrôad
in the areas of computer sciences and personnel and finance management;
1/   In addition, three micro-computers vill be provided for the
Directorate of Educational Planning and Programming (Annex 3-6) and
one for the Project Coordination Unit (Annex 3-11).



- 77                         ANNEX 3-5
Pige 3 of 6
(d) a total of 21 staff months of local training for MENESR staff initi-
ating them in the use of micro-computers; and (e) 36 months of short-term
consultants' services to assist ln (i) revievlng and revising MENESR's
personnel management procedures; (iI) reviewing and revising MENESR's
financial management and budgeting procedures; and (iiî) computerizing
MENESR's records. The last item would include the following steps:
determining computerization needs, selecting hardware and software, instal-
ling the micro-computers and providing on-the-job training in their use for
MENESR staff (following the initial training provided under point (d)
through locally organized courses), and computerizing the records on MENESR
teaching and non-teaching personnel, expenditures, equipment, acholarahips
and examination results. It ia expected that a team of three consultants
(one system analyst, one expert in personnel management and one expert in
financial management) vould assist in carrying out these tasks during
several short-term missions during 1987 and 1988.
9.        Sumuary information on quantities and base costs of support
provided by the project is given in Table 2. Table 4 of Annex 3-4 gives
details on construction, Annex 3-8 on furniture, Annex 3-9 on equipment,
Annex 3-13 on specialist services and Annex 3-14 on local and foreign
training. The Directorate of Planning and Programming (DEP) will be
responsible for managing the implementation of this sub-component
(Annex 3-11) assisted as described above by short-term consultants.

PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY 0F SUPPORT TO STRENGTHEN EDUCATIONAL PLANNING
1.        Objective.  To enhance MENESR's capability to plan and monitor
development of the education sector as well as to develop and implement
cost-effective uieasures, the project would reinforce the Directorate of
Educational Planning and Programming (Direction des Etudes et de la
Programmation-DEP).
2.        Back£round.  The DEP is organized into three different bureaus
(Chart 1): the Bureau of Research, Planning and Programning (BRPP), the
Bureau of Statistics and School Napping (BSCS); and the Bureau of School
Infrastructures and Equipment (BIES). The functions allocated to each of
these three bureaus and to the office of the Director are sumuarized in
Chart 2. Presently the BIES exists only on paper, and the two other
bureaus do not even have the limited staff shown in Chart 2. A substantial
part of the work carried out by DEP is performed by the Director.
3.        Strategy.  The project vould setrengthen DEP's capacity to (a)
compile, analyze and publish timely and reliable education statistics; (b)
establish and maintain a country-wide school map covering all levels and
types of education; (c) prepare and monitor the implementation of policies
promoting more cost-effective resource use; and (d) plan and supervise
school construction, rehabilitation and maintenance.
4.        Work Program.  Within the general framework given in Chart 2,
during project implementation the three Bureaus of DEP vould complete the
following tasks:
(a) review and improve the registers on pupils kept by schools and
revise the questionnaires used for collection of statistice from
the schools; train the staff at the achool and inspectorate
levels to maintain the registers and complete the questionnaires;
computerize the processing of education statisties; train the
staff at the central level in the analysis of education
statistice; and publish annually a yearbook of education
statistices covering all levels and types of public and private
education and including data on pupils, teachers, physical
facilities, examination results as vell as on cost and financial
aspects;
(b) establish and maintain a country-vide school map cscvering all
levels and types of education;
(c) conduct quantitative studies in support of policy reforms,
including the following: (i) factors governing unit costa in
primary. secondary and higher education; (ii) public finance and
equity impact of coat recovery achemes for textbooks and ochool
supplies; (iii) supply of and demand for primary and secondary
achool teachers; (iv) scope for extending the use of multigrade

Page 1 of 5
REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PRINARY EDUCATION DEVELOPhENT PROJECT
PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
1.        Project costs are based on November 1985 prices-updated to
reflect a change in the exchange rate from FCFA 385 - US$l at appraisal to
FCFA 345 - US$1 at negotiations. Cost estimates for the primary school
construction program are based on the development of a prototype of a loy-
cost classroom using local materials and labor. Cost estimates for the
school rehabilitation prograu are based on a Government survey of the
quality of existing classrooms. The details behind the cost estimates for
the construction and rehabilitation programs are explained in Annex 3-4.
Cost estimates for the other civil works components (extension of INDRAP,
construction of inspectorate offices and lodgings, renovation of DAF vare-
house for textbooks as vell as of offices for the School Construction Unit
and the Project Coordination Unit) are based on comparable civil works
completed recently; further details are given in Working Paper No. 2.
2.        The average co0t per moath of internationally recruited
specialist services is estimated at US$10,000 for long-term services and
US$12,500 for short-term services. Scholarships abroad are costed at
US$2,200 per month. Annex 3-1 explains the assumptions behind the costing
of local specialiats and locally arranged seminars.
3.        Physical contingencies of 10% have been applied for the civil
works, furniture and equipment expenditure categories. Allowances for
annual price escalations are as follows: 7.2% for 1986; 6.8% for 1987 and
1988; 7.0% for 1989; 7.1% for 1990 and 4.0% per year for the period
1991-95. Price contingencies for foreign and local costs are assumed to be
equal due to compensating exchange rate adjustments. Total physical con-
tingencies are estimated at US$1.1 million (4% of total project coste) and
price contingencies at US$5.9 million (22% of project costs).
4.        Table 1 shows summary accounts by project component; Table 2
shows project coet by component and expenditure category; Table 3 shows
project cost suumary by expenditure category and Table 4 shows the

REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PRIMMRY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY OF RECURRENT EXPENDITURES AND OF
GOST SAVINGS GENERATED BY THE PROJECT
1.        The table below provides rough estimates of (a) the incremental
Government recurrent expenditures and (b) the co0t savings generated by the
project. The assumptions behind the calculations are explained in the
notes tu the table. The estimates of incr_emntal expsnditures probably
reflect quite closely the likely effects of the project on the Government
racurtent budget. Rowever, the estîmates of cost savings are more
uncertain and are likely to underestimate considerably the beneficial
effects of the project since they do not include difficult quantifiable
e.fects such as the impact of improved institutional capabilities on the
cost-effectiveness of resource use, the impact of better trained teachers
and improved availability, relevance and quality of textbooks on internal
efficiency of primary education, and the effects of increased contribution
by local communities to school construction made possible by the
development of low-cost construction techniques based on locally available
materials.
2.        The estimates of cost savinge assume an annual enrollment growth
of 4%. This equals the projected growth in the school-age population over
the period considered and would imply maintaining the primary school
enrollment ratio at its 1984 level (25%). Compared to a situation where
the reduction in unit costs promoted through the project are not
introduced, the cost savinge generated by the project would be higher than
those shown belov if annual eurollment growth vere to exceed the assumed 4%
level.
3.        The estimates show that the savings resulting from the measures
included in the project are likely to exceed substantially the recurrent
expenditures ge.arated, especially when the project is fully developed.

5/  Assuaing a 4% annual enrollment grovth and constant pupil-teacher ratio.  The savings
result from limiting the recruitment of "instituteurs" to 14% of the total annual nev
recruitment instead of following a policy that vould lead to 20% of "instituteurs" in
the teaching force lin 1994 (saving 285,000 CFAF per new teacher recrutted as
"instituteur-adjoint" instead of as "instituteur".
6/  Computed under the assumption of 4% annual enrollment grovth and that no nev teachers
vould be needed in 1992 and 1993 due to double-ehift teaching. Teacher requtrements if
no double-shift teaching are given in Annes 2-6.
71   Assures that construction under the project does not replace Covernment construction
(i.e. no savings during project implementation), that enrollment greva at 4% annually
and that nev construction techniques developed under the project la used for all the 320
nev classrooms required in 1994 (savings per clasaroom eatimated at 2.2 million CFAF in
1984 prices>.
8/   Does not include savings duo. to factors such as Impact of iproved instttutional
capabilities on the cost-effec-iveness of resource use, and the impact of better trained
teachers and improved avsilability, relevance and quality of texthooks on internal
efficiency of primary education.

PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY OF GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTION
The Government's financial contribution to the project is
estImated at 469,262,000 FCFA, equivalent to US$1.4 million or 5% of total
project costs. The (.overnment's contribution would be used for the
procurement of loc.l materials for the echool construction program and to
cover 10% of the recurrent costs incurred mainly by the institution-
building component. The table below shows the breakdown of the
Government's contribution by expenditure category and calendar year.

PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
1.        In addition to increasing the access to primary education by
about 13% as compared ta 1985 enrollments, most primary school pupils would
benefit from the project through better trained teachers, improved
availability, relevance and quality of textbooks and improved school
buildings. The project provides a technical package to improve quality and
relevance of primary education, make primary school more cost effective and
strengthen institutional capacity to plan and develop the entire education
system. Not all the benefits of the project are amenable to
quantification.
2.        Cost-benefit analysis has been carried out on simplified
assumptiens to assess the effect of the components aimed at reducing
recurrent and capital costs and improving quality of primary education.
These components -- teacher training, development, production and
distribution of teaching aids, construction and rehabilitation of primary
schools -- account for about two-thirds of the total project costs. For
the purpose of the analysis, benefits have been estimated by quantifying
users' savings arising from the projects expected positive effect on the
repetition rates through an improved learning environment. No specific
etudy has been carried out of users' savings from an improved learning
environnent in Niger.  However, research on other African countries show
that the provision of improved physical facilities, teaching aids and
teacher training have a positive impact on retention rates, i.e. reduce
repetition and dropout rates.
3.        Users' savings have been estimated on the conservative assumption
that the technical package provided under the project woi,ld result in a 15%
reduction in repetition rates -- from 14% to 12%. The costs for each
repeater "saved" to the economy have been computed adding the private
opportunity cost of attending school to the public expenditures on his/her
education. On the assumption that (a) the economic life of the project
would extend over 20 years, and (b) the textbook supply is replenished
every four years, a comparison between costs and benefits yields a return
of about 8%. If to the estimated savings resulting from lower repetitions,
prudeit estimates are added to take account of the cost effectiveness
improvements resulting from multi-grade teaching, double-shift teaching and
a gradual restructuring of the teaching force (5% of public recurrent unit
expenditures on the e~ach direct beneficiary), the comparison of costs and
benefits on the components above yields a 13% return.
4.        These estimates are to be considered minimum returns as no
allowaace ls made for improved productivity, easier and better acquisition
oa adaptive agrieultural research and new farming practices and lover
fertility. They are consistent with comparatively high rt.turns to primary
education highlighted in Annex 2-4 as well as with the University of Dijon

study. According to this study, on the basis of earning differentials in
wage employment, in Niger primary education produces social returns between
15% (on the assumption of 18 school year equivalent to complete the primary
cycle) and 30% (on the basis of six years to complete the cycle) while
lower secondary, upper secondary and higher education have social returns
respectively of 6X, 13% and 6%.
