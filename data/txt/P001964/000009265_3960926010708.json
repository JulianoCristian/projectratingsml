program,\n            to develop primary education through more efficient and\n            effective utilization of education resources.\n            Implementation of this strategy is expected to result in a\n            more equitable, relevant and efficient educational system\n            where priority is given to the expansion of primary\n            education and where secondary and higher education will\n            develop in line with expected resource availability and\n            labor market conditions.  In addition to supporting the\n            Government's structural adjustment program generally,\n            the project is designed around three components:  the first\n            will reduce unit recurrent costs in primary education while\n            improving quality and relevance.  The second will reduce\n            unit capital costs and improve access to primary education\n            while the third will promote a more cost-effective use of\n            education resources."}, "docdt": "1986-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
