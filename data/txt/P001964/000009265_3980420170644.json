DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Primary Education\n            Development Project for Niger were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, project sustainability was likely, Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also highly satisfactory. A major lesson\n            learned from this project is that new complementary ways of\n            delivering educational services will have to be employed\n            such as community-based and private schools. A second lesson\n            learned is that flexibility is required to address\n            unforeseen circumstances during implementation. The Bank and\n            the Borrower demonstrated flexibility during project\n            implementation which helped address issues arising during\n            implementation such as initial delays in the construction\n            program and textbook provision. A third lesson to be drawn\n            from this project is the importance of consensus-building to\n            gain wide acceptance for reforms among the various groups\n            affected at the national level. The fourth lesson concerns\n            the long-term process of improving the national capacity to\n            develop manuscripts and produce textbooks. The textbook\n            production program was delayed due to an over-ambitious\n            assessment at appraisal of the capacity of the National\n            Institute for Pedagogical Documentation, Research and\n            Promotion (INDRAP) (composed of civil servants) to develop\n            and test manuscripts for new textbooks and teachers'\n            guides. To avoid delays, manuscript preparation should be\n            entrusted to private authors who have the capacity to\n            deliver. The ongoing project is supporting the development\n            of quality control at INDRAP."}, "docdt": "1996-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
