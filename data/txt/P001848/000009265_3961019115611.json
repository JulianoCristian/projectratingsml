"This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Development Management Project in\n            Mauritania. The objectives of the Development Management\n            Project were to support the implementation of the\n            Government's Economic and Financial Recovery Program\n            (1985-1989) by strengthening weak institutions and building\n            administrative capacity in the areas of economic management\n            and public service. Bank's performance was not\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was deficient. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows:  i) the difficulty for\n            the Bank to be an absentee stakeholder in the process of\n            institutional change; (ii) the need for persistent govemment\n            commitment to the change agenda and close attention to the\n            implementation process by both the Bank and the Borrower;\n            (iii) the need to set realistic and monitorable performance\n            indicators against which implementation progress can be\n            measured; and (iv) the need for the Bank to provide\n            frequent, consistent, well-structured and well-organized\n            supervision where the emphasis is on providing govemment\n            with solid professional advice and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1995-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
