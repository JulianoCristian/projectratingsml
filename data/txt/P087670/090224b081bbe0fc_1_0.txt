                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global development objective is to limit land degradation and to safeguard critical ecosystem functions through community-driven SLM activities that improve
                         agrosylvopastoral management and increase vegetation cover while securing livelihoods and global environmental benefits (i.e., reduced sedimentation of waterways,
                         improved interconnectedness and integrity of ecosystems, enhanced carbon storage rates, and increased opportunities for biodiversity conservation).

                         At component level, despite some delays noted during the first 2-years of implementation of Watershed activities (first specifically in the Tenghrada site where the implementation of
                         activities experienced some delayed until January 2012 due to the 2010-2011 social conflicts in Tenghara site; and second to the 16 months delays noted in the preparation of
                         watershed management Plans (linked to the procurement issues and, suspension of the bank activities in 2008- 2009,).). By the time being, all the activities have been completed in
                         the 4 project's sites (Greiguel, Beilouga, Hodh El Gharbi and Tengharada),. As of March, 2013 the disbursement rate of the project stands at 94.46%. the 6% variance in the

                         Disbursement rate was due to the fact that the Project was blended to the IDA CBRD which financed all the operating costs. As a result the resources planned for Project
                         Coordination under this Project were not entirely used.

                         The level of disbursement of the investments funds component is at 99.64%; since the investments were directly oriented to the beneficiaries, the latter showed a real satisfaction on
                         all project activities, with the focus on the scaling up by communities of soil and water conservation activities and the income generating one which is intended to improve
                         communities’ livelihood .

                         The safeguards measures with the sub-projects have been satisfactory and financial management and procurement have improved and are satisfactory.
                         However, the Counterpart funds mobilization is at 65%. The GOM will need to make more funds available after the closing date to cover operating costs for the next 4 months for the
                         staff which will work on the follow up of the external audit.

                         Moreover the overall project objective of the closed project is still relevant to the country's current development priorities, which have an increased focus on natural resource
                         management and sustainable land management. That is why the Project's results are now going to be used as input to upcoming GEF/inclusive green growth project and the
                         Agricultural sector Support projects.
