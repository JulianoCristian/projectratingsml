1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives, and Design
1.1       Context at Appraisal
1.      At appraisal, Mauritania was a Heavily-Indebted Poor Country with a per capita
gross domestic product of US$ 350 and a poverty rate of 46.3 percent. Despite continued
rural–urban migration, the rural sector provided employment for about 64 percent of the
labor force and remained a main source of income for the population. Rural areas also
had the highest concentration of the poor (75 percent), although overall poverty has
declined since 1990.
2.     At the same time, the rural sector was facing (and continues to face) major
environmental, economic, and infrastructure constraints that were widely recognized to
impede rural growth and development. Those constraints include: (i) a fragile and
degraded natural resource base; (ii) limited transport infrastructure to access markets and
services; (iii) limited supply of production support services; (iv) limited local ownership
of public investments; (v) limited access to investment and working capital; and (vi)
inadequate land tenure and pastoral laws.
3.     Land degradation was and remains a major concern in Mauritania, where
agropastoral areas and oases constitute the ecosystem that supports agricultural and
pastoral production; provides most of the water for cattle, small ruminants, and camels;
supplies firewood and timber; and provides a habitat for fauna and flora that could not
survive elsewhere. The ecosystem’s integrity under continual pressure from constraints
on managing natural resources sustainably. Arable land, pasture, forests, and biodiversity
are all being lost because communities lack sufficient technical supervision and
information; access to improved technologies is limited; natural resources are poorly
managed, with few controls on their use; and population pressure is rising.
4.     The Government of Mauritania had devised various strategies and policies to
address these constraints. They included the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP,
revised in 2001), the National Strategy for Decentralization and Local Governance (2002),
and the National Environmental Action Plan-NEAP (2004).
5.      The Community-based Watershed Management (CBWM) Project was developed
by the World Bank and Global Environment Facility (GEF) in response to the
government’s official request for complementary support to the Community-Based Rural
Development (CBRD) Project, referred to here as the “baseline project.” 1 . While the
CBRD Project primarily focuses on village-level investments to improve the living
conditions of project-supported village communities in terms of sustainable income
increase and access to basic socioeconomic services, the CBWM Project was envisioned
as complementing and broadening that baseline effort by working across communities to
foster sustainable land management (SLM) practices that could improve natural resource
management at the watershed and landscape levels. Thus this enabled the World Bank,
GEF, and Government of Mauritania to support their shared
6.     The CBWM Project also contributed to the government’s priorities and higher-
level development objectives for poverty reduction in rural areas. Not only was the

                                            1
CBWM Project aligned with the government’s priorities as expressed in the PRSP, which
emphasized the need to invest in natural resource management and capacity building, but
like the baseline project, the CWBM Project supported the government’s program of
decentralization by soliciting the active participation of regional, local, and traditional
authorities in carrying out the project.
1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
7.      The global development objective was “to limit land degradation and to safeguard
critical ecosystem functions through community-driven SLM activities that improve
agrosilvopastoral management and increase vegetation cover while securing livelihoods
and global environmental benefits (i.e., reduced sedimentation of waterways, improved
interconnectedness and integrity of ecosystems, enhanced carbon storage rates, and
increased opportunities for biodiversity conservation).”
8.      The project development objective (PDO) was “to lessen the incidence of land
degradation at the watershed level within the CBRD Project area by assisting rural
communities to generate benefits through community-driven investments addressing land
degradation and promoting SLM practices.” The overall project outcome was expected to
be a reduction in the incidence of land degradation as rural communities increased their
use of effective SLM techniques and practices.
9.     The key indicators for evaluating the achievement of the PDO were defined as
follows:
    (i)    Appropriate implementation of the SLM process by the Watershed Associations
           (Associations des Bassins Versants, ABVs) in the project area.
    (ii)   Two-thirds of activities introduced by the project are generating positive income
           flow for the communities.
(iii)      A 25 percent increase in biomass (perennial grass and shrub regeneration) in
           targeted areas.
1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
    and reasons/justification
10.        Neither the GEO nor the key indicators were revised.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.    The primary beneficiaries of the project were the rural populace in four
watersheds:
    (i)    Greiguel (Wilaya 2 de l’Assaba)—some 13,218 inhabitants in 24 villages and 4
           communes (rural municipalities) covering 1,780 square kilometers.
    (ii)   Tengharada (Wilaya de Adrar)—some 3,100 inhabitants in 19 villages and 1
           commune covering 243 square kilometers.
(iii)      Saïla (Wilaya de Hodh-El-Chargui)—some 5,600 inhabitants in 23 villages and 2
           communes covering 439 square kilometers.
2
    A wilaya is an administrative region.

                                               2
(iv)    Beilougue Litama (Wilaya du Gorgol)—some 13,800 inhabitants in 42 villages
        and 5 communes covering 515 square kilometers.
12.     In sum, the project would have about 36,000 direct beneficiaries residing in 108
villages over an area of approximately 3,000 square kilometers.
13.      Other project beneficiaries included the institutions that were expected to support
those 108 villages, including: (i) the regional and local Agricultural Services of the
Ministry of Rural Development (Ministère de Développement Rural, MDR); (ii) the four
Watershed Management Associations (Associations des Bassins Versants,ABVs); and
(iii) the local and regional authorities (mayors and Hakims).
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
14.    The project had three components which were aligned with the components of the
baseline CBRD project. These were:
 (i)    Component A: Capacity Building for Sustainable Land Management (GEF
        funding: US$ 1.5 million). Activities under this component included: (i) the
        development of intercommunity plans for watershed management; (ii) the
        establishment of watershed management associations (Associations des Bassins
        Versants, ABVs) in the target areas; (iii) collaboration with national and local
        research institutions, extension services, and community associations to adopt a
        watershed management approach in developing and transferring SLM
        technologies; (iv) a review of policies, laws, and regulations to provide incentives
        to rural communities to adopt sustainable management of resources at the
        watershed/landscape level; and (v) exploration and identification of future
        sustainable operation and funding options (such as carbon markets, bio-carbon
        funds, and environmental tax revenues) following project closure.
(ii)    Component B: Providing Incentives for Sustainable Land Management
        Practices (GEF funding: US$ 3.5 million). Through the Local Investment Fund
        established under the project, this component provided investment capital to
        village communities to adopt Watershed Management Plans—namely, sustainable
        resource management and conservation practices adopted by all of the
        communities within a watershed covered by the project.
(iii)   Component C: Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (GEF
        funding: US$ 1.0 million). This component funded technical assistance
        associated with monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and covered the incremental
        operating costs of additional personnel recruited to assist in managing and
        executing the GEF activities. It also provided funding to hire technical assistance
        to develop the Watershed Management Plans and the associated M&E tools.
1.6 Revised Components
15.     The project’s components were not revised during implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

16.    The Mid-term Review (MTR), originally planned for June 2009, was postponed
to early 2011, because the 2008 political unrest resulted in a 14-month freeze on

                                             3
disbursements under the Bank’s Operational Policy (OP) 7.30. 3 The project was also
restructured twice. The first restructuring, following the MTR, extended the closing date
from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2012, and reallocated project funds. That
reallocation primarily benefitted disbursement categories II (goods) (an increase of 6.6
percent), III (consultants, services, and audit) (an increase of 25 percent), and V (grants
for subprojects) (an increase of 16.6 percent).

17.     The second restructuring was processed to further extend the closing date to
March 31, 2013 and reallocate funds once again. The reallocation resulted in a 4 percent
increase for category III (consultants, services, and audit). Each restructuring was needed
to compensate for the delay incurred by the 14-month suspension of activities. Each was
a level 2 restructuring approved by the Country Director.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
18.      Project preparation lasted for about two years and made use of a US$470,000
preparation fund (US$350,000 from GEF PDF-B and US$120,000 Bank PPA) to finance
preparation activities including studies, study tours, and technical assistance, among other
items. The project was approved by the Board on June 22, 2006 and became effective on
January 26, 2007. The preparation phase was broadly participatory, involving extensive
consultations with stakeholders in two of the watersheds (Greiguel and Tengharada)
eventually selected to be covered by the project. The local commitment and sense of
ownership generated by the participatory preparation phase were strong and ultimately
critical for the project’s successful implementation. Representatives from other donor
agencies that were implementing or developing programs also participated, including the
German Organization for Technical Cooperation (GTZ, now GIZ), the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme, and
International Fund for Agricultural Development. Because the CBWM was a companion
project to the CBRD, it was prepared by the same Mauritanian counterpart team.
19.    The design of the project drew on experiences accumulated in Mauritania across
World Bank and GEF operations, similar Bank projects in the sub-region, as well as
experiences of other development partners involved in the agricultural and rural sector of
Mauritania. Those experiences were particularly valuable with respect to building
capacity in community associations, providing agricultural services, and managing
natural resources. The preparation team also drew on lessons from the GEF Land
Degradation Study (2001), particularly the following:
    (i)   Projects with a people/land management focus tend to address land
          degradation issues more directly; for that reason, the CBWM Project
          employed a demand-driven, participatory approach that emphasized local
          empowerment to manage land and other natural resources sustainably.

                                                    4
    (ii)    The most effective projects appear to be those in which land degradation is
            an initial component of the problem and the solution. For that reason, the
            CBWM Project’s objective was focused on reducing land degradation through
            SLM and related activities.
    (iii)   In biodiversity projects, rangeland environments have created the best land
            degradation/biodiversity synergy. The project specifically targeted rangeland
            environments in selecting the sites where it would operate.
20.     As stated earlier (Section 1.1), the CBWM Project was the World Bank’s/GEF’s
response to the Government of Mauritania’s official request to complement the IDA-
financed CBRD Project to improve the management of natural resources and combat
desertification in the project area within the context of watershed and landscape
management. Since the CBWM Project was processed later than the baseline operation, it
had separate legal documentation and a separate Board approval date. 4
21.     The CBWM Project was conceived as a partially blended operation. As noted, it
had the same component structure as the baseline project, and its project objective and
the activities under each component were aligned with those of the baseline project. 5
22.    Several criteria were used to identify the watersheds where the project would
focus its efforts. First, the watershed had to be representative of the Mauritanian
ecosystem. 6 Second, a development project capable of financing the basic needs of the
communities had to be in place. Third, signs of degradation had to be evident. And fourth,
the watershed had to be adequately populated. Ultimately, four watersheds were selected
(Greiguel, Tengharada, Saïla, and Beilougue Litama—see Section 1.4). As planned, two
of the watersheds (Greiguel and Tengharada) were included at the start of the project in
2006, whereas the other two (Saïla and Beilougue Litama) were added later, in 2008.
23.     The CBWM Project used the same institutional setup for project implementation
as the baseline IDA project, with the addition of a Scientific and Technical Committee
(Comité Scientifique et Technique, CST). The CST was responsible for conducting a
technical review of all new and innovative project activities (for example, the solar stoves,
biogas, and so on); contributing to project M&E from a technical standpoint; and helping
to disseminate the project’s results. In addition, the project recruited four facilitators (one
per watershed) to provide technical assistance to the ABVs. 7 The other institutions
involved in implementing the baseline CBRD Project, including the Project Coordination
Unit, were strengthened with additional staff responsible for the GEF activities under the
CBWM Project.

4
  The Government of Mauritania became eligible for funding under the GEF in the mid-1990s, by signing
the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the
Convention on Climate Change.
5
  Both projects (CBRD and CBWM) were a follow-up to the IDA Rainfed Natural Resource Management
Project, which ended in 2003.
6
  For that reason, the areas selected included a watershed basin in an oasis system (Tengharada, in Adrar), a
watershed basin in the predominantly agricultural zone (Beilougue Litama, in Gorgol), a watershed basin in
the agropastoral zone (Greiguel, in Assaba), and a watershed basin in the pastoral zone (Saïla, in Hodh
Chargui).
7
  Note that the ABVs are a higher-level grouping of the Community Development Associations
(Associations de Développement Communautaires, ADCs) formed under the CBRD Project.

                                                     5
24.     Despite the care taken in designing and preparing the project, some shortcomings
became apparent. One shortcoming was related to the assumption that the Watershed
Management Plans would provide the framework for carrying out the project’s
investment activities, but none of the plans were ready for operational use when project
implementation began. This was because during preparation the idea was to use the
existing two plans (for the Greiguel and Tengharada Watersheds) developed in 2005. But
during start of Project implementation, it was realized that these plans were too technical
and challenging for the communities to understand and/or implement and thus needed to
be revised. At the same time it was also decided that while the first two plans were being
revised, to go ahead with the development of the plans for the remaining two watersheds.
But the search for remedy was not done quickly and it seems that at the time there was an
assumption that Watershed Management Plans could be developed easily and quickly by
an experienced international consulting firm; in practice, however, the assumption proved
incorrect. Thus the whole process took very long, negatively impacting the effective
implementation of project activities.
25.      The other weakness of this phase was the very fact of assuming the project’s
activities contingent on the watershed management plans rather than letting the two
proceed simultaneously. In other words rather than preceding the investment activities, it
would have been preferable for the plans to be developed in parallel with (and guided by)
the investment activities. This was eventually corrected during the MTR.
26.     Another issue was that greater attention could have been given to the specific
M&E requirements of this type of project. Although adequate indicators were developed
for the project, they could have been more comprehensive. For example, if specific
indicators had been developed for measuring changes in biodiversity, carbon
sequestration, and ecosystem integrity, those impacts of the project could have been
assessed.
27.    Most of these issues were ultimately addressed during the course of project
implementation, especially through modifications proposed by the MTR mission and
subsequent implementation support missions.
28.     With respect to potential risk identification, considerable efforts were made
during appraisal to identify the key risks and design appropriate mitigation measures. For
example, the preparation team identified the risk of potential conflict between
communities; when a conflict arose during implementation in the Tengharada Watershed,
the proposed mitigation measures—participatory resource management processes and the
use of local laws and traditional methods of conflict resolution—proved useful. Other
risks identified during preparation included risks associated with financial management in
the public sector, weak implementation capacity at the local and institutional level, weak
cohesion of inter-village associations and groups, and periods of prolonged drought that
would negate the positive impacts of project investments. The measures formulated to
mitigate those risks included strong internal financial control procedures, combined with
rigorous training for project staff in the Bank’s fiduciary procedures, extensive training of
project beneficiaries in natural resource management, support for diversifying livelihoods,
and water conservation management activities.



                                             6
29.     Nonetheless, just like for the baseline project, the risk of political unrest and
regime change was not anticipated. This factor was crucial as during the course of the
project implementation, the country experienced a second military coup in 2008 that
resulted in a 14-months suspension of Bank operations under OP7.30: there was no
processing of withdrawal applications and no project supervision by IDA. This resulted
in a serious delay in the project’s activities implementation.
2.2 Implementation
30.     Although the project gained momentum slowly (after effectiveness in January
2007, and during the first two years, only a few activities were implemented on the
ground), the changes introduced at the MTR and after, including, some adjustments,
clarifications and precisions (particularly the two restructurings discussed in Section 1.7),
enabled the project to move forward more rapidly, complete most of the planned
activities, disburse most of the financial resources (the project used 94 percent of the
allocated funds, including 99 percent of the investment funds), and meet most of the
targets (all targets for the core indicators and most targets for the intermediate indicators)
by the closing date. In addition the CBWM Project strengthened social cohesion at the
village level through the newly created ABVs, expanded stakeholders’ capacity to
implement SLM practices, and provided an enabling environment that reinforced local
ownership of natural resource management initiatives.
31.     Despite the above successes, the project was also faced with challenges mainly
due to the delay in implementation of its activities. Several factors contributed to the
delays and the consequent slow initial disbursements but the main challenges were
related to the Watershed Management Plans, the coup of August 2008, and the social
conflict that erupted in the Tengharada Watershed.
32.     A review of the available project documents show that little physical SLM
investments in the watersheds took place initially due first to the delays in the recruitment
of a specialized consulting firm to develop and finalize the Watershed Management Plans.
But in addition the Bank and its Mauritanian counterparts had to come to grips with a
number of conceptual issues and questions. For example, should the plans specify all
investments to be undertaken in the short, medium, and long term? Or should they take
the form of living documents, similar to a rolling investment plan, which outlines the
broad orientation and types of investments to be undertaken, with annual investment
plans attached? To what extent could specific investments proceed in a piecemeal fashion
without jeopardizing the technical coherence of the overall plan?
33.     These issues were only addressed and settled during the MTR in January 2011. As
specified in the Aide-Memoire for the MTR, the Watershed Management Plans would be
considered “visions of development of the respective watersheds over the medium and
long term.” The plans would be treated as important project outputs or results rather than
preconditions for initiating investment activities. Specific, discrete SLM investments that
had been identified as priorities by technicians in the watersheds and by the ABVs could
proceed, even if the Watershed Management Plans had not been finalized, and the
investments would be integrated with those plans. It was these decisions during the MTR
in January 2011 that cleared the way for speedy project implementation from then on.


                                              7
34.     The second factor that affected Project implementation was the military coup in
August 2008 that caused the Bank to put OP 7.30 into effect. As a result disbursement
applications for the entire World Bank portfolio in Mauritania could not be processed and
the World Bank staff in the Mauritania resident mission was put on administrative leave.
OP 7.30 remained in effect until October 2009. Consequently, the Project was not
supervised from February 2008 (when the mid-term review mission of the CBRD project
ended) to December 2009. This in turn resulted in the delay of implementation of the
project activities and the MTR of the project, initially planned for June 2009, took place
only 18 months later, from January 11–21, 2011.
35.     The third factor for the delay was the social conflict in the Tengharada Watershed.
This watershed was one of the two watersheds selected in 2005. The watershed, which
encompasses 19 villages and hamlets, established its ABV in February 2007, but the
association did not function for several years due to disagreements between its members.
At first the central village with the biggest population did not want to participate in the
association; when it decided to participate, it wanted its representative to replace the
president who had been elected by the other villages. This conflict was not resolved until
the end of 2012, after repeated interventions by the administration and project personnel
caused the association to realize that members would lose economic development
opportunities if they did not set aside their differences and agree on a leader. Once the
dispute was settled, the association managed to build several impressive structures to
control water runoff within the few remaining months before the project came to a close.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization
36.     The CBWM Project used the same M&E system as the CBRD Project. The
advantage of this was that, as stated in the ICR of the CBRD, by June 2007 the M&E
system was in place, operational at the regional level, and the database set-up; it also
stated that “the project Central Coordination Unit (CCU) was able, for the first time, to
produce activity reports from the database”.
37.      The indicators for project management and the development of a communication
strategy were the same for the CBWM and CBRD Projects with additional indicators
included to measure the GEF-funded activities in the CBWM Project. Overall the
objective of the CBWM Project and the underlying assumptions on how the project’s
activities would lead to the intended outcomes were stated well, and the number of core
and intermediate indicators as well as the targets set out for each project year seemed
reasonable and measurable. The data collection methods had also been outlined; for
example, for the core indicators a scorecard system would be used to measure the
performance of the ABVs, and a line transect survey complemented by a plot survey
would be used to measure the impact of the SLM activities.
38.    The key responsibilities related to M&E (collecting and processing data, updating
performance indicators, analyzing and disseminating results) were assigned to the M&E
unit of MDRE, other agencies, and consultants, with overall responsibility for
coordinating M&E assigned to the joint CBRD/CBWM Project team. The GIS for the
baseline was to be developed in parallel with the GIS system of the Integrated
Development Project for Irrigated Agriculture (Projet de Développement Intégré de
l’Agriculture Irriguée en Mauritanie, PDIAIM) and in collaboration with the central

                                            8
mapping agency of Mauritania. The project was responsible for contracting a firm to
develop the plans for the baseline study and train the technical staff.
39.     In terms of staffing, at the national level the project design called for a unit head,
assisted by a computer specialist and two data entry staff. At the regional level, the
regional coordinator for the CBRD would also be responsible for M&E, assisted by one
data entry technician and a mobile technical support team (équipe mobile d’appui
technique) staffed by engineer-level technicians who were also responsible for
supervising data collection in the field.
40.     In spite of the above the M&E system had also flaws. The first one relates to the
operation of the system; the M&E system did not function optimally. As pointed out in
the ICR of the CBRD project though the system was up and running, concerns remained
in relation to training central and regional staff in basic computer literacy, improving
communication between technical personnel and the M&E unit on the best use of the data,
and including data on additional appropriate and measurable indicators. Data collection
was lagging, and analytical capacity at the central and regional entities was weak.
Information dissemination was limited to a quarterly project report with little analysis to
evaluate performance. The second limitation of the M&E, discussed in Section 2.1, was
that although a good set of indicators had been identified, key data should have been
collected on biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem restoration. A third
challenge for M&E was the lack of staff; due to lack of agricultural extension staff in the
project area, data on two vital variables (crop yields and increases in the water table)
were not systematically collected on an annual basis, and no institutional mechanisms
were in place to collect those data after the project ended. As a result it was difficult to
carry out a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of some of the most economically
important project investments: (a) stone weirs (overflow dams) in dry riverbeds to slow
water runoff and foster infiltration during the rainy season, thus raising the water table,
and (b) prime agricultural areas that are protected by metallic fences to keep animals out
and to prevent conflict between agriculturalists and herders.
41.     The performance of the M&E system improved over time, and by the end of the
project most issues raised during implementation support missions had been addressed
and corrected. However, with the closing of the project and lack of a successor project,
the M&E data unfortunately are no longer easily accessible. The data, along with the
equipment assigned to the CCU, were physically transferred to MDR (to the localities of
the Direction de la Vulgarisation, Extension Department), but the M&E system has not
yet been set up and put into use by the Ministry.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Procurement
42.     Procurement for the project was rated Satisfactory. From 2008 onwards, Annual
Procurement Plans were produced regularly, and all procurement was executed
efficiently, in a timely manner. The Manual for Simplified Community Procurement
Procedures developed under the CBRD Project was used, and training was provided to all
ABV members involved in procurement. The training was effective; the Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs) for the project rated procurement as Satisfactory after the trained
ABV members assumed responsibility for procurement. Training mainly concerned the

                                              9
special procurement procedures for community-driven development projects, which
enabled the trained association members to contract directly with suppliers of goods and
services and evaluate their performances. During this process, the ABVs were assisted by
the decentralized RCUs and by facilitators assigned to them. The facilitators were
responsible for helping the associations to program acquisitions, launch procurement
processes, prepare and manage contracts, and insure capacity building at the community
level.
Financial Management
43.      The financials management of CBWM Project was handled by the baseline
CBRD Project financial management team. The performance of this team was rated
Satisfactory by the ICR of the CBRD. The evaluation was done on the basis of several
criteria. The financial management system was adequate for the project’s needs.
Quarterly interim financial reports and annual financial audit reports were prepared and
submitted on time. All annual audit reports were unqualified. The ICR notes that
disbursements were disrupted for 14 months during 2008–09 owing to the August 2008
coup and subsequent application of OP 7.30.
Safeguards
44.     Both the CBRD and the CBWM Projects were classified as Category B projects
and triggered the following safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01),
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12), and Pest Management (OP 4.09). When these
projects were prepared, the Government of Mauritania undertook three major studies to
evaluate the adverse effects that could potentially result from project activities and
determine the measures to mitigate such effects: an Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF), a Relocation Policy Framework (RPF), and a Pest
Management Plan (PMP).
45.     The CCU hired an environmental expert to ensure that the environmental aspects
of both projects were managed properly. The CBWM Project required all of the
subprojects it funded to complete and pass an environmental screening test. The project
also strengthened the capacity of the ABVs in environmental management and social
safeguards. Gender training ensured that women ABVs member’s specific needs were
taken into account throughout the project. Training in environmental protection policy
allowed ABVs to consider mitigation measures for subprojects having undesirable
impacts on the environment. An environmental audit of the CBWM Project carried out in
March 2013 by an independent consultant found no major negative environmental
impacts and suggested a number of specific measures to permit full compliance with all
applicable environmental safeguards.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
46.    With the ending of the CBRD Project, the CCU prepared a proposal for a second
phase of the CBRD/CBWM Project, which would have scaled up the project’s activities
to cover 1,200 new villages and additional watersheds and completed the work initiated
under the first phase in 300 of the 856 villages and the four watersheds. However, tiven
the limited IDA envelope for Mauritania and the government’s overall priorities,
financing for a second phase was not feasible.

                                          10
47.     The World Bank portfolio for Mauritania currently features two new projects. The
first one is under the GEF Sahel and West Africa Program (SAWAP) in support to the
Great Green Wall and includes an SLM Project for Mauritania with GEF financing. The
second one is the Regional Pastoralism Development Operation in the Sahel (Projet
Régional d'Appui au Pastoralisme au Sahel, PRAPS). Both projects, still at the concept
stage, could provide continuity for the institutional and technical innovations introduced
under the CBRD/CBWM Projects and potentially build on the achievements and lessons
learned from those efforts.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
48.     The global objective of the CBWM Project is still important and relevant in the
Mauritanian context. It remains consistent with the PRSP (2000–15) for the rural sector
and its Third Action Plan (2011–15), which aims for the rural sector to contribute 1
percent to Mauritania’s overall growth through sectoral investment programs focused on
improving the living conditions of rural populations and reducing poverty through pro-
poor growth. Likewise, the CBWM Project remains relevant in relation to the general
objective of the 2001–2015 Rural Sector Development Strategy, which is to reduce
poverty.
49.     The project proved particularly instrumental in providing a basis for improving
governance and stakeholder participation. Even more than the CBRD, the CBWM Project
was both a laboratory and school for local intercommunity development. The manner in
which the ABVs were designed and implemented through the CBWM Project created a
space for dialogue between these community associations and local government.
Contacts between the local population and the administration’s technical services have
greatly increased, and trust between the two entities has been building.
3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objective (GEO)
50.     The GEO of the CBWM Project was “to limit land degradation and to safeguard
critical ecosystem functions through community-driven sustainable land management
(SLM) activities that improve agrosilvopastoral management and increase vegetation
cover while securing livelihoods and global environmental benefits (i.e., reduced
sedimentation of waterways, improved interconnection and integrity of ecosystems,
enhanced carbon storage rates, and increased opportunities for biodiversity conservation).”
Progress toward the GEO was to be measured through the following outcome indicators:
 (i)    Appropriate implementation of the sustainable land management process by the
        Watershed Management Associations (ABVs) in the project area.
(ii)    2/3 of activities introduced generate positive income flow for the communities.
(iii)   25 percent biomass increase in project areas treated, indicating sustainable
        regeneration of grass and shrubs.
51.     The project achieved all three core indicators: (i) the ABVs manage and maintain
inter-communal SLM investments; (ii) about 64 percent (or 106 out of 165) subprojects
generate income for the beneficiaries; and (iii) based on the assessment of 13 trial sites
where SLM practices were introduced, an increase in biomass of about 31 percent was

                                             11
observed. Most of the intermediate indicators were achieved as well. Table 1 summarizes
the project’s achievements with respect to the core and intermediate outcome indicators.

3.3 Efficiency
52.     At appraisal, the cost-benefit analysis that was undertaken for the project was
merely illustrative. This was because the economic and financial benefits arising from the
project’s social and environmental activities are primarily derived from capacity building
and empowerment in local communities, a reduction in conflicts between herders and
agriculturalists, and investments in natural resource management and SLM. This mix of
economic, social, and environmental benefits is particularly difficult to quantify in
monetary terms. Moreover, even for the economic activities, it is challenging to predict
the types of subproject investments that will be made, because they are chosen as the
project progresses, in accordance with the priorities of the local population. For that
reason, an illustrative cost-benefit analysis of the income-generating activities supported
under the project was carried out.
Key Assumptions and Results of the Illustrative Economic and Financial Analysis
53.     The key assumptions for the economic and financial analysis were that on 5
hectares of previously uncultivated land, investing in dikes would allow the production of
800 kilograms of sorghum per hectare; investing in thresholds (stone and earth bunds)
would allow the production of 500 kilograms per hectare. In both cases, the production of
cowpeas or hay (on unirrigated land) could add to the value of sorghum production. The
fresh produce from the vegetable gardens was assumed to fetch a relatively low price
(100 to 120 MRO per kilograms).
                                                13
54.    The economic and financial costs were assumed to differ little except for the costs
of labor and transport. The economic cost of labor was set 50 percent lower to account
for unemployment and the lack of alternative jobs in the project areas, and the cost of
transport included a 10 percent fuel tax.
55.      The analysis found that it should not be difficult to reach the minimum 10 percent
internal rate of return (IRR) and economic rate of return (ERR) on average for
subprojects to conserve soil and water (dikes and thresholds). Table 2 summarizes the
results.

Key Results and Impacts of Interventions Ultimately Implemented under the
Project
56.     To better evaluate the project’s overall results, the ICR team referred to various
studies for the CBRD and CBWM Projects. On the basis of this the project’s results and
impacts may be summarized as follows:
    i) Incomes improved in beneficiary communities. An analysis of the impacts of
       the subprojects revealed an IRR between 13 percent and 63 percent, significantly
       surpassing the 10 percent minimum. In fact, the IRR for dikes and thresholds
       surpassed 50 percent. All of the subprojects’ activities helped to improve the
       socioeconomic welfare of the population. Women’s vegetable gardens, with an
       IRR of 52.66 percent and ERR of 202 percent, are especially promising for
       diversifying sources of income and nutrition; the results reinforce the value of a
       gender-sensitive approach to local development.
    ii) The project had positive environmental impacts and increased the awareness
        of strategies to reduce pressure on natural resources. The environmental audit
        found that the project’s activities had no negative effects on the equilibrium of the
        ecosystems involved. In fact, by establishing forest reserves and increasing
        supplies of butane gas, the project reduced pressure on natural resources and had a
        positive impact on the environment.
    iii) The survey of beneficiaries found strong ownership of the investments and a
         commitment to maintaining them. The survey also found that the investments


                                                      14
       were being used properly. These behaviors strongly indicate that the investments
       will be sustained for sometimes beyond the project.
57.     The principal lesson is that the project’s activities were profitable, enabling
most subprojects to continue without new financing. However, the need for credit is
still important within and beyond the project areas. In this context—and based on the
satisfaction of the ADCs)—a compelling case can be made for replicating this model in
other watersheds of Mauritania, not only using the same approaches but emphasizing
continued close support and capacity building for beneficiaries.
58.    The details of the analysis of the results are found in Annex 3.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
59.     The project achieved its core outcome indicators and most of the intermediate
outcome indicators. It demonstrated that dealing with land degradation at the watershed
level by enabling communities to form watershed management association and generate
benefits through community-driven investments in SLM practices remains highly
relevant for Mauritania. This strategy is likely to be the most cost-effective means of
fostering pro-poor growth and creating sustainable livelihoods in rural Mauritania outside
the Senegal River Valley. Nevertheless, the project is rated only Moderately Satisfactory,
owing to the long delays in its execution. Most investments in infrastructure under the
Watershed Management Plans occurred only one or two years before the project ended,
leaving insufficient time for a robust assessment of their impact or for entirely ensuring
their maintenance and sustainability. Although the project successfully introduced the
innovation of Watershed Management Associations (ABVs) in Mauritania, and although
its results were positive, it was a pilot operation. The ultimate success and justification of
the watershed management approach piloted through the project depends on whether it
can be replicated more widely, and as of this writing, no follow-up is planned.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts
60.     The SLM investments, executed as part of the Watershed Management Plans, are
very labor intensive. All labor was provided by the beneficiaries themselves, who were
paid for their work based on previously agreed norms (for example, “x cubic meters of
stone bunds built”). This was therefore not only source for temporary local job creation
that resulted in the transfer of substantial resources to beneficiaries improving their local
livelihoods, but also resulted in the reversing of city migration, eliminating the
communities seasonal migration to urban areas to supplement their incomes. This was
particularly observed during the last two years of the project, during which activities
implementation was at its peak.
(b) Gender Impact
61.     Women in the communities participated actively in preparing and implementing
project activities. They were also involved in the ABVs and about 200 women belonging
to ABVs benefitted from training. To further support women, the project financed: (i)
fencing materials and agricultural inputs for 39 women’s groups to develop vegetable

                                             15
gardens; (ii) 1,000 metal stoves that significantly reduced the need for fuel wood; (iii) the
opening of stores selling butane gas, also to reduce the need for fuel wood; (iv) the
introduction of improved clay stoves; (v) training for women to make soap from local
forest products; (vi) the introduction of two solar water pumps to reduce the time and
energy needed to pump water; and (vii) the introduction of solar panels to generate
electricity for the offices of the ABVs, enabling local students use these offices to do
their homework at night.
(c) Institutional Change/Strengthening
62.     The rural institutional landscape has been enriched by the emergence of the ADCs
under the CBRD Project and even more so by the emergence of the higher-level ABVs
that regroup several ADCs. As stated, the idea of ABVs was very new for Mauritania,
and it yielded positive results. The ABVs can foster solidarity among people living in the
same watershed and create the political space for dialogue among members, among
villages, and between the local and regional administrations. In this sense, the ABVs can
be considered a level of local governance. The relationship between the rural population
and local administration was often marred by distrust, but frequent interactions in the
framework of the associations developed a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect.
Representatives of ABVs have easy access to government officials and are sure that their
requests for an audience will be granted. As legally recognized entities, the ABVs are
development partners that can negotiate activities and contracts on behalf of the entire
watershed with any other development partner.
63.     By improving contact among the local and regional administrations, technical
services, and rural people, the ABVs make it possible to alert the authorities to practices
that are harmful to the environment (excessive logging, illegal charcoal production,
setting bushfires, and so on) and gain a response. The increased awareness of
environmental protection issues and community mobilization for environmental
protection are important signs of growing concern over the importance of managing
natural resources sustainably.
64.      The project also made important contributions to strengthening several
institutions at the regional level in Mauritania, especially to the two research institutes,
CNRADA and CNERV. 8 Various types of training (in the project’s approach, ESMF,
gender issues, and the use of guidelines and diagnostic tools for the management of
watersheds) were conducted for regional staff of MDR and the Ministry of Environment
(MoE). This staff was directly involved in all phases of the project and played a key role
in providing technical advice to ABVs. Unfortunately, during the course of the project, it
became evident that the government had insufficient field staff to provide ABVs with the
technical advice required to maintain their SLM investments.
(d) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
65.    The project helped to reduce conflicts between herders and agriculturalists in two
ways. First, it fenced key cultivated areas, reducing the likelihood that animals would

                                                16
destroy crops. Second, the ABVs constitute a new forum for anticipating social conflict
and handling it consensually, based on agreed and accepted fines for damage caused by
unsupervised animals.
66.     A related point is that the local land use and protection agreements (conventions
locales) developed by each ABV under the Watershed Management Plans also had a
positive impact. By enabling agriculturalists and herders to respect one another’s rights,
preventing the indiscriminate felling of trees, and fining those who violated the rules,
these local agreements have helped to reduce conflicts and motivate villagers to protect
their shared resources.
67.     Another positive impact is that the stone overflow dams built through the project
in some areas serve as bridges during the rainy season. Communities that had once been
cut off from others by the rains became more accessible.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
68.     A beneficiary survey in December 2007 9 and a self-assessment by the ADCs in
September/October 2010, done within the context of the CBRD Project, included the
ADCs in the four watersheds of the CBWM Project. The beneficiaries judged the
project’s socioeconomic impact to be satisfactory. Women in particular concurred that
levels of poverty and extreme poverty were falling. The participatory approach used for
the Community Development Plans and the establishment of the Watershed Management
Plans permitted an accurate understanding of local issues, priority setting, and the
development of sound investment plans. All stakeholders confirmed that the subprojects
had a positive impact. The self-assessment of the ADCs, including those in the four
watersheds, used scorecards. Of the ADCs in the watersheds, 93 percent considered
themselves satisfied with the project overall.
69.     During the meetings with ABVs, the ICR mission team was able to confirm that
they valued the project’s investments very highly. They were particularly impressed by
and grateful for the overflow dams, which slowed runoff and increased infiltration during
the rains. As water infiltrates, the groundwater table rises, and more water becomes
available for human and animal consumption in places and in quantities never seen
before. Villagers in the watersheds were also highly satisfied with the collective
investment in fencing under the project, which protected crops. As noted, an ancillary
benefit of the fences is that they reduce the chronic conflicts between agriculturalists and
herders.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
70.     With the official closing of the CBRD Project in December 2011, the project staff
of the CCU which had handled both projects was reduced to a minimum. The CBWM
project continued to function with this skeleton staff. With the closing of the CBWM
project on March 31, 2013, these staffs were disbanded; the latter were therefore obliged
to look for other opportunities. Since there was no planned, systematic absorption of any

contains the executive summary of that report.

                                                17
of these CCU personnel into the MDR or MoE, these staffs were obliged to look for other
opportunities (some have already found jobs others are still looking for new job
opportunities). Consequently the institutional memory of the CBWM Project is
dispersing with these individuals. On a more positive note, most of the technical field
staff involved in and trained by the project in SLM techniques remain within MDR,
where their knowledge can be mobilized and updated by future operations.
71.     The watershed management structures built through the project can be expected to
survive at least for the foreseeable future. The ABVs have defined local action plans and
set up maintenance procedures and teams. The infrastructure is likely to be maintained,
unless it requires major repairs that are beyond the associations’ financial capacity. The
economic benefits of some of these investments are high, very visible, and clearly
appreciated by the villagers. The ABVs are making efforts to collect user fees from
members to pay for maintenance and repairs. Whether these fees are adequate remains to
be seen. Yet without a minimum of continued outside technical support to the ABVs,
there is a risk that they will become dormant. Ultimately the development outcomes and
especially the sustainability of the CBWM Project depend heavily on whether the
government, with support from international donors, deepens the SLM practices
introduced in the four watersheds and replicates them elsewhere.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
72.     The World Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. First and foremost there was a design flaw: the Watershed Management
Plans should have been an output of the project and not the basis for all of its activities;
this was later on corrected during the MTR. Another consideration is that, although most
aspects, and especially the fiduciary ones, are very well described in the PAD. Where the
appraisal document is weak is concerning the technical aspects of watershed management
and the M&E system for this type of investments. The appraisal document provide little
indication of the extent to which the technical requirements of watershed management
plans, the M&E demands related to such an investment, and the capacity of MDR and
MoE field staff were taken into account. In other words it is not clear to what extent the
country’s limited experience in these areas were effectively taken into account and to
what extent the capacity of field staff of the MDR and the MoE had been analyzed. The
documents appear to have assumed that technical expertise could easily be hired to
develop the Watershed Management Plans and an appropriate M&E system, and that the
government would be able to easily provide the necessary field staff to supplement
project staff. A great deal of confidence was also placed in the CST—the committee that
would be created to oversee the scientific and technical soundness and quality of
intercommunity subprojects. Finally, the first two draft watershed management plans that
were already prepared in 2005 but were found not be easily applicable in operational
terms should have received more upfront attention and there should have been close and
quicker follow up for the corrective measures. Although none of these assumptions and


                                            18
omissions prevented the project from achieving its objective, they initially complicated
its implementation and impacted in the pace of implementation of the activities.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
73.     The quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.. Although project
supervision took place under difficult country circumstances, after 2009, successive
missions succeeded in helping the project to move towards achieving its PDO. All
fiduciary and safeguard aspects were monitored and implemented. The MTR in January
2011 was particularly well done, as it determined that SLM investments in the watersheds
could proceed while the Watershed Management Plans were finalized.. Other instances
where Bank supervision missions were proactive in extending the project’s closing dates
and reallocating funds to enable the project to achieve its GEO.
74.     These positive developments aside, quality of supervision is nevertheless judged
to be moderately satisfactory because of three reasons. First, it was uneven. The
impression conveyed by the aide memoires and ISRs is that the CBWM Project—
conceived as an extension of the CBRD Project and perhaps perceived as a “junior”
partner—received comparatively less attention during supervision until the CBRD
Project was about to close. Increased supervision at that time appears to have sped
implementation of the CBWM Project, which peaked toward the end of the project’s life.
For that reason, insufficient time was available to test the infrastructure built for
watershed management (a problem aggravated by the irregular rains) and assess the
project’s overall impact. For no clear reason, all of the ISRs rated the project’s
performance for Implementation Progress as Satisfactory, despite the numerous
difficulties encountered during implementation.
75.    A second reason to rate quality of supervision as moderately satisfactory is related
to the Tengharada conflict. Given that it took a long time to resolve that conflict,
measures should have been taken to reallocate resources to the other three ABVs, as
recommended by Bank management in ISR No. 16 (June 2012). A reallocation would
most likely have avoided more than US$ 300,000 (about 6 percent of total resources) of
unused resources from being cancelled.
76.     A third reason for this rating is that toward the end of the project too little
attention was given to safeguarding the project’s achievements and replicating them in
future Bank operations. The considerable socioeconomic success of the SLM investments
in the four watersheds was not adequately highlighted and brought to the attention of
decision makers inside the government and the Bank.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
77.     The Bank took all actions necessary to ensure that the CBWM Project as such was
a success. Yet more could have been done to use its pilot character to demonstrate the
importance of SLM for common property resources in a country such as Mauritania, with
its extremely serious problems of land degradation. The GEF Scientific and Technical
Advisory Panel (STAP) performed only one review of the project—at appraisal. The
exploration of innovative mechanisms to ensure the financial sustainability of SLM

                                            19
practices was mentioned in the PAD but addressed only in the form of a national
workshop, with no concrete follow-up.
5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
78.      Performance of the Government is rated moderately satisfactory. It is true that the
Government quickly met all the negotiations and effectiveness conditions as there was no
delay in project effectiveness. It is also true that during political disturbances (coups,
political transition) it ensured the project’s continued operation and maintained project
staff. However, there were also instances where its commitments were not maintained.
The bureaucratic tussles between the MDR and MoE over who should be in charge of the
project led to instances where the CCU was unable to take critical actions such as the
establishment of the Comité Scientifique et Technique (CST). And given the critical role
the CST was supposed to play in the implementation of the project activities, this delay
had negative impact in the pace of implementation of the activities. Another instance
where the government failed to maintain its commitment was the fact that it did not
make available sufficient number of extension agents that would accompany the ABVs
in line with the expansion of the portfolio of sub-projects. The inadequacy and
instability of extension services and lack of technical advices support have been a real
constraint to the implementation of advisory support and monitoring of the ABVs. And
this problem prevailed for most part of project implementation despite the repetitive
suggestions and recommendations during the various implementation support missions.
As a result not only the ABVs did not get the adequate technical support but also project
data that was supposed to be collected by these agents could not be done regularly as
planned. A third reason for the moderately satisfactory rating is that just like for the
baseline CBRD project there was a problem with the counterpart funding. At the end of
the project counterpart mobilization was only at 27 percent (see Annex 1 (b) Financing).
Finally, as discussed, the government made no effort to capitalize on the experience of
the CBWM Project after it ended. The CCU was quickly disbanded. The equipment and
data contained in the M&E system were not put to use, despite the considerable effort to
develop the system. Even more important, although the success of these innovative pilot
activities was visible, the government showed little interest in either continuing to finance
the activities or scaling them up. Toward the end of 2011, for example, the Bank gave the
government the option of using supplemental funds for additional financing for the
CBRD/CBWM Projects and/or PDIAIM. The government chose to allocate all of those
resources to PDIAIM.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
79.     The CCU’s performance is rated Satisfactory. The CCU staff proved to be
dynamic, competent, and devoted to the project’s work with poor communities in remote
corners of the country and under extremely challenging circumstances. The CCU’s
training and coaching of ADCs to set up ABVs and understand, commit to, and manage
Watershed Management Plans was well done. The CCU staff also successfully
coordinated activities of the ABVs with the local administration at the prefectural

                                             20
(moughataa) level and the decentralized services of MDR and MoE. They regularly
visited the ABVs, especially as critical investment activities were underway, and they
followed up closely to ensure that the ABVs obtained their legal status and functioned
actively and as expected. Where the CCU was less successful was in systematically and
scientifically analyzing the benefits of some of its investments (measuring the impact on
groundwater levels, carbon sequestration, and so on) and in implementing the
communication strategy to draw the attention of the country and its policy makers to the
high level of benefits from SLM. Another weakness of the CCU was that at the end of the
project it failed to safeguard the project’s assets (although most of the equipment was
recovered eventually by MDR).
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
80.     Overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. What happens
after a project of this nature is as important as what happens during its execution. The
CBWM Project was highly successful in creating the ABVs, and introducing and testing
SLM for common property resources in Mauritania. This type of SLM pilot project,
which deals with complex environmental effects, creates social capital, and requires
behavioral change across groups of villages, requires special attention to plan for the way
the project ends. In this case, what is missing is a national strategy to deal with land
degradation problems and to replicate the success of CBWM Project on a large scale.

6. Lessons Learned
81.     The positive impact of a project of this nature is the empowerment and
ownership demonstrated as management plans are set up and local communities
implement them. The communities learned to make use of natural resource management
tools, including forest law, water law, and pastoral law, which are extremely relevant for
the Watershed Management Plans and their implementation. The local population
demonstrated the capacity to manage their own ecosystem when the boundaries are well
defined, natural resource management tools are available, and a minimum level of
resources and technical expertise is provided.
82.     Important factors to consider in watershed management projects are the
timing and manner of creating ABVs. The associations should be created at the
beginning of the project, rather than waiting until SLM practices are better understood
and internalized by the communities, and they should be created from the bottom up
rather than the top down. The sociological context must be analyzed carefully at the
outset and monitored continuously, because intercommunity cooperation and the
establishment of a coordinating body are crucial to success. A minimum level of
consensus is required among villages to select the leaders of the ABVs. Otherwise
leadership conflicts can easily paralyze collective action—as in the Tengharada
Watershed.
83.   SLM practices that make additional water available, such as the overflow
dams and stone bunds developed through the CBWM Project, should be
accompanied by agronomic advice to make the best use of the additional water.
Once communities are organized in ABVs and open to innovation, they stand to benefit

                                            21
from extension advice on increasing yields through improved seed and agronomic
practices and on marketing surplus produce. Especially in the maintenance phase, close
follow-up and technical and sometimes financial backstopping are critical. The local
population has a considerable and continuous need for learning on an extensive range of
subjects, from technical to administrative matters.
84.    This type of project should be reevaluated five to ten years after it closes.
Given the wide variation in annual rainfall in the Sahel, the economic benefits of some of
the most important SLM investments can be reliably assessed only after several years
have passed. This timeframe is especially important for determining the impact of
changes in groundwater levels on crop yields and the availability of groundwater for
human and animal consumption. Only time can tell how well the institutions created
under the project (ABVs) are functioning and whether they are able and willing to
maintain the infrastructure created.

                               Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A: Capacity Building for Sustainable Land Management (SLM)
1.      In addition to the capacity building provided through the CBRD Project, the
CBWM Project included a number of capacity-building activities. They included the
development of inter-community plans for watershed management; the establishment of
ABVs in target areas; collaboration with national research institutions, extension services,
and community associations to adopt a watershed management approach in developing
and transferring SLM technologies; a review of policies, laws, and regulations to provide
incentives to rural communities to adopt sustainable management of resources at the
watershed/landscape level; and exploration and identification of future sustainable
operations and funding options (such as carbon markets, bio-carbon funds, and
environmental tax revenues) following the project’s closure.
2.      The ABVs were established at different times, as shown in Table 2.1. Once the
ABVs were formed, their members, the technicians working with them, and local
administrators and their representatives were trained in a variety of subjects. Altogether,
some 500 people (about 300 men and 200 women) participated in training sessions. The
topics covered ranged from soil conservation techniques to gender issues, group
management and conflict resolution, maintenance of SLM investments, and formulation
of local rules for managing natural resources. In addition, more specialized training was
provided to technicians and ABV members in such topics as environmental impact
evaluation, accounting and auditing, and other skills. Six project staff members benefited
from study tours to Burkina Faso (CILSS and PNGT), Niger (ICRISAT and
AGHRYMET Regional Centre), and Tunisia (ICARDA) to learn about watershed
management practices and experiences in these countries. 10

3.         The CBWM Project also commissioned a number of studies:
     (i)   Four baseline studies for the watersheds of Greiguel and Tengharada (biophysical,
           land degradation, socioeconomic, and institutional aspects);
 (ii)      The four Watershed Management Plans, validated by the beneficiaries, the local
           elected officials, the technical services, and the administration;
(iii)      The preparation and adoption of two local agreements concerning natural resource
           management;

 (iv)    An environmental and social guidelines;
  (v)    An agreement between the CBWM and the Directorate of Rural Works to look
         after the SLM investments financed by the project;
 (vi)    Manuals for project execution, M&E, and environmental and social safeguards;
(vii)    Environmental impact of the project; and
(viii)   Socioeconomic impact evaluation of subprojects.
 4.      As discussed, it took some time to prepare the Watershed Management Plans,
 primarily because of the difficulties entailed in finding an international consulting firm
 competent in this area, and secondly because execution of the contract was delayed by
 political unrest and the subsequent suspension of disbursements for 14 months. The
 management plans were available to, discussed by, and validated by the ABVs only
 toward the end of the project.
 5.      Moreover, Project activities related to the review of policies, laws, and regulations
 for sustainable management of resources at the watershed/landscape level and the
 exploration and identification of future sustainable operations and funding options
 (carbon markets, bio-carbon funds, environmental tax revenues, and so on) were not
 carried through.
 Component B: Providing Incentives for Sustainable Land Management Practices
 6.      This component provided investment capital for communities within a watershed
 to work jointly to adopt sustainable resource management and conservation practices.
 The ABVs were responsible for the entire procurement process (ranging from identifying
 their needs to placing the orders), except for paying the suppliers. Payment was handled
 by the CCU on the basis of the agreement (Procès-Verbal) signed by the ABVs and
 supplier. During the entire process, the ABVs were assisted by the facilitators, who also
 assured the quality of the delivered goods on behalf of the communities. Table 2.2
 summarizes the works carried out in the individual watersheds from June 2007 to
 February 2013.

7.      The SLM practices listed in Table 2.2 made it possible to recover land that had
been denuded and degraded by wind and water erosion and put it to productive use. An
estimated 3,200 hectares of degraded land has been recovered (1,225 hectares for
agricultural use, 450 hectares for forestry, and 1,525 hectares for pastoral purposes).
Measurements of vegetative cover indicate that biomass increased by 31 percent on
average. The 5,537 hectares of agricultural land protected by fencing allowed 4,430 tons
of produce to be grown (average yields were 800 kilograms per hectare).
Component C: Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation
8.       Project management, monitoring, and evaluation for the CBWM Project were the
responsibility of the CCU of the CBRD Project. Use of the CCU, reinforced by the
addition of staff members with specific responsibilities for GEF-funded activities under
the CBWM Project, ensured synergy and consistency in the objectives and activities of
the two projects. The lead environmental specialist within the CCU was responsible for
facilitating, coordinating, and monitoring the project’s GEF activities. This component
funded technical assistance associated with M&E and the incremental operating costs of

                                                     26
additional personnel recruited as part of regional teams (facilitators and animators) to
execute GEF activities. Qualified technical assistance, especially for developing
Watershed Management Plans and implementing M&E tools, was obtained, albeit with
considerable delays.
9.      Annual work plans, budgets, and procurement plans were prepared on time. They
were submitted and approved by the CST and cleared by the World Bank. Financial
management posed no problems; expense reports submitted for reimbursement from the
special account were prepared regularly and were all accepted. Annual audit reports were
submitted on time and were unqualified.
10.     The CBRD and the CBWM Projects used the same basic M&E system. By June
2007, this system was in place and a database had been set up. It was operational at the
regional level, and the CCU was able, for the first time, to produce activity reports from
the database. As pointed out in the ICR of the CBRD Project, concerns remained in
relation to training central and regional staff in basic computer literacy, communication
between technical staff and the M&E unit about the best use of the data, and the
availability of some appropriate and measurable indicators. The M&E system was well
designed but did not function optimally, at least initially. Data collection lagged, and
analytical capacity at the central and regional entities was weak. Information
dissemination was limited to a quarterly project report with little analysis to evaluate
performance. In addition due to a lack of agricultural extension staff in the project area,
regular collection of data could not be done; especially data on two vital variables (crop
yields and increases in the water table) were not systematically collected on an annual
basis, and no institutional mechanisms are presently in place to collect these data now
that the project has ended. This lack of data complicates a comprehensive cost-benefit
analysis of some of the economically most important project investments: overflow stone
dams in dry riverbeds (to slow runoff during the rainy season, foster infiltration, and raise
the water table) and fencing for prime agricultural areas (to keep animals out and reduce
conflicts between agriculturalists and herders). Moreover, as indicated, some data that
were of key interest for a project of this nature were not collected (on biodiversity, carbon
sequestration, and ecosystem restoration).
11.     With support and prodding from several Bank supervision missions, the M&E
system improved over time, and by the end of the project, most issues had been corrected.
With the closing of the project and absence of a follow-up operation, right now the data is
not accessible. This is because at the end of the project the data of the M&E system as
well as the equipment that were under the responsibility of the project CCU have been
physically transferred to the MDR (to the localities of the Direction de la Vulgarisation)
but the M&E system has not been yet set up and put into use.

                           Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The economic and financial benefits arising from the project’s social and
environmental activities are primarily derived from capacity building and empowerment
in local communities, a reduction in conflicts between herders and agriculturalists, and
investments in natural resource management and SLM. This mix of economic, social, and
environmental benefits is particularly difficult to quantify in monetary terms. A cost-
benefit analysis is challenging even for the economic activities, because the specific
subproject investments were also not known beforehand as they are chosen in accordance
with the priorities of the local population.
Key Assumptions
2.      The key assumptions for the economic and financial analysis as carried out for
this ICR were that on 5 hectares of previously uncultivated land, investing in dikes would
allow the production of 800 kilograms of sorghum per hectare; investing in stone and
earth bunds would allow the production of 500 kilograms per hectare. In both cases, the
production of cowpeas or hay (on unirrigated land) could add to the value of sorghum
production. The fresh produce from the vegetable gardens was assumed to fetch a
relatively low price ( 100–120 MRO per kilogram). The economic and financial costs
were assumed to differ little except for the costs of labor and transport. The economic
cost of labor was set 50 percent lower to account for unemployment and the lack of
alternative jobs in the project areas, and the cost of transport included a 10 percent fuel
tax.
3.       The analysis found that it should not be difficult to reach the minimum 10 percent
internal rate of return (IRR) and economic rate of return (ERR) on average for
subprojects to conserve soil and water (dikes and bunds). Table 3.1 summarizes the
results.

4.      With respect to the sensitivity analysis, the break-even analysis was done against
the total life of the project and indicated the number of year necessary to recover the total
investment, not just the ADCs’ contribution. The conclusion from the sensitivity analysis


                                                      28
was that “based on the level of switching values and the break-even analysis, the models
[that is, the interventions] display little risk.”

5.      To better evaluate the project’s overall results for this ICR, the team referred to
various studies for the CBRD and CBWM Projects. They included Analyse économique
et financière des microprojets générateurs de revenue du PDRC (Economic and financial
evaluation of CBRD income-generating microprojects), December 2010, conducted for
the CBRD Project ICR, and Audit Environnemental du PACBV (an analysis of the
CBWM Project’s environmental impact), done at the end of the CBWM Project in March
2013.
Analysis of CBWM Project
6.     The CBWM Project’s target area covered more than 3,200 hectares and about
45,000 people, most of them extremely poor and vulnerable. Based on the data from
various reports (including those just cited), an estimated 70 percent of the population in
the four watersheds benefited from the project. Note that more than 80 percent of that
population is concentrated in the Beilougue Litama and Greiguel Watersheds.
7.      With respect to the financial analysis, 83.6 percent of subprojects had IRRs
ranging from 13 percent to 63 percent, way above the initial target of 10 percent set
during appraisal. The subprojects contributed positively to improving socioeconomic
conditions in the communities; for example, average IRRs were 15 percent for village
shops, 63 percent for fencing agricultural fields, and 52 percent for village gardens (Table
3.3). Village gardens (with an IRR of 52.6 percent and ERR of 202 percent) and village
shops (with an IRR of 21 percent) are principally owned and managed by women,
offering a good means of income diversification and reinforcing the importance of the
project’s gender-sensitive approach to local development. The ERRs for the ADCs were
above 50 percent in all areas of project intervention. Table 3.4 shows the results for the
two most important natural resource management activities (dikes and bunds).
8.      The results differ from one watershed to the other. This might be due to the nature
of activities or the specificity of the socioeconomic characteristics of the watershed. In
the arid zones such as the Tengharada and Saïla Watersheds, the types of investments

                                                  29
were mainly for fences and earth and stone bunds to facilitate water infiltration and
replenish groundwater tables (nappes d’eau superficielle). The economic and financial
impacts were essentially to increase yields. When surveyed, communities expressed their
satisfaction with the rising levels of water in their wells, the improved productivity, and
the virtual absence of agropastoral conflicts.

9.     All watersheds achieved returns higher than the initial target of 10 percent, but
some watersheds recorded returns exceeding 60 percent. For example, projects in
Greiguel Watershed had a direct beneficiary population of 13,480 among a total of
17,873 inhabitants (in other words, equivalent to more than 75 percent of the population).
The projects yielded 12 tons of produce and created 6,392 seasonal employment
opportunities each year. Among the four categories of beneficiaries—ranging from
highly vulnerable segments of the population (the elderly, female heads of household
without an adult child) to households with large families—incomes ranged from 8,750
MRO per month to 175,000 MRO per month and in all cases exceeded the poverty
threshold. In the Beilougue Litama Watershed, the project significantly increased
monthly incomes from 10,417 to 208,333 MRO. In the humid zones, namely the
Beilougue Litama and Greiguel Watersheds, yields per hectare rose from 0.5 tons per
hectare to more than 1.2 tons per hectare. These communities—thanks to the new sources
of income provided through the project’s activities—willingly accepted to pay for
maintaining the investments. The subprojects financed under the CBWM Project
                                                       30
subprojects responded to demands that were expressed collectively by the communities in
the four watersheds. Ultimately some were not profitable because they were costly to
acquire, with the exception of improved stoves (foyers en banco), which remain
profitable as they are still in use.




                                          31
Analysis by category of subprojects
10.     Village shops. While the project contributed 50 percent of the total investment
(including construction) and the cost of transportation of the initial shop inventory, the
ADCs contributed half of the construction cost and part of the investment capital to stock
the shop. The average rate of return for village shops was 16.22 percent, which is above
the target of 10 percent set during appraisal.
11.     Vaccination structures. The project financed the cost of materials and their
transportation, and the ADCs were responsible for the labor to build the structures. This
intervention was not considered an income-generating activity by the project and was
thus provided at no cost to the community members other than their labor. Now, however,
the communities are considering how to make the structures profitable by introducing a
fee. For that reason, the economic and financial analysis included an assumed charge of
50 MRO per vaccinated animal. The analysis showed an IRR of 13 percent and an ERR
of 16.5 percent, with an ERR for the ADC of 567 percent.
12.     Grazing reserves. The project financed the procurement of the fences, installed
and maintained by the ADCs, which were also responsible for planting the fields. For an
area of 50 hectares, the investment cost for the material is about 4,095,000 MRO and the
cost of labor is estimated at 2,964,000 MRO.
13.    Another scenario envisaged the plantation of acacia gum trees at a rate of 200
seedlings per hectare and an estimated production of 300 grams per tree. The sale price of
gum Arabic is estimated at 1,000 MRO per kilogram. Another possible source of income
is from the sale of tree seed (semences forestières) harvested within the perimeter. The
new trees will start production in Year 6 and continue to produce for an estimated life of
30 years.
14.     The analysis showed a global IRR of 4 percent and an IRR for ADCs of 13
percent, mainly owing to the heavy initial cost of the investment compared to the net
expected results. The investment could be recovered by Year 11, however (in relation to
the total life of 30 years), and over that time the global IRR increases to 15 percent and
ERR to 16 percent. These results may vary, of course, depending on the market price for
gum Arabic and the total cost of the investment.
15.     Fencing for agricultural fields. The project financed the cost of the fencing
materials and the ADCs were responsible for the cost of the labor to build the fences. The
returns were calculated based on an estimated life of 10 years for the fencing, provided
that fences received regular maintenance of about 15 man-days per hectare per year. The
production of sorghum in fenced fields was 600 kilograms per hectare (at an average
price of 200 MRO per kilogram), and cowpea production was 200 kilograms per hectare
(at an average price of 1,000 MRO per kilogram).

provided the initial stock of seed, phytosanitary products, and small agricultural
equipment. The ADC contributed about 25 percent of the total in the form of labor and
replenishment of the stock of inputs. The life of the fence is set at 10 years. The
computation is based on the same value as the financial calculation, replacing the
financial values by economic values if needed. Table 3.6 shows that vegetable gardens
had a global IRR of 52.66 percent, and returns for the ADCs were very high, with an IRR

Conclusions from the Economic and Financial Analysis
18.    Despite the fact that the analysis used a sample, when the results are combined
with the actual observations, we can conclude the following for all project activities.
    i)        Incomes improved in beneficiary communities. The analysis of subprojects
              revealed an IRR between 13 percent and 63 percent, significantly surpassing
              the 10 percent minimum. In fact, the IRR for dikes and thresholds surpassed
              50 percent. All of the subproject activities contributed to improved
              socioeconomic welfare of the population. The vegetable gardens managed by
              the women, with an IRR of 52.66 percent and ERR of 202 percent, are
              especially promising for diversifying sources of income and nutrition and
              reinforce the value of a gender-sensitive approach to local development.
    ii)       The project had positive environmental impacts and increased the
              awareness of strategies to reduce pressure on natural resources. The
              environmental audit found that the project’s activities had no negative effects
              on the equilibrium of the ecosystems involved. In fact, by establishing forest
              reserves and increasing supplies of butane gas, the project reduced pressure on
              natural resources and had a positive impact on the environment.

                                                      33
iii)   The survey of beneficiaries found strong ownership of the investments
       and a commitment to maintaining them. The survey also found that the
       investments were being used properly. These behaviors provide a strong
       indication that the investments will be sustained beyond the life of the project.
iv)    The principal lesson is that the project’s activities were profitable,
       enabling most subprojects to continue without new financing. However,
       the need for credit is still important within and beyond the project areas. In
       this context—and based on the satisfaction of the ADCs—a compelling case
       can be made for replicating this model in other watersheds of Mauritania,
       using the same approaches and emphasizing close support and continuous
       capacity building for beneficiaries.

     Annex 5. Executive Summary of the CBRD Project Beneficiary Survey Results

A beneficiary survey for the baseline CBRD Project, “Evaluation, par les Bénéficiaires,
de l’Impact Social et Economique du PDRC,” was done in April 2008. The following is
the executive summary of the results of that survey.

1.      This final report on the evaluation study conducted with the beneficiaries
concerning the social and economic impact of the project is presented in five parts, as
follows: (i) the Community-Based Rural Development Project (CBRD), and in particular
its objectives, components, and mid-term achievements, as well as the objectives of the
present evaluation mission conducted with the beneficiaries; (ii) the methodology
followed, in particular with respect to the participatory evaluation; (iii) a succinct
description of the progress made by the evaluation mission; (iv) presentation and analysis
of the results from the beneficiaries' evaluations; and (v) the conclusions and
recommendations of the consultant who, to a large extent, adopts the suggestions and
recommendations expressed by the beneficiaries encountered during the mission.
Presentation of the Community-Based Rural Development Project (CBRD)
2.      The objectives of the project and its organization into three components are
widely known among readers. We will therefore summarize it briefly by recalling that the
project strategy is based on a participatory approach, which encourages the
decentralization process in the country through the establishment of Community
Development Associations (ADCs) and the development of their capabilities as well as
those of the targeted rural municipalities. This approach supports local development
through the establishment of community development plans via the facilitating
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as well as the direct transfer of funds to the
ADCs and the communities to enable them to implement subprojects with a socio-
collective or economic impact on the population, in particular disadvantaged groups and
especially women, with a view to reducing poverty.
3.      Among the many achievements, we will mention only the creation of 843 ADCs
(including 693 new ones) out of the 850 anticipated associations (150 of which involve
resumption of the pilot project—the PGRNP 11—and support for the official recognition
of 682 of the 693 new ADCs, management training for nearly 3,000 officials from 822
ADCs, 1,638 individuals belonging to 619 ADCs dealing with gender and the
environment, and 202 facilitators from NGOs and research departments responsible in
particular for carrying out the participatory activities of the Community Development
Plans and Community Initiative Projects.
4.      With respect to the subprojects, current results are less spectacular due to the fact
that this component could not in fact begin until after the ADCs had been set up.
Nevertheless, according to the CCU, of the approximately 3,000 subprojects to be
completed by the end of the project in 2010, the completion rate is on the order of 40
percent and the disbursements made to ADC subprojects reached nearly 3.4 billion MRO.

5.      The present mission was responsible for evaluating (via the beneficiaries) the
social and economic impact of the actions taken by the CBRD, identifying the principal
lessons learned and the strengths and weaknesses of the CBRD, and on the basis of those
analyses, proposing suitable corrective measures to be taken in response to the problems
and constraints identified.
Methodology Followed by the Consultant and Mission Operation
6.       Following several sessions devoted to working with the CCU, assembling and
reviewing project documentation, defining the sample of ADCs and beneficiaries to be
covered by the survey, and providing additional training to the field teams (consisting of
two researchers, each with one assistant researcher), the consultant visited 67 ADCs
distributed over the 10 wilayas (administrative regions) in the intervention zone covered
by the project. As a result, he was able to visit 135 subprojects representing 21 of the 24
types of physical investments implemented by the ADCs, and he was able to interview
the other stakeholders involved in carrying out the project, including regional,
departmental, and municipal administrative authorities, representatives from the
facilitating NGOs, officials from the regional coordination units (RCUs) and their mobile
technical assistants (MTAs) responsible for activities at the ADC level, agricultural
services (regional delegates, departmental inspectors, and agricultural extension agents
for the ABVs, who are responsible for providing technical support to the ADCs), small
local businesses responsible for carrying out the subprojects, and various prominent
persons, opinion leaders, and other resource persons.
7.      The impact study consisted of the beneficiaries’ evaluation of the project, based
on qualitative and participatory survey techniques. A key feature of this socio-
anthropological approach is that it enables the populations surveyed to become actors in
the analysis of their own situation. This form of interactive participation involves the
exchange of information and creates positive dynamics with regard to the participants'
expertise and local knowledge, which should enable the populations in question to
express their own perspective.
8.      Thus the evaluation methodology adopted by the consultant in the field gave
preference to semi-structured meetings and interviews. In villages with a ADC, focus
groups (for women, men, and mixed) were organized to collect information on
participants’ experiences (127 focus groups organized in 67 ADCs visited). Participation
was considerable: 851 individuals, including 535 women, attended. Meanwhile, 30
household stories were gathered, which, on the basis of an average number of eight (8)
members per household, accounted for approximately 240 individuals.
Results
9.      The results of this evaluation enabled the consultant, in accordance with the
Terms of Reference of the study, to make accurate statements about the impact of the
project on the beneficiaries, identify the principal lessons learned and the strengths and
weaknesses of the community experience, and on the basis of that analysis propose
suitable corrective measures for the problems and constraints identified.
10.    For capacity building (Component A of the project), the objectives were fully
achieved in all ADCs, in large part because the activities occurred when the ADCs were

                                            38
set up. The physical investments made by the ADCs are unfinished, however. Many
subprojects have not been started or are still being set up. Consequently, very few
beneficiaries have real experience of one year or more with operational subprojects,
about which they can provide an opinion.
11.     This limited experience is particularly true for subprojects involving small market
gardens, rehabilitated wells, grain mills, fencing to protect cropped areas, and community
stores. Although beneficiaries’ appraisal of these subprojects was included in the analysis
of the results, these subprojects have not been operating for more than two years, and it is
therefore too early to conduct an economic and financial analysis subprojects and
calculate the IRR and NPV. To be truly relevant, such an analysis must be based on
actual numerical data and not on assumptions about future revenues and expenditures.
12.       The results can be summarized by component as follows:
      •   With regard to capacity building, all beneficiaries report an undeniable positive
          impact arising from the creation of the ADCs and the training provided
          (especially in management, procurement, other procedures, and gender), as well
          as from the strengthened social cohesion and solidarity, especially with regard to
          the poorest households in the villages. This capacity building has a particular
          impact on the women. They are becoming aware of their roles and responsibilities
          with regard to community development and wish to become involved in economic
          and social activities, in particular through women’s cooperatives, which offer
          management and marketing training that they appreciate. Weaknesses identified
          by the beneficiaries included the low representation of women in the senior
          management of ADCs and in the training sessions, as well as the very low literacy
          among ADC officials and members of the various committees formed at that level.
      •   The majority of ADCs reported that the impact of the activities entrusted to
          outside partners was clearly weaker. Extension agents responsible for agricultural
          services were rarely on site, and their technical skills were often disputed, in
          particular in relation to income-generating activities. When these personnel were
          placed under the supervision of the regional representative of MDRE, they
          complained that their travel allowances (by motorcycle) could be used only for
          their ADC-based projects. They also criticized the late payments for their
          compensation and expenses and suggested that they be covered by the project.
          The MTAs working with the RCUs were criticized for showing little concern for
          the activities of the ADCs and devoting the bulk of their time to drafting the RCU
          co-funding agreements with the ADCs. The RCUs themselves generally admit
          that this is the case and justify the situation by referring to the limited competence
          of the ADCs and in particular the low literacy rate.
      •   RCU officials consider the impact of the project to be very positive, while
          admitting that subprojects have been implemented slowly. Without these delays,
          the impact might already be more perceptible, in particular the impact on poverty
          reduction through the work of the ADCs. RCU officials point out the extent of
          their intervention zone, which covers a large number of ADCs, and their lack of
          equipment in terms of logistics. While congratulating themselves over the fact
          that they have been called upon to carry out the subprojects, local micro and small

                                               39
       businesses are anxious for the training and small equipment promised to them by
       the project. However, these subprojects should now begin as soon as possible.
       Finally, local elected officials appreciate the impact of the project, which is
       already visible in villages with ADCs compared to villages without them. They
       suggest a greater involvement on the part of municipalities, in particular to ensure
       the sustainability of the subprojects at the end of the intervention. However, they
       are aware that the project anticipates that support will be provided to
       municipalities once the nature of this support and in particular the required
       training, have been clearly defined with regard to 10 pilot municipalities.
   •   The beneficiaries unanimously appreciate the impact of the subprojects and
       investments (Component B) and acknowledge that they have had a social and
       economic impact and, in some cases, an environmental impact. The subprojects
       involved investments of a socio-collective nature on the one hand and investments
       of a largely economic nature (in particular income-generating activities) on the
       other. Their results and the impact on beneficiaries can be summarized as follows:
           •   The impact of socio-collective investments (including irrigation schemes,
               measures to improve access, village hydraulic structures, fencing
               agricultural areas, and enclosures and cattle inoculation centers) are fully
               appreciated wherever such facilities are operational. The hydraulic
               structures are greatly appreciated, in particular by women, who now have
               access to clean water and note improved health among children in
               particular (seen in a decline in the incidence of diarrhea). Women also
               appreciate the time savings; rather than spending time providing drinking
               water, women are increasingly available to participate in cooperatives and
               engage in market farming, sewing, dyeing, or weaving, all of which are
               likely to provide them with income. The same holds true for men once the
               crop areas have been fenced in: Yields increase and men no longer have to
               spend time keeping an eye on the crops. Finally, the impact of the
               enclosures and inoculation centers is very much appreciated by all
               breeders, who say that their animals are healthier and production has
               increased considerably.
           •   Income-generating activities are in high demand. All beneficiaries see
               their immediate impact (especially grain mills, community stores, the
               availability of horticultural equipment) on part of the community (in
               particular women and the poorest), if not the entire community. The only
               reservations expressed by the beneficiaries concerned the limited number
               of income-generating activities implemented and the absence of other
               types of income-generating activities from the project (such as grain banks
               and wire fencing manufacturing facilities).
13.     Overall, the project’s impact is largely positive and clearly visible to the
beneficiaries despite certain delays, in particular with the physical investments. For the
beneficiaries, these deficiencies do not mean that the project or its activities lack impact
but rather that it can be improved through their suggestions and proposals to intensify and
extend its activities and investments during the second half of the CBRD (2008–10).


                                            40
14.     Finally, using notes taken by beneficiaries during the evaluation, especially the
127 focus groups organized within the 67 ADCs, the consultant attempted to highlight
beneficiaries’ opinion about the degree to which three performance indicators adopted by
the project were reached: (i) at the end of the project, at least 80 percent of the ADCs had
a satisfactory operational capability; (ii) at least 75 percent of the ADCs were
satisfactorily managing and maintaining their equipment; and (iii) 80 percent of the
communities were satisfied with the agricultural services offered to them.
15.       To date (at mid-term), the results of this analysis can be summarized as follows:
      •   Of the focus group participants, 53.8 percent deemed the organizational capability
          of their ADC satisfactory (the other 46.3 percent considered that this capability
          would be easily achieved if the project intensified and extended its management
          training activities for the benefit of the ADCs and invested in literacy training).
      •   The management and upkeep of the equipment was deemed satisfactory by 76.3
          percent of participants (the remaining 42.8 percent considered that the
          sustainability of some technical equipment required special training for
          beneficiaries).
      •   On the other hand, 90.2 percent of participants are currently dissatisfied with the
          services offered by the agricultural services (only 10.8 percent are relatively
          satisfied, while at the same time considering that the staff of the agricultural
          services, and in particular the ADCs, need training focused on project activities,
          primarily the income-generating activities and market farming).
16.    The statistical series used for calculating these overall averages as well as a
graphic representation of the achievement rate for these three indicators are the subject of
Annex 10 in the main report.
17.      Thus the beneficiaries consulted believe that the first two indicators are easily
achievable by the end of the project if the suggested changes are adopted. However,
achieving the indicator relating to the provision of agricultural services will require not
only significant improvements in appropriate training, in particular as regards the
activities implemented by the ADCs (and especially as regards income-generating
activities and market farming), but also increased motivation and availability among the
staff responsible for agricultural advice. These suggestions are included in the
recommendations.
Conclusions
18.       The consultant arrived at the following specific conclusions:
      •   Overall, the objectives of the beneficiary evaluation were achieved. The
          beneficiaries deemed that the social and economic impact of the CBRD Project
          was satisfactory and relevant to the pre-project situation, with everyone, and in
          particular women, concurring that poverty, and especially extreme poverty, is in
          decline.
      •   The participatory approach is suitable to the context, and the ADCs are equipped
          with an appropriate intervention structure. They are recognized under the law and,
          for the most part, testify to a dynamic and motivation largely acknowledged by

                                              41
       the beneficiaries and confirmed by the monitoring of project performance
       indicators.
   •   The sustainability of the community subprojects and the ADCs themselves thus
       seems assured, even if many beneficiaries request additional capacity building,
       especially in the management and maintenance of investments. Beneficiaries are
       certain that the weaknesses they point out are due to the illiteracy often
       encountered among ADC officials and to the limited representation of women in
       positions of responsibility.
   •   The impact of the project via the subprojects as well as that of the socio-collective
       and economic investments is confirmed by all of the stakeholders. In particular,
       these investments have an impact on disadvantaged groups, including women in
       general and in particular poor women or female heads of household (through
       hydraulic structures, the support of their cooperatives, and community stores),
       small farmers relying only on their unirrigated plot (diéri) through the protection
       of their fields, and the small cattle breeders through the construction of pens and
       inoculation centers. This impact affects social, human, and economic capital as
       well as the standards of living of the beneficiaries.
19.    The beneficiary evaluation thus clearly indicates that the project has had an
indisputable social and economic impact. Within the remaining three years of the CBRD
and prior to its closure, it may be possible to remedy the weaknesses identified and to
overcome the delays noted, in particular in relation to the completion of some subprojects,
provided all the stakeholders contribute effectively.
Recommendations
20.     The recommendations are grouped by component and not presented in any order
of priority. The most important ones relate to strengthening capabilities (Component A):
   •   In general, improve the flow of information (in both directions) and strengthen
       follow-up through more frequent visits as well as by scheduling quarterly
       meetings with ADC officials at the departmental level. Both recommendations
       must go hand-in-hand with a strengthening of the human and logistical
       capabilities of the RCUs.
   •   Strengthen training and repeat the management training already provided in order
       to improve the operation of ADC offices and committees and expand these to
       other beneficiaries beside the three or four previously trained managers. In
       addition, set up certified training programs dealing with other topics, including
       the management and maintenance of subprojects, the follow-up and evaluation of
       activities in the ADCs, and the management of natural resources.
   •   In accordance with the request made by all categories of beneficiaries, it is highly
       recommended that the project become involved in functional literacy training in
       all the ADCs where such initiatives have not already been undertaken by other
       stakeholders.
   •   It is suggested that information, education, and communication campaigns be set
       up to benefit all of the ADC village populations on cross-cutting themes such as

                                            42
    health, water and sanitation, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, and hydro-agricultural
    structures.
•   In addition to the development-oriented training programs already carried out, it is
    recommended to introduce training aiming at women as well as measures that will
    ensure their more effective participation in the development process and their
    access to positions of responsibility.
•   In the event that some ADCs operate under a deficit, the consultant recommends
    that officials be reelected and/or that some office and committee officials be
    replaced with a view to having dynamic and literate executives residing in the
    locality and ensuring better representation of women.
•   Improving the services provided (both in terms of quality and quantity) by the
    agricultural service agents is essential and depends on solving their problems
    (such as delayed payments) and strengthening their technical capabilities, in
    particular for the purpose of guaranteeing that their interventions will be
    continued once the project ends.
•   Appropriate training of MTAs is recommended to intensify the activities of the
    ADC villages. In parallel, strengthening the capabilities of the ADCs should
    lighten the administrative load for these ADCs and make them more amenable to
    enhancing these activities.
•   A thorough follow-up of the facilitating NGO staff appointed to carry out the
    village diagnostics, planning, and Community Development Plans is essential.
•   The training and equipment scheduled for the MPERs should be implemented
    diligently with a view to accelerating the execution of project investments via the
    ADCs.
•   A detailed study will be a suitable approach to better identifying the sustainability
    of the structures implemented by the project (ADC, subprojects, activity and
    technical advisory activities) within the perspective of the project coming to an
    end.
•   A further recommendation relates to defining the capacities required by
    municipalities to become more meaningfully involved (as provided for in 10-
    municipality pilot) in ensuring follow-up of ADC activities, in particular the
    income-generating activities, a desire expressed by the elected officials as well as
    their sponsor (MDAT).
•   The consultant recommends that synergies with other projects and programs
    involved in the CBRD’s intervention zone be enhanced to prevent the duplication
    of effort while ensuring wider impact on poverty reduction at the commune level
    (not limited to the ADC villages).
•   Finally, it is highly recommended that project documents (including procedural
    and Community Development Plan manuals) intended for the ADCs be available
    in the local languages ADC, given that ADC officials commonly do not know
    French.

                                         43
21.     For Component B, which covers the investments and subprojects implemented by
the CBRDP through the ADCs, the recommendations reflect the observations of many
beneficiaries. Specifically, beneficiaries suggested that the sustainability of subprojects
be ensured, their pace of development accelerated, the number of subprojects increased to
enhance their impact on the entire population of ADC villages, and the subprojects,
particularly the income-generating activities, be diversified to continually increase their
impact on the communities, especially disadvantaged groups and households, as follows:
   •   Ensure sustainability by improving the diligent development of subprojects,
       initially by supporting the activities under Component A. For a number of
       projects, the creation of employment and service manuals should also be included.
   •   Certain types of investment, with an assured demand and impact, could be
       multiplied (particularly the ADCs), subject to the availability of financing and an
       equitable distribution between the ADCs and the wilayas in the intervention areas.
   •   Other types of subprojects, such as fence-making workshops, the training of
       additional veterinarians, and the creation of grain banks, should be implemented,
       provided that the types of subprojects proposed do not contradict the project
       strategy and that their impact is positive.
   •   Investments targeting environmental protection should also be increased, because
       only reforestation and the creation of deferred grazing or woodland areas (few and
       far between at the moment) have a clear environmental impact. The outlets for
       selling butane gas represent a means of conserving fuel wood, but the high price
       of butane gas compared to collected fuel wood makes such outlets difficult to
       develop in a rural setting that remains very poor.
22.    For Component C, which essentially involves project M&E and the acceptable
operation of the central and decentralized structures of the CBRD, recommendations for
human resources and RCU logistics were made in the context of Component A. Notably,
the beneficiaries had recommendations to make in the matter of M&E:
   •   These recommendations particularly concern the relatively slow pace of M&E,
       essentially due to weak communication (insufficient circulation of information in
       both directions). Communication will improve through the implementation of
       proposals already made in the context of Component A.
   •   Beneficiaries agree that the scorecard is not very appropriate to the needs of
       MTAs or ADCs. The consultant believes that this perception arises above all from
       beneficiaries’ incomplete understanding and recommends that project-specific
       training and possibly translation of the scorecard into the national languages.
   •   Finally, the experience in local development of the ADCs and the project in
       general should be publicized regionally and nationally to benefit other projects
       and structures operating as part of local development projects. In the context of
       the new decentralization policy, the CBRD should do more to assert its
       competencies like other programs and projects supported by multilateral and
       bilateral development partners.

The Borrower’s ICR for the CBWM Project, “Projet d’Amenagement Communautaire
des Bassins Versants: Rapport d’Achèvement” (April 2013), is summarized here.

1.     The government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania requested and obtained
GEF financing to prepare a Community-Based Watershed Management Project (CBWM)
that complements the Rural Community Development Project (CBRD) financed by an
IDA credit (3883-MAU). It obtained financing in the amount of US$ 6 million. Table 7.1
presents the project timeline.

I.       OBJECTIVES
2.      The overall objective is to limit soil degradation and to conserve the vital
functions of the ecosystems through sustainable soil management efforts at the
community level. This will help improve agropastoral and silvopastoral management and
increase vegetation cover while procuring the means of subsistence and ecological
benefits to the local communities through the reduction of sedimentary deposits in
waterways, improved interconnection and integrity of ecosystems, an increase in carbon
storage rates, and new conservation and biodiversity opportunities.
3.      The development objective of the project is to attenuate the occurrence of soil
degradation at the watershed level in the CBRD area by helping local communities create
incomes through local investments in remedying soil degradation and by promoting
sustainable soil management practices.
4.      The overall environmental goal of this GEF project is to introduce management
practices at the local level to limit soil degradation and desertification and to conserve
ecosystem functions.
5.      With these objectives in mind, the following actions will be supported by the GEF
alternative scenario:
     •   Putting in place a scientifically and technically viable watershed management
         method that integrates socioeconomic dynamics.
     •   Development of this method through the training of project participants and local
         investments; and dissemination of results from pilot sites on a larger scale.
6.     The project consists of three components: (a) capacity building; (b) community
investment funding; and (c) management, monitoring, and evaluation.




                                            46
II.        PROJECT SETUP
7.      On behalf of the Government of Mauritania, the Ministry of Rural Development
and the Environment (Ministère du Développement Rural et de l'Environnement, MDRE)
is responsible for the implementation and supervision of the CBWM.
8.         The plan's institutional framework includes:
       •   CBWM Steering Committee: This committee is tasked with ensuring coherence
           and avoiding duplication. The Steering Committee is the same Steering
           Committee as the CBRD Steering Committee.
       •   Central Coordination Unit for the project (CCU): This unit will be responsible
           for the RCPD and the performance of the CBWM.
       •   Scientific and Technical Committee (SCT): The CBWM is equipped with a
           Scientific and Technical Committee responsible for research-related issues and
           the approval of scientific work.
       •   Decentralized Regional Coordination Unit (RCU): This decentralized structure
           of the RCPD is responsible for the management of the CBWM at the regional
           level (wilaya).
       •   Regional Development Committee (RDC): This committee is presided over by
           the regional governor (wali). It selects the sites within the approved watershed
           areas and supervises the regional program. In addition to the regional governor,
           the RDC includes the technical divisions and other development structures.
       •   Local public communities and supervisory role: The State and community-based
           central and local technical divisions must play an important role in both the
           RCPD and the CBWM.
       •   ABVs are the principal CBWM executing agencies.
III.       MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS
9.      The main achievements are a function of the conceptual framework indicated at
the start of the project and the agreed upon components.
Evaluation of the Results Matrix (Logframe)
10.     The performance of the CBWM Project is Satisfactory. All three (3) key
indicators of project results were attained.
Evaluation of Components
Component A: CAPACITY BUILDING
11.     The goal of this component is to set up the ABVs and build their capacities as
well as those of the project officers and the technical divisions charged with assisting the
ABVs. An additional goal is to adopt a new culture for watershed management focused
on the development and transfer of sustainable land management technologies, including
local management practices.
Selection of Watershed Areas and Establishment of ABVs


                                               47
12.     Due to the political context (the political transition that followed the 2005 coup), a
significant amount of time was devoted to the initial selection of two pilot watershed
areas (Greiguel and Tengharada) in 2006 and two more (Beilougue Litama and Saïla) in
2008.
13.      This selection was based on the agro-environmental context of the country,
namely a watershed basin in an oasis system (Tengharada, in Adrar), a watershed basin in
the predominantly agricultural zone (Beilougue Litama, in Gorgol), a watershed basin in
the agropastoral zone (Greiguel, in Assaba), and a watershed basin in the pastoral zone
(Saïla, in Hodh Chargui).
14.    An ABV was set up in each watershed basin using a participatory process. Each
association has legal status and recognition and is composed of 12 members. Depending
on each case, the ABV has specialized committees, such as a communication and
monitoring committee, a committee of advisors (council of elders), a purchasing
committee, and an approval committee. Each association was given an activity book (as a
monitoring device) in which to describe its activities. The extension agents assigned to
each watershed area assist the association in maintaining this activity book.
Training
15.    A total of 507 persons participated in the training—298 men (59 percent) and 209
women (41 percent), including Watershed Association members, technicians, and CBRD
and CBWM team members—on a variety of themes, including water and soil
conservation techniques, an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP),
vegetation type and index, making soap, making cereamine, 12 and improved cooking
methods, and geographic information systems (GIS).
Other, more targeted training was also completed, including:
       •   Two training sessions for the CBWM technical manager on strategic
           environmental evaluation and environmental monitoring.
       •   Workshop for exchanging experiences among the ABVs of Beilougue Litama,
           Grieguel, Saïla, and Tengharada, held in Greiguel Watershed.
       •   Training for the CBWM accountant on internal auditing.
       •   Training for the Director of Administration and Finance on management
           techniques.
       •   Training for the Procurement Assistant on contract monitoring and management.
       •   Training for the Watershed Association monitoring committees on how to fill out
           the association activity books and the scorecard for the Greiguel, Beilougue
           Litama, and Saïla Watersheds.
16.    Six project managers undertook study tours focusing on watershed management
to Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Tunisia. The institutions visited included ICARDA in
Tunisia, CILSS headquarters and PGNT in Burkina Faso, and ICRISAT and


12
     A high-energy flour made from maize, beans, rice, millet, and groundnuts.

                                                      48
AGHRYMET in Nigeria. The site visits significantly contributed to a better
understanding of the vision for watershed planning and management.
Studies and Research
17.    The CBWM conducted several studies, drew up documents (including
management plans and local agreements), and produced an environmental impact study, a
subproject socioeconomic impact evaluation, and an environmental management guide. It
should be noted that the management plans and the guide constitute an innovation in
Mauritania.
18.       The details of the studies are as follows:
      •   Four core studies: biophysical, soil degradation, socioeconomic, and institutional
          for the first two pilot watersheds (Greiguel and Tengharada).
      •   Watershed Management Plans (Saïla, Beilougue, Tengharada and Greiguel)
          approved by the beneficiaries, local elected officials, decentralized technical
          divisions, and the authorities.
      •   Drafting and adoption of two local agreements on the management of natural
          resources for two watersheds (Beilougue Litama and Greiguel) in the presence of
          the administrative authorities and the beneficiary communities, local elected
          officials, and technicians.
      •   The environmental and social management guide was approved in February 2011
          in the presence of development partners (MDRE, MEDD, equipment and
          transport, UNDP, GTZ, NGOs, and so on). This guide, which constitutes the first
          document dealing in practical terms with the environmental and social
          management of rural community subprojects, was translated from French into
          Arabic and distributed to all partners and the ABVs of the watersheds involved;.
      •   Procedural and performance manuals, M&E manuals, and social and
          environmental safeguard polices for the CBRD were updated to conform to
          CBWM requirements.
Component B: COMMUNITY INVESTMENT FUND
19.    This component dealt with providing village communities with investment capital
through the Local Investment Fund to encourage the adoption of sustainable conservation
and natural resource management practices for the watersheds across communities.
Activities Completed
20.     Action plans were created through an intercommunity organization within each
watershed area through work zones maintained by the ABVs together with the CBWM.
The work zones were chosen based on the spatial distribution of villages within the
watershed and their proximity to the other intercommunity work sites identified. The
implementation of the 2011–12 action plans took into account the Watershed Association
action plans during the approval process for the management plans in May 2011 for the
Saïla, Greiguel, and Beilougue Litama watershed areas.
21.       Table 7.2 summarizes the actions taken under those plans.

Water and soil conservation
22.      The building of water and soil conservation structures—stone barriers, filtering
dikes, half-moons, retardation thresholds (bunds), earthen dikes, and deferred grazing—
made it possible to recover land stripped and degraded by wind erosion and water runoff.
Increases in biomass were recorded for sites selected for water and soil conservation and
for soil protection and restoration.
23.     After three years of implementation, a tangible increase in biomass production
was evident at the reforested sites. The average percentage increase in biomass at the
combined sites is 31.26 percent, which shows that the initial target of the project’s
framework of 25 percent was met. (Note: 2008–09 was the reference year for calculating
any biomass production increase.) This increase may be attributed to the combined
effects of water and soil conservation structures and fencing.
24.    The planning process enabled local beneficiaries, elected officials, and the various
administrations and technicians involved with the project to devise appropriate methods
for regenerating degraded land (deferred grazing and completion of water and soil
conservation projects).
25.     The agricultural areas protected by metal fences (5,537 hectares over 69
agricultural zones) responded to the major concerns of the Watershed Association
members. In addition to providing food security, the agricultural enclosures constitute
collective and non-tradable assets. In a land management context where disputes are
common and complex, fencing is a tool for pre-emptive conflict management between
livestock herders and farmers within the community.

26.    Gender. The project financed specific activities within the ABVs to reduce rural
women’s vulnerability by providing financing to women’s groups to undertake income-
generating activities in support of proper management of natural resources, including
   •   Providing fencing and farm inputs for 39 groups of women vegetable farmers.
   •   Providing 1,000 dual-purpose metal ovens that can burn charcoal or wood more
       efficiently and help to conserve these resources, which are steadily being depleted
       in these watersheds.
   •   Opening stores to sell butane gas to reduce pressure on fuel wood collection and
       reduce the women’s daily burden.
   •   Promoting the use of improved clay ovens (accessible to all households) to reduce
       the use of fuel wood.
   •   Training women to make soap from forest products (Balanites aegyptiaca) and to
       make cereamine (a supplemental, more nutritious food source for children and the
       elderly).
   •   Introduction of solar-powered water pumps to replace two pedal-operated pumps.
       These solar-powered pumps made it possible to build raised tanks and standpipes
       and are the pride of many women and children in the Greiguel Watershed. Pedal-
       pumping is now only an unhappy memory for women, who could miscarry as a
       result of pedaling, and for the elderly, who were unable to draw even one liter of
       water without the help of young people.
   •   Providing solar panels to light Watershed Association offices permitted nighttime
       meetings and enabled schoolchildren to do their homework assignments after dark.
Other Specific Activities
27.    The Lake Libher Fishermen’s Association (Greiguel) benefited from equipment,
including canoes and fishing nets that improved fishing conditions on the lake, where
fishermen were using tree trunks to cross the lake to fish.
28.     The Beilougue Litama Watershed Association received welding equipment to
repair frequently used agricultural implements in this mainly agricultural watershed.
29.    By raising critical feeder road crossings in the watershed area, communities
in the watersheds had greater mobility in the rainy season. This activity is particularly
appreciated by the mayors of rural communities in the watershed area due to the
numerous trips they must make within their jurisdiction.
Component C: PROJECT MANAGEMENT, MONITORING, AND
EVALUATION
30.    Management. Under the guidance of MDRE, project operations are centrally
managed by the CCU for the project and by MDRE extension agents within the
watershed areas.
31.    The CCU assumes the responsibility for the technical and financial execution of
the project. It prepares annual work plans and budgets for the execution of project
components and annual procurement plans. These plans were submitted to and approved

                                           51
by the steering committee and the Bank. The CCU gave particular attention to the
investments intended for the ABVs and to monitoring and evaluating agreed upon annual
programs.
32.    The statements of expenses submitted for reimbursement from the special
accounts and all of the Fund Withdrawal Applications (Demande de Retraits de Fonds,
DRF) were fully approved (source: DRF). All of the actions recommended to strengthen
CBWM accounting and financial management were fully completed.
33.     Monitoring and evaluation. Periodic reports were produced on schedule, with
quarterly and annual reports now available. The ABVs used their activity books to
monitor their activities with the assistance of extension agents.
34.   The various supervisory missions were performed and their recommendations
implemented. However, it should be noted that the M&E tools for CBWM were not
completely integrated in the CBRD database in the coherent fashion required.
Environmental and Social Safeguards
35.     At preparation, the CBWM financed the adaptation of the CBRD safeguard
framework plans (ESMP, PCR, PCGPP) to the CBWM context, to identify and mitigate
any negative environmental and social effects associated with the implementation of
subprojects. A screening checklist was developed, published, and used to closely examine
the subprojects in terms of their social and environmental value and to manage their
potential impacts so that mitigation measures can be developed if needed.
36.     In addition, an environmental and social management guide was created for the
preparation, development, and operational phases of the subprojects. It was widely
distributed through the training sessions, especially those offered to the ABVs. This guide
was approved by a workshop involving all of the development partners working in rural
settings.
Communication
37.    The CBWM communication component was included under CBRD and handled
all awareness-raising activities for ABVs, including media broadcasts, press articles, and
brochures in the national languages. Specifically, the creation and approval of land use
plans and local agreements led to awareness-raising sessions with photographs
reproduced in large format by the CBWM and the consulting teams. An image bank was
created to make it possible to visualize the destruction of small dikes by runoff and
erosion, brush fires, illegal logging, and the destructive distillation of wood and charcoal
making. This image bank was used as part of awareness-raising sessions.
COMMUNITY MICROPROJECT IMPACTS
38.    The CBWM hired two consultants to conduct two impact studies: an
environmental impact study and an evaluation of the impact of subprojects.




                                            52
Environmental Impact Study
39.     This study concluded that the negative impacts of the project are not very
significant. It shows that the beneficiaries have a particular interest in the project with
respect to its impact on the restoration of soils and natural resources and the improvement
of their quality of life.
40.   The communities’ perceptions of the environmental impact after project
implementation can be summarized as follows:
      •   Yields increased, and often two harvests could be obtained per year (in Beilougue
          Litama and Greiguel Watersheds), which reduced the pressure on forest resources
          as part of the fight against poverty.
      •   Illnesses associated with water quality became less frequent (in Attawatiya, in the
          Greiguel Watershed).
      •   Rural exodus decreased and now there are positive prospects for development in
          the affected areas.
      •   The natural regeneration of treated and enclosed sites increased, with an
          abundance of once-endangered species as a result of the increased biomass in the
          deferred grazing areas and of anti-erosion measures.
      •   Wild fauna are increasingly observed.
      •   Agricultural itinerancy decreased due to the protected enclosed areas and the
          creation of bunds and dikes, which reduced runoff, allowed agricultural land to
          recover, and increased the area suitable for agriculture.
      •   The pressure on forestry resources from the collection of fuel wood decreased due
          to the introduction of clay and metal stoves.
      •   Conflicts between livestock herders and farmers eased due to the agricultural
          enclosures but also to the community organizations that were set up (the ABVs).
      •   The subprojects are beginning to generate income by increasing agricultural
          production, increasing sales of straw to deferred grazing areas, and increasing
          sales of butane gas.
41.     By way of illustration, the checklists filled out by the ABVs with the assistance of
the extension agents are provided as an appendix.
Evaluation of Socioeconomic Impact
42.       Project activities proved effective, with positive impacts overall, principally:
      •   The community development approach fits in neatly with the rural social and
          economic configuration of the country. It is thus highly pertinent. Through the
          Watershed Associations, communities received support to undertake various
          project activities, notably in the Beilougue and Greiguel Watersheds.
      •   The involvement of the beneficiaries in land use planning and project
          implementation was significant. It reinforced the project approval process as well


                                               53
      as the capacity to service and maintain the infrastructure, which led in turn to the
      implementation of efficient management systems in certain watersheds.
  •   The management methods established in the Watershed Associations in Greiguel
      and Beilougue reinforced the sustainability of project activities.
  •   The impact on livelihoods and welfare of the local population is highly significant,
      in particular in the watershed areas with efficient management systems (Greiguel
      and Beilougue).
  •   The impact of the project on social harmony is significant. In fact, the watershed
      areas where livestock herders and farmers were most often in conflict have not
      recorded any serious conflicts since the project was set up.
  •   The project’s approach can be scaled up, particularly its organizational and
      community dimensions.
IV. PRINCIPAL LESSONS LEARNED
  •   Lesson 1: Improvements in organizational dynamics. The institutional context
      introduced by the CBWM brought change and greater accountability to the
      communities with respect to sustainable natural resource management. This
      lesson is associated with the Watershed Associations, which are increasingly
      becoming the locus for social and institutional dialogue.
      At the social level, there used to be constant conflict in the communities between
      livestock herders and farmers. In response, the ABVs implemented a working
      framework for pre-emptive conflict management. In the Beilougue Litama and
      Greiguel Watersheds, the Maure and Fulani communities bear witness to the fact
      that since the implementation of the ABVs, the two groups have lived more
      peacefully, as they now have a context within which they can work together. As
      the Fulani adage puts it: “When two adults fight, they have not spoken to each
      other.”
      At the institutional level, communities that once feared the regional prefect and
      technical service agents gained greater confidence in calling attention to their
      problems through the Watershed Association office, to which the prefect, the
      municipality, and the technical service agents are increasingly inclined to listen.
  •   Lesson 2: Greater social cohesion. Social cohesion is a major factor in the
      successful management of natural resources. Weak social cohesion caused the
      Tengharada Watershed to remain on the margins of CBWM investment for a long
      time; in fact, it took three long years of mediation to start setting up subprojects.
  •   Lesson 3: Accountability. The communities now understand that the local
      agreements constitute a tool for managing conflicts and development.
  •   Lesson 4: Ownership. Watershed management tools were created (including land
      use plans, environmental management guides, and local agreements). These
      constitute innovative assets in Mauritania. However, ownership by the ministries
      in charge of environment and rural development is modest, principally due to the
      low level of cross-sectoral dialogue, misalignment of planning tools, and poor

                                           54
    local availability of human resources. In this respect, it seems that the notion of
    SLM requires more time to become a development practice.
•   Lesson 5: Technical solutions. The bunds to prevent runoff are the most
    appreciated technique used to restore degraded lands, since they add value in the
    form of water that can be used to irrigate agricultural land. The added value
    provided by these thresholds in terms of increased agricultural production augurs
    well for the maintenance—or even the extension—of this type of activity among
    farmers in the watersheds. With respect to deferred grazing areas and water and
    soil conservation processes, the increase in biomass can be used on a large scale
    by structures with significant financial resources, including the activities of
    private livestock breeders or specific projects, to restore vast pastoral areas to
    profitable livestock breeding, which is an essential (even indispensable) sector in
    Mauritania.
•   Lesson 6: Intercommunity cooperation. The watershed institutional space often
    brings together several communities, mayors, legislators, and other community
    partners as well as the prefecture. All activities require considerable discussion
    time (sometimes to the detriment of taking action within the frequently tight
    timeframe of the agricultural calendar).
•   Lesson 7: Project duration. The project’s five-year timeframe should have been
    longer for such a complex watershed management pilot, given the complications
    arising in discussions with potential partners in setting up financing and
    monitoring and evaluating results. This situation was made more difficult by
    political upheaval. As a result, significant difficulties were encountered in the
    domain of M&E. A longer timeframe would allow better evaluation of the
    activities conducted as part of the project, such as effects of thresholds at mid-
    term, production of ligneous vegetation, capacity building for ABVs in
    implementing local agreements, and water table monitoring.

 Annex 10. Overall Environmental Benefits of Activities under the CBWM Project

1.      As stated, the project achieved the GEO, “to limit land degradation and to
safeguard critical ecosystem functions through community-driven sustainable land
management (SLM) activities that improve agrosilvopastoral management and increase
vegetation cover while securing livelihoods and global environmental benefits.” It
achieved targets for all three core indicators. ABVs now manage and maintain inter-
communal SLM investments; about 64 percent (106 of 169) subprojects generate income
for the beneficiaries; and based on the assessment of 13 trail sites where SLM practices
were introduced, an increase in biomass of about 31 percent was observed. Most
intermediate indicators were also achieved (see Table 1 in the main section of this report
for details).

Total Project Financing

3.      The actual total cost, of both CBRD and CBWM Projects, was US$ 58.9 million.
With respect to the GEF financing, the actual disbursement was 94.4 percent. Table 10.2
shows total project financing (both for the baseline CBRD and the GEF CBWM Projects).
As stated, counterpart funding was an issue for both projects. Table 10.2 shows that at the
projects’ closing, the counterpart funds received amounted to 87 percent for the CBRD
Project and 27 percent for CBWM Project.

Overall Impact of the Project
4.      The main environmental benefits of the CBWM Project consisted, among others,
of the following:
    •   The creation of water and soil conservation devices (stone barriers, filtering dikes,
        half-moons, bunds, earthen dikes, and deferred grazing) allowed for the recovery
        of land stripped and degraded by wind erosion and water runoff.

                                               62
•   A tangible increase in biomass at the reforested sites resulted from the
    development and use of anti-erosion techniques, including water and soil
    conservation, soil protection and restoration, and fencing. According to the
    environmental impact study, “the average percentage increase in biomass at the
    combined sites is 31.26 percent, which shows that the initial target of the project’s
    framework of 25 percent was met.” The study also stated that “...the natural
    regeneration of treated and enclosed sites increased, with abundance of once-
    endangered species as a result of the increase in the herbaceous biomass in the
    deferred grazing areas and of anti-erosion measures.…” Wild fauna are now seen.
•   The agricultural enclosures protected with metal fences constitute collective and
    non-tradable assets. They have ensured food security and are a tool for pre-
    emptive conflict management between livestock herders and farmers within the
    community. The watersheds where livestock herders and farmers were most often
    in conflict have not recorded any serious conflicts since the development project
    was set up. The enclosures and the building of bunds to prevent runoff have made
    it possible to recover and expand agricultural area and reduced agricultural
    itinerancy.
•   The introduction of clay and metal stoves reduced the pressure on forest resources.
•   Community subprojects are beginning to generate income through increased
    agricultural production, sales of straw to deferred grazing areas, and sales of
    butane gas.
•   Yields increased, and farmers often obtained two harvests per year (Beylougué-
    Litama and Greiguel Watersheds), which reduced pressure on wood resources as
    part of the fight against poverty.
•   The incidence of water-borne illness declined in Attawatiya, in the Greiguel
    Watershed.
•   Rural exodus decreased. Now there are positive prospects for development in the
    affected areas.
•   The involvement of the beneficiaries in the land use planning and implementation
    helped reinforce not only project approval but also the capacity to service and
    maintain the infrastructure. This in turn led to the implementation of efficient
    management systems in certain watershed areas.
