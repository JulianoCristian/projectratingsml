 Management (CBWM) Project for Mauritania were as follows:\n            risk to global environment outcome was high, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: The positive impact of a project of this\n            nature is the empowerment and ownership demonstrated as\n            management plans are set up and local communities implement\n            them. Important factors to consider in watershed management\n            projects are the timing and manner of creating Associations\n            de Bassins Versants (ABV). Sustainable Land Management (SLM)\n            practices that make additional water available, such as the\n            overflow dams and stone bunds developed through the CBWM\n            Project, should be accompanied by agronomic advice to make\n            the best use of the additional water. This type of project\n            should be reevaluated five to ten years after it closes."}, "docdt": "2014-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
