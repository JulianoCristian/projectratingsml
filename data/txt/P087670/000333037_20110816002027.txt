SUMMARY
This project paper is for a first extension of the original closing date of the above
mentioned GEF project by 12 months, from September 30, 2011 to September, 2012 and
a reallocation of credit proceeds, to support the achievement of the Project Development
Objectives (PDO). The Grant of $6 million of the project was approved by the Board on
June 22, 2006, and became effective on October 20, 2007 with an original closing date of
September 30, 2011. The Recipient, in its letter attached in this memo has requested a 12-
months extension and a reallocation of Grant proceeds among disbursement categories in
the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund Grant Agreement signed on August 28, 2006

This restructuring is level two and will not change the PDO and the results framework of
the project. A copy of the Recipient’s request is attached. If this request is granted, it will
give the Recipient the opportunity to complete the on-going implementation of project
activities, particularly watershed Management plans which got delays due to the
Procurement delays and suspension of IDA disbursements in 2008/09.

The PDO is to limit land degradation and to safeguard critical ecosystem functions
through community-driven SLM activities that improve agro sylvo pastoral management
and increase vegetation cover while securing livelihoods and global environmental
benefits (i.e. reduced sedimentation of waterways, improved interconnectedness and
integrity of ecosystems, enhanced carbon storage rates, and increased opportunities for
biodiversity conservation.

The implementation of the grant has been affected by 14 months of political instability in
the Country which resulted in suspension of IDA disbursements in 2008/09. As a result,
the project experienced delays in most of planned activities, including: preparation of
Watershed Management Plans which was the foundation of project activities;
implementation of sub-projects and the Capacity building Component.

The project has been performing in compliance with the Grant agreement and progress
towards achieving DO was rated moderately satisfactory in January 2011 due to the
delays in the implementation of some component. The recent implementation support
mission carried out in June 2011, rated the DO as satisfactory, due to the real
improvement noted in the execution of main components (investment Funds and capacity
building). The communities are implementing a critical mass of activities, from
Watershed Management Plans, which was rated by them and the Government as
satisfactory with a real impact on the ground.


I confirm that: i) the Objective of the project will continue to be achievable, once the
extension is granted, ii) the Borrow is in compliance with the Bank's financial
management requirements and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial

                                              4
reports from these entities, iii) the Borrow has prepared specific action plans and
schedules acceptable to the Bank to complete the project within the extension period.


PROJECT STATUS
The Project will achieve before the end its Project Development Objective. The
implementation of activities under the various components of the project was affected by
the 14 months suspension of IDA disbursements following the August 2008 military
coup and procurement issues of which took a lot of time.

The project implementation has been rated moderately satisfactory. The performance
ratings of the project have been satisfactory in terms of Implementation Progress (IP).
As of June 30, 2011, the project has disbursed about US$ 2.768 million, 54.68 percent of
the original amount of Grant approved by the Board which is still weak referring to the
Current Closing date. In order to improve disbursement and speed up the project
implementation, the Government identified some priorities as part of the implementation
of the action plan


PROPOSED CHANGES

    •     Closing date

This will be the first extension of the original closing date of the above mentioned GEF
project by 12 months, from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2012.

Rationale for extension: The proposed extension is required to allow the Government to
complete all project activities. This will in particular provide the time and resources to
(i) complete investments program by achieving a critical mass of actions necessary for
the communities; (ii) allow time for technical support for at least one year to the
Watershed Management Associations (ABV) benefitting from funding to implement
their actions plans, (iii) to enhance capacity of beneficiaries in monitoring, coordination
of action and conflict management inherent in the implementation of management of
local rules in natural resources to ensure the sustainability of achievements at the
watershed level.

Please note that the detailed work plan for the one year period of extension is attached to
this memorandum (as required by OP/BP 13.30: Extension of the Closing Date), the
procurement plan for 2012 and the reallocation of resource for the undisbursed amount.
A review of these documents suggests that the activities could be substantially completed
by the requested extension date, thereby ensuring achievement of PDO by September 30,
2012. All audits are current and unqualified.

•       Financing


                                             5
Reallocation of funds: the purpose of the proposed reallocation is to adjust some of the
categories in order to meet the Government’s ongoing and planned commitments by
focusing on priority actions as per the below mentioned work plan and to essentially
better cover communities investments program associated respectively with the Greiguel,
Beiloulgue, Tenghrada and Saila watershed plans. The changes requested will not affect
PDO and results framework.

The project has disbursed, to date, US$ 3,232 million (54.68%) of total amount (6
million). The proposed reallocation of the Grant proceeds is shown in the table below.
Overall the project amount to be reallocated is equivalent to $ 600,000 (10% of Grant)
which is unallocated part of the project.

Civil Works: the overall increase in the category is 0.22% from $10000 to $10130.
Goods: The increase in this category is 6.6% from US$ 360000 to US$ 399,870;
Consultants, Services and audits: The increase in this category is 25% from
unallocated amount;
Grants (Sub-projects): the increase in this category is the biggest part of the
reallocation, 83.33% of the unallocated amount;
The operating costs: there is a decrease of 15% in this category. From 900,000 to
810,000 (15%)
There is no increase from the Training and Workshops categories.
