It\n            would also provide for consulting services for engineering\n            and supervision during procurement and construction. The\n            basic powerhouse construction would be completed during\n            1969-72. Unit 4, the first in the expansion program, would\n            come into service in 1973; the remaining six units would be\n            erected one each year commencing in 1975. The resulting\n            power capacity would meet the market forcast for Guri\n            through 1980."}, "docdt": "1969-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
