INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPI4ENT
REPORT AND RECONkENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
C.V.G. ELECTRIFICACION DEL CARONI, C.A. (EDELCA) IN VENEZUELA
FOR GURI POWERHOUSE EXTENSION
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$31 million to
C.V.G. Electrificacion del Caroni, C.A. (EDELCA).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has previously made two loans to EDELCA for power de-
velopment. The first one (353-VE) was made in 1963 in an amount of $85
million, for construction of the initial stage of Guri Hydroelectric Pro-
ject, including three generating units. There has been some delay in the
completion of the project: the general contractor experienced certain tech-
nical and financial difficulties, additional excavation was needed, work
fell behind schedule, and additional equipment had to be moved on-si.te. A
revised schedule of completion was drawn up, and the Closing Date extended
from March 31, 1968, to September 30, 1969. The first of the three units
was brought into operation in November 1968, and a second unit in April
1969. The last unit is expected to be operational in July 1969.
3.        A second loan (i482-VE) of $15 million was made in January 1967
to help finance the extra-high-voltage transmission line, substations,
and related facilities required for transmitting power from EDELCA's Guri
plant to the major market areas of northern Venezuela. The project is
proceeding well, and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of
this year as originally scheduled.
4.        In addition to these two, a third loan in the power sector
(391-VE) was made in 1964 in the amount of $14 million to Compania Anonima
de Acministracion y Fomento Electrico (CADAFE) to finance the foreign ex-
change costs of a transmission project to integrate two of CADAFE's major
service areas, and interconnect them with the EDELCA hydroelectric plants.
The Government has undertaken to bring about frequency unification between
the government systems and La Electricidad, the major private producer
located in Caracas; and a long-term power sales agreement has been entered
into between EDELCA, CADAFE and La Electricidad. The Bank's lending fcr
power in Venezuela has thus aimed at a coordinated development of this sec-
tor.
5.        Project appraisal was completed in December 1968, and negotia-
tions for the proposed loan took place at the Bank in February 1969.
EDELCA was represented by its President, General Rafael Alfonzo Ravard,



- 2 -
and other members of that organization. Dr. Jose DaLucca, Director, De-
partment of Public Credit, Ministry of Finance, represented the Govern-
ment of Venezuela as the Guarantor.
6.        Under Venezuelan laws the Government cannot enter into loan or
guarantee agreements with the Bank without specific prior authorization
from the Venezuelan Congress. Legislation covering the present loan is
now before the Congress and its approval is expected shortly; this loan
proposal will be placed on the agenda for consideration by the Executive
Directors as soon as the legislation is completed.
7.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Venezuela,
as of May 31, 1969:
Loan                                                    Amount (US$ Million)

8.    In addition to the difficulties experienced in the completion of the
first EDELCA power project (Loan 353-VE) already mentioned, difficulties
have been encountered in the execution of the projects covered by Loans
390-VE and 444-VE.  These have already been commented upon in my Report
and Recommendation  of Nay 26, 1969, to the Executive Directors in connec-
tion with the Third Highway Project in Venezuela (P-706).
9.        A loan of $20 million for the above-mentioned Highway Project
was presented to the Executive Directors on June 10, 1969.
10.       As of March 31, 1969, IFC held net investments (lcan and equity)
in Venezuela totalling US$9.2 million.

PMRT III - THE PROJECT
12.       A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
report entitled "Appraisal of Guri Powerhouse Extension" (PU-6a).
13.       As already mentioned, the first stage of Guri with its three
units is nearing completion. The project now proposed for Bank financ-
ing would include civil works to extend the powerhouse to ten units, and
the installation of unit 4 complete and of embedded parts for units 5 to
10. It would also provide for consulting services for engineering and
supervision during procurement and construction. The basic powerhouse
construction would be completed during 1969-72. Unit 4, the first in the
expansion program, would come into service in 1973; the remaining six
units would be erected one each year commencing in 1975. The resulting
power capacity would meet the market forecast for Guri through 1980
14.       The project would be executed by EDELCA, a wholly-owned subsi-
diary of Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (C.V.G.) which is an autonomous
government agency responsible for developing the Guayana region located
in southeasterm Venezuela. EDELCA was created in 1963 to take over the
electric power activities of C.V.G. Over the years its staff have re-
ceived extensive training and experience in the designing, construction,
and operation of power facilities. It is considered capable of executing
the project with only limited assistance from consultants.



15.       EDELCA has retained the services of Harza Engineering Company
International (U.S.A.) throughout the designing and construction of Guri.
It intends to continue the arrangement, which has worked satisfactorily,
in connection with the expansion program. The general contract for civil
works will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank policies; the electro-mechanical equipment will
be similarly procured.
16.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$57 million
equivalent: this includes civil works, equipment, contingencies and con-
sulting services, but excludes interest during construction. The proposed
loan would finance the foreign exchange costs of the civil works contract
and equipment as well as the consultants' services. EDELCA would cover
local costs out of its own cash generation plus new capital contributions
from the Government.
17.       The project is technically sound and economically justified.
The additional investment in the powerhouse and units Nos. 4 to 10 would
yield an internal rate of return of 17-18 percent. This calculation is
based on a productive life of only 20 years for the facilities; the ac-
tual life is likely to be longer. Operation of EDELCA's net plant as a
whole is expected to yield a financial rate of return of 8 percent and
over, beginning 1975.
18.       On project grounds a term of 25 years would be justified for
this loan; however, in view of Venezuela's generally favorable economic
position and relatively small external debt, a term of 20 years is pro-
posed, including a grace period of 5 years.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and EDELCA, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Venezuela and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
20.       The draft Agreements contain provisions generally used in such
projects.
PART V - THE ECONOINY
21.       A memorandum of May 26, 1969, entitled "Recent Economic Develop-
ments in Venezuela" was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 29,
1969, in connection with the Third Highway Project. I also commented on
the salient aspects of the economy in my Report and Recommendation on that
project, concluding as follows:



"Therefore, in sum, while it is difficult at this stage
to forecast Venezuela's overall requirements of exter-
nal financing in the absence of a public sector invest-
ment program for the coming years, these are expected
to be not inconsiderable; at the same time there is
evidence of steady economic grovfth and a move towards
diversification; and there remains a significant margin
for additional borrowing on conventional terms."
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENIATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
