The Bank not only\n            provided all required foreign exchange, but also provided\n            support in selection and evaluation of the proper technical\n            solutions, contract packaging and grouping procurement of\n            services, and equipment, prequalification of contractors and\n            various design matters. The Bank was instrumental in\n            achieving the technical objectives of the project. The\n            relationship with the borrower remains excellent. All power\n            generating units which can be converted to fuel oil should\n            be modified to operate on dual firing, using gas in summer\n            and fuel oil in winter. In view of the constraints in future\n            gas supply GOP should take concrete measures to limit growth\n            in gas demand by curtailing future use of gas in thermal\n            power generation and exercise peak load shaving during peak\n            demand. The experience learned from the Fourth project\n            provides assurance for positive results in continuing the\n            dialogue with Government of Pakistan for the development of\n            the energy sector to achieve their objectives."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
