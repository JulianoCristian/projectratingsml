           are to assist India in meeting the costs and the\n            reconstruction/rehabilitation requirements resulting from\n            the drought, to help sustain and enhance the momentum of the\n            economic reform process during the present drought\n            situation, and to support the Government's longer term\n            strategy for increasing India's resilience to droughts.\n            The timely injection of fast-disbursing foreign exchange\n            under the proposed project would assist the Government to\n            manage the balance of payments consequences of the drought\n            without tightening import restrictions or reversing the\n            recent liberalization of technology- or export related\n            imports. The project would also support initiatives to\n            accelerate the design and implementation of key elements of\n            the Government's longer term strategy for increasing\n            India's resilience to droughts. The need to ameliorate\n            the impact of the drought and to rehabilitate in its wake\n            are the essential features of the proposed loan. The loan\n            would primarily finance imports of agro-industrial inputs,\n            petroleum and petroleum products, non-ferrous metals, and\n            other drought-related industrial intermediate goods."}, "docdt": "1987-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
