performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. The\n            experience of PLCE-1 holds number of important lessons.\n            These pertain to ways to improve the functioning of similar,\n            future program to support learning and skills development\n            among neo-literates. Some of the lessons learned are\n            specific to the non-formal education (NFE) sector, while\n            others have broader application for the effective management\n            and implementation of development assistance programs in\n            Bangladesh, in particular, and elsewhere. These are\n            important lessons given the enormous potential which PLCE-1\n            held for positively affecting the lives of millions of poor\n            people in Bangladesh, but which can not be realized due to\n            the various obstacles which arose as a function of the\n            complex operating environment which characterizes\n            Bangladesh, and the project's own design shortcomings."}, "docdt": "2008-07-15T00:00:00Z"}
