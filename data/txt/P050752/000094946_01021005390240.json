There are four project components. The\n            first component promotes enhanced and comprehensive\n            non-formal education. The second component finances a\n            post-literacy program. The third component supports a\n            continuing education program by improving the quality and\n            accessibility of continuing education services, helps\n            organize village-level continuing education centers, helps\n            service providers develop and offer courses, and develops\n            linkages between learners and services. The fourth component\n            strengthens institutional capacity of the Directorate of\n            Non-Formal Education by improving its administrative,\n            financial, information, planning, implementation, technical\n            service, and monitoring systems, strengthens its management\n            information system, builds monitoring and evaluation into\n            current program operations, and develops the capacity of the\n            tecnical staff."}, "docdt": "2001-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
