Ozone\n            Depleting Substances (ODS) Phase Out Project of Pakistan\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) During\n            the implementation of the umbrella projects (where there\n            were more than one enterprises involved) it would have been\n            more appropriate that the selection of machinery be based on\n            each individual enterprises' technical and working\n            capability so that the equipment supplied met their working\n            environment; 2) In projects that involve funding the private\n            sector to transform a market, it is advantageous to have\n            some counterpart contribution to ensure ownership; 3) In\n            cases where subproject implementation was deliberately\n            stalled because of a lack of enterprise commitment, it would\n            have been helpful to the Financial Intermediary (FI) to have\n            a \"stick\" to encourage enterprises to move forward\n            in implementation; 4) The lessons drawn from the Pakistan\n            ODS Phase-out Project support the findings that sustainable\n            phaseout hinges upon Government policy action early on and a\n            project design that promotes Government involvement in\n            implementation through capacity building and other support\n            measures; 5) Although an assessment of economic costs and\n            benefits to the country to convert to non-ODS technology and\n            to implement the MP is beyond the scope of this report, some\n            broad conclusions can be made based on experiences from\n            implementation of the ODS Project; 6) One important lesson\n            learned was that a capacity needs assessment would have been\n            helpful to determine what type of training NBP needed to\n            ensure it was able to deliver on its obligations in the\n            earlier stages of the project."}, "docdt": "2007-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
