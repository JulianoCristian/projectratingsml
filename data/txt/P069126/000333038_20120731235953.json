This restructuring will update the results\n            framework for the Project and amend the Development Grant\n            Agreement for this purpose.  In July 2011, the project\n            benefited from a twelve month extension of the grant closing\n            date to July 30, 2012 and a reallocation of funds within the\n            original project description.  The restructuring aims at:\n            (a) formalizing the inclusion during the 2011 restructuring\n            of a new core indicator which estimates the number of direct\n            beneficiaries (including the number of women); and (b)\n            correcting an output indicator target which was modified\n            during the project's mid-term review but not formalized."}, "docdt": "2012-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
