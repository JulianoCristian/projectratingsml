                         Construction works on the Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougou 225kV lines as well as the reinforcement work on the Kompiengra-Bagre-Tenkodogo-Ouaga lines are now completed. The
                         construction work for additional thermal capacity (of the 14MW and 18 MW power plant) have also been completed. Progress is also noted in the energy efficiency component with
                         energy saving devices installed in 15 (of 25) administrative buildings. In view of the steady progress, the task team has maintained the S rating of the ISR.
