1.  Country and Sector Background 
 
In the nineties, the Kosovo
1
economy had been damaged by poor economic policies, broken 
external trade and financial links, international sanctions, and a lack of investment in key sectors.  
It suffered further during the ethnic conflict which ended in 1999.  The post-conflict 
reconstruction program has proceeded well, and official aid flows have resulted in recovery of 
economic activity and positive growth. However, this growth is not likely to be sustainable and 
official aid flows have started declining. Despite post-conflict economic recovery, poverty in 
Kosovo is wide spread. Out of a population of about 2 million almost 36% live below poverty 
line, half of its population is below 24 years of age, and about 47% of the population is 
unemployed 
–
significantly higher than in any Balkan country. 
 
After the conflict, Kosovo was placed under the administration of the United Nations Interim 
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) under the terms of UN Security Council 
Resolution 1244.  In 2001, a Constitutional Framework was agreed establishing the Provisional 
Institutions of Self-Government (PISG).  Although the UNMIK retains certain reserve powers 
and final legal authority, including on energy and mining sectors, there is a continued transition 
to self-government with the PISG assuming significant responsibility on matters relating 
inter-
alia 
to economic policy, trade, and investment. In the PISG, a new Ministry of Energy and 
Mining has been established in December 2004 with the responsibility for defining policies and

refer to this region 
under the UN’s Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) administration. 
Page  2
future development strategies of the energy and mining sectors. In June 2002, Kosovo Trust 
Agency (KTA) was established by UNMIK and entrusted with the responsibility of 
inter-alia
 
managing the energy and mining sector enterprises, restructuring the Publicly Owned Enterprises 
(POEs), and privatizing Socially Owned Enterprises (SOEs).  This shared governance 
arrangement results in a challenging environment for the energy and mining sectors. 
 
Key development issues
.
Historically, energy and mining were mainstays of the Kosovo 
economy, providing direct and indirect employment, sources of revenue, export earnings, and 
inputs to downstream industries.  However, from being a contributor to economic growth, the 
power sector has become a drain on public resources.  In addition, unreliable electricity supply 
has emerged as one of the main obstacles to growth (Investment Climate Assessment, 2003). 
Irrational mining practices have rendered some mining assets uneconomic and neglect of 
maintenance and upgrading of equipment requires substantial investments.  
 
The Kosovo Economic Memorandum (KEM) defines the medium-term economic outlook as 
relying heavily on three economic sectors in which Kosovo has considerable endowment and/or 
comparative advantage:  energy, mining, and agriculture.  Both energy and mining have the 
potential in the medium to longer term to revitalize the Kosovo economy, especially given large 
and increasing energy needs throughout the region and the rebound in global commodity prices.   
 
Kosovo’s key energy resource is its extensive lignite deposits. It has no other fossil fuel resource 
and has only a very modest hydroelectric potential. It has no natural gas import and no gas 
supply infrastructure. It has no oil refinery and depends entirely on imported liquid fuels. Its 
electricity network covers almost 100% of the households, but the district heating networks are 
confined only to about 11,000 consumers in the three cities, meeting only 5% of the heat 
demand. Hence, there is an excessive heat demand load on the power system.  Billing and 
collection remains a major problem. In 2004 KEK’s technical losses were 21%.  Of the total 
energy available only 62% was billed of which only 63% was collected. Due to poor operational 
and financial performance of the power utility (KEK), the electricity sector has not only become 
an obstacle to growth but also a fiscal burden. Shared and often politically conflicting 
governance arrangements between the UNMIK and PISG have led to poor sector governance, 
and slowed the pace of policy development.  In addition, it has impeded sector restructuring, 
improvements in utility performance, and recovery of the mining sector.  
 
The mining industry was a major component of Kosovo’s industrial complex.  Current mining 
operations are approaching physical collapse after more than a decade of irrational mining 
practices, chronic under-funding, localized land-slides, urban encroachment, and uncontrolled 
lignite fires.  In the mining sector, strategic actions are needed on existing operations and to 
stimulate new investments.  The level of investment that is needed is significant and will need to 
come from private investors willing to take the risks inherent in mineral commodity markets.   
 
Electricity Sector.  Major challenges facing the electricity sector are:  
·
Poor performance of the power utility Korporata Energjetike Ë Kosoves (KEK), in part 
due to its weak management capacity and poor corporate governance; poor maintenance of 
generation plants, and the network due to lack of resources available to KEK; deteriorating 
Page  3
lignite mines, inefficient operation of generation plants, high level of system losses, and poor 
bill collection. 
·
A
need to integrate with the ECSEE regional energy market in order to optimize its own 
generation capacity, reduce the risk of unreliable power supply, in particular, to potential large 
investors in Kosovo, and in the medium term to exploit its lignite resources for attracting 
investments in export-oriented power plants. 
·
Rationalize excessive use of electricity for space heating during winter to reduce demand 
for electricity, and revise its outdated retail tariff structure to improve targeting of the subsidy 
for the poor.  
·
Finance near term investments to rehabilitate generation plants and lignite mines, 
rehabilitate and augment the network, and to implement orderly plans for import of power to 
reduce its chronic shortages, particularly in winter season.  
 
Mining Sector.
 
Absence of a coherent approach to recovering Kosovo’s mining sector has 
resulted in an array of issues  affecting ongoing lignite mining operations, efforts to recover 
Trepca’s mining activities (lead and zinc), privatization of Ferronikeli (mines and ferro-nickel 
plant), efforts to regulate  unlicensed construction material production, and rehabilitation of other 
mining assets currently idle.  Meaningful recovery of the sector depends upon policies and 
strategies that promote private-sector led growth.   
 
Development of a comprehensive, strategic, long-term sector plan is a key step towards 
improving sector performance and making mining a source of economic growth.   Major issues 
facing the mining sector are:  
·
Institutional weaknesses
.
Capacity development and institutional strengthening of the 
newly created Ministry of Energy and Mining is needed to support commercialization of 
SOEs, and attract private sector participation.   
·
Legal and regulatory framework. 
A
new mining law, recently promulgated as an UNMIK 
regulation, will require MEM to provide policy guidance and ensure that benefits reach 
those most affected by mineral development.  Appropriate sector regulations need to be 
prepared to support implementation of the new Law. 
·
A
strategic framework for lignite mining is critical to the power sector.
 
A
comprehensive 
lignite development plan is needed to guide future power generation projects under a 
progressive economic, social, and environmental framework.   
·
Small scale mining. 
 Additional technical assistance is needed to improve sub-sector 
performance by creating licensed SMEs having the capacity to adhere to obligations and 
regulations.  
 
2. Objectives 
 
The project’s primary objectives are (i) to support Kosovo’s integration with the regional energy 
market through assistance with implementation of its immediate obligations under the Athens 
Memorandum namely the establishment of an independent Transmission and System Operator 
(TSO), development of a Grid Code, development of transmission and retail tariffs including 
subsidy mechanism, and institutional strengthening to participate in the market, and (ii) to 
develop a policy framework, guidelines, and institutional capacity for the utilization of Kosovo’s 
mineral resources. 
Page  4
3.  Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
Even with limited amounts of IDA Grants, the Bank has been able to provide the much needed 
catalytic technical assistance for developing a more strategic approach to addressing the sector 
issues.  Through two previous technical assistance projects (ESTAP-I and II), the Bank has 
helped Kosovo authorities develop an energy sector strategy, carry out a feasibility study for a 
regional transmission link and create capacity for regional trade, and develop a framework for 
attracting private sector investment in the energy sector.  Because of the Bank’s deep 
involvement in evolution of the regional energy market
2
,
Kosovo authorities have requested the 
Bank to provide technical assistance support in implementing their immediate obligations under 
the Athens Memorandum
3
,
develop institutional capacity, and restructure the power sector for 
creation of an independent transmission and system operator.  The Bank’s regional APL facility 
to finance the necessary investments of the countries participating in the regional energy market 
has now been approved.  On becoming eligible to borrow from the Association, Kosovo will be 
able to access this facility.  In the meanwhile, some limited financing is expected to be available 
from the donors and through the Kosovo Consolidated Budget.  The Bank’s engagement in 
Kosovo, through the proposed technical assistance, will help maintain consistency in evolution 
of the market.  The proposed IDA Grant for facilitating Kosovo’s integration into the regional 
energy market has been welcomed by UNMIK, PISG, and the donors.  
 
In the mining sector, past donor activity has been largely restricted to equipment procurement 
and environmental pollution abatement.  The European Agency for Reconstruction remains the 
only active donor with support to lignite mining, mostly for refurbishment of some production 
equipment, mine infrastructure, and to combat uncontrolled fire in the pits.  Larger operations for 
which Kosovo would need donor assistance include future lignite development, privatization of 
the assets of Ferronikeli, and recovery of the Trepca and Strezovc/Golesh magnesia operations.  
The Bank has the mining sector expertise and in-depth knowledge of Kosovo itself, which are 
needed to put together a comprehensive approach to addressing mining sector issues.  This will 
provide a basis for addressing the obstacles that hinder mining sector recovery and growth, and 
for subsequent re-engagement of other donors to support sector recovery.  It will also address the 
needs of both large scale and small to medium scale mining. 
 
4. Description 
Main Components
.
The project will focus on two key sectors, energy and mining.  
Component 1:  Energy Sector
The energy sector component will comprise the following two subcomponents: 
2
PAD for a regional APL program to finance countries in South East Europe for integration into the regional energy 
market (December 2004), and World Bank Framework for Development of Regional Energy Trade in South East 
Europe (March 2004). 
3
Athens Memorandum, signed by all the countries in South East Europe and UNMIK on behalf of Kosovo, for 
creation of a regional energy market, obliges the participants to establish a policy making division in the 
government, an independent regulatory agency, and a transmission and system operator.  In addition, several 
technical documents have to be developed to govern operations of the interconnected system, and to harmonize 
KEK’s current rules and practices for operating the power system, with the regional market.  
Page  5
Subcomponent 1- Transmission and System Operator
:
This includes the development of a Grid 
Code for the transmission system, drafting of a transmission policy framework clearly defining 
the role of the TSO within the Kosovo electricity industry and the regional ESCEE market, and 
development of the TSO organizational design and structure. 
 
Subcomponent 2- Tariff Framework
:
Development of electricity transmission and retail tariffs 
including a lifeline tariff that is consistent with EU Directives, and improve targeting of subsidy 
for the poor. 
 
Component 2:  Mining Sector
The mining sector component will comprise of the following three subcomponents: 
 
Subcomponent 1- Mining Sector Strategy
:
Development of a mining sector Strategy and building 
capacity within PISG to implement the plan for both large and small mines. 
 
Subcomponent 2- Mining Sector Community Participation and Development Plan:
 Development 
of a policy framework and detailed guidelines for communication, participation, and preparation 
of development plans for communities that may be affected by future mining projects. 
 
Subcomponent 3- Mining Sector SME Capacity Development

6. Implementation 
 
Institutional and implementation arrangements were confirmed in a communication from the 
Recipient and are more fully described in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) of February 
2005. The Grant Agreement will be signed by the Recipient. The Ministry of Energy and Mining 
will be the Project Implementing Entity and have the overall responsibility of project 
implementation and coordination with several institutions involved in implementation of sub-
components as follows: 
 
¾
Ministry of Energy and Mining (MEM): (i) develop a mining sector strategy, (ii) 
develop detailed guidelines and procedures for community consultation, participation, 
and preparing community development plans; 
¾
Energy Regulatory Office: develop transmission and retail tariffs; 
¾
KTA: institutional development of TSO; 
Page  6
¾
ICMM: technical assistance to small mining operators (SMEs) to improve their 
technical, financial, and environmental performance. 
 
The MEM, in consultation with UNMIK and the agencies responsible for different sub-
components, will manage procurement, negotiate contracts, supervise progress, and process 
payments through Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) and UNMIK.  The MEM will 
prepare withdrawal applications and submit to MFE for their signature. The applications will be 
forwarded to the Association through UNMIK.  
 
A
Project Steering Committee (PSC), with representatives of UNMIK, MEM, ERO, KTA, and 
ICMM, has been established to coordinate the activities of various agencies involved in 
implementation of sub-components, and also provide guidance and advice on implementation 
of the project, terms of reference of the consultants, selection of consultants, and compliance 
with Bank’s procurement guidelines and procedures. The PSC will reinforce ownership within 
local institutions, reviews consultant’s outputs for quality and internal consistence among the 
components, and consultation with local institutions, donors, and other stakeholders. 
 
7. Sustainability 
 
The authorities have demonstrated ownership and a commitment to sustainability of the project 
through the creation of the Ministry of Energy and Mining, implementing measures to fulfill 
commitments under the Athens Memorandum, creating a Steering Committee from a diverse 
group of stakeholders, and convening on a regular basis to plan and implement the project. 
 
The long term sustainability of the project benefits depends on continuation of Kosovo’s energy 
strategy based on regional integration.  Kosovo is not likely to change this strategy, and reduce 
its participation in the regional energy market and its institutions, since its political future, 
economic development, and fulfillment of its strong desire to eventually integrate with Europe 
depends, among other actions, on its active participation in the regional institutions. All its laws, 
policies, and institutions are being gradually aligned with the directives of the European Union. 
An indicator of this strong desire is the recent reconnection of the power system of the South 
East Europe Region, including Kosovo, with the main European power system operated by 
UCTE.   
 
The mining components enjoy the same commitments to sustainability.  The authorities have 
demonstrated a commitment through the creation of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, seeking 
to improve policy decisions in the sector and facilitate strategic investments. The community 
participation and development plan will strengthen sustainability by ensuring benefits to those 
communities most impacted by mining projects.  Key mineral resources form the cornerstone of 
future economic development strategies.  Lignite resources offer export of power and foreign 
earnings.  Likewise, ongoing budgetary support of Trepca demonstrates commitment to recovery 
of the asset to prepare it for resumption of mining, export earnings, and eventual privatization.  
With prioritization, strategic investment decisions relating to these resources and others will lead 
to growth of the sector and provide needed economic growth.

8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
The ESTAP III project design reflects lessons learned in ESTAP I and ESTAP II.  Extensive 
consultation has been undertaken with UNMIK and PISG officials, managers and administrators 
of POE and SOE operations, and the donor community.  The lessons learned from various 
technical assistance projects, i.e., ownership by local institutions, preparation of comprehensive 
terms of reference, selection of competent consultants, detailed reviews for ensuring quality of 
consultant’s outputs, realistic timeframe, and wide consultations with local institutions, donors, 
and other stakeholders, have been taken into account in the project design.  The lessons learned 
from the recent mining technical assistance programs in Madagascar and Mauritania focus on 
improving project design and implementation by placing an emphasis on beneficiary 
participation in project preparation.   
 
The proposed components of ESTAP III have received political support at the highest levels of 
UNMIK, PISG.  In addition, several institutions are involved in project implementation and are 
included in the Project Steering Committee for coordination and implementation of the project 
(see Section C.1).   
 
The project components are considered high priority by the authorities, Kosovo institutions, and 
the donors (EAR, CIDA, USAID, DFID, KfW), and meet urgent requirements of Kosovo for 
compliance with its obligations under the Athens Memorandum.  The scope of work of the 
consultants has been defined to ensure complementarity with the technical assistance being 
provided by EAR, CIDA, and USAID.  The consultants would be selected through International 
Competitive Bidding using the Bank’s guidelines and procedures for selection of consultants.  
Cost estimates shall be prepared carefully and contracts will be signed on a lump-sum basis.  
 
Though the Ministry of Energy and Mining, assigned the responsibility of implementing the 
project, has been established recently and does not have a track record, several senior officials of 
the Ministry and of other agencies, e.g., ERO, KTA, KEK, have been involved in 
implementation of projects funded by the Association and other donors.  In addition, their 
experience and expertise will be available through their involvement in the Project Steering 
Committee, which is expected to meet once a month.  
 
9.  Safeguard Policies (including public consultation) 
 
Although the project will not finance any investments, it will provide technical assistance in 
community development and social impact mitigation matters.  Consultant contracts will require 
the assistance rendered to be consistent with Bank Safeguard Policies.  Compliance will be 
supervised closely.
