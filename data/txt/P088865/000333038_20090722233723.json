Third Energy Sector\n            Technical Assistance Project for Kosovo were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) a project is highly effective in\n            implementation when there is a clear identification of the\n            needs by the counterpart/borrower. For this project, all the\n            agencies were eager to establish their institutions with the\n            help of the technical assistance, and the consultants were\n            fully integrated into Kosovo Transmission System Market\n            Operator (KOSTT) and Energy Regulatory Office (ERO)\n            operations, and the performance was good; 2) it has been\n            beneficial to have the involvement of non-governmental\n            organization (NGO) also in the preparation of strategic\n            documents. For example, in the preparation of the mining\n            strategy, it is important that the consultants financed by\n            the Bank are engaged with a range of players, so that even\n            if there is a change of government, the momentum is not\n            lost; 3) there is a need for flexibility so that activities\n            can be rescheduled or revised to reflect changing priorities\n            as a new government stands-up and defines its development\n            priorities; and 4) throughout project implementation the\n            Bank facilitated frequent meetings and discussions so that\n            the project will benefit from close cooperation among the\n            donors and consultants to avoid overlaps."}, "docdt": "2009-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
