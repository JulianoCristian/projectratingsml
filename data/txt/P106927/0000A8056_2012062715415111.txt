                         The improved performance of the HIV/AIDS project observed earlier is continuing and this was confirmed by an in depth review carried out in January 2012. The review determined
                         that the project is on track for achieving the development objectives.

                         The South Sudan AIDS Commission (SSAC) which was created in early 2007 is now fully operational at central and state level and coordinating the national HIV/AIDS response

                         reasonably well. 5 out of 6 selected priority line ministries have fully implemented their plans. The recruited lead agencies (NGOs/firms) are providing HIV/AIDS prevention and care
                         services in the states, thus contributing to the improvement of the availability and use of HIV/AIDS services.

                         The project supported the SSCA to strengthening M&E system and to conduct of a review of HIV Epidemic and Response. An HIV/AIDS module (HIV prevalence and the women and
                         men questionnaire about HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes and sexual behavior) was successfully included into the Second Sudan Household Survey completed in May 2010 and into
                         LQAS survey conducted in April 2011. The report on HIV Epidemic and Response was released in April 2011.

                         As of May 28, 2012, all the funds allocated under the project were fully committed and a total of US $ 16.6 million out of the US$ 17.6 million had been disbursed. The South Sudan
                         HIV/AIDS Commission, which is the implementing entity, has submitted through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning a formal request to extend the project to September
                         28, 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The current project which is the main support to the national HIV/AIDS response will be extended to September 28th, 2012 and there is no new World Bank project in the pipeline.
                         The support of the Global Fund (round 4) is already finished and the country failed tosecure additional support from the Global Fund. There was a huge expectation for round 11
                         which is now canceled. This implies that in the near future, South Sudan HIV/AIDS program will not have any significant support.. The World Bank has included the support to the
                         health related HIV/AIDS activities (VCT, PMTCT and ART) into the newly approved Rapid Results Health Project. The bank also advocate for the inclusion of these activities in similar
                         health projects supported by other donors.
