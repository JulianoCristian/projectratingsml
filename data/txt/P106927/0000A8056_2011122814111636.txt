                         In June 2011, the project was restructured with slight modification of result framework and extension of closing date to June 2012.The performance of the HIV/AIDS project observed
                         earlier is continuing despite the frequent shortage of reagents (test kits) and ART drugs experienced during the last six months.

                         The South Sudan AIDS Commission (SSAC) at federal level is now fully operational and coordinating the national HIV/AIDS response reasonably well;
                         Most of the selected priority line ministries have fully implemented their plans. The recruited 4 lead agencies (NGOs/firms) are providing HIV/AIDS prevention and care services in the
                         states, thus contributing to the improvement of the availability of HIV/AIDS services.

                         data on the PDO and IO indicators; (ii) Identify any other data collection that is needed; (iii) Identify any final course corrections that are needed before it's too late; and (iv) Propose a

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The current project which is the main support to the national HIV/AIDS response will be completed June 30th, 2012 and there is no new World Bank project in the pipeline. The
                         support of the Global Fund (round 4) is already finished and the country failed to secure additional support from the Global Fund. There was a huge expectation for round 11 which is
                         now canceled. This implies that in the near future, South Sudan HIV/AIDS program will not have any significant support.

                         Restructuring History
