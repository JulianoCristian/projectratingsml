To achieve this objective, the\n            project will establish a unified modular training system for\n            construction-related trades and improve the use and\n            maintenance of plant and equipment. The Construction\n            Industry Training Project consists of the following\n            components: (i) training of about 45,000 unskilled workers\n            up to a basic skill level; (ii) upgrading of skills of about\n            9,600 skilled workers; (iii) training of about 1,800\n            mechanical equipment operators and mechanics; (iv) training\n            of about 900 junior work supervisors; (v) training of about\n            80 senior work managers; (vi) provision of equipment and\n            training materials; and (vii) technical assistance. The\n            Construction Industry Training Project does not involve any\n            unusual risk associated with similar type projects."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
