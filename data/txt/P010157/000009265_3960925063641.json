Most of the objectives\n            were achieved, the impact of the project has been\n            significant, sustainability is likely, and both the Borrower\n            and the Bank acted satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, planning in the\n            construction industry should provide for its inherent\n            volatility and include built-in mechanisms for a continuous\n            assessment of training needs. Second, planning should take\n            cognizance of the need to provide for preliminary\n            activities. Third, for future projects, several agencies\n            should be required to contribute towards the successful\n            implementation of a project. Fourth, every effort should be\n            made to implement the recommendations of the National\n            Steering Committee's documents in both the public and\n            private sectors for maintaining uniformity of standards.\n            Fifth, more incentives should be given to local contractors\n            for upgrading their knowledge of financial control and\n            management and construction technology in order to enable\n            them to execute their work efficiently. Lastly, curricula\n            and training standards should be constantly reviewed and\n            developed to maintain standards of achievement acceptable to\n            the construction industry."}, "docdt": "1988-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
