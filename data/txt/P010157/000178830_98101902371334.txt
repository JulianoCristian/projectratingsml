INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA FOR A
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation for a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for
Special Drawing Rights 10.9 M (US$13.5 M equivalent at the time of negotia-
tions) on standard terms to help finance a Construction Industry Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report, "Sri Lanka:  Key Development Issues
in the 1980s" (Report No. 2955-CE, May 20, 1980) was distributed to the Exe-
cutive Directors on May 27, 1980. Country Data are provided in Annex, I.
3.        After several years of relative stagnation, Sri Lanka's economy is
experiencing sustained growth. This growth has been the direct result of the
economic liberalization of 1977, and the development push associated with it.
Until 1977, Sri Lanka's growth performance had been below both need and poten-
tial. Although GDP growth in the 1960s, at 4.4% per annum, was above the
average for low income countries, growth slackened sharply in the 1970-77
period to 2.9% per annum, just below the average for low income countries.
Through much of this period, the terms of trade deteriorated steadily, eroding
even these modest gains; as a consequence, per capita gross national income
rose by a mere 0.9% per annum during the 1960-76 period. The slowdown in
economic growth in the 1970-77 period is attributable to a combination of
factors, including inadequate investment, poor management of the economy,
and a policy environment unconducive to growth and investment, which were
compounded by bad weather and a sharp rise in the cost of imported food and
petroleum.
4.        The three tree crops--tea, rubber and coconuts--which are still the
mainstay of the economy, suffered from low replanting and inadequate incen-
tives. These problems were exacerbated by a dual exchange rate, introduced
in 1968, that discriminated against these crops, and by the uncertainties
surrounding a protracted nationalization (1972-75) of the larger estates.
After the exceptional output growth of the 1960s, rice yields and cropping
intensities declined in the 1970s due to poor institutional support.  Invest-
ment in manufacturing was low, and the inefficiency of most public and private
sector firms nurtured in a highly protected environment resulted in industrial
growth of less than 2% per annum. The only bright spots were subsidiary food
crops and industrial exports which benefited from good incentives.
5.        An inadequate public savings effort, caused by inelastic revenues
and an uncontrolled increase in recurrent expenditures, inhibited public
investment. Private savings and investment were constrained by an unfavor-
able policy environment. The high incremental capital output ratio in the
1970s (5.5 as against 3.5 in the 1960s), reflected the fact that the invest-
ment that did take place was both inefficient and highly capital intensive.



-2-
6.        The low growth rates and the slow changes in the structure of
output matched neither the jobs nor the changes in employment structure that
the labor force required. Slow output growth, the excessive capital intensity
of investment, the mismatch between the job aspirations of those with post-
primary education and the jobs available to them, the post war demographic
bulge, and rising female participation rates contributed to a massive increase
in open unemployment, estimated at over 1 million, or some 18% of the labor
force in 1977.
7.        In sharp contrast to this poor economic performance, Sri Lanka's
social achievements in relation to per capita income have been outstanding.
Sri Lanka has about one and one-half times the life expectancy, almost thrice
the literacy, one-quarter the infant mortality and half the birth rate that
would be expected for a country at its per capita income level. Nutrition
levels have been adequate, and in the 1960s there were parallel gains in
income distribution.
8.        Improvements in the quality of life, in particular the rise in health
standards, the spread of education and the availability of subsidized food,
have been important factors in the decline in mortality. The increasing age
of marriage, the spread of female education and employment, and a vigorous
family planning program, have also contributed to a sharp decline in fertility.
As a consequence, the growth rate of population has dropped from 2.6% per annum
in the 1953-63 intercensal period to 2.0% per annum in the 1963-73 period.
Allowing for net migration, population is currently increasing at only 1.7%
per annum.
9.        The gains in the social field were made possible by favorable initial
conditions. Compulsory primary education was introduced as early as 1901. The
food ration was introduced in 1942. Thus, at the time of Independence in 1948,
Sri Lanka already enjoyed high levels of adult literacy and life expectancy.
These initial gains were consolidated and expanded in the post-Independence
period through large expenditures on social services and the food subsidy,
which accounted for two-fifths to one-half of government revenues in the 1960s
and early 1970s. These expenditures were traditionally financed by harnessing
the surpluses of the three major tree crops, which provided the Government
with easy sources of revenue and foreign exchange. These surpluses began to
disappear in the late 1960s as government policies discriminated against these
crops and the terms of trade deteriorated. With growth in other productive
sectors in the economy also decelerating in the 1970-77 period, the budgetary
resources available for social programs were squeezed by inelastic revenues
and rapid inflation. As a consequence, expenditures on social services other
than the food subsidy began to decline as a proportion of total current
expenditures and of GDP, threatening the hard-won gains in health and educa-
tion. In sum, the economy was no longer generating the resources needed to
sustain a large program of welfare expenditures. Moreover, the very size
of those programs reduced the scope for policy makers to shift resources to
development.
10.       The policy changes introduced in 1977, following the election of
the United National Party, were intended to break this vicious circle. The
new Government identified its objectives as the sustained revival and resus-
citation of the economy and increased employment through (i) increased capa-
city utilization in the productive sectors, (ii) stimulation of savings and



- 3 -
investment, and (iii) efforts to encourage exports and import substitution in
foodgrains. A program of policy reforms was developed in close consultation
with the IMF. Its principal aim was to dismantle controls over resource
allocation and initiate price adjustments with a view to establishing more
realistic relative prices. These reforms were supported initially by an IMF
standby arrangement covering 1978 for SDR 93 million. On January 26, 1979
the Fund's Executive Board approved an SDR 260 million Extended Arrangement
covering the 1979-81 period.
11.       The following broad policy reforms were introduced:
Exchange Rate Reform: The exchange rate was unified on November 16,
1977 at a depreciated rate of Rs 16 = US$1.00 and allowed to float.
This implied a depreciation of 46% against the official rate prevail-
ing prior to unification, 11.2% with respect to the Foreign Exchange
Entitlement Certificate rate, and 29.5% with respect to a transactions-
weighted average rate of the two markets. 1/ Between 1977 and 1979
the rupee appreciated by about 5% against the dollar; however, it
began depreciating in early 1980 and reached a level of Rs 18 per
US dollar by December 1980.
Import Liberalization: The trade and payments regime was liberalized.
With the exception of petroleum products, public sector import mono-
polies were terminated. Prior licensing of imports was abolished
for all but a handful of commodities. The tariff structure was
revised and simplified.
Interest Rate Reform: To encourage financial savings and discourage
speculative imports, interest rates were raised sharply. However,
inflation eroded these rates, and in April 1980 further upward
adjustments were made.
Price Controls: These ended for most commodities.
Budgetary Policies: The unification and depreciation of the exchange
rate caused tree crops export tax revenues and the cost of food,
fertilizer, and petroleum subsidies to rise sharply. Business Turn-
over Tax rates were also substantially lowered and rationalized to
be consistent with the new import tariff and exchange rate. To limit
the increase in cost of food subsidies, rice and sugar rations were
initially confined to the poorer half of the population, and the
subsidy on imported wheat flour was reduced through a series of
adjustments in the domestic price. On September 1, 1979 the
Government introduced a system of food and kerosene stamps for
families with monthly incomes less than Rs 300 to replace spe-
cific subsid.ies and food rationing, and to target benefits to
1/   Prior to unification, all exports other than tea, rubber and coconut
products and all imports other than food, fertilizers and drugs were
channelled through the certificate market. Since November 1972, the
FEEC rate was maintained at a 65% premium over the official rate.



-4-
the poorest. This was accompanied by a move to full cost pricing
for rice and flour. Initially about seven million persons were
issued with food and kerosene stamps. To help offset the adverse
impact of these changes on real incomes, public sector wages were
adjusted upwards on four occasions. Public corporations were asked
to pass on cost increases, except in the cases of fertilizer,
petroleum, milk, and public transport, where price increases were
initially deferred to cushion the impact on consumers. The Govern-
ment subsequently eliminated the subsidy on petroleum products and
made sizable adjustments in bus and train fares and electricity
prices. The burden of subsidies and transfers, as a consequence,
fell from around 9% of GDP in 1978 to around 5% in 1980. These
changes, taken together with higher aid receipts, have permitted a
sizable increase in capital expenditures.
Tax Reform: The tax structure was rationalized and simplified
with a view to increasing the elasticity of revenues. The burden
of personal and company taxation was lowered. However, taxes
on slowly growing treecrop exports accounted for over 45% of
1978 revenues; as a result, the overall elasticity of revenues
to economic growth and domestic inflation has been low.
Agricultural Pricing Policies: The domestic support price for
paddy was increased by 21% in November 1977, by 25% in November
1980 and by a further 5% in February 1981. With the related
increase in flour prices, incentives for paddy and other flour
substitutes benefited. Fresh coconut prices were also increased
and the export duty on coconut products was appropriately adjusted.
While the unification of the exchange rate ended formal discrimina-
tion against tree crops, the export duty on tea was initially set
at a level which effectively siphoned off most of the benefits to
the Government. As tea prices fell and production costs rose in
1978-79, the Government responded to the reduced producer margins by
a lowering of taxes on tea. Further adjustments in both the structure
and level of tea and coconut taxation will be needed to maintain and
improve incentives. Similarly, the support price for paddy will
need to be increased further to maintain strong producer incentives,
especially since the substantial increase in fertilizer prices
announced in February could have an adverse effect on fertilizer
consumption.
12.       The economic reforms have been accompanied by a major effort at
stepping up public investment. The Government's capital expenditures jumped
from 6% of GDP in 1977 to an average of 15% in 1979 and 19% in 1980, as
government departments responded to the initial improvement in the budgetary
resource position by embarking on long overdue replacement investments and new
projects that had been shelved earlier for lack of resources. At the same
time, the Government embarked on four major new programs which are to be the
lead projects in a five-year rolling public investment program. These are:
(i) Accelerated implementation of the Mahaweli Ganga Development Program, by
far the largest multi-purpose river basin development program ever undertaken
in Sri Lanka; (ii) a 200 square-mile free trade zone north of Colombo under a



- 5 -
newly constituted Greater Colombo Economic Commission which has established
the first of several Investment Promotion Zones near Colombo's international
airport and has signed agreements with some 64 foreign investors involving a
total investment of US$117 million by end-1980; (iii) a massive housing and
urban renewal program with its main focus on the Colombo metropolitan region;
and (iv) the construction of a new capital complex at Kotte, a suburb of
Colombo. These four programs will together cost an estimated Rs 32 billion,
or 43% of the projected public investment program over the 1981-85 period.
By 1980, their share in the investment program had already risen to 33%.
13.       The underlying public investment strategy is to balance the large
investment requirements of the Government's high priority programs against the
urgent rehabilitation and fresh investment needs in other sectors.  The main
thrust of the public sector program is to lay the foundation for longer term
development, both by improving the efficiency of use of existing infrastructure
investments and by expanding the longer term growth capacity of the economy.
The strategy thus implicitly relies on the private sector to respond to the
economic reforms and the stimulus of the public sector investment program,
and provide much of the short-term growth.
14.       A difficulty with the 1981-85 investment program, as currently
proposed, is that identified investment activities, which in most cases,
have already gathered substantial momentum, will result in government capital
expenditures far in excess of available financial resources in the earlier
years (1981-1983) of the program. The experience during 1980 (paras 16-19),
when government capital expenditures rose to nearly 19% of GNP at market
prices, and contributed to the severe pressures on prices and the balance
of payments, underscores the dangers arising from this "front-loading" of
the investment program. The government is aware of this, and is reviewing
its public investment program with a view to reducing the level of investment
in the current year and the following two years.
15.       The initial response of the economy to the policy reforms and the
accompanying acceleration in investment has been encouraging. Economic
growth in 1978-1980 averaged an impressive 6.7% per annum. This growth was
shared by almost all sectors of the economy, with the most dynamic sectors
being construction; mining and quarrying; electricity, gas and water; trans-
port; and manufacturing. The only major exception has been the tree crop
sector. This impressive performance is due to a number of factors including
the improved availability of inputs following import liberalization, an
increased role for the private sector in distribution, and the removal of
price controls. Although there is little data available on employment,
Central Bank estimates suggest that unemployment dropped from 18% of the
labor force to 15% between 1977 and 1979.
16.       The rapid rise in investment has not, however, been accompanied by
a concomitant rise in the national savings effort. Gross national savings
fluctuated around 15% of GDP during the 1978-80 period, while the use of
foreign savings increased from 4.6% of GDP in 1978 to 20.0% in 1980. Although
the Government has succeeded in containing the costly consumer subsidy and
transfer programs, which has led to their decline as a percent of GDP (para
11), relatively inelastic revenues combined with steadily rising other recur-
rent expenditures and declining terms of trade have resulted in practically no



- 6 -
public savings over the 1978-1980 period, As a result, the Government has
financed its rapidly rising capital expenditures through foreign aid, and by
increasing its level of domestic borrowings. Initially the Gov ernment was
able to meet its domestic financing requirements through non-expansionary
borrowings from captive financial institutions, which had been able to
mobilize increased private savings following the interest rate reform.
However, resources mobilized through these channels have not grown as rapidly
as the budgetary deficit, and the Government has been increasingly forced to
undertake expansionary borrowings from the Central Bank. Between 1978 and
1979, these rose from 0.4% to 1.2% of GDP; a further sharp rise to over 10%
of GDP is estimated for 1980.
17.       The exchange rate adjustment, other policy-induced price increases
and related wage increases, the removal of price controls, and the build-up of
external assets contributed significantly to inflationary pressures in 1978
and 1979. However, they were moderated in 1978 and 1979 by bumper paddy har-
vests, increased capacity utilization in the economy, increased availability
of imports, and the beneficial effects of competition from imports and in
domestic distribution. Thus, annual inflation, as measured by the official
Colombo consumer price index, averaged 11% in 1978 and 1979. However, with
broad money increasing by 38% in 1979 and 27% in 1980, compared to a 6% growth
in GDP, there has been a sizable "built-in" price increase. This, together
with the corrective price increases designed to reduce budgetary subsidies,
and the rapid increases in the price of petroleum, wheat and sugar imports
have led to an overall inflation rate of 26% for 1980.
18.       The rapid growth of the economy since 1977 has also been reflected
in the balance of payments. As a result of the import liberalization, the
acceleration in economic growth in the domestic economy, and the decline in
the terms of trade, imports grew at over 42% annually between 1977 and 1979;
on the other hand, exports (of which sluggishly growing treecrop exports still
account for about 60%) grew at only 15% annually. Tourism receipts and pri-
vate transfers from abroad both grew rapidly, partially offsetting the rapid
growth in the trade deficit; nevertheless, the current account deficit rose
to 4.6% of GDP in 1978 and 11.0% of GDP in 1979. In both years, however,
the current account deficits were more than offset by non-monetary capital
inflows, and Sri Lanka continued to add to its net international reserves,
albeit at a declining rate. At the end of 1979, Sri Lanka's net international
reserves stood at US$258 million; its gross international reserves at US$517
million, equivalent to more than four months of imports of goods and non-
factor services. In 1980, however, the balance of payments deteriorated
rapidly and net reserves declined by about US$230 million. The principal
cause of the deterioration has been the sharp increase in the trade deficit.
While all categories of imports, but particularly capital goods imports,
grew rapidly, exports rose only slightly above 1979 levels. Although the recent
price increases will almost double Sri Lanka's petroleum import bill between
1979 and 1980, the oil import burden is not yet unmanageable. Gross petroleum
imports still account for less than one-fourth of total imports; net petroleum
imports, for less than one-third of non-oil exports. Other elements of the
current account continued to perform well; nevertheless, they could not offset
the deterioration of the trade account, and as a result the current account



- 7 -
deficit is expected to more than double to over US$800 million and rise to 20%
of GDP. Net aid disbursements, together with net direct foreign investment,
will cover only about one-half of the current account deficit. With the
consequent rapid drawdown in international reserves, the public sector,
especially the public corporations, have begun to make significant use of
commercial financing arrangements.
19.       Aid donors have responded enthusiastically to the Government's
development initiatives - aid commitments totalled US$617 million in 1979
and $615 million in 1980. Continued high levels of aid will, however, depend
upon the Government maintaining donor confidence in its economic policies and
management.
20.       External public debt outstanding and disbursed stood at US$1,086
million at the end of 1979, amounting to about 32% of GDP. However, it is
almost all long-term concessional debt. As a result, the debt service burden
is relatively low--the debt service ratio in 1980 excluding IMF repurchases
stood at 7.3% of exports of goods and non-factor services, declining from
16.6% in 1977. While this sustained decline is due in part to improved export
earnings, the main cause has been a decline in outstanding short and medium
term commercial borrowings. Unless the ratio of the current account deficit
to GDP improves, Sri Lanka will again have to begin undertaking significant
shorter maturity commercial borrowings to fill the gap between the current
account deficit and likely concessional aid flows. In that case, the debt
service ratio could deteriorate quickly.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
21.       Since the beginning of its operations in Sri Lanka in 1954, the Bank
Group has approved eight loans totalling US$72.9 million (net of cancellations)
and 26 credits totalling US$395.5 million (net of cancellations and exchange
adjustments) in support of 32 projects. About 43% of Bank Group assistance
has been for agriculture (irrigation, agricultural, and dairy development),
17% for power, 15% for transport, and the remainder for development finance
company operations, a program credit (mainly involving the import of raw mate-
rials for industry), water supply, telecommunications, and small and medium
industries. Eight loans and eight credits have been fully disbursed so far.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations as of January
31, 1981, together with notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
22.       An IFC equity investment of about US$100,000 equivalent in the
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) and an IFC non-revolving
line of credit of US$2.0 million to the government-owned Bank of Ceylon for
on-lending to private small- and medium-scale industrial enterprises were
approved in FY78. IFC also approved an investment of US$3.68 million in a
synthetic textile mill, and US$986,000 in a polypropylene bag manufacturing
plant in FY79. During FY80, IFC approved an increase in equity investment
of about US$51,000 equivalent in DFCC and an investment of US$260,000 in an
equipment leasing company.



-8-
23.       The Bank Group's current strategy is focused on the agricultural
sector to support Government efforts to increase food prdduction and reduce
its dependence on food imports, and to raise productivity, employment, incomes
and living standards of the rural population in Sri Lanka. Projects to sup-
port basic infrastructure are also included. A Mahaweli Ganga Development
III project, a village tank rehabilitation project, a second tea rehabilitation
project, and a second small and medium industries project are being appraised.
24.       In 1979, the Bank Group accounted for 10.2% (IBRD, 3.0%; IDA, 7.2%)
of Sri Lanka's total debt outstanding and disbursed, and 8.5% (over 90% IBRD)
of debt service. It is projected that the Bank Group's share in total external
debt will increase to 15% by 1985 (with the IBRD's share declining to 2%).
The Bank and IDA shares in the debt service are expected to decline to about
5% by 1985.
PART III - THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
Current Constraints in the Construction Industry
25.       Sri Lanka's construction industry has gone through various phases
over the past twenty years, reflecting phases in the development of the economy
as a whole. Rapid growth in 1966-70 was followed by a sharp decline during
the period 1971-77, when the economy was generally depressed. The latter
period was characterized by a reduction in the output of the construction
industry, from 5.6% of GDP in 1971 to 3.8% in 1977, and by a dramatic shift
of work from the private to the public sector, reflecting the constraints
placed during this period on the development of the private sector.
26.       Following the liberalization of the economy, begun in 1977, the con-
struction industry had to face a significantly enlarged demand stemming mainly
from the Government's investment program. The industry, however, was poorly
prepared to meet such increased demand, as a result of supply constraints in
the areas of materials, equipment, manpower and management. Despite these
constraints, the industry grew in real terms at 28% in 1978 and 21% in 1979.
It is doubtful, however, that such performance can be maintained, as evidenced
by the rapid increase in the price index within the sector, which rose 45% in
1978 and 50% in 1979.
27.       Current shortages of construction materials have prompted the
Government to allow the importation of timber, cement and steel. However,
more difficult to overcome are the shortages of several domestically produced
materials such as sand, bricks and stone aggregates. There are signs, however,
that production is increasing, and IDA's Small and Medium Industries (SMI)
Project (Credit 942-CE, US$16 million) includes assistance to building mate-
rials industries.
28.       Past import controls and the generally depressed state of the economy
during 1971-1977, have resulted in a largely antiquated fleet of equipment
available to the construction industry, particularly to the private sector.



- 9 -
The recently created Lanka Orient Leasing Company, with IFC equity participa-
tion, is expected to help increase the availability of capital equipment to
construction companies. SMI project includes financial and technical assistance
for small scale construction contractors in equipment and materials. Addi-
tional equipment is expected to be provided in the proposed IDA-financed
NDB/SMI project.
29.       There is an absolute shortage of skilled labor in the industry, and
the scarce skills arc being dilun-  tD meet the Pxisting and increasing demands.
The reasons are manifold. First, the labor force in the construction incustry
remained at around 100,000, or 2% of the total labor force during most of the
seventies and grew towards the end of the decade to 140,000 in 1979. Secondly,
about half of the estimated 30,000 Sri Lankans who migrated to the Middle East
in the late seventies were construction workers. Finally, the traditional
training system, consisting of long apprenticeship periods under skilled
craftsmen, may be in the process of breaking down because there are fewer
skilled workers in the country to provide training, and because those remaining
in Sri Lanka would rather work productively and benefit from higher rates than
train others. The present situation is, therefore, characterized by a scarcity
of skilled workers; by unskilled workers carrying out tasks unsuited to their
ability; and, as a consequence, by a general decrease in the productivity of
labor.
Training Institutions
30.       There are several institutions in Sri Lanka that impart training
in skills relevant to the construction industry. The National Apprenticeship
Board (NAB) administers training provided by contractors at work sites; its
8,000 trainees include about 1,400 in building and allied trades. The Depart-
ment of Labor imparts construction-related training through two permanent and
130 mobile centers to about 2,700 trainees a year, mainly in masonry and
carpentry. The Department of Rural Industries operates 75 centers where 1,500
trainees receive carpentry skills. The Department of Higher Education has 20
technical institutes where technical courses are offered as part of a two-year
general high school education with about 4,000 students taking construction-
related courses at any one time. The Center for Housing Planning and Building
(CHPB) trains about 40 engineers annually in planning and management. These
institutions do not generally have adequate financial resources nor do they
have adequate supplies of training materials at their disposal. In all, the
annual output of the existing training facilities is about 6,000 skilled
construction workers.
Construction Companies
31.       There are no large domestic private contractors in Sri Lanka.  About
six contractors have an annual capacity of up to Rs 100 million each, and about
twenty more have a capacity of about Rs 30 million each per year. They con-
centrate on buildings, water supply and small sewage projects, and have so far
responded well to the rising demand for their services. The revitalization of
the economy in recent years and the new attitude of the Government towards the
private sector have resulted in the latter carrying out increasing amounts of
public works. After 1977, the private construction industry organized itself



- 10 -
into a Sri Lanka Construction Consortium that now includes about 350 contractors
and about 30 consulting firms. Under existing arrangements with the Govern-
ment, the Consortium carries out contracts for government work at negotiated
rates, and with substantial advances to help the contractors' precarious
liquidity position. The Government reintroduced competitive bidding as the
normal procedure in the construction sector with effect from February 1, 1981.
The Consortium fulfills a useful function as an intermediary between a rundown
construction industry and a government that wishes to proceed quickly with its
investment program without having to revise bidding and contract procedures.
The Consortium has an interest in training to make up for the exodus of skills
to the Middle East, and encourages its member firms to carry out on-the-job
training under NAB-administered programs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       During the preparation of the 1979-83 Public Investment, the Govern-
ment became aware that the capacity of the domestic construction industry
would have to be increased to carry out the work called for in the Plan. In
recognition of the constraint, IDA discussed with the Government, in December
1978, a program of assistance leading to a possible project designed to
increase the output of the construction industry. During this and subse-
quent discussions, it was agreed that a possible project should concentrate
on specific aspects where significant improvement would be possible with the
resources available. It was later decided that measures to increase the
supply of skilled manpower and management expertise available to the industry
were likely to be the most effective. In early 1980, the Government decided
to retain the services of the British Council to provide technical assistance
to be financed under the project. The project was appraised in June/July
1980. An advance of US$280,000 from the Project Preparation Facility (P0128)
was approved by IDA in October 1980 mainly to finance about 25 man-months
of consultancy services required to ensure timely project implementation.
Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. in February 1981. The Government
delegation was led by Mr. R. Paskaralingam, Secretary, Ministry of Local
Government, Housing and Construction. A Staff Appraisal Report entitled
"Sri Lanka - Construction Industry Project" (Report No. 3219-CE, dated
March 3, 1981) is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
A timetable of key events relating to the project and special conditions of
the credit are given in Annex III.
Project Objectives
33.       The project aims to increase the supply of trained manpower and
improve the level of technical management so that the construction industry
can better meet the demands of Sri Lanka's development program. To achieve
this objective, the project will: (i) establish a unified modular training
system for construction-related trades, which will supply the industry with
significant numbers of skilled workers in the shortest possible time; (ii)
improve the use and maintenance of plant and equipment by training operators
and mechanics; (iii) increase the effectiveness of work planning and supervi-
sion by training middle and upper management personnel in contract procedures,
site management and quality control; and (iv) improve government policies and
procedures relating to the industry.



- 11 -
Project Description
34.       The project consists of the following components:  (i) training of
about 45,000 unskilled workers up to a "basic skills" level in areas such as
masonry, carpentry, by means of 8-week long training courses; (ii) upgrading
of skills of about 9,600 skilled workers in the abovementioned areas; (iii)
training of about 1,800 mechanical equipment operators and mechanics, by means
of 12-week long courses for heavy equipment operators, 4-week long courses
for operators of small plant, truck and tractor drivers, and 24-week long
courses for equipment mechanics; (iv) training of about 900 junior work super-
visors in procedures of supervision and quality control, by means of off-site
8-week long courses imparted in cooperation with the CHPB; (v) training of
about 80 senior works managers in improved work planning and management,
entirely under CHPB's responsibility, involving both on-site and off-site
training; (vi) technical assistance to establish and run the training system
under the project and advise on technical and policy issues concerning the
construction industry; and (vii) supply of equipment and materials necessary
to carry out the training program.
35.       The numbers estimated for training are indicative targets that take
into account the requirements of the revised public investment program. It
is estimated that a 15% annual growth of the workforce in the construction
industry over the period 1980-84 is realistically attainable under the project.
The proposed project would train about 57,000 persons, or about 60% of the
expected cumulative increase in the workforce up to mid-1984.
Training Principles
36.       The project will set up a training organization supported by
increased equipment and materials and technical assistance. Training will
be on the modular system, whereby trainees can progress from one level to
a higher level, via a series of short courses interspersed with periods of
job experience. In setting up the training system, job specifications will
be drawn up, from which a list of required end-of-course objectives will
be obtained. On the basis of these training objectives, trainee selection
criteria will be determined, and course curricula and training standards
will be developed. Other features of the project include: a unified stan-
dard for entry to and for passing courses; uniform course content throughout
the country, irrespective of which organization carries out training; and a
unified system of trade testing and certification. The Government will, by
June 30, 1982, standardize selection criteria, training curricula and methods,
testing, certification, and registration of construction workers, supervisors
and specialists (draft DCA, Section 3.07(a)). The proposed system will help
build up a recognized career pattern in the industry, where certificates will
come to have a recognized value in denoting what standard of performance may
be expected from the holder. Trainees in basic skills, advanced skills,
equipment operation and site supervision will be paid an allowance while
undergoing full time training (draft DCA, Section 3.09). The level of the
allowances will be revised, if necessary, in accordance with the average wage
level that the trainee could otherwise expect to receive. Trainee selection
will aim at including women in proportions at least similar to those existing
in the industry as a whole. Concerning geographic and ethnic background of
trainees, an appropriate mix will be obtained through the use of training
centers spread throughout Sri Lanka.

Organization and Implementation
37.       The overall implementation of the project will be the responsibility
of the Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Construction (MLGHC). In
1979, the Government established a Secretaries' Committee for the Construction
Industry (SCCI) under the chairmanship of Secretary, MLGHC to coordinate
policies and use of available resources in the construction industry and to
improve contract documents, specifications and procedures. The SCCI assisted
by the technical assistance team, will act as a steering committee for the
project.
38.       The day to day administration of the project will be carried out
by a Project Cell which has been set up within MLGHC, under a Project Director.
The Project Cell will be responsible for: (i) the preparation of budgets in
collaboration with the various implementing agencies; (ii) the release of funds
and payment of project expenditures; (iii) the maintenance of consolidated
project accounts; (iv) the preparation of applications to IDA for reimburse-
ments; (v) the preparation of monthly progress reviews; and (vi) liaison with
the technical assistance team on all project matters. The annual consolidated
project accounts and audit reports will be submitted to the Association within
nine months after the end of each fiscal year.
39.       In order to obtain maximum benefits from the training program, it
must be allied with a recognized trade testing procedure with certification
for those who pass qualifying standards and central registration of skills.
The entire training program will be supervised by a National Training Committee
-for Construction Industry (NTCCI) which has already been established. NTCCI
will be responsible for the overall planning of training in the construction
industry, and for setting up standards for selection, curricula, testing and
other aspects of construction industry training (draft DCA, Section 3.06(b)).
NTCCI will be assisted by the senior training specialist of the technical
assistance team.
40.       Six Ministries will be concerned with the implementation of the
project. These are:
Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Construction:
Secretaries' Committee for the           - act as a steering com-
Construction Industry                      mittee for the project.
Project Cell                            -  day to day administration
of the project.
National Training Committee             -  overall planning of
for the Construction                       training for the con-
Industry                                   struction industry and
establishment of standards
for admission, curricula
and trade testing for
the industry.
Center for Housing Planning             -  recruit and train technical
and Building                               managers and supervisors.



- 13 -
Ministry of Youth Affairs and Employment:
National Apprenticeship Board           -  administer training at work
sites.
- administer agreed aptitude
and trade tests and intro-
duce registration of skilled
construction workers.
Ministry of Labor:
Department of Labor (Training           -  train masons, carpenters,
Centers)                                   electricians and agricul-
tural tractor drivers/
mechanics.
Ministry of Higher Education:
Department of Higher Education         -   train masons, carpenters,
(Polytechnic and Junior Technical          plumbers and possibly
institutes)                                electricians.
Ministry of Rural Development:
Department of Rural Industries         -   train carpenters
(Training Centers)
Ministry of Lands and Land Development:
River Valleys Development Board        -   allow the use of suitable
construction sites for
equipment operators'
training.
Department of Machinery                -   provide facilities for
and Equipment                              mechanics' training at
Ratmalana workshops.
41.       The physical implementation of the project is planned to commence
in the third quarter 1981 and be completed in three years. Initial technical
assistance is being financed under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) so
that, by the time of credit effectiveness, the Project Cell will be in opera-
tion; adequate liaison between the various ministries involved will have been
established; course curricula will have been drafted and discussed; recruit-
ment and training of local instructors will have begun; and procurement of
mechanical equipment and materials will have commenced. During the first
year, recruitment and training of local staff will be completed and training
will commence in all specialities except technical planning and management,
which will begin in the second year. By the third year, training will have
built up to its maximum level.



- 14 -
42.       The project will be implemented through both on-site and off-site
training. On-site training will be carried out at ongoing work sites, mainly
as production training, i.e., involving the production of useful output, while
training takes place. To this end, several sites have been identified and
arrangements have been made to take over portions of suitable contracts for
on-site training. The project will use existing training institutions as much
as possible for off-site training. Many of these institutions are now under-
utilized and the dropout rate is high. By introducing shorter courses and
providing adequate supply of training materials under the project, their util-
ization will increase.  The Government will make available the facilities of
existing training institutes for construction industry and adjust the ongoing
courses as necessary for implementation of the project (draft DCA, Section 3.08).
43.       Project monitoring will be the responsibility of the NAB, which by
June 30, 1982, will set up a monitoring and evaluation system satisfactory to
IDA, able to assess the qualitative and quantitative impacts of the project
(draft DCA, Section 3.10). Reporting requirements during the course of
project implementation will be in the shape of quarterly progress reports
prepared by the Project Cell and annual reports to review project performance
and recommend changes as needed during implementation.
44.       To set up the systems, train local staff and supervise the project,
a significant amount of technical assistance is necessary. The Government
rlquested, and IDA agreed, that the British Council shall undertake this work.
A total of about 430 man-months of technical assistance is proposed at an
average cost of US$9,500 per man-month. The technical assistance component
has been estimated mainly on the basis of the number of instructors required
to carry out the training at all levels during project implementation. It
also includes the services of a construction industry specialist who will
assist SCCI on technical and policy matters, and a senior training specialist
who will manage the training program.
Cost and Financing
45.       The total project cost is estimated at US$25.0 million (including
taxes, and duties of US$2.6 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange cost
of US$10.8 million. The estimates are based on prices of mid-1980. The pro-
posed credit of US$13.5 million would finance the full foreign exchange cost
and contribute US$2.7 million to local costs, or about 60% of total project
costs, net of taxes and duties.  The remaining local costs, amounting to
US$11.5 million (including taxes and duties) would be met by the Government.
The local cost financing would be in support of the Government's continued
strong efforts to increase savings by reducing the burden of subsidies and
transfer payments (para 11), despite the drop in tax revenues and weak export
prices. Physical contingencies are calculated at 5% for equipment and 10%
for all other items. Price contingencies have been estimated for plant and
equipment at 10.5% in 1980 and 9% in 1981; for technical assistance, at 13.5%
in 1980/81, 8.5% in 1981/82 and 7.5% thereafter; and for other items, at 25%
in 1980, 25% in 1981, 15% in 1982, 12% in 1983 and 10% in 1984.



Procurement and Disbursement
46.       Since plant, vehicles and equipment to be used for training have
to be representative of what is currently available in Sri Lanka, these items
will be procured from suppliers of specified models and types in accordance
with procedures satisfactory to IDA. Such equipment and tools are estimated
to cost $2.5 million. In the event that no models or types can be specified
for a particular tool or piece of equipment, ICB will be used with a preference
amounting to 15% or the import duty, whichever is less, allowed to domestic
manufacturers. Training materials will be procured according to the Govern-
ment's established local procurement methods, which are acceptable to IDA.
For purchases of items with an individual value of US$5,000 or less, and up to
an aggregate amount not exceeding US$125,000, local prudent shopping procedures
may be used. The Association will review all contracts and related documenta-
tion for procurement of goods and services estimated to cost US$100,000 or
more before an award is made. The Association will review the proposal and
rates of the technical assistance to be provided by the British Council before
their services are retained.
47.       Disbursements from the credit will be made as follows:  (i) 100%
of foreign expenditures for directly imported, 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory) for locally manufactured, and 80% of expenditures for locally
procured equipment; (ii) 50% of expenditures for training materials; and
(iii) 100% of expenditures for technical assistance. Advances made from the
PPF with service charge accrued thereon, will be repaid out of the proceeds
of the proposed credit as soon as it is declared effective.
Project Benefits and Risks
48.       The proposed project will increase the capacity of Sri Lanka's
construction industry so that it can better meet the needs of the country's
investment program in the public and private sectors. Benefits will accrue
from the project by: (i) increasing the number of skilled and semi-skilled
workers; (ii) reducing wage inflation at present caused by the shortage of
skilled workers; (iii) increasing employment among unskilled labor; (iv)
improving income levels of individual workers by providing them with extra
skills; (v) increasing returns on invested capital through better use of
equipment and better management; (vi) improving the quality of finished work;
and (vii) improving the effectiveness and productivity of existing training
facilities. Emigration of skilled workers after they have acquired some
experience will probably continue at present levels or more, but it will
increase rather than decrease benefits, due to increased remittances from
abroad.
49.       The largest number of direct beneficiaries of the project will be
workers trained in basic skills, who are mostly from poor backgrounds and tend
at present to be unemployed or underemployed. Others who have some skills at
present and who will undergo advanced training will receive increased earnings.
Organizations carrying out construction work will benefit from better returns
on invested capital, due to better utilization of equipment and a better
supply of skilled labor. Indirectly, the project will benefit all those who
stand to benefit from public and private investment in construction, due to
faster and less expensive completion of works.



- 16 -
50.       The technical and organizational risks of the project are no higher
than normal risks associated with such a project. Shortages or irregular
supplies of training materials, or shortage of recruits for training, may
endanger the success of the project. A degree of flexibility has been built
in the project through short-course format and periodic project performance
reviews, so that training targets and contents may be readjusted, if necessary,
during implementation. This will avoid any possible overproduction of skilled
workers under the project. As materials required for training form only a
small percentage of the total requirements for the industry, advance purchases
will help to reduce the risks of shortages impeding training. Finally, given
the high rate of unemployment among school leavers, the fairly sure prospect
of employment following a few weeks of training, and the allowances to be paid
during the training period, it is expected that there will be no significant
shortage of recruits for training.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Association and the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 504 - Dairy Development Project; US$9.0 million of August 9, 1974;
Effective Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
Progress on project implementation was severely constrained by
the poor supply of cattle available for supplying to project borrowers and
disparities in the pricing structure for milk, meat and cattle feed. The
Government has acted to provide appropriate incentives to the dairy sector
by raising the producer price of milk and stabilizing feed prices. We are
considering shifting the project focus from credit to supporting dairy
cooperatives, in a manner similar to the Anand pattern of dairy cooperatives
in India. The successful ongoing pilot calf/heifer rearing and pasture
programs have been expanded. The closing date was extended by one year to
allow time for reorientation of project activities.
Cr. No. 666 - Tank Irrigation Modernization Project; US$5.0 million of
January 12, 1977; Effective Date: April 12, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Significant improvement in project implementation progress and
construction quality has been made during the last one year. A new manage-
ment team has been posted, which is planning, scheduling and coordinating
work actions much more capably than the previous project manager. Equipment
maintenance and downtime is still a problem, but a new maintenance workshop
is scheduled for completion by March 1981 and new construction equipment has
been procured. A water management program was planned for the whole of the
Mahakandarawa subproject area during maha 1980/81, utilizing rainfall to the
maximum extent possible so that tank water can be conserved for the yala crop.
Farmers have been organized within each turnout for rotational water issues
and all fields were ploughed early (by the onset of the rains) enabling
planting. Considerable enthusiasm has been generated for this trial program
and it appears to be successful. Project completion is now anticipated by
December 1982.
Cr. No. 701 - Mahaweli Ganga Development II Project; US$19.0 million
of June 27, 1977; Effective Date: December 29, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
Considerable progress has been achieved in the construction of the
irrigation system and the outlook for completing the project about one year
ahead of schedule remains good. Settlement of project farms is well advanced.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

ANNEX II
Page 3
About half of the total of about 13,500 farms had been settled by late 1980
and settlement of all areas is scheduled for completion by late 1981. However,
on-farm development work is not keeping pace with settlement and only about
40% of the lands settled are cultivable. The completion of social infrastruc-
ture is lagging considerably behind other project components but steps have
been taken to accelerate this work. Water issues have started in some of
the recently settled project areas and water charges have been initiated in
adjoining areas of System H completed previously (a total of about Rs 180,000
had been collected up to June 1980). Quality control measures and the quality
of completed works have improved considerably. The full complement of agri-
cultural extension staff has been posted and extension activities are improving.
Disbursements are still behind schedule but are expected to increase signifi-
cantly in 1981 with the submission of claims for works already completed or
under execution.
Cr. No. 709 - Water Supply Project; US$9.2 million of June 30, 1977;
Effective Date:  February 8, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
The Project has made good progress in the procurement of equipment
and materials and construction of works. Disbursements out of the IDA Credit
and the IDA-administered CIDA Credit have moved fast in recent months but
disbursements out of EEC Special Action Credit continue to be slow. Financial
management of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (WDB) has improved
and WDB now produces financial information required for management.
WDB's progress in implementing the consumer metering program is
unsatisfactory. It has recently taken measures to accelerate the program.
Cr. No. 742 - Fourth Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon Project;
US$8.0 million of September 30, 1977; Effective Date:
December 16, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Subprojects for US$7.8 million have been authorized. DFCC remains
a competent institution, with a rapidly increasing level of activity, which
could increase further now that DFCC's staffing problems are being addressed,
and possibilities for expanding DFCC's low equity base are being pursued.
Cr. No. 818 - Tree Crop Rehabilitation (Tea) Project; US$21.0 million
of July 12, 1978; Effective Date: December 28, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984
Project progress is satisfactory. Procurement is under way; all
tender documents have been issued. Due to sharp cost increases, both housing
and field rehabilitation programs are being revised. For the former, more
emphasis will be placed on renovation rather than building new cottages. For
the latter, more emphasis will be given to infilling as opposed to replanting.
All other project components, namely health component, training component and
tea area measurement, are progressing satisfactorily.

Cr. No. 819 - Tree Crop Diversification (Tea) Project; US$4.5 million
of July 12, 1978; Effective Date: December 15, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The National Agricultural Development and Settlement Authority, the
project executing agency, has developed into a mature development organization
which is operating efficiently under capable management. Despite some delay
in procurement of equipment, progress in field work is impressive. Cluster
selection and homestead and farm demarcation, and soil conservation work
have been completed.  About 2,000 settlers have occupied their houses.  Farm
planting schedule was disrupted by the severe and prolonged drought last year.
With normal conditions this year, all plantings are expected to be completed
by end-1981.
Cr. No. 891 - Kurunegala Rural Development Project; US$20.0 million
of April 26, 1979; Effective Date: August 27, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project is generally on schedule; rural electrification works
have already been completed; and rural roads and education works should be
completed by the end of the year. Problems on quality of construction of
irrigation and education works were identified at early stage of project
implementation. Supervisory consultants, soon to be appointed for the
Second Rural Development Project, will help improve construction activities.
Improvements on the institutional arrangements for agricultural credit and
agricultural extension are somewhat slower than expected. High cost overruns
was noted in nearly all project components. Efforts are being made to cut
down cost by introducing farmers' donated labor for some of the activities.
Cr. No. 900 - Road Maintenance Project; US$16.5 million of June 22, 1979;
Effective Date: December 19, 1979; Closing Date: June 30,
1984
The project is progressing reasonably well, but continuing steep
increases in construction costs make constant review of the project scope and
costs essential. For the same reason, some financial limits in the Develop-
ment Credit Agreement have been revised upwards in order that implementation
of urgent bridge and road rehabilitation shall not be delayed. Consultants
have been appointed, contract documents revised and improved, equipment has
been ordered and a pilot road maintenance district set up.
Cr. No. 931 - Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project; US$15.5
million of July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 4, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985
Implementation during the first year has been slower than anticipated
due to delays in procurement and staffing. Recently, however, most full time
staff have been recruited and procurement of vehicles and equipment are underway.
With these, implementation is likely to improve. Civil works are progressing
satisfactorily. Some questions have been raised as to the feasibility of
operating the T&V method of extension in the wet zones dominated by tree crops,
absentee landlord and inadequate infrastructure. These and other implementa-
tion issues would be reviewed by IDA and the Government in June/July, 1981.

Cr. No. 942 - Small and Medium Industries Project; US$16.0 million
of July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 23, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The principal objectives of the project would be to encourage and
assist growth and productivity improvement of small and medium firms, defined
as enterprises having plant and equipment valued at less than Rs 1 million,
so as to increase their contribution to efficiernt low cost employment creation,
export expansion, regional development and economic growth. About 55% of the
total subloan amount has already been committed, but disbursements through
the refinancing facility and IDA credit are lagging due to delays in claiming
reimbursement and implementation of the subprojects. Most technical assistance
activities have either been completed or are well underway.
Cr. No. 979 - Mahaweli Ganga Technical Assistance Project; US3.0 million;
Effective Date: July 7, 1980; Closing Date: September 30,
1982.
A consultancy contract was awarded in July, 1980 for the preparation
of specifications and tender documents for the Minipe Right Bank Transbasin
Canal and for the preparation of final designs and tender documents for
irrigation and social infrastructure in System C. The consultant is assisting
MDB in the designs for System C and the designs have been essentially completed
for Zones 3 and 4. A consultancy contract was awarded during August, 1980 for
studies to determine the most economically viable and technically feasible
plan for conveying surplus flows of the Mahaweli Ganga to the North Central
River Basin and/or Northwest or Southeast Dry Zones and utilizing the water
for irrigated agriculture.
Cr. No. 994 - Road Passenger Transport Project; US$53 million; Effective
Date: October 27, 1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Consultants have been appointed in the fields of procurement,
industrial engineering and accounting. Bid documents for procurement of
bus chassis and materials have been issued. Bus fares were increased twice
during 1980, the last increase becoming effective in November. Weak and
inefficient management continues to plague the Transport Boards whose com-
bined operating losses are a matter of serious concern. IDA is discussing
with the Government suitable measures to improve the situation.
Cr. No. 1017 - Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation Project; US$16.0 million;
Effective Date: September 10, 1980; Closing Date: June 30,
1986.
The project is making satisfactory progress. A suitable part-time
Project Coordinator and a full-time Project Officer have been appointed.
Recruitment of additional extension staff has started. Orders have been
placed for planting materials for the first planting season (1981).

Cr. No. 1020 - Telecommunications Project; US$30.0 million; Effective Date:
September 10, 1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
The Government has already established a separate Telecommunications
Department as part of organizational improvements under the project. The
Government has also increased overseas telephone and telex rates.  Bid docu-
ments for procurement are under preparation.
Cr. No. 1041 - Water Supply and Sewerage II Project; US$30.0 million;
Effective Date:  February 26, 1981; Closing Date:
September 30, 1985.
Engineering consultants to supervise the construction of sewerage
works under the Project, and financial consultants have already been appointed.
An agreement for cofinancing in the amount of US$30.0 million from Saudi Fund
for Development was signed on January 8, 1981.
Cr. No. 1048 - Sixth Power Project; US$19.5 million; Not Yet Effective.
Closing Date: March 31, 1985.
Procurement is now proceeding satisfactorily after initial delays:
final tender documents for four of the five contracts have been cleared and
will be advertised shortly. An agreement for cofinancing in the amount of
US$20.0 million was signed between the Government and Saudi Fund for Develop-
ment on January 8, 1981. The average tariff for power supplied by the Ceylon
Electricity Board was increased from about Rs 0.30 to Rs 0.58/kWh.
Cr. No. 1079 - Second Rural Development Project; US$33.5 million;
Not Yet Effective; Closing Date: June 30, 1986.
The project was signed on February 2, 1981. Supervisory consul-
tants have been selected and procurement of essential vehicles and equipment
initiated.
