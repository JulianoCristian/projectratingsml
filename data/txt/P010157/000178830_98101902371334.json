Industry Training\n            Project aims to increase the supply of trained manpower and\n            improve the level of technical management expertise in the\n            construction industry. To achieve this objective, the\n            project will establish a unified modular training system for\n            construction-related trades and improve the use and\n            maintenance of plant and equipment. The Construction\n            Industry Training Project consists of the following\n            components: (i) training of about 45,000 unskilled workers\n            up to a basic skill level; (ii) upgrading of skills of about\n            9,600 skilled workers; (iii) training of about 1,800\n            mechanical equipment operators and mechanics; (iv) training\n            of about 900 junior work supervisors; (v) training of about\n            80 senior work managers; (vi) provision of equipment and\n            training materials; and (vii) technical assistance. The\n            Construction Industry Training Project does not involve any\n            unusual risk associated with similar type projects."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
