I", "versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Provincial Health\n            Project for Indonesia are as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also rated as\n            moderately satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned\n            included: 1) the central government has limited capacity for\n            decentralization and has not adequately adjusted its\n            structure and functions to respond to the needs. In the\n            early days of decentralization in Indonesia expert and\n            policymakers focused on the limited capacity of districts\n            and provinces to assume their new responsibilities. That the\n            central government needed to scale back on its\n            implementation activities and assume new leadership roles\n            was assumed to be a relatively easy transition. But in time\n            the inability of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to restructure\n            and change its mind-set have emerged as major obstacles to\n            effective decentralization of the health system. Future\n            projects need to address or adapt to the weak leadership\n            from the central level; 2) as stated in the Guidelines for\n            the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), project development\n            objectives should focus on the outcome for which the project\n            can be held accountable given the project's duration,\n            resources and approach. Performance indicators (PI) need to\n            be selected more thoughtfully, defined more precisely, and\n            measured much more carefully. If performance indicators with\n            targets must be set, maybe such targets could be conditional\n            given the uncertainty surrounding current changes in\n            governance. Moreover, both Government of Indonesia (GOI) and\n            Bank could have tried to formally revise the indicators\n            during the life of the operation; and 3) while the project\n            gave excellent insights on institutional changes and why\n            those should happen, in many areas it was less specific on\n            the how. While that is part of the flexibility of the\n            design, in many areas the provinces and districts needed\n            some more guidance and lessons from other provinces and\n            countries to learn how best to proceed."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
