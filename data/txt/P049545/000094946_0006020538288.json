The first component sets the stage for\n            decentralization and health reform, while helping to sustain\n            health social safety net services introduced during the\n            economic crisis. Task forces will address institutional and\n            health sector issues and assist in building district\n            implementation capacity, including upgrading health\n            information systems. Some results expected by the end of\n            2001 include finalization of the division of\n            responsibilities and institutional arrangements between\n            districts and provinces, a human resource development plan,\n            staff training, baseline surveys and mapping of poverty\n            areas, developing integrated health planning and budgeting\n            systems, reviewing and piloting alternative insurance\n            approaches, examining tax-based and other means of\n            generating resources for health, introducing quality\n            assurance programs, and intensifying health promotion.\n            Grants will be made available to districts to finance\n            implementation of the recommendations made by the task\n            forces and to reform and improve district level health\n            services. The second component helps the central health\n            ministry become an effective, analytical, advisory, and\n            advocacy agency; and provides grants to provinces and districts."}, "docdt": "2000-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
