They often are of a political economy nature, as\n            well as technical; and both kinds of risks need to be\n            recognized and planned for. In Indonesia, reluctance to\n            introduce accompanying regulations to new laws was an\n            indicator that new institutional arrangements had yet to\n            mature; and that government was not yet ready to firm up its\n            options for defining new responsibilities. Conventional\n            government processes (budget processes, fiduciary controls)\n            should be amenable to adjustment, especially when the\n            emphasis is on piloting new methods. The purpose of piloting\n            is to learn and adapt, which requires some flexibility. All\n            three projects were piloting new complex reforms in an\n            unsettled environment. All three were closely sequenced,\n            offering limited opportunity for transmitting learning from\n            one project to another. Projects introducing new\n            institutions must be seen as opportunities for learning and\n            improving, and sequencing should have that in mind."}, "docdt": "2013-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
