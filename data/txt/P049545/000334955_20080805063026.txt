F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
1. To bring about effective health sector decentralization in the provinces of Lampung
and Yogyakarta. The challenge during this period of institutional change and limited
economic recovery is to protect health services which are essential for the poor and
public at large while implementing key sector reforms and putting health financing on a
firm footing.




                                            ii

  2. To help the central ministry carry out its new role in a decentralized system in
Lampung, Yogyakarta and other provinces. This role encompasses analysis of key issues,
advocacy of best practices and standards, and support for local initiative and innovation.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The First Provincial Health Project (PHP I) was launched in August 2000, during a
turbulent period in Indonesia's history. Indonesia was hit hard by the Asian economic
crisis of the late 1990s. This introduced a period of rapid and major change in governance.
Complex and unpredictable processes of democratic reform and decentralization
provided the context for the design and final preparation phases of PHP I, especially new
legislation on "regional autonomy" (decentralization) announced in 1999.1

The changes in governance and society provided both opportunities and risks for the
health sector, which was itself still recovering from the economic crisis. The project's
primary aim was effective decentralization of the health sector, mainly in the provinces of
Lampung and DI Yogyakarta.2 This aim entailed protecting health services essential for
the poor and the public at large, initiating key sector reforms, improving health financing,
and helping the Ministry of Health (MOH) assume new roles. These objectives could be
expected to contribute to achieving the CAS post-economic crisis goal of reinforcing
social safety nets and strengthening institutions to support sustainable growth.

The Project provinces were selected to provide different lessons and experiences. Yogya
presented a more developed province with capacity and ability to undertake reforms and
provide key lessons for how other provinces can handle decentralization, while Lampung
had more limited capacity and as such can provide important lessons on how capacity and
reforms can be developed that are suited to the provincial and district needs.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PDO as stated in the PAD were:

a. Bring about effective health decentralization in the provinces of Lampung and
    Yogyakarta. This involves protecting health services of the poor and the public at
    large, initiating key sector reforms, and putting health financing on a firm footing.

b. Help the central health ministry (MOH) carry out its new role to provide analysis of
    key issues, advocacy of best practices and standards, and support for local initiative
    and innovation.



1Notably Law 22 of 1999 on Regional Autonomy (Pemerintahan Daerah) and Law 25 on Financial Balance between
Central and Regional Government (Perimbangan Keuangan Antara Pemerintah Pusat dan Daerah).

2For historical reasons the Province of Yogyakarta goes by the title Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (Special Region of
Yogyakarta); this is often abbreviated to Yogyakarta, or simply Yogya.




                                                           1

The PAD listed three key performance indicators for the PDO to gauge project
performance:

a. The introduction and implementation of new organization structures, health financing
    mechanisms, and work force policies.

b. The establishment and operation of effective, locally specific curative service
    delivery, and financing arrangements.

c. The establishment and operation of effective, locally specific public health service
    provisions, and financing arrangements.

The above three Key Performance Indicators for the PDO are too broad and an
impediment for arriving at a meaningful assessment of the extent to which the two PDOs
have been achieved. Because of the lack of specificity of the PDO Indicators the ICR
team decided to assess the extent to which the two PDOs were achieved by examining (in
Section 3.2, "Achievement of Project Development Objectives") the extent to which the
objectives specific to each of the eight components were achieved.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

The PDO were not revised. The implementation period was extended for 18 months from
June 30, 2006, to December 31, 2007, by amendment of the Credit Agreement; it was
agreed that for this period activities in Lampung Province would concentrate on efforts to
reduce infant and maternal mortality, but still within the existing framework of the
project, while in Yogyakarta, activities would continue with health reform efforts,
especially in health financing, workforce regulation, and health information systems.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries were identified as poor households living in Lampung and
Yogyakarta, estimated to comprise approximately 570,000 individuals in Yogyakarta and
1.5 million in Lampung in 1999. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, household
expenditure data (cited in the PAD), the percentage of poor people in the two provinces
combined was just under 11 percent in 1996, but had risen to 18 percent in early 1999
due to the economic crisis.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

As described in the PAD (pp. 8-9), the project had two main parts: a Provincial/district
part that consists of 5 components (referred to as A1-A5 below) and a central part that
consists of 3 components (referred to as B1 to B3). Most of the activities of the central
component as well as key developmental aspects of the provincial ones were expected to
be completed in the first phase of the project (expected to be about 18 months) Having
established an appropriate institutional framework for implementation and having the
Task Forces studied the relevant issues and made their recommendations in the first
phase, the second phase would then focus mostly on awarding of block grants to districts
and implement key recommendations.

Component A3. Improving Health Service Access and Quality (District and
Provincial) ­ $4.17 million
This component was only implemented during 2000 and 2001 (Phase 1) and aimed at: (a)
implementing specific health service activities, including the refurbishing of health care
facilities, upgrading medical equipment, increasing the number of mobile health service
facilities and contracting private health service providers for the delivery of basic health
services to designated areas; (b) implementing quality assurance programs and upgrading
the quality of health sector personnel through the implementation of fellowship
programs; (c) establishing a health promotion board in Yogyakarta to coordinate health
with public and private sector promotion activities; and (d) providing specific drugs and

1.6 Revised Components

No revised components.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

No other significant changes, although it is worth noting that Ministry of Health (MOH)
assigned the core management group at the Ministry with the Central Project
Coordination Unit (CPCU) for PHP I similar responsibilities for PHP II during the last 14
months of its activities (closing June 302007), after the latter project's own management
group was implicated in documented corruption. On May 30, 2006, upon request from
the Government, the World Bank cancelled a part of the loan amounting US$ 2.9 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background analysis was sound in the way it drew on experience with the Bank's 16
previous health projects in Indonesia and identified "entrenched problems" in Indonesia's
health sector.3 Decentralization has a long and complex history in Indonesia going back
to colonial times.4 The idea for a Bank project facilitating effective decentralization of the
health sector dates from the early nineties, although what was proposed then was
certainly a more limited transfer of authority to the regions than that envisioned in the
late nineties.

With the advantage of hindsight, further analysis would have been helpful looking at how
decentralization could be expected to impact the underlying causes of the entrenched
problems in the sector. The Bank identified many factors behind the "unsatisfactory
health system performance in the 1990s" and the "disengaged worldview" within the
health labor force.5 Few would argue with the Bank's view that "decentralization and
related steps can lead to conditions in which providers have the incentives, skills,
supervision, material support, and discretionary authority needed to offer high quality
services, and clients have the information, financial means, and bargaining power
required to elicit appropriate responses." The key phrase which did not receive sufficient
analysis is "can lead to conditions." There were many things wrong with the health

system before decentralization, but they were not all due to centralized governance.
Decentralization per se could not be expected to sweep away all the underlying causes of
the system's poor performance. Further analysis of underlying causes was needed to
distinguish those underlying causes of poor performance which could be transformed by
decentralization and those which would likely be unaffected by decentralization.

Final plans and the drafting of documents for PHP I were completed unusually quickly,6
as indeed was the case for the Government's 1999 decentralization laws themselves.
Bank officials knew that decentralization was going to happen whether the Bank had an
approved project or not. The Bank can be commended that it was the only donor with a
project already in place to assist decentralization of the health sector before the so-called
"Big Bang" on January 1, 2001.7 No one could see clearly how the implementation of
decentralization would evolve; the important thing was to put mechanisms in place which
could respond well to opportunities and risks (both anticipated and unanticipated) which
the sector would experience following implementation of the 1999 laws.

One especially strong feature of project design was the way those of its components
which focused on regional governance (i.e. components A1-A5) assigned explicit
functions and roles to the province. Law 22/1999 transferred most authority for health
(and other sectors) to the districts; it eliminated the province-district hierarchy and left
few explicit functions for the province to perform. It was perceptive of the Bank team to
recognize that there were nevertheless still crucial and indispensable functions and roles
in the health system that had to be performed at an intermediate level between center and
district (e.g. technical support and quality control for district programs, communicable
disease surveillance and control, health promotion, medium to large volume procurement,
regulatory tasks and personnel management). It was a bold move to propose specific and
innovative mechanisms (JHC, TRT, Task Forces, and the Provincial Health Promotion
Board) so that the provinces could perform these functions and roles even though the
need for them was not clearly stated or recognized in the 1999 laws.8

A significant weakness in design, at least according to regional government officials
interviewed by the ICR team, was that while the project proposed a lot of innovative
changes it did not give much guidance about how to prioritize them or arrange them in
some temporal sequence, or indeed give much guidance about how actually to set about
designing and implementing them. "We were expected to implement too much all at
once," they said, and this at a time when they already had to adapt to far-reaching
changes in the principles and structures of governance, (especially around the time of the



6For example the Project Administration Manual was still only in rough draft when the credit was signed.

7Many of the prescriptions of the 1999 laws were supposed to take effect on January 1, 2001, including the
transfer of hundreds of thousands of civil servants to regional governments who had before been under the
direct management of the central government. In Indonesia this event is often referred to as the "Big Bang."

8The need was however recognized later (in broad terms) in Law 32/2004, which superseded Law 25/1999.

"Big Bang" during the first year of the project) quite apart from those changes
highlighted for special attention by the project. The project aimed to build capacity, but
its design also implicitly presupposed the prior existence of significant capacity,
sometimes more than was actually the case.

Based on its findings, the ICR team rates Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory
although QAG rating for QEA was Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

The ISRs consistently rated Implementation Progress (IP) as satisfactory or moderately
satisfactory. In fact implementation of the project varied considerably by government
level and by province. Implementation in Yogyakarta was generally satisfactory, in
Lampung moderately satisfactory, and at the central level generally unsatisfactory.
Different factors affected implementation at different levels and Yogyakarta was better
able to counter negative factors than Lampung.

On the positive side the innovative instruments introduced by the project at the provincial
level (TRT, JHC, TFs, etc.) were, overall, successful and contributed to the success of the
district grants component. Of these mechanisms the Technical Review Team (TRT) was
the most successful, although it was difficult to find enough members with sufficient
expertise in Lampung. Experience with the Joint Health Council (JHC) confirmed the
need for a mechanism supporting cross-district discussion of health issues but it proved
unrealistic to expect district heads to attend regular meetings on health, and the
mechanism needed fine-tuning. Similarly, Task Force (TF)s proved essential to the
reform process but once again Lampung was handicapped by the lack of local expertise.
Short term technical assistance (TA) was used but it is less than ideal option for building
capacity and providing continuous support. Yogyakarta enjoyed a tremendous advantage
in this regard in that it had first-rate consultants close-at-hand at Gadjah Mada University,
and the provincial government has a long tradition of working closely with them.

According to those responsible for implementing the project, the factor that had the most
serious negative impact on project implementation was the lateness in the disbursement
of funds by the central government. This problem was outside the control of the
implementing agency (MOH). It reached its lowest point when funds for FY 2005 were
not released to the districts until October. This was at a time when the Ministry of
Finance was introducing a new accounting system; but even in "normal" years funds
would not arrive before June or July (May at the earliest). This not only affected the
regions' capacity for implementing activities and their absorption rates, it also
undermined the very concept the project was trying to foster, namely, responsible
integrated planning and budgeting at local level.

Another factor which constrained reform and innovation in the health system at regional
levels was that the policy environment produced by the central level was constantly
shifting and changing; precise details regarding the distribution of authorities across
government levels are still far from perfectly clear. Provinces and districts were reluctant



                                                7

to introduce innovative changes (for example, concerning licensing arrangements,
locally-specific HIS, or health insurance) if it was not perfectly clear that they had the
legal authority to do so, or if they were concerned that their efforts would be thwarted or
annulled later by new regulations issued by the central government. Perhaps more
importantly was the shifting role of the province in various formulations of how
decentralization will work from very limited role to one to provide capacity and support
or to provide the linchpin between the center and the districts. The institutional
uncertainty did not provide the supportive environment for more innovation to take place.

Civil servants faced considerable uncertainty around the time of the Big Bang, and
although the process as a whole went smoothly many individuals were worried by
potential loss of status and security. Under these circumstances it was highly ambitious to
expect all the activities listed for Phase 1 in the PAD to be completed in 18 months and
many took longer.9 A longer period for the first phase may have helped provinces with
less capacity like Lampung be more prepared for phase II.

The provinces experienced difficulties in conducting reform on human resource
management policies as foreseen by the project. The lack of major civil service reform at
the national level remains an enormous obstacle to health sector reform.10 When the
project was designed it was reasonable to assume that with decentralization regions
would enjoy much more control over their personnel than has turned out to be the case;
even as civil servants have been transferred to regional offices they still remain part of a
national civil service system, and PP 25/2000 and subsequent policy instruments make it
clear that the central government retains essential control over the entire service.

There were significant changes in the national policy for regulatory framework during the
course of the project. Law 29/2004 (on medical practice of doctors and dentists) provides
a good model for establishing a legal framework for setting national standards for health
professionals on the one hand, and for licensing health professionals at the regional levels
in a way that incorporates competency tests based on national standards on the other.
Draft legislation for the licensing of nurses is currently before the parliament. Meanwhile,
the licensing of midwives is regulated by a 2002 MOH decree.

In 2005 a new health financing scheme, Askeskin, was introduced to cover the poor using
Government money saved by reducing the oil subsidy. Askeskin is built on the social
safety net model (JPS-BK) developed at the time of the Asian financial crisis. In the PAD
the Bank, while recognizing the merits of JPS-BK as an emergency measure cautioned
against its adoption and extension over the long term because of issues of sustainability



9Because of delays in starting the project Phase 1 was already truncated and totaled less than 18 months,
adding to the difficulties of completing Phase 1 activities before the scheduled end of the phase.

and other distortion effects. When Askeskin became a national policy, project provinces
had little option but to adopt the scheme. Yogyakarta province combined Askeskin
financing with their own insurance program developed under the project, Jamkesos, and
increase coverage to include the non-poor population.

Until February 2006, the Project Director position at MOH was assigned to the Secretary
General because PHP I is a sector-wide project and involves all divisions, while the
Deputy Director position was assigned to the Head of Bureau of Planning. However,
these positions within MOH are not normally involved with project implementation. The
unit was soon overwhelmed with the project management tasks and delegated most
management responsibilities to the CPCU. This was even more pronounced when 4 other
similar projects (two new projects each financed by the World Bank and the ADB) were
also put under the Bureau of Planning. Because the CPCU was an ad hoc unit, it did not
have the credibility to bring key central level units into project implementation and this,
for the large part, explained the poor performance of the central level components.

Implementation in Yogyakarta was seriously disrupted by the 2006 earthquake.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E was uneven and overall less than satisfactory.

M&E Design

M&E design was weak. As discussed in Section 1.2, the three key performance indicators
for the PDO listed in the PAD were too broad. The PAD (Annex 1) also contained a large
number of output indicators (with 9 of them in the Credit Agreement). The output
indicators actually included both process and output variables and ranged across 3
components (A1, A2 and A4). There was no clear rationale given for some of the targets
sets for some indicators. For example setting a target of reducing non-health staff by 20
percent across the board seems arbitrary. Other indicators were not easy to measure and
with some effort could have been better aligned with existing surveys (e.g. the contact
rate of poor people at health centers): More effort could have been made in terms of
ensuring availability of reliable data for some of the indicators.

M&E Implementation

The weak M&E design and the week capacity of the unit put in charge of this activitiy -
the independent Research Unit (RU) resulted in difficulty in getting a good idea about the
performance of the operation. The consultancy company contracted by the MOH to run
the RU seems to have lacked some of the necessary social research skills. The MOH gave
the contract for the "second" Final Review, conducted at the end of 2007, to another
company which did a better job. In addition, for some indicators related to financing or
budgets, the fragmentation and changes in the system made it very hard to get data or
trends as the system kept changing. Additional studies were commissioned for providing
data needed for the mid term review and end of project implementation.



                                              9

M&E Utilization

M&E utilization by project management was slight. Those responsible for managing the
project rarely had the data they needed for analyzing problems in depth and improving
performance. The project was also subjected to a number of GOI and Bank audits, which
did uncover some financial irregularities. This focused management attention much more
on the fiduciary monitoring and less so on the outputs and outcomes of the operation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Private auditors selected by the implementing agency for conducting interim audits in the
early years of PHP I did not perform well. When corruption at the MOH was uncovered
in 2005 involving the CPCU for PHP II, the MOH took action, while the Bank conducted
a special mission and proposed an action plan to strengthen financial control of the whole
series of provincial operations (3 in total) of which the current project is the first (referred
to as PHP I, PHP II and PHP III) and send a clear message of deterrence to all PHP staff,
as well as attempting to resolve the specific issues of PHP II. The action plan included (i)
strengthening of controls by removing financial and procurement management control
from the Bureau of Planning to relevant units within MOH, (ii) recruiting a firm to
conduct internal audits of the projects while working with the IG's office to strengthen
internal control within MOH, (iii) expanding investigations to include more samples to
determine the full extent of ineligible expenditures, (iv) appointing BPK to replace BPKP
as external auditors, and (v) temporary withholding payment in PHP II until immediate
actions were taken. All actions except for (iii) and (v) were also applied to PHP I and
PHP III. Until the end of the project, recruitment of a firm to conduct internal audit has
not been completed.

Occasional financial irregularities occurred in PHP I, especially involving procurement at
the district level. In general, findings involved small contracts and did not result in the
Bank declaring misprocurement. District staff were not familiar with Bank rules and
procedures and despite efforts to clarify project management manual and increase the
frequency of procurement training and supervision, officials told the ICR team that it
remains difficult to reconcile Bank auditing and procurement requirements with those of
the GOI. This is obviously an area that needs closer attention in the design of future
projects.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

Yogyakarta assured the ICR team they have mechanisms in place to sustain positive
outcomes beyond the life of the project. The province released a Governor decree to
legalize the existence of the provincial health insurance body (Jamkesos) and the quality
council (Badan Mutu). It also continued to allocate funding for expanding the
implementation of the integrated health information system in collaboration with the five
districts in the province. Without block grants to support spending for health
development, the district health offices have no option but to compete with other sectors
for local government funding as happened prior to the project. Nevertheless, there was



                                              10

consensus among those interviewed by the ICR team that the project has contributed to
improving the capacity of the districts in developing a stronger plan, useful for
advocating for more resources for health. The central government has cut funding for
health in FY 2008 (although there were significant increases in earlier years so the net
effect is not clear and a health financing study is currently underway).


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The two PDO were both of high strategic relevance to the development of the health
sector at the time of credit approval, and they remain of high strategic relevance today.
Bringing about effective health decentralization in the provinces is still an important
policy objective, and the MOH still needs help in carrying out its new roles and
responsibilities under decentralization.

The relevance of some of the more specific objectives and targets of specific project
components, however, shifted during the history of the project as the central government
progressively revised and redefined elements of the national policy environment within
which the project was being implemented. Law 1/2004, for example, introduced the
concept of Badan Layanan Umum (BLU, or General Service Unit), which introduced
new principles regarding how government units might retain and utilize revenues
obtained from providing services to the public: this meant the project's focus on
converting hospitals and health centers to "swadana" status as part of a more general
resource mobilization strategy in the health sector needed to be reconsidered and aligned
with the new policy. A series of decrees and regulations issued by the Ministry of Home
Affairs (MOHA) defining and redefining the functions, responsibilities and organizing
principles for provincial and district governments was especially important. While the
flexibility in the project design was very helpful in light of all these changes, the
government system and budget revisions to allow the project to use the flexibility delayed
implementation and at times limited the flexibility offered by the design.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Project Development Objectives of PHP I were defined broadly, and so were the
three PDO Indicators specified in the PAD. In view of this, the ICR uses the more
specific objectives and outputs of the eight project components in order to arrive at an
assessment of the extent to which the two PDOs were achieved.

In the subsections below we first assess the extent to which the project achieved the first
PDO by achieving the objectives of the first 5 components; we then assess the extent of
achievement of the second PDO by reviewing the achievements of the last 3 components

First PDO/Provincial Level: Bring about effective health decentralization in the
provinces of Lampung and Yogyakarta. This involves protecting health services of the



                                              11

poor and public at large, initiating key sector reforms, and putting health financing on a
firm footing.

Component A1. Managing Decentralization (District and Provincial)

Performance on items (a) restructuring health service organizations and (b) reorganizing
the management structures of entities implementing health services are rated by the ICR
team satisfactory in both Yogyakarta and Lampung provinces.11 The transfer of scores of
civil servants previously working for local offices of the central government (Kanwil and
Kandep) in the 2 provinces to local government health offices (Dinas) under the
provincial governor or the district head went smoothly, as indeed was the case throughout
the country, and the governors and district heads involved promptly passed relevant
decrees establishing appropriate organizational structures in accordance with prevailing
laws. Project resources were used to fine-tune and augment the new organizational
structures and socialize its principles and mechanisms. The introduction of Joint Health
Councils (JHCs), Technical Review Teams (TRTs) and Task Forces (TFs) at the province
level proved especially valuable. Yogyakarta went further than Lampung and established
some additional innovative structures, for example, Provincial Health Promotion Board
(HPB), Provincial Health Service Quality Board (BMPK), and Technical Assistance
Teams (TATs) that are not to be found in Lampung.

Performance on item (c) developing and implementing new human resource management
policies, is rated moderately satisfactory in Yogyakarta and moderately unsatisfactory in
Lampung. Achieving the objective of developing and implementing new human resource
management policies was essentially beyond the control of those responsible for the
project without further enabling regulations from the central government. Nonetheless
regional governments do have significant control over the allocation of staff and various
privileges, and Yogyakarta appears to have taken advantage of these opportunities more
than Lampung for example by undertaking systematic study of their personnel needs and
pushing against the limits of national policy as much as possible.

Performance for item (d) at the provincial level, developing and implementing new health
information systems covering health indicators, and service delivery, facility and staffing
information, is rated satisfactory for Yogyakarta and unsatisfactory for Lampung.
Yogyakarta is now well on the way to having a good HIS. Lampung's plans to introduce
a province-specific HIS have been less successful although they are working to adopt
some of the work done by Yogyakarta. The major uncertainty relates to the center.
Ideally the center should provide general guidance and the provinces tailor the model to
their needs and conditions. However, the delays and lack of certainty from the center
have hindered this. The hope is that the center will take into account and build on these
positive developments if they move forward on a new HIS.




11More data and analysis used by the ICR team to determine their ratings are given in Annex 2.




                                                  12

Performance on item (e) strengthening public accountability mechanisms, is rated
satisfactory in Yogyakarta and unsatisfactory in Lampung. There are effective public
accountability mechanisms throughout Yogyakarta province for example, the complaint
hotline service, public accountability forum, health newsletter and so forth, but not yet in
Lampung.

Performance on item (f) strengthening the policy regulatory framework for health
services, including the establishment of a health council and a health care accreditation
agency at the provincial level, is rated satisfactory for Yogyakarta and unsatisfactory for
Lampung. Yogyakarta has had new licensing systems for midwives and nurses which
include competency tests since 2003, as well as having taken the lead on licensing for
doctors and dentists since before the new 2004 national law. An important part of the
system is a Quality Council (Badan Mutu) established by the province as a semi-
independent body for conducting provider assessment against national standards and
providing recommendation for licensing and accreditation. Lampung is behind on this
path.

Component A2. Mobilizing Resources (District and Provincial)

Performance on item (a) at the provincial level, developing and implementing
decentralized health service planning, budgeting and financing systems designed to
permit districts to plan and develop efficient, effective and equitable programs according
to community needs, is rated satisfactory in Yogyakarta and moderately satisfactory in
Lampung. The capacity for planning and budgeting increased markedly in all districts
and the districts gained considerable experience in this area through preparing annual
grant proposals under the project. The province-level systems supporting these activities
are more advanced and better organized in Yogyakarta than in Lampung.

Performance on item (b) converting hospitals, health centers and other health service
units into autonomous units (swadana)12 which will possess, inter alia, the authority to
apply cost recovery measures, is rated moderately satisfactory in Yogyakarta and
moderately unsatisfactory in Lampung, although this is one of those objectives which
maybe should have been adjusted to bring it more into line with a changing national
policy agenda. The 2007 Project Final Review shows that in Yogyakarta all 5 district
hospitals are swadana, and 3 of the 5 districts have at least 1 puskesmas swadana (all are
swadana in Slemen District), but overall the percentage is less than 40 percent. In
Lampung only 2 of 10 district hospitals are swadana, and only 3 districts have at least 1
puskesmas swadana.

Law 1/2004 supersedes the earlier MOHA decree and introduces the idea of Badan
Layanan Umum (BLU). A BLU is given considerably more autonomy regarding the way



12According to the original definition (MOHA decree 92/1993) "swadana" status means a unit has been granted
authority to retain revenues from its provision of services and to use them for operational expenses. Following
decentralization the term came to be used in a variety of ways expressing some idea of relative autonomy.




                                                            13

it can spend its revenues. The central government's policy is that all public service units
will eventually become BLU. Thus, while it may appear disappointing that more units did
not become "autonomous" in the swadana sense during the course of PHP I, the fact is
the 2004 law effectively meant it was often not worth districts investing in swadana when
a new definition of "autonomy" was being promoted by the central government. The
project component objective here needed to be adjusted to stay relevant, but the more
important point is that the central government has introduced policies which move in the
direction supported by the project, and in fact go further in this direction than the project
envisioned.

Performance on item (c) at the provincial and district/municipal levels, developing,
piloting and, if appropriate, implementing a health insurance system and/or managed care,
is rated satisfactory in Yogyakarta and moderately satisfactory in Lampung, although a
large part of the increase in health insurance coverage in both provinces is due to the
introduction of Askeskin, a new MOH health-scheme targeted at the poor.

According to Susenas 2006, health insurance total coverage was 42% in Yogyakarta and
22.6% in Lampung. The percentage may have increased in 2007 with the expansion of
the Askeskin program. This is almost certainly the case in Yogyakarta, which has
successfully introduced its own province-wide health insurance scheme, Jamkesos.
Yogyakarta believes they now have 60 percent total coverage. Jamkesos appears to be
developing well; the Bank's aide-memoires have suggested in fact that it may be
developing too quickly. Kota Metro in Lampung has fragmentary plans to introduce its
own health insurance system but has successively delayed implementation through lack
of funds.

Component A3. Improving Health Service Access and Quality (District and
Provincial). This component was only implemented during 2000 and 2001.

Performance on item (a) implementing specific health service activities, including the
refurbishing of health care facilities, upgrading medical equipment, increasing the
number of mobile health service facilities and contracting private health service providers
for the delivery of basic health services to designated areas, is rated moderately
unsatisfactory since relatively little was procured under this component during Phase 1
and no provider contracting took place. Performance on item (b) implementing quality
assurance programs and upgrading the quality of health sector personnel through the
implementation of fellowship programs, is rated moderately satisfactory since many
fellowships were awarded.

Note: D3: Academy level, S1: Bachelor level, S2: Masters level


Performance on item (c) establishing a health promotion board in Yogyakarta to
coordinate health public and private sector promotion activities, is moderately
satisfactory. The health promotion board was established and despite some shortcomings
performed well, but rather than continue to become an independent unit, the board
became an integral part of the Provincial Health Office. Performance on item (d)
providing specific drugs and supplies based on district/municipal proposals, is not rated
since relatively little was procured under this component during Phase 1.

Component A4. Grants (Districts). This component aimed at: "Financing (a) Eligible
Activities through the provision of MD and RM Grants and (b) Eligible Programs
through the provision of District Grants". The distinction between the two grants
disappeared during implementation as managing decentralization and resource
mobilization efforts became an integral part of the District Grant proposals.

Performance on the District Grants is rated satisfactory for Yogyakarta and moderately
satisfactory for Lampung. Four rounds of annual district grants supporting effective
decentralization of health at the district level were implemented. The process was
extremely difficult for many districts in the first and second years, but officials have
learned from experience and implementation was much smoother by the end of the
project. The Final Review document showed this improvement, and district-level officials
acknowledge how they have learned to plan and budget the district health system with the
support of the project. Province-level teams supporting the proposal writing and proposal
assessment process have also learned from working with project support. The main
problem with using the financing mechanism in Lampung is that some district heads
regard the mechanisms as a way to fund routine health services. Some districts have
embraced the idea of innovation more enthusiastically than others. The main problem
with implementation was the late disbursement of funds by the central government.

Component A5. Project Management (District and Provincial). This component
aimed at: "Establishing, at the provincial and district/municipal levels, a management and
administrative structure appropriate for the coordination and carrying out of health
service program and Project activities".

This component is rated satisfactory in Yogyakarta and moderately satisfactory in
Lampung. The management structures comprising Provincial Central Implementation
Units (PCIU) and District Implementation Units (DIU) were established and performed
well, despite specific shortcomings in some units.

 PDO Outcomes

In the case of Yogyakarta it appears that all five project components reached a
satisfactory level of performance in achieving their respective objectives. Health services
in Yogyakarta have been strengthened; resource mobilization capacities have been
enhanced; health service access and quality have been improved; successive rounds of
annual grants to districts were successfully implemented; and a viable management and
administrative structure at both province and district levels were established for the health
service program and project activities. Instances where component outcomes were rated
less than satisfactory do not appear to be so serious as to jeopardize effective health
decentralization in the province as a whole. The ICR team rates overall assessment of the
First PDO Outcomes in Yogyakarta as satisfactory.




                                                       16

Project components in Lampung were not so successful in achieving their respective
objectives. The ICR team rates overall assessment of the First PDO Outcomes in
Lampung as moderately satisfactory. However, one should note that it may have been too
much to expect the two very different provinces to meet the same targets. In fact
Lampung showed significant progress in terms of the quality of the district proposals and
activities during the life of the operation.

Second PDO/Central level: Help the central ministry (MOH) carry out its new role to
provide analysis of key issues, advocacy of best practices and standards, and support for
local initiatives and innovation.

Component B1. Managing Decentralization (Central). This component aimed at:
"Strengthening (a) the institutional capacity of MOH to provide support to provinces and
districts in fulfilling their health sector responsibilities allocated to them under the Law
on Regional Government, No. 22/1999 through conducting policy studies, sponsoring
national seminars and workshops, and strengthening its policy and technical analytical
capabilities and its health service advocacy and information dissemination services and
(b) national capacity to evaluate health policy interventions through the establishment of
an independent research unit".

Performance on item (a) is rated unsatisfactory. Seminars and workshops were
conducted, but no significant policy-related studies were completed under the project and
the project's impact on strengthening MOH's analytical and advocacy capabilities
appears negligible. Some specific proposals regarding the restructuring of the
organization of the central Ministry, intergovernmental fiscal transfers, decentralized
workforce policies and decentralized information systems were agreed during project
midterm review. MOH hardly used project resources to move those agenda forward and
little was achieved at project closing.

Performance on item (b) is similarly rated unsatisfactory. An independent research unit
was established but it was under funded and contributed little to expanded MOH's
capacity for evaluating policy interventions.

Component B2. Resource Mobilization (Central). This component aimed at:
Strengthening the institutional capacity of MOH to develop and administer a program for
the financing of specific health-related programs at the provincial and district/municipal
levels by providing Matching Grants.

This component is rated moderately unsatisfactory. There was good demand from
districts for the matching grants as indicated by the number of proposals received by the
CPCU after the availability of the grant was announced. Nevertheless, the idea to use the
grant as a tool for MOH to influence district spending for health was not institutionalized.
Although a MOH technical unit helped the CPCU in reviewing district proposal, day to
day management of the Matching Grants program was the task of the CPCU, an ad hoc
unit. Matching grants were no longer offered to the districts after the midterm review.




                                                17

Component B3. Project Management (Central). This component aimed at:
Strengthening the institutional capacity of MOH to carry out its management
responsibilities for the Project through the provision of technical assistance, training and
office equipment and supplies and the carrying out of workshops.

This component is rated moderately satisfactory. The CPCU did its best to carry out these
management functions on behalf of MOH, but it had few resources of its own to respond
to requests for technical assistance and had neither the authority or institutional leverage
to send MOH officials possessing the required skills who were not themselves members
of the CPCU.

 Overall Assessment of Second PDO Outcomes                         Moderately Unsatisfactory
Source: Data abstracted from Aide-memoires, ISRs, mid-term and final reviews, Susenas, and ICR interviews.


The ICR team rates overall assessment of the Second PDO Outcomes at the central level
as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The central level components did not achieve their
respective objectives and consequently the PDO outcomes were not achieved. This
appears to reflect lack of support for the project in the Ministry more than lack of effort
on the part of the CPCU. The project was designed as sector-wide, requiring cooperation
and coordination across MOH divisions, but the project's management structure could
not bring this about.

3.3 Efficiency

The PAD included a limited yet sound cost-benefit analysis Some of the efficiencies
discussed in that analysis have not been realized: in particular the merger of Kanwil and
Dinas did not result in much larger efficiency because there was no significant
downsizing of staff at the province level. Also, converting non-health staff to health staff
through training has presumably increased overall potential of the health system to
deliver quality services but this remains to be documented. PHP I may have contributed




                                                       18

to improved services at health centers but average number of staff per center has not
declined and the health centers are still overstaffed.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The ICR team rates overall outcome as moderately satisfactory (consistent with ISR
ratings). More specifically, the overall outcome rating for Yogyakarta is satisfactory, for
Lampung moderately satisfactory, and the overall outcome rating for the central level is
unsatisfactory. The justification for these ratings is as follows:

Project objectives and project design were largely appropriate to the challenges brought
upon by decentralization in health, but during implementation it became clear that the
design was too broad and ambitious, particularly for under resourced and low capacity
provinces like Lampung province. Project performance is much driven by the
performance of the provinces as project design and components gave more emphasis on
reform at the sub-national level, and the District Grants were by far the largest
component of PHP I.

The achievement of the first PDO in Yogyakarta is satisfactory as the province has
initiated key sector reforms and has made significant strides towards putting health
financing on a firm footing. The performance of Lampung Province is moderately
satisfactory. The province has discussed and planned a number of key sector reforms but
so far has implemented few, and likewise is still far from putting health financing on a
firm footing. However, the project does appear to have considerably enhanced overall
capacity of the sector, even if that has not resulted yet in a lot of institutional changes or
reform.

Achievement of the second PDO is Moderately Unsatisfactory. The MOH has begun to
perform new roles since decentralization but for the most part it has not chosen to do so
in the ways envisioned by the project. The analysis of key issues it provides the sector is
short on quantity and quality, its advocacy of best practices and standards is more rule-
oriented than results-oriented, and it is not proactive in supporting local innovations.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Many of the project activities in Yogyakarta and Lampung were seen by the project as
pro-poor, but it is difficult to assess their impact. According to Susenas data, utilization
of outpatient care in public facilities by the poor (the lowest income quintile) in Lampung
has increased from 37.86% in 2002 to 40.62% in 2006 and from 33.48% to 36.14% in
Yogyakarta for the same years. An increase for the same years was also observed for the
second lowest quintile, from 27.94% to 32.94% in Lampung, and from 30.58% to
36.37 % in Yogyakarta. The percentage may have increased further in 2007 because of
the expansion of the Askeskin program. The introduction of Askeskin in 2005 has
undoubtedly improved access for many poor people. It seems reasonable to conclude that
availability and accessibility of health services for the poor have to some extent been
protected.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
No further institutional change in addition to that discussed elsewhere in the ICR.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Based on what they have learned from and achieved with PHP I, both provinces have
indicated a follow-up project would be welcome. Attitudes at the central level towards a
follow-up project are currently colored somewhat by the experience of corruption being
uncovered at the MOH in the case of PHP II and the Bank's response to this.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No Beneficiary Survey conducted.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

ICR Rating: Substantial
The ICR team rates the risk to development outcomes achieved in Yogyakarta as
negligible to low. Yogyakarta's health system is robust and the benefits gained from PHP
I are well institutionalized. The system is forward-looking and well supported by the
province.

The ICR team rates the risk to development outcomes achieved in Lampung as
substantial. Lampung's health system is far less advanced than Yogyakarta's and the
benefits it has gained from PHP I are more in the nature of milestones reached towards
attainment of the project's objectives rather than achieving the objectives themselves (e.g.
regarding health insurance or HIS). With reduced funds from the central government
likely and the local budget very limited, there is significant risk these milestone benefits
will fade.

The risk to development outcomes at the central level is high since these outcomes were
themselves rated unsatisfactory; whatever benefits the center gained from the project are
diffuse.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
The ICR team rating for QEA is Moderately Satisfactory. Project objectives were very
relevant and project design was an appropriate response to the challenges confronted at
the time by a rapidly changing health sector. However, project scope was very ambitious
and took on too broad a range of reform activities given the turmoil introduced by
decentralization. Monitoring and evaluation was weak resulting in difficulties in
conducting routine monitoring of project performance.




                                             20

(b) Quality of Supervision
The ICR team rates quality of supervision as Moderately Satisfactory. The archived ISR
and aide-memoires show that the Bank monitored the project's progress carefully,
discussed problems with the implementing agency and other stakeholders, and made
constructive suggestions when necessary.13 Bank staff assumed a heavy workload for the
project (and other PHP projects) when they undertook to review all district grant
proposals (at least for the early years of this granting process) and their supervision
contributed to the success of this component. Government officials interviewed in the
two provinces by the ICR team were appreciative of the expertise and support the Bank
provided and welcome interactions with the Bank; in fact they made it clear the provinces
would like more contact with the Bank in the future if possible.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Overall Bank performance rating Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Moderately Unsatisfactory. The enabling environment provided by the central
government had significant shortcomings for project implementation from the point of
view of lateness in disbursement of funds, confusion over precise allocation of authorities
among government levels, and inadequate response to shortcomings at the MOH.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Moderately Satisfactory. There were significant shortcomings at the MOH: (i) the
Ministry has not reorganize or downsized in a way consistent with its new functions
under decentralization; and (ii) despite the best efforts of those on the CPCU the MOH
has not been able to provide much constructive support or technical guidance to the
provinces and districts. Officials in the provinces expressed considerable frustration with
the MOH to the ICR team. On the other hand, performance of the provinces and districts
were Satisfactory for Yogyakarta and Moderately Satisfactory for Lampung. Yogyakarta
particularly was not much influenced by the absence of the center, and many of its reform
ideas were an inspiration to the other provinces, even those beyond Lampung.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
The ICR rates Borrower Performance as Moderately Satisfactory. This rating reflects the
Moderately Satisfactory rating of the two provinces combined, and the fact that the
project put much larger weight on investment and interventions in the province and
district components.

6. Lessons Learned

A number of lessons can be drawn from this assessment of PHP I experience. Positive
institutional change is a valuable public good and needs to be promoted as such. The big
success of PHP I is in Yogyakarta. Although the project's first development objective
(PDO) is vaguely worded there is broad consensus that the changes brought about in the
health in Yogyakarta sector since 2001 do add up to an unambiguous case of "effective
health decentralization." Yogyakarta started off at the beginning of PHP I as a relatively
well resourced province and it enjoys a unique status within Indonesia. Local officials at
both the province and district level argue that support from the project did in fact make a
big difference. The gains are not for the people of Yogyakarta alone. Officials from
around the country come to Yogyakarta to study the Yogyakarta model and learn
practical lessons from Yogyakarta's experience.

The success of Yogyakarta illustrates the indispensable role of sound technical advice.
The city of Yogyakarta is home to one of the country's preeminent universities. Experts
from Gadjah Mada University have a long history of working closely with the provincial
government. The PHP I design relied heavily on technical inputs and expert advice on the
Technical Review Teams, Task Forces, and in some cases on Joint Health Councils; and
consultants were needed to undertake special studies and operational research. Lampung
lacks such expertise locally and had to import it from elsewhere, mostly from Yogyakarta,
but in their experience this was often not fully effective. Special attention needs to be
given to making technical inputs more effective for less-developed provinces like
Lampung. There is a need over the longer term to develop the capabilities of local
consultants. Projects dealing with decentralization should pay special attention to the
quality and quantity of the TA available for the local governments. The same point can be
made more generally, not just with regard to technical inputs. Projects designed to bring
about more effective health decentralization in provinces need to include special
interventions to make sure the inequalities across regions are addressed.

The central government has limited capacity for decentralization and has not adequately
adjusted its structure and functions to respond to the needs. In the early days of
decentralization in Indonesia expert and policymakers focused on the limited capacity of
districts and provinces to assume their new responsibilities. That the central government
needed to scale back on its implementation activities and assume new leadership roles
was assumed to be a relatively easy transition. But in time the inability of the MOH to
restructure and change its mind-set have emerged as major obstacles to effective
decentralization of the health system. Future projects need to address or adapt to the weak
leadership from the central level.

In turbulent times projects need a flexible decision-making and management structure.
PHP I was designed to respond to the government's decentralization laws of 1999 and to
implement reforms within the framework of that legislation. While the project design
was quite flexible and built in annual reviews of the district block grants and operational
manual that could be changed as the project advanced, the flexibility was not always used.
This is in part due to the momentum and time it takes to get some activities underway as



                                             22

well as the rigid government system and budget. Moreover, the flexibility was great for
the stronger province but provinces with weaker capacity can benefit from more focused
approach.

As stated in the Guidelines for the PAD, Project Development Objectives should focus on
the outcome for which the project can be held accountable given the project's duration,
resources and approach. Performance indicators (PI) need to be selected more
thoughtfully, defined more precisely, and measured much more carefully. If performance
indicators with targets must be set, maybe such targets could be conditional given the
uncertainty surrounding current changes in governance. Moreover, both GOI and Bank
could have tried to formally revise the indicators during the life of the operation.

While the Project gave excellent insights on institutional changes and why those should
happen, in many areas it was less specific on the how. While that is part of the flexibility
of the design, in many areas the provinces and districts needed some more guidance and
lessons from other provinces and countries to learn how best to proceed.

Projects aimed at reforming institutions need to be grounded in a realistic understanding
of how, when and why institutions change, and how they can be expected to change in
the specific political and cultural contexts in which the projects operate. The PHP I PAD
was rich in insights about the kind of changes in institutional arrangements needed to
bring about effective decentralization of the health sector, and about how to sustain
reformed institutions with new financial arrangements. It was not so rich in insights
regarding how one goes about designing the reformed institutions in any detail (what are
the principles of institutional design which should be employed?), or about how one gets
rid of the old ways of doing things and replaces them with the new (how do you
overcome vested interests in the old order and align incentive structures with the new?).
Simply proposing new and better ways of doing things is never enough; change
invariably means some gain more than others. Governance in Indonesia is a hybrid of
patrimonial and legal-rational structures and processes. The implications of this, needs to
be thought through more carefully in future during project preparation.

More lessons could undoubtedly be drawn by undertaking a comparative study of all
decentralization experience including those supported by donors like the World Bank and
ADB. Such a study could focus on the different ways provinces have established the
province-district relationship, the relative costs and benefits of each, and the variety of
ways districts and provinces have developed to exercise autonomy in the health sector
despite continuing lack of clarity in the policy environment and their dependency on
central government funding.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies

The following is the summary of comments received from MOH. Many of these
comments are consistent with findings of the ICR team:

-   The start of project implementation coincided with the launch of decentralization
    giving large autonomy to the district level. This made collaboration between the
    province and the districts difficult because the districts disregarded the role of the
    province although in reality many districts had weak capacity.

-   PHP I proposed innovative ways to change the health system, but a five year project
    is too short for large system changes envisioned by the project.

-   The timeline for achieving performance indicators was too short given the long time
    required to carry on systems reform. Some of the indicators, particularly those related
    with personnel policies, were contradictory to existing laws.

-   The length of the preparation phase (Phase I) was too short to produce meaningful
    outputs for adoption by the districts, and therefore the work of the task forces had to
    continue to Phase II.

-   Implementation of the District Grants is considered as an innovative way to build
    capacity of the districts in planning and budgeting.

-   The role of the JHC was only limited to approval of district proposal rather than the
    expected larger role of developing province level health policies. Limited
    involvement of the Bupatis (Head of the District) in JHC assemblies was seen as the
    main reason for ineffectiveness of the JHC.

-   The TRT is considered successful in improving the capacity of districts/cities in
    developing annual proposals.

-   The weak capacity of Lampung compared to that of Yogyakarta was mainly because
    some districts in Lampung were new districts with less qualified human resources and
    the lack of technical assistance from a locally based University.

-   The provinces and districts benefited from PHP I because the project gave the
    opportunity to conduct health reform trials, and pilots that usually could not be
    financed by government own budget.

-   Contradiction between the Bank's procurement guidelines and the Government's
    Keppres 18 was the source of confusion to the implementing units, although the use
    of procurement plans was considered as a useful tool for monitoring procurement
    activities. Moreover, procurement activities were often delayed because of delays in
    developing procurement plans, changes among procurement committee members and



                                             24

    their insufficient knowledge of Bank procurement guidelines, weak capacity in TOR
    development, and lengthy process in obtaining Bank no objection letter.

-   World Bank requirements sometimes caused delays in execution of procurement, for
    example the requirement to conduct a feasibility study prior to construction of a new
    facility, or requirement to reach consensus on performance indicators prior to buying
    computers for developing the health information system.

-   Project Management Reports (PMR) is a useful tool for project monitoring. On the
    other hand, multiple audit activities were considered too many and time consuming.
    Moreover, the auditors do not always have the same perception when interpreting
    Bank regulations.

-   Disbursement of project funds was very much influenced by procedures and
    regulations from MOF that often resulted in delays in budget release.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A. Comments on Draft ICR

Despite unsatisfactory rating for the central level, there was positive
performance/outcome of the central level as follows:

1. Well perfoming PDK (Pendamping Desentralisasi Kesehatan) from the
   Decentralization Unit in assisting the regions in collaboration with the TRT so that
   districts were able to develop better/logical district proposals

2. MOH and University of Indonesia has conducted training on Integrated Health
   Planning and Budgeting and therefore districts were able to develop better health
   proposal compared to proposals from the first and second years of the project

3. MOH and University of Indonesia has conducted training on District Health Account
   so that districts were able to develop accurate DHA and health expenditures. This was
   used by the regions as an advocacy tool to negotiate budget allocation with district
   executive and legislative

4. Center of Health Data, MOH (Pusdatin) has conducted training of geographical
   Information System (GIS) to develop skills in preparing graphs and charts to make
   reports more communicative to the readers

B. Summary of Borrower's ICR

I. General

1. Provincial Health Project I (PHP I) is a project that has a strong relationship with
   decentralization. PHP I was launched at the same time with the enactment of Law
   22/1999 regarding "local government". PHP I started at August 2000 and finished at
   30 June 2006. However PHP I was extended until 31 December 2007. PHP I is
   implemented at: Provinces Lampung and Yogyakarta, and Central. Generally
   activities implemented in PHP I are "Health Sector Reform" activities in all aspects.

   In following up changes due to the emerging of the new laws, a lot of preparations
   should be done, among others: institutions, human resource and other resources, and
   supporting regulations. Usually the above changes are beyond the capacity of the
   Ministry of Health. This means that we should prepare to overcome potential
   problems that may appear.

2. At the beginning of the implementation of decentralization, districts and cities felt
   free from the province, however the are not ready to receive the responsibilities, so
   that the provinces are difficult to coordinate, and even difficult to conduct supervision
   for providing guidance. In reality human resource in the districts/ cities were still
   weak and require "capacity building" by the province and central.




                                             35

3. Data and information were extremely required by the districts/cities for developing
    health planning and proposals, however reporting system does not work as the
    expectations of the Ministry of Health. Ministry of Health and the World Bank
    overcome this problem by developing District/City Health Indicators based on the
    "Healthy Indonesia 2010" indicators, which was further used to develop proposals and
    monitor Districts/Cities.


II. Project Design

1. PHP I is a project developed to change a health system, from a centralistic character
    to a decentralistic one. For this change, innovative activities were required in relation
    with capacity building, planning and health expenditure, improving accessibility and
    quality of health service delivery, etc. This change needs to be supported by a
    consistent central policy, which do not often change, including the human resources
    (tour of duty, tour of area, etc.).
2. A five-year period is too short to realize this relatively big system change. We
    consider the Performance Indicators as too ambitious and difficult to be achieved.
    Proxy-indicators would be better. Besides that, several indicators related to human
    resource were impossible to be achieved by the region because it was related to
    "human resource law" as an umbrella law for civil servants.

3. PHP I consists of two phases, Preparation phase and Operational phase. Preparation
    phase is considered necessary. The 17 months period (August 2000 ­ December
    2001) of preparation phase was considered not enough to yield outputs as planned. In
    the PAD, at the Preparation phase, Task Forces should come up with outputs as
    planned. However the outputs are developed at the Operational phase,
    simultaneously with the implementation.

4. PHP I started at 1 August 2000 and closing date at 30 June 2006. The extension
    request from the Ministry of Health was approved by Bappenas and the Ministry of
    Finance, the World Bank agree to extend PHP I for 1½ year (1 July 2006 ­ 31
    December 2007). It means closing date of PHP I was 31 December 2007. The
    extension of PHP I is very useful for Lampung Province, because within the
    extension period, many nurses and midwives have been trained for topics such as:
    APN (Normal Delivery Care), PONED (Basic Emergency Obstetric and Neonatology
    Care), PONEK (Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Neonatology Care),
    Management of Asphyxia, etc. We are sure that these trainings are very useful for
    improving quality of health service and later, will be followed by the reduction of
    IMR/MMR. The same goes for Yogyakarta Province, it has successfully
    implementing Social and Health Security (Jamkessos), Regulation, Integrated Health
    Information System Development, all of these are very useful.

5. Implementation of District Grant (DG) is an innovative capacity building in the
    "comprehensive health planning and budgeting". Districts and cities develop Plans of
    Action tailored to their needs in the form of proposals, complete with budget and its



                                              36

    source. Districts and cities develop a Master Plan (a five-year period plan) and a one-
    year plan based on their Master Plan. This proves to enhance personnel's ability to
    develop a comprehensive health plan for their districts / cities.

6. The objective of establishing Joint Health Council (JHC) at the province is for
    dealing with health issues and development of health policies in the region. We
    assume that JHC's members who are consisted of Bupati/Major, Professional
    organization, NGOs, cannot function well as it is hoped. JHC only provides proposal
    approval submitted by the District/Cities.

7. The objective of establishing Technical Review Team (TRT) at the province level is
    for assisting District/Cities in proposal development and reviewing it. TRT is
    considered successful in conducting its role, even though at the beginning there are
    rejections from the Districts/Cities with various reasons such as: inability to keep
    company, guidance for proposal development was not clear. However as time goes on,
    the role of TRT was well-accepted by the Districts/Cities. There was a significant
    capacity improvement of district's planners.

III. Project Components.

There are five components at provincial and three at central level. Those components are
important to support health sector reform which was really required in the
decentralization era (Organization, planning, health information, health financing,
regulation, public accountability reforms, etc.).

One among the components at central level is Matching Grant (MG), which many
districts interested. However since the procedure and mechanism are complicated and
lengthy, MG activity was discontinued. MG was only implemented for a period of two
years. As an example the timing of proposal approval and implementation was not
synchron due to delay of budget, delay of contract with the regions receiving MG.


IV. Output of Project Component

a. Output at Province / District / City
    Decentralization is executed based on Law 22 / 1999, which was then revised to Law
    32 / 2004. For the implementer, Decentralization is a new issue. This is even more if
    it is linked to Health Sector Reform.

    -    Yogyakarta province has better quality of human resources as compared to
         Lampung. Yogyakarta has the Gajahmada University with its professionals
         qualified in the aspect of decentralization. They assist Provincial/district/city
         health offices in the development of decentralization concepts. Yogyakarta has,
         therefore, outstanding Task Force performance/outputs.




                                              37

   -   Lampung province: The addition of new districts during the decentralization period
       has a great impact on the overall quality of human resources. At Lampung, there
       are no Universities, with qualified experts in health decentralization which could
       assist, insufficient coordination within the Dinkes, the merger of Kanwil and Dinkes,
       followed with the addition of new districts and less-qualified human resources, all
       influenced the process of project implementation. As a consequence health sector
       reforms in Lampung are less, as compared to Yogyakarta Province.

   -   The benefit of regions implementing PHP I among others: Province and Districts
       could develop innovative activities such as: trials/piloting/model until
       implementation which could not be financed from APBD or APBN. Innovative
       activities are very important in supporting motivation and capacity of human
       resource at the regions.

   -   Besides developing comprehensive district planning, the regional personnel can
       also develop reports and monitoring of District indicators, including data analysis,
       various data presentation from the simple one to GIS (Geographic Information
       System). The important thing is: region understand the benefit of data and
       information as a tool for advocating the local government and the legislative body.

b. Output at Central level

  Organization change from "Ministry of Health and Social Welfare" to "Ministry of
   Health" brought forth mutation of personnel several times, interfering Task Force's
   performance. Central's prominent output is the development of the "Minimal
   Services Standard" which during the project has been revised twice. The conduction
   of the Family Doctor trial was used by Yogyakarta as reference, for the development
   of Jamkessos (Social and Health Security)
       .
c. Project Sustainability and Key Lessons Learned

   -   To increase involvement and sense of belonging of the local government (To gain
       budget allocation) as well as the central MOH, PHP I collaborating with "Center
       for Management of Health Service" (PMPK), Gajahmada University, organized a
       seminar, two months prior the finish of PHP I, discussing activities considered as
       "Best Practices".

   -   There should be a continuous advocative approach toward the local government
       including the local parliament in order to assure political commitment, so that
       implementation budget will be there.

   -   After the project ends, to maintain technical competence of the districts and
       provinces, Ministry of Health must continue to provide technical assistance.

V. Project Management

The establishment of Project Secretariat at the Central level, Province and all
Districts/Cities was very helpful in the smoothness of project implementation:

1. In facilitating all project activities conducted by Technical Unit / Task Force at the
   Ministry of Health, Provincial/District/City Health Offices.

2. In conducting project administration according to "loan agreement" such as: planning,
   procurement of goods/consultant, finance and monitoring project. Good coordination
   and cooperation in the project secretariat is very helpful in the smoothness of the
   project.

3. In managing inter-sectoral financing administration such as with the Ministry of
   Finance for replenishment and reimbursement of the budget.

VI. Comments on the World Bank

a. Procurement

1. Several rules in the "Procurement Guideline" are contradictory with the Presidential
   Decree (Keppres) causing confusement during the implementation, to the
   implementers as well as the auditor themselves.

2. The project is obliged to develop a "Procurement Plan" yearly, which must be
   approved by the Bank. The plan contains district's need. The Procurement Plan is
   very useful as assessment tool for yearly needs and for the monitoring the
   procurement activities.

3. Yearly procurement activities are always late/out of schedule, due to:
   -   Procurement plan developments are behind schedule.
   -   Procurement Committee members change every year.
   -   Insufficient knowledge of the Committee regarding the Bank's rules.
   -   Development of TOR by the Technical Unit is also behind schedule.
   -   The time needed by the Bank to issue the NOL.

4. Procurement of Computers to support the Health Information System is far too late in
   procurement. Procurement was just implemented in 2007. This is because
   procurement may be done only after the performance indicators are approved by
   central.

5. Civil Works. Construction for the expansion of Public Hospital at Central Lampung
   district, which was planned in 2002, was only conducted in 2006. This was because
   the Bank demanded a feasibility study to be done first, and approval from Directorate
   General of Medical Care and Directorate General of Community Health.




                                              39

b. Project Management Report (PMR)

   This is a comprehensive report, accommodating all project activities, including
   procurement, plan of the budget needed, current and cumulative financial status since
  the start of the project. It is a useful report. Information/ data are correct and accurate.
  However districts and provinces must continuously be guided and supported in this
  report making.

c. Audit

   1. In line with the Loan Agreement, the project audit consists of:
       -   General Audit by BPKP, conducted each year: March ­ June,
       -   Ex Post Review, each year conducted by different auditors, appointed by the
           Bank: April ­ June,
       -   Interim Audit, for district / cities twice yearly March and October.
       -   Technical Audit, the Loan Agreement mention as twice yearly. The project
           considers once a year to be sufficient: September ­ November.

  2. The different audits, going through the same documents, executed at nearly the
       same time / period, make it difficult for the implementers.

  3. Very often they have different perception regarding the Bank's regulation. The
       guideline, a reference for the implementation of the project needs to be clear, free
       from possible mis/multiple perceptions by every component, especially the
       auditors.

d. Performance Indicator

   1. Time target set in the Performance Indicator is too short, since changing the
       system (which is the goal of the project) cannot be achieved in such a short time.
       There should have been a preparation time for the regions, especially the
       manpower. Implementation time needs to be longer.

  2. Other indicators not able to be fulfilled by the regions are those contradictory with
       the existing Law. For example: reducing number of personnel, early retirement,
       recruitment, etc.

e. Closing date

   We suggest that the closing date of the next projects will not be at 31 December, but
   30 June. The reason of this suggestion is because of: the project faces difficulties in
   conducting activities between closing date and closing account. The activities are
   among others: to finish up the administration: replenishment, reimbursement, writing
   final project report, follow up of audit/investigation report. These activities require
   certain budget. The budget is liquefied after DIPA issuance, and very often DIPA
   issuance is late.

VII. Comments on the Ministry of Finance

Loan disbursement is very much depended upon budget withdrawal. In reality
implementation is very often behind the schedule. This is due to:

1. Project implementation was behind schedule, due to error of DIPA software (mistake
   was at the budget proportion of GOI). Software revision is required and this takes
   time.

2. The different perception with the KPKN / KPPN managers in Lampung and
   Yogyakarta in translating the Circular Letter from Directorate General of Budget
   regarding the implementation of District Grant, caused a delay in money withdrawal
   for Districts / Cities.

3. Transition of the new rule of "Unified Budget" system needs time.

4. The establishment of "travel efficiency budget" policy in the amount of 70 % on
   August 2007. At the beginning it also applied for "Foreign Loan and Grant" (PHLN).
   The budget efficiency policy was repealed at the early November 2007, and the
   dispensation to use the money was approved at the late November 2007.


VIII. Comments on the Ministry of Health.

1. There was no matching budget available at the beginning of the project.

2. The changes of project management line (which in the beginning under Secretariat
   General) were moved to "main unit" (Directorate General of Community Health). This
   influenced budgeting mechanism (Changes of Working Unit/SATKER), and required
   a long time to settle.

3. Revision process must wait the Regional and Central DIPA compilation. It could not
   be processed separately.

4. Difficulties in recruiting "Working Unit Staff" and members for the Procurement
   Committee.

5. Project results, especially best practices, need to be well documented and
   disseminated so that other provinces can learn.

6. For the 7 years (84 months) working plan, in reality only implemented 54 months
   (64 %).

IX. Conclusion.

1. Decentralization in the autonomy era is not only delegation of authority or financial
   distribution between central and region. Further more, how decentralization could
   improve services to the community. As a consequence many things should be
   anticipated, especially technical provider in the field.

2. In reality, the human resource in the provinces and districts are not yet prepared to
   implement the programs decentralized by the MOH, so that capacity building is
   required to achieve the development objectives of PHP I.

3. Managerial skill and good communication are very important to manage a project.

4. Project Extension (1 July 2006 ­ 31 December 2007), is very beneficial for the PHP I
   to achieve the objectives of activities, in Lampung Province and Yogyakarta

5. To obtain local government support after the project closing, political commitment is
   required through continuous policy dialogue.

6. After the project closes, the local governments are still required to further expand the
   technical support from MOH.
