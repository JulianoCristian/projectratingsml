development impacts were modest. Performances by both the\n            Bank, and Borrower are also rated unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            mainly address the choice of the lending instrument -\n            technical assistance - arguing a technical assistance (TA)\n            project provides little support, if a Structural Adjustment\n            program has not been clearly defined, and neither is there a\n            strong government ownership. Moreover, in a country with low\n            institutional capacity, a TA project should be small, and\n            directed to fewer activities. This also reinforces that\n            cross-institutional participation, and collaboration should\n            be avoided if the political economy of the country receiving\n            TA, precludes effective cooperation. Thus, the Bank needs to\n            provide more on the ground support for TA projects in\n            low-income countries."}, "docdt": "2004-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
