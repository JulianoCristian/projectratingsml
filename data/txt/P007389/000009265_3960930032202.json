Fund Project are to:  (i) mitigate the social costs of\n            adjustment and allow economic reform measures to be put into\n            place rapidly with the necessary support of the population;\n            (ii) lay the basis for a decentralized program of direct\n            support for the poor and malnourished to buy food; and (iii)\n            support the improvement of service delivery in the social\n            ministeries.  The project will have four components:  (i)\n            the financing of the Honduran Social Investment Fund (FHIS);\n            (ii) support to a pilot targeted nutrition assistance\n            program; (iii) technical assistance to help design a program\n            to improve the efficiency and equity of the services of the\n            Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education; and (iv)\n            the setting up of a monitoring and evaluation system of the\n            government's social policy interventions through the\n            use of a Living Standards Measurement Study."}, "docdt": "1991-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
