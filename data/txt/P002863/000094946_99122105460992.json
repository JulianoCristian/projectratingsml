While the Bank's performance is rated\n            satisfactory, the performance of the borrower showed mixed\n            results, for, contrary to its commitments, the borrower\n            continued to interfere with the management of CEET. The\n            lessons convey, first and foremost, that expected tools,\n            namely the performance contract, envisaged during\n            preparation to strengthen institutional performance, was not\n            a sufficient tool, nor in reducing Government interference.\n            However, the agreement reached later with the Government for\n            CEET's privatization, which was not an option\n            initially, turned the project into a successful operation,\n            accepted and supported by the Government and staff at large.\n            The economic and political environment, did affect\n            CEET's performance, thus, it is suggested that projects\n            should be undertaken under sound macroeconomic frameworks,\n            to minimize political risks. Furthermore, a comprehensive\n            Mid-term Review can help identify problems, and take\n            corrective actions towards the achievement of project objectives."}, "docdt": "1999-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
