MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A, POWER REHABILITATION AND EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit of SDR
11.4 million to the Republic of Togo is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity, and
would help finance improvements and investment requirements of the power
system and strengthening of Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo (CEET).
The project would be cofinanced by CCCE.
2.        Background.  Public electricity supply in Togo is the
responsibility of CENT. CEET operates generation, transmission and
distribution facilities at 10 centers throughout the country. Its major
market is in the southern maritime region, particularly Lome, where about
36000 customers are served. The energy distributed by CEET in the southern
maritime region is bought from the Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB),
the TogolBenin joint power generation and transmissioa company (see below).
Besides its distribution facilities, CEET has a diesel plant in downtown
Lome consisting of 2 x 8 MW engines. In addition, in April 1984, GOT
transferred to CENT the operational responsibility for the Centrale
Thermique de Lom4 (CTL) which consists of 2 s 25 MV gas turbines and 4 x 10
MW diesels. At the present time, these thermal units are used only in the
event of interruption of the normal supply from CEB; however, in the future
CTL could become a valuable source of generation for the CEB interconnected
system supplying both Togo and Bdnin. Inland, CEET's effective plant
capacity totals about 20 MW, composed of isolated diesel units. The inland
market serves about 7000 domestic customers, whose consumption accounts for
less than 1OZ of thta total Togo consumption. CEET's headquarters are
located in Lomn. Total staff is about 1,000, including 28 management
personnel and 3 expatriate advisers. Although overall financial
performance has been satisfactory over the past few years, significant
improvements could be achieved particularly in system operations and
consumer administration.
3.        In 1968, the States of Togo and Benin concluded a Treaty
establishing the CEB. It has been operational since 1971 and its role has
been largely that of wholesale supplier of electricity, purchased from the
Volta River Authority (VRA) in Ghana, for sale to the national power
utilities of Bnin and Togo which, in turn, distribute it to retail
consumers. CEB's facilities consist essentially of a 161 kV transmission
line running from Ghana's Akosombo plant to Cotonou, and since late 1987,
the Nangbeto hydroelectric plant (60 NW, 150 GWh) whichi was partly financed
by IDA. Nangbeto is the first of two, possibly three, sites which could be
developed to harness the hydroelectrical potential of the Mono River.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in the
power sector in Togo and Benin dates back to 1978 when IDA acted as
executing agent for a UNDP-financed power development study. This study
identified the Nangbeto Project as the least-cost source of power supply to
be implemented as a regional project by both Togo and Benin and to be owned
by CEB, with the Bank acting as Chef de file for donors' coordinatxn. The



-2-
objectives of the project were to stabilize the cost of electricity supply
to BUnin and Togo, while, at the same time, strengthening the sector
institutions, in particular CEB., This has been largely achieved.
Strengthening of CEB, however, needs to go hand-in-hand with the
development of the national utilities as equal partners because these
latter are CEB's main source of income. Continued involvement of the Bank
at the national level would also provide the means to reinforce the SAL
process underway in Togo with its emphasis on efficient public investment,
parastatal reform and financial stabilization. Finally, further Bank
support for the power sectors of Togo and Benin is a key element in the
strategy of promoting regional cooperation of the electric utilities in
West Africa.
5.        Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project is a logical follow-up
of the Bank's past involvement in the sector. Under the Engineering &
Technical Assistance (1189-BEN/1190-TO) and Iangbeto (1507-BEN11508-TO)
Projects, preliminary studies of the Lome distribution system and CUET's
organization were undertaken which indicated the pressing need to
strengthen CEET and to physically rehabilitate and extend Lome's
distribution system. These needs were subsequently confirmed by Bank
missions that supervised the Nangbeto Project as well as by the Bank/UNDP
Ee-rgy Assessment Report that was issued in June 1985.  The main purposes
eO the proposed project are thus to strengthen all facets of CEET's
management and operations through internal reorganization, technical
assistance and training programs; to improve the external environment for
CEET so that it operates as an autonomous entity without undue government
interference; to rehabilitate and expand CEET's plant, particularly the
existing distribution system in the Lome area so as to improve reliability,
reduce losses and generate additional sales; to maintain CEET's financial
viability enabling it to generate sufficient internal resources to meet at
least the local costs of its investment program and thereby strengthen
financially CEB as vell; and to further promote regional cooperation.
6.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project would consist of the
detailed engineering (now essentially completed), followed by the actual
rehabilitation and extension of the Lomh distribution system, including the
hardware required, such as poles, cables, transformers, meters and the
like, completion of the CTL rehabilitation, and the implementation, with
appropriate technical assistance and training, of the institutional
strengthening program for CEET, as identified following a diagnostic study
completed in August 1989. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$38.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$33.5
million (87Z). The breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement ochedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the
Republic of Togo are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
7.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached ons
(a) the fair valuation and the transfer to CEET of the diesel component of
the CTL plant; (b) annual consultation on CEET's investment plan; (c)
performance incentives to be given to CEET, to be reflected in an agreed
performance contract; (d) revision of CEET's statutes; (e) audit of CEET's
accounts; (f) audit of the Spec'ial Account and the SOE's, and submission of



-3-
a PCRi (g) GOT's plan to reduce the level of arrears in public sector
receivables, adoption of annual budgets of government departments and
public entities to include sufficient provision to cover their electricity
consumption, and payment of future 1ills within three months of
presentation; (h) private customers to pay their bills to CENT within three
months; (i) minimum rates of return for CENT of 3.5S in 90, 42 in 91 and
92, and 6Z thereafter; and (j) a debt limitation covenant of at least 1.5.
Conditions of Credit effectiveness would bes (a) finalization of the
onlending agreement between GOT and CENT; (b) effectiveLess of CCCE Loan;
and (c) submission of a satisfactory environmental impact assessment.
8.        Benefits.  The project would help streamline CEET's
institutional set-ap as well an restore and strengthen CENT's distribution
capability. The expected benefits would include a more reliable
distribution system providing an improved infrastructure for industrial
development, a larger access to power by the country's population and
improved operational efficiency of CEET.
9.        Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the proposed
project. The main risk would be CEET's failure to restructure; however,
experience with parastatal reform in Togo is good, therefore the risk is
considered minimal.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
