for the Private Sector\n            Development Project for Benin are as follows: outcome was\n            unsatisfactory, risk to the development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also rated\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            sustained government commitment is key to successful reform.\n            The privatization of the telecommunications company and the\n            institutional transformation of Credit Institution for\n            Micro-enterprises, (Association pour la promotion et\n            l'appui au d\u00e9veloppement des micro-entreprises) (PADME)\n            and Credit institution for Small and Medium Enterprises,\n            (Agence pour la promotion et l'appui aux petites et\n            moyennes entreprises) (PAPME), two major project activities,\n            have been delayed partly due to insufficient Government\n            commitment. The privatization unit was not independent and\n            adequately staffed. The commitment to privatize Benin\n            Telecom in a transparent way and using the World Bank\n            resources materialized only in 2005 with the new Government.\n            2) Stable policy environment is critical to ensure\n            sustainability of nascent and still fragile institutions\n            such as PADME and PAPME. 3) Experience has demonstrated that\n            institution-building takes time, and that the support should\n            be sustained to ensure their success. 4) The key performance\n            indicators that were defined appeared to be excessive in\n            number and in many cases called for data that was not\n            readily available without beneficiary surveys being conducted."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
