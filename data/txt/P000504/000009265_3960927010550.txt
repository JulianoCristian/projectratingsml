HEHORANDUH AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDERi
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR AN EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Development Credit
to the Republic of Chad for SDR 16.2 million (US$22.0 million equivalent) is submitted
for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years
maturity and would help finance the rehabilitation of primar" education and of the
education sector's institutions.
f    2.        Back2round.  Despite the destruction and disruption brought about by the
war, including interruption of Government support, local community and donor
initiatives have allowed Chad to maintain minimal educational activities, in both
Government and community-built and managed "spcztaneous" schools (about 1,320 and 480
schools, respectively, of which 13S are for girls). In 1987, the gross primary
enrollment ratio was a low 45% (about 28% of the enrollment is girls), but demand
remains high, with enrollments having grown by 7% per annum over the past three years.
The sector is severely underfinanced: it is allocated about 11, but actually receives
only about 7% (1987) of Government's total recurrent budget which has been affected by
the decline in. cotton prices; of this, salaries absorb about 96%, leaving only 4% for
pedagogic inputs and materials; even then teachers, as most civil servants, are paid
at only 60% of their 1967 salary base, and with lengthy delays. To partially
compensate for this, the local communities (mostly in the form of Parents'
Associations, or APEs) have been financing all primary school construction and
maintenance on a self.,help basis, and have been recruiting and paying some 2,500 so-
called "supplementary" teachers (45% of the teaching corps); this represents a
contribution in cash and in kind equivalent to about 25% of public expenditures for
education in 1987. The APEs are a driving force in the sector, but sustaining their
effort will require financial and technical support, and the somewhat anarchic nature
of their development raises questions of quality. There is a potential for structural
distortion, but this has been limited by fiscal constraints, which have prevented
growth beyond primary education. The Government's most urgent priorities are
rehabilitation of primary education and the formulation of a global, long-term human
resource development strategy.
3.        Three readily identifiable issues should be addressed urgently.  The first
concerns the sector's underfinancing and the need to ensure the sustainability and
increase the productivity of investments made by the communities. The second is the
poor learning environment in primary education, which results in low internal
efficiency and quality (it takes 16 pupil-years of instruction, versus a theoretical
six, to produce a primary education graduate). This is due to extreme resource
constraints (both public and private), which have led to (a) a dilapidated physical
er.vironment, in which about 40% of the schools require replacement and 60%
rehabilitation, school furniture is lacking, and the average student/teacher ratio is
60/1; (b) a dearth of textbooks and classroom supplies (1 set per 9 students); (c)
large scale reliance on 2,500 'supplementary" teachers, only 200 of whom have
completed lower secondary education, and none of whom have received professional
training or professional incentives; and (d) insufficient teacher supervision and
support by the inspectorates. The third issue is the Ministry of Education's (MEN)
weak capacity to plan and manage the sector's financial, human and physical resources.
4.        Rationale for IDA involvement.  Given the low level of human resource
development in Chad, education is a high priority, and the proposed project would be



2
part of a concerted effort (AfDB, EDF, FAC, NG0s) to restore acceptable operating
conditions in the sector. It would complement and implement at the sectoral level
elements of the adjustment program to be undertaken under IDA's Financial
Rehabilitation Credit (FRC), while creating the basis for long-term sustainable
growth. IDA's ivolvement has resulted in the initi,l definition of a policy and
institutional framework which should accelerate rehabilitation and lay a solid
foundation for balanced development. The approach developed with the Chadian
authorities is realistic and has already served as a vehicle for aid coordination,
especially with France, the major bilateral donor. Finally, the project is providing
a model on which a series of repeater projects could be based, possibly financed by
other donors, to further the process of physical and institutional rehabilitation
while an IDA-financed, policy-based sector operation is envisaged for FY92.
5.        Proiect oblectives.  The project is designed to initiate a long-term process
of rehabilitation of the education sector. It would assist the Government to (a)
adopt appropriate policies; (b) rehabilitate primary education by restoring to minimal
acceptable standards the physical schooling environment in two zones (four regions)
and learning conditions countrywide; and (c) rehabilitate sectoral management and
planning for a more effective allocation and use of scarce educational resources. The
project would meet the most obvious and urgent needs, building on the dynamics born
out of the war's exceptional circumstances -- the APE movement -- while giving MEN the
means to carry out its planning, regulatory and support role, without mortgaging
future options.
6.        Prolect description.  In order to meet the above objectives the project
would help the Government to: (a) develop and implement an education strategy aimed at
increasing the resources available to the sector, and allocating them appropriately,
avoiding the emergence of major distortions; (b) rehabilitate primary education by (i)
supporting a program of community-based school reconstruction/rehabilitation and
equipping of 1,000 existing classrooms; (ii) providing about 600,000 basic primary
textbooks and in-service training for about 1,750 of the more qualified supplementary
teachers; and (iii) strengthening teacher supervision and support including training
of 600 school directors; and (c) rehabilitate sectoral management by (i) reinforcing
national capacities in the critical areas of budget preparation and implementation
(including procedures to ensure regular salary payments to education staff), personnel
management, planning and policy formulation; and (ii) strengthening the recently
established National Directorate for Education Projects to ensure timely and efficient
implementation.
7.        The project, to be implemented over a six year period, would finance civil
works, furniture, equipment, pedagogic materials, training, specialist services, and
selected incremental costs. Its total cost is estimated at US$25.2 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$19.2 million (76%). A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Chad are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively, followed by a map of the country. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No 7244-CD, dated July 14, 1988, is also attached.
8.       AMreed actions.  The Government has agreed on the principle of joint Annual
Reviews aimed at assessing performance during the previous year, approving a work
program for the following project year (PY) and gradually specifying a policy
framework for the sector, as detailed sector work becomes available. This would
include (a) reviewing, on the basis of agreed trends and annually determined targets,



3
the level and structure of the recurrent budget with a view to increasing education's
share (now 11%) in Government's total recurrent budget, and within the sectoral
budget, protecting the share of primary education (now 51%) and raising the share of
non-salary expenditures (now 4%); (b) monitoring, on the basis of target zones (i)
teacher recruitment and promotion so as to contain the growth of the salary element of
the budget, and (ii) the number of new entrants into secondary general and
non-scientific higher education, in an effort to orient students toward the streams
and disciplines for which there is a market demand; and (c) agreeing on a rolling
three-year investment program for the education sector. Tne Government has also
agreed to prepare and implement a scheme, acceptable to IDA, to ensure regular payment
of education personnel salaries (at 60% of 1967 salary levels), and to formulate a
global human resource strategy. A condition of effectiveness would be signing of the
contract for the internationally recruited Educator and the arrival in-post of the
Project Administrator. Conditions of disbursement would be (i) for tlhe primary school
construction component, the signing of a contract with a volunteer association to
support the implementation of the primary school construction program, and (ii) for
the Study Fund (Category 7), the approval by the Association of each activity proposed
by the Government for financing under this Fund.
9.        Benefits.  Developing a partnership between the APEs and the Government for
the rehabilitation of primary education would provide a new impetus for sectoral
development without placing excessive pressure on an already overstrained Government
budget. Restoration of acceptable quality standards in primary education would have a
favorable impact on pupil achievements and internal efficiency at all levels of
education and eventually on l1"or productivity. The formulation and implementation of
a strategy involving sound policy principles, a well-coordinated investment plan and a
realistic institution-building program would set the stage for balanced development
and long-term, sustainable growth.
10.       Risks.  The risk that the war now localized in the northern part of the
country outside the project area might intensify, drawing more resources toward the
military effort, is common to all Chad operations. Two risks ~aore closely related to
the proposed project concern (i) possible demobilization of the local communities, if
a sudden influx of resources leads to centralizing tendencies in the Government; and
(ii) limited absorptive capacities of MEN and of the local communities, which are also
solicited by other externally financed projects. The project design is expected to
reduce these risks, through shared managerial and financial roles between the
Government and the local communities, rigorous criteria for access to and control of
project funds, capacity reinforcement, and careful monitoring.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
