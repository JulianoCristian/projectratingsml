Within this context the\n            project is composed of two major components. The first one\n            involves rehabilitating primary education with limited\n            increases in recurrent public expenditure by: assisting\n            local community initiatives through the provision of\n            financial and technical support for the reconstruction\n            and/or rehabilitation and equipping of about 1000 existing\n            classrooms; and by improving the efficiency and quality of\n            schooling through the provision of low-cost books and\n            teacher guides; the training of supplementary teachers; and\n            strengthening of teacher supervision and support. The second\n            component involves the rehabilitation of sector management\n            and planning capacity by; strengthening the Ministry of\n            National Education's (MEN) capacities to plan and\n            manage it's resources; and strengening MEN's\n            capacity to manage and implement projects through continued\n            support to the recently established National Directorate for\n            Education Projects."}, "docdt": "1988-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
