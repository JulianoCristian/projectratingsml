Rehabilitation Project\n            will help the Chad Government to gradually develop and\n            implement a policy framework aimed at increasing sectoral\n            resources and improving their cost effectiveness, and\n            avoiding the emergence of sectoral distortions. Within this\n            context the project is composed of two major components. The\n            first one involves rehabilitating primary education with\n            limited increases in recurrent public expenditure by:\n            assisting local community initiatives through the provision\n            of financial and technical support for the reconstruction\n            and/or rehabilitation and equipping of about 1000 existing\n            classrooms; and by improving the efficiency and quality of\n            schooling through the provision of low-cost books and\n            teacher guides; the training of supplementary teachers; and\n            strengthening of teacher supervision and support. The second\n            component involves the rehabilitation of sector management\n            and planning capacity by; strengthening the Ministry of\n            National Education's (MEN) capacities to plan and\n            manage it's resources; and strengening MEN's\n            capacity to manage and implement projects through continued\n            support to the recently established National Directorate for\n            Education Projects."}, "docdt": "1988-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
