      Credit Project for Chad were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, project sustainability was uncertain, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance in\n            project implementation was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included:  a project with well-defined and limited\n            objectives can succeed in an unstable country context, given\n            adequate resources and supervision. Indicators of project\n            success should have been addressed explicitly in the Staff\n            Appraisal Report (SAR) although they were compiled from\n            various sections of the SAR and reviewed consistently during\n            supervision. Implementation is obviously hampered by\n            frequent transfers and large-scale losses of supervisory\n            staff, Government officials and trained personnel. In the\n            future, emphasis should be placed not only on training\n            adequate numbers of appropriate staff, but also on\n            developing a policy framework that increases personnel\n            stability and requires personnel changes to be based on\n            sector needs. As supplementary teachers now make up 50\n            percent of Chad's teaching force, measures should be\n            developed to increase stability in that group as well, in\n            order to sustain the benefits of investments in training and\n            increase school quality. This operation was the fourth\n            education project in Chad, but the first to receive a\n            satisfactory rating. In part, its relative success was due\n            to increased country stability, but its implementation\n            record is largely the result of realistic program design, a\n            flexible approach to implementation at allowed the\n            adaptation of strategies to fit the evolving country and\n            sector contexts and adequate Bank supervision."}, "docdt": "1995-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
