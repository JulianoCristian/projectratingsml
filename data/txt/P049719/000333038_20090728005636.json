{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Land and Real Estate\n            Registration Project (LRERP) for the Kyrgyz Republic were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) the project\n            confirms a number of recognized lessons with respect to\n            lending. Foremost among these is the importance of\n            Government ownership and commitment over the long term which\n            were evident in identification of a true champion for\n            implementation of the project and further, stability over\n            time of a qualified and high-performing management team.\n            Continuity of staff was also important on the Bank's\n            side. This approach was deeply appreciated by the borrower\n            and allowed for building and maintaining a relationship of\n            trust that was an important part of the project's\n            success; 2) the LRERP also serves to confirm findings on the\n            advantages of a single agency model for handling\n            registration and cadastre, and to approach these\n            interventions through stand-alone projects rather than as\n            components in larger projects; 3) the project reconfirmed\n            the importance of a good monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            program. For a project such as this with multiple points of\n            service provision to the population, this could not have\n            been accomplished, even in a country of relatively small\n            scale as the Kyrgyz Republic, without the use of regional\n            monitors and the insistence that those monitors spend their\n            time in the field; and 4) the benefits of the project were\n            and are wider than the direct benefits of achieving the\n            project development objective (PDO). The well recognized\n            success of this intervention had a positive impact on the\n            broader Bank-Borrower relationship and on the reputation of\n            the Bank in the Kyrgyz Republic. Further, it is useful as a\n            model of success for land registration and land\n            administration projects more broadly."}, "docdt": "2009-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
