{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Land and Real Estate\n            Registration Project for Kyrgyz Republic were as follows:\n            outcome was highly satisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include: a single implementation agency for land\n            administration has operational advantages over a dual or\n            multi-agency approach. As the sole agency responsible for\n            land administration it was easier for Gosregister to\n            coordinate cadastral and registration activities, to reduce\n            bottlenecks, and to improve efficiency. The project's\n            success can be attributed in part to several design factors:\n            (a) the implementing agency and supporting legislation were\n            established before project implementation; (b) the project\n            prioritized development of a trained cadre of professional\n            staff; and (c) large-scale or complex activities were\n            introduced in phases. Gosregister could commence operations\n            immediately. Major training built staff proficiency in all\n            key skills. The network of registration offices and the\n            digitization and information technology systems were\n            developed progressively in line with evolving management and\n            technical capacity."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
