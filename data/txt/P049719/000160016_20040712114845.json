negative environmental impacts and\n            proposes measures to mitigate them. Among impacts\n            identified: Prevent loss of biodiversity and cultural\n            features by avoiding priority protection areas and areas of\n            little or no cultural significance. Select locations where\n            noise, odor, or aesthetic nuisance to neighborhoods will be\n            reduced. To reduce soil erosion, ensure worker awareness,\n            adopt appropriate soil protection techniques, avoid exposing\n            soil surfaces, conserve topsoil, and recover and replant,\n            and landscape where appropriate when construction is\n            completed. To minimize loss of soil productivity and\n            contaminating groundwater, train workers in handling and\n            storing fuels, lubricants, and chemicals; provide proper\n            on-site storage facilities; and install toilets and transfer\n            waste to municipal treatment facility. Operate during\n            working hours only, and water access roads during dry\n            periods to cut down on noise and dust. Dispose of\n            construction waste and garbage at designated sites. Ensure\n            that local people are aware of restricted access and arrange\n            for alternatives. Instruct workers on safety, use signage,\n            and barricade exposed areas. Provide protective clothing,\n            effective use of disinfectants, and conduct sanitary\n            inspections according to standards, including regulatory\n            animal and meat inspection. Ground waste bone, meat , and\n            offal into flour for animal feed, use blood for blood\n            sausage, collect and treat other water and blood waste\n            before disposing into municipal waste treatment systems,\n            recycle manure and allow to mature in an impervious\n            containment, apply manure as fertilizer for crop production\n            or on pastures. Properly apply pesticides. Remove and\n            recycle or effectively dispose of all toxic materials,\n            complete demolition after recycling useful materials, and\n            remove to a designated environmentally safe disposal site\n            and bury clean and inert materials. Avoid escaping NH3,\n            maintain sanitary conditions, and dispose of manure in a\n            timely manner to reduce odors. Convert refrigerants from\n            ozone depleting substances to a hydrofluorocarbon. To\n            prevent groundwater depletion, apportion water and use\n            efficiently. To reduce impacts from lead (lead solder used\n            for can seams), use tin instead or adopt other appropriate\n            sealing methods. To lessen risk to toxic chemicals modifying\n            aquatic habitats, contain and treat effluent discharges, and\n            store chemicals to prevent spills. To reduce surface water\n            contamination, collect and treat whey (waste from cheese\n            making) before discharge, and use for feedstock. To prevent\n            food contamination, know origin of milk, use effective\n            pasteurization process, conduct veterinary inspections, wear\n            protective gear, and disinfect. Regularly inspecting\n            markets, exterminating vermin, refrigerating meat and dairy\n            products will prevent spread of disease and worker illness."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
