INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE CHANDPUR II IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $13 million
to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to help finance the completion of
the Chandpur irrigation and flood protection project in East Pakistan.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.         The Association has made four credits for water development
projects in East Pakistan. The first Credit (No. 11-PAK) was made in
1961 for the Dacca-Demra Project (US$1 million equivalent) and construc-
tion of the project was completed in 1967. The second Credit (No. 39-PAK)
was made in 1963 for the Brahmaputra Embankment Project (US$5 million
equivalent) which was substantially completed in 1968. The thiird Credit
(No. h4-PAK) for US$9 million was for the initial Chandpur Project, which
is discussed in paragraph 3 below. The fourth Credit (No. S-8 PAK) was
made in 1969 for the engineering services of the Dacca Southwest Irriga-
tion-Engineering Project. The latter was the first in a series of proposed
engineering credits in East Pakistan. In addition, the Association and
the UNDP in 1969 began jointly financing the foreign exchange costs
(US$4 million) for the first two years of general consultants to the East
Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA).
3.         The first Chandpur Credit (No. ho-PAK) for US$9 million was
approved in 1963 to provide irrigation and flood protection for a gross
area of 135,000 acres. In 1965, because of increased costs, inadequate
execution of the project, and serious doubts about the design of the pro-
posed gravity irrigation system, the Association decided to cancel the
amount of the Credit pertaining to irrigation (US$3.75 million equivalent).
Work proceeded on the flood control aspects of the scheme, but because of
further cost increases and other difficulties, the Association agreed in
1967 that EPWAPDA should stop construction. One of the first tasks of a
special group, established in the Bank in September 1967 to assist East
Pakistan in the development of the agricultural and water sectors, was
to re-evaluate the Chandpur Project. In the light of the special group's
report, a recommendation was made to the Executive Directors (IDA/R68-31),
and was approved in June 1968, that the undisbursed balance of the Credit
(about US$660,000 equivalent) be applied toward the cost of redesigning
the project to substantially modify the irrigation design features, i.e.,
using natural drainage channels and low-lift pumps instead of a gravity
irrigation system. The consultants selected for this work produced a
feasibility report in September 1969 and have completed tender documents
for most of the major works of the Chandpur II project.



4.         The Chandpur ProJect was appraised by a mission which visited
Pakistan in July 1969. Negotiations were held in Washington on March 16-24,
1970. The Borrower and the Provincial Government of East Pakistan were
represented by Mr. Salahuddin Ahmed, Secretary of Agriculture; Mr. A.M.A.
Muhith, Economic Counsellor at the Embassy of Pakistan; and Mr. A.K.M.T.
Islam, EPWAPDA's Project Director for Chandpur.
5.         The Association has made twenty-nine development credits to
Pakistan totalling US$399.2 million, net of cancellations, of which ten
are fully disbursed. The Bank has made thirty loans in Pakistan for an
aggregate amount, net of cancellations, of US$614.3 million; eighteen
are fully disbursed. The following is a summary statement of IDA credits
and Bank loans as of February 28, 1970:

6.        In my recent report on the Industrial Development Bank Project
in Pakistan (dated January 29, 1970; circulated to the Executive Directors
as IDA/R 70-5) I have referred to the slow rate of disbursement of some of
the Association's credits to Pakistan. As I stated in that report, slow
disbursements have been caused by a variety of difficulties, especially
administrative shortcomings in the executing agencies, delayed availability
of local funds, and poor response to tendering.
7.        The Khairpur Ground Water and Salinity Control Project (Credit
No. 22-PAK) has been seriously delayed by unsatisfactory performance of
the contractors and inadequate supervision by the project authority;
however, construction is now virtually complete and more than half of the
project is in operation. A proposal to extend the Closing Date again to
cover the remaining foreign exchange expenditures of about US $500,000
has been circulated to the Executive Directors on March 27, 1970 and an
amount of about US $1.6 million is being cancelled (IDA/R 70-10). The
Dacca and Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Projects (Credits Nos.
11 and 12-PAX) were revised in October, 1968 (IDA/R 68-53), at which
time substantial portions of the credits were cancelled. Construction
of both projects started very slowly, primarly due to inadequate rupee
funds, but is now progressing reasonably well; and disbursements should
accelerate during the current calendar year. The last supervision mission
visited Dacca and Chittagong at the end of January, and has reported that
serious financial and managerial problems continue to exist; we therefore



- 4 -
intend to continue sending frequent supervision missions, and the next
such mission is scheduled for the middle of this month. The East and
West Pakistan Education Projects (Credits Nos. 49, 50, and 87-PAK) have
all been considerably delayed, primarily due to failure to provide the
necessary rupee funds to the executing agencies. However, the concerned
governments have assured the Association that the rupee problem is now
being taken care of in all three cases. A supervision mission is
presently in the field checking the progress made on these projects.
On the East Pakistan Highway Project (Credit No. 53-PAK), repeated at-
tempts have not produced acceptable tenders for major parts of the project;
recommendations for a revision of the project have been discussed with
the Pakistan authorities and will be circulated for the consideration of
the Executive Directors shortly.
8.        A few other projects encountered problems in their early stages,
but are now progressing satisfactorily in accordance with revised construc-
tion schedules (e.g., the Karachi Port Development Project - Loan No. 376-
PAK, the West Pakistan Highway Project - Credit No. 54-PAK, and the Karachi
Electric Supply Project - Loan No. 488-PAK). The Indus Basin and Tarbela
Multipurpose Loans (Nos. 266 and 548-PAK) are being disbursed in accordance
with predetermined formulae.
9.        Of the total undisbursed amount, more than half (about US $176
million) is accounted for by projects approved since July 1, 1968. There
are no substantial delays in implementation of these projects except for
the West Pakistan Highway Project - Loan No. 578-PAK, where a substantial
delay in the completion of the detailed engineering is likely to require
an extension of the Closing Date. A supervision mission which returned
from West Pakistan about three weeks ago has assisted the Government of
West Pakistan in an attempt to expedite the implementation of this project.
10.       It is quite obvious that the disbursement record in Pakistan is
not wholly satisfactory, and I have given instructions to the staff that
in appraising new projects particular attention is given to these implemen-
tation aspects.
11.       IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling about US
$21.6 million, net of cancellations. The value of outstanding commitments,
net of repayments, cancellations and sales of loans, is about US $16.5
million. IFC is presently considering applications for investments in
a large engineering company and in a project for fertilizer production.
12.       Several projects are in various stages of preparation.  Engineer-
ing credits have been negotiated for the Karachi Port Trust (US $1 million
equivalent) and for the Karnaphuli and Muhuri irrigation projects (US
$2.5 million equivalent, with the final amount of the credit subject to
adjustment on the basis of a firm price proposal from the consultants yet
to be selected). The following projects are expected to be negotiated
soon: Tubewells in East Pakistan (US $23 million total financing Jointly
with the Swedish International Development Agency; participation by the
Canadian International Development Agency is under discussion); Small
Industries in East Pakistan (US $3 million); Telecommunications (US $15
million); Power Transmission and Distribution (US $22 million); Sui
Northern Gas Pipeline (US $17 million); and Technical Education (US $8
million) - the last three in West Pakistan.

PART III - THE PROJECT
14.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Chandpur II Project in
East Pakistan" (No. PA-32) is attached.
15.       The second Chandpur Project is designed to provide irrigation
by using natural channels and low-lift pumps, as well as flood protection
by means of embankments. The revised irrigation design will alleviate the
problem of land acquisition. Much less land is required than was the case
for the first Chandpur Project (2,640 acres instead of 6,000 acres) and
many of the sites are of relatively lower elevations and hence less valu-
able. It is a condition of effectiveness (Section 6.01 (f) of the draft
Credit Agreement) that the Government obtain the land, or rights pertain-
ing thereto, necessary for the 1970 construction season (roughly October
to June). The Government has also provided assurances that the remainder
of the required land (about 700 acres), or rights relating thereto, will
be acquired promptly as needed.
16.       During the rainy season, periodic flood levels in the polder
will be reduced from present average levels of about 12 feet above sea
level to about 10 feet above sea level. This will mean that about two-
thirds of the cultivable land within the polder will be free from flood-



- 6 -
ing, the other one-third still being subject to flooding at varying
depths. During the rest of the year, the water level will be kept at
about 7 feet above sea level, which will be sufficient for purposes of
irrigation. The water will be raised from the channels by low-lift
pumps, each of Which is expected to serve an area of about 50 acres.
With assured water supplies, improved seed varieties and other inputs,
such as fertilizer and pesticides, can be used and the cropping inten-
sity increased from 170 percent to 240 percent.
17.       The Project is expected to yield substantial benefits in
agricultural output, with farm production increasing by as much as
three times above that obtainable without the project. The economic
rate of return would be approximately 22 percent for the presently
proposed project. If previous expenditures of Rs. 51.0 million on the
project are included in the calculations, the rate of return for the
combined investments would be about 15 percent. However, the rate of
return is sensitive to timing. The 22 percent rate of return would de-
cline to 18 percent if the construction of major facilities were to
require 5 rather than 3 years; it would decline to 16 percent if the
installation of the 1,500 low-lift pumps takes 6 years rather than 3
years.
18.       Many of the farmers in East Pakistan are living at subsistence
level; land holdings are small and highly fragmented; the Chandpur area
is a net importer of foodgrains; and most of the additional production
arising from the project would be consumed locally. Nevertheless, par-
ticular attention was paid in preparing and negotiating this Credit to
the recovery of project costs. Low-lift pump costs will be recovered
under existing procedures by a rental charge. Operation and maintenance
costs of the pumps (including replacement) will be recovered on the basis
of a graduated scale ensuring that full costs (estimated at about Rs. 55
per acre per annum) are being recovered by the tenth year of operation.
As far as major peripheral embankments and other flood-control-cum-irriga-
tion works are concerr.ed, the Provincial Government has agreed to begin
recovering as much as practicable of capital costs beginning with the tenth
year after completion of the project and to prepare and submit to the As-
sociation, within eighteen months, a plan for recovering operation and main-
tenance costs of the project works (embankments, regulators and sluices).
The Provincial Government has also agreed to submit by June 30, 1973 a
study of the feasibility of tolls at navigation locks and consult with the
Association about its implementation. (See Section 2.07 of the draft Project
Agreement for the covenants on recovery of costs).
19.       The success of the Chandpur Project requires that agricultural
inputs (low-lift pumps, fertilizer, and improved seed varieties) - supported
by agricultural extension work, credit and organization of farmers into
pump group cooperatives - become available as the phased construction of
the project works progresses. This in turn will require a complex project
organization and management involving several East Pakistan organizations
(EPWAPDA, Agricultural Development Corporation, Agriculture Department).
Special arrangements for organization and management have been developed
for this project and have been discussed extensively with the Government
of Pakistan. These arrangements, described in Part VI of the Appraisal
Report, center on a Project Area Committee and a Central Review Committee
which have already been reconstituted with membership and terms of refer-
ence satisfactory to the Association.



-7-
20.       The idea of using low-lift pumps for irrigation distribution
within polder-type projects such as Chandpur constituted a breakthrough
in the planning of water projects in East Pakistan. The use of low-lift
pumps on a significant scale in East Pakistan developed only in the past
five years. The Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) had placed
18,000 low-lift pumps at dispersed locations throughout the Province by
March 1970 and it plans for a total of 40,000 by the winter of 1972/73.
Under the Thana Irrigation Plan a "pump group" - usually from 10 to 75
farmers - has been formed within the area served by each pump (averaging
50 acres). The pump group collects pump rental and fuel charges and
arranges for the excavation of field channels for water distribution.
Primarily because of quick benefits obtainable during the dry season,
low-lift pump irrigation is spreading in East Pakistan. With engineering
works for primary pumping from the larger rivers, the scope for low-lift
pumping using perennial low flows of the smaller rivers can be substan-
tially expanded.
21.       The estimated total cost of the project is $22.7 million
equivalent. Of the $13 million IDA credit (constituting just under 60
percent of total costs), $5.1 million would be used to cover foreign
exchange expenditures. The balance of approximately $8 million would
be used to finance about half the estimated local expenditures. Water
control projects in East Pakistan, like the Chandpur Project, have a
very high priority; if the Bank Group is to make a significant contri-
bution in this vital sector, where the foreign exchange content usually
is low, it should be prepared to continue financing a substantial amount
of local costs. Although the Government has performed reasonably well
in taking action to raise additional revenue, the shortage of local cur-
rency has developed into a major constraint on the level of public develop-
ment expenditures. This situation has arisen in part because of rapid in-
creases in outlays on debt service and defense, but it has been greatly
aggravated by the sharp rise in salaries and welfare oriented outlays
following the disturbances in late 1968 and early 1969. On the exchange
side, freely usable exchange resources have been squeezed by rising debt
service payments and a roughly constant level of gross inflows, largely
in the form of project assistance. For all these reasons, local expendi-
ture financing is considered justified in this case.
22.       Contracts for the construction of regulators (approximately
US $5 million) and for low-lift pumps, pump engines and accessories
(totalling approximately US $2.5 million) would be awarded after inter-
national competitive bidding. Two contracts for civil works on the
regulators have been awarded, in February 1970, to East Pakistan con-
tractors who submitted the lowest tender in international competition.
Expenditures of up to US $700,000 incurred before the date of presentation
of this credit to the Executive Directors on these two contracts and a
third for the electrical and mechanical works to be awarded shortly, are
proposed to be reimbursed out of the credit. Local manufacturers would be
allowed to submit bids for the pumps, engines and other equipment; the
preference would be limited to 15 percent, or the prevailing custom duty,
whichever is lower. Contracts for other works would be of insufficient
interest to foreign firms and these contracts will be awarded after local



-8-
bidding on the basis of standard government procOdures, which ensure ade-
quate competition.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Province 6f1 East Pakistan and the Association, the Recom-
mendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
2L.       The draft Development Credit Agreement and the draft Project
Agreement follow the general pattern of other agreements for irrigation
projects. In addition to those provisions noted in PART III above, the
following features of the draft Agreements are of particular interest:
a.   Sections 2.02 and 2.03 of the draft Project Agreement
provide respectively for the creation by the Province
of a construction Revolving Fund and an Agriculture
Revolving Fund in order to ensure that the funds re-
quired for the Project are made available by the Province
quarterly on the basis of work schedules for the forth-
coming three month period.
b.   Section 6.01 (b) and (d) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement provide, as conditions of effectiveness of the
Credit, that the Province shall have established, and made
the initial payments into, the construction Revolving Fund
and the Agriculture Revolving Fund.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
25.       A comprehensive report on the Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Pakistan (SA-4a) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on April 18, 1969. A report on "Industrialization of Pakistan, the Record,
the Problems and the Prospects" (R 70-53) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on April 2, 1970.
26.       Political and social unrest in Pakistan during the latter part
of 1968 and early 1969 led to the resignation in March 1969 of Ayub Khan,
who handed over control to the army under General (now President) Yahya
Khan. In November 1969, the new President announced that elections would
be held in October this year for a National Assembly which would draw up
a new constitution. In addition, the President said that the Province of
West Pakistan would be split up into several units. An important issue
which underlay the political unrest, and which will figure prominently in



-9-
discussions on the constitution, is the allocation of resources between
East and West Pakistan in view of the fact that incole disparity between
the two provinces appears to have increased in recent years.
27.       These political events occurred at a time when the economy was
faced with a shortage of foreign exchange resources. As a result, indus-
trial investment, output and export growth have all been affected adversely.
However, the overall growth has been protected by the breakthrough in food-
grain production in West Pakistan. During the Third Plan (1965/66 - 1969/70)
the growth rate is expected to be 5.8 percent per. annum compared with 5.
percent per annum during the Second Plan (1960/61 - 1964/65). But while
West Pakistan should achieve a rate of 6.2 percent per annum over the Third
Plan, the growth of the East Pakistan economy can only be expected to be
about 4.2 percent per annum. The contrast between the two provinces in
agriculture is even more significant. West Pakistan has enjoyed the benefits
of the green revolution through the success of mexipak wheat and IRRI vari-
eties of rice; a significant increase in production occurred in 1967/68 to
give a sectoral growth rate of 11.7 percent, which was followed by further
growth in 1968/69 of 6.2 percent and an estimated 5 percent in 1969/70. In
East Pakistan, the growth rate jumped to 8.9 percent in 1967/68 but this
improvement was not sustained as there was a slight decline (one-half of
one percent).
28.       In East Pakistan, the principal food crop is rice which occupies
about 80 percent of the cultivated land. Production of rice has not kept
pace with population growth. In 1969/70 imports of foodgrain of 1.7 million
tons have been planned compared with previous levels of usually under 1
million tons. As a consequence of the shortage which arose in 1969, the
price of rice has risen markedly, substantially affecting the cost of living;
the general wholesale price index (1959/60 = 100) stood at 160 in September
1969 for East Pakistan compared with 133 for West Pakistan.
29.       An economic mission has Just completed its work in Pakistan and
we expect to distribute their report by the end of May. The mission con-
firms that the economic position and prospects of Pakistan justify continued
assistance on concessional terms such as those provided by IDA.
