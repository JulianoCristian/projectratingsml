                              P078832
                         (CREDIT NO. 4211-IN)

                                  Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for India, Karnataka Panchayats Strengthening Project, [Credit
No. 4211-IN], P078832 will be extended from December 31, 2012 to December 31,
2013. This will be the second extension to the project making for a total extension of one
year and nine months from the original closing date.

2.      The project has been under implementation for over five years and is currently
rated as moderately satisfactory in implementation progress and in achievement of
Project Development Objectives. Significant progress has been made in institutionalizing
the good governance practices developed under the project and in building capacity of
Gram Panchayats. The assets created through untied grants are of acceptable quality and
are put to use by the beneficiary communities. The general public appreciates the
creation of a tendering requirement for awarding contracts, as per the recent post-
procurement review, and attributes the same for improvement in quality of works under
this project. There has been significant improvement in documenting of procurement,
payments and completion certificates of works. There has been an increase in own
source revenues. The introduction of computerized double-entry accrual accounting
system has improved gram panchayat accounting significantly.

3.      The proposed extension will be used to complete some key activities which
include: a) the construction of the remaining Taluk Resource Centers (TRCs); b)
establishing fully functional Satellite Communication facilities/studios; c) allowing the
Gram Panchayats to complete the utilization, accounting and reporting of the block grants
financed by the project; and d) completion of the impact evaluation and end-of-project
survey. The extension will also help in utilizing the additional amount of Rs. 82.7 crores
that has accrued to the project over and above the original allocated amount due to
exchange rate fluctuation. The Borrower has submitted a detailed action plan to the Bank
for completing the remaining activities and utilizing the additional amounts by December
31st, 2013.
