                         through untied grants are of acceptable quality and are put to use by the beneficiary communities. The general public appreciates the creation of a tendering requirement for awarding
                         contracts, as per the recent post procurement review, and attributes the same for improvement in quality of works under this project. There has been significant improvement in
                         documenting of procurement, payments and completion certificates of works. There has been an increase in own source revenues. The introduction of computerized double-entry
                         accrual accounting system has improved gram panchayat accounting significantly. The extension will be used to complete some key activities which include: a) the construction of

                         the remaining Taluk Resource Centers (TRCs); b) establishing fully functional Satellite Communication facilities/studios; c) allowing the Gram Panchayats to complete the utilization,
                         accounting and reporting of the block grants financed by the project; and d) completion of the impact evaluation and end-of-project survey. The extension will also help in utilizing the
                         additional amount of Rs. 82.7 crores that has accrued to the project over and above the original allocated amount due to exchange rate fluctuation. The Borrower has submitted a
