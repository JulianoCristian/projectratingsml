                         This ISR updates the status of the operation with level one restructuring. The project closing date has been extended by three months following a request from the Government.

                         The project has been under implementation for seven years and is currently rated as moderately satisfactory in implementation progress and in achievement of Project Development
                         Objectives. The project is 98% disbursed. Significant progress has been made in institutionalizing the good governance practices developed under the project and in building

                         communities. The general public appreciates the creation of a tendering requirement for awarding contracts, as per the recent post-procurement review, and attributes the same for
                         improvement in quality of works under this project. There has been significant improvement in documenting of procurement, payments and completion certificates of works. The
                         recent environment review rates the environment performance of the project including the impact of civil works undertaken as moderately satisfactory. There has been a steady

                         increase in own source revenues of the project GPs with better infrastructure and improvement in service delivery. The introduction of computerized double-entry accrual accounting
                         system (PanchaTantra) has remarkably improved the gram panchayat accounting and enabled completion of a huge backlog of audit reports.

                         The three month extension will be used to complete all pending residual works in the project activities in order to successfully meet the project development objectives. These
                         pending tasks include: a) procurement and installation of computers and peripherals in 5629 GPs and 176 Samarthya Soudhas (Taluk Resource Centers (TRCs)); b) the completion
                         of construction of the remaining TRCs; c) installation of studio equipment for the five satellite studios and establishment of fully functional communication facilities; d) allowing the GPs
                         to complete the utilization, accounting and reporting of the block grants financed by the project; and e) completion of the impact evaluation study based on end-of-project survey. The
                         proposed extension is facilitating full utilization of additional amount of financing that had accrued to the project over and above the original allocated amount due to exchange rate
                         fluctuation. The Borrower has submitted a detailed action plan to the Bank for completing the remaining activities by March 30, 2014.

                         During the Tenth Implementation Support Mission (August 2013), the Government of Karnataka expressed interested in possible future support by the World Bank. Since KGSP is
                         the only project in Government of Karnataka that has an explicit focus on 39 ‘most backward’ taluks, efforts in sustaining the progress made under this project will help in
                         consolidating the gains and further strengthening the institutions so developed. According to the Government, Gram Swaraj project has played an important catalytic function in
                         helping the ‘most backward’ GPs to plan, prioritize and articulate their local needs and demands within the decentralized framework. However, a formal request for possible follow-up
                         operation is yet to be received by the Bank.
