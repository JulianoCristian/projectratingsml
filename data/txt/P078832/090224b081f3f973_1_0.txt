                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been under implementation for over five years and is currently rated as moderately satisfactory in implementation progress and in achievement of Project
                         Development Objectives. Implementation progress has been affected by frequent changes in the Project Chief and more recently by the state elections. The mission has observed
                         that an official at an appropriate level with necessary administrative powers and authority is critical for smooth implementation of the project. The mission recommended that the
                         project be headed by an official delegated with all necessary authority to expedite completion of remaining project activities. The implementation has been slow in the last few months

                         due to elections also and this has resulted in accumulation of mission requests, delays in updating the procurement plan, and slack in collecting the utilization certificates from the
                         GPs. After the elections, there have been changes in the project in terms of the senior management and the Project Director. Some of the long pending issues on method of
                         procurement for computer and peripherals have been directly addressed by the Principal Secretary, RDPR and other issues have also been taken up.

                         The project closing date was extended by one year and the project now closes on December 31, 2013. The Bank mission reviewed the progress of the activities as per the agreed
                         Action Plan 2012 on the basis of which the Karnataka Gram Swaraj Project (KGSP) was extended for one more year. This was the second extension to the project. The ninth
                         implementation support mission in August 2012 identified that the project had surplus money due to exchange rate fluctuations. The mission noted in August 2012 that the surplus
                         funds in excess of the original amount were Rs. 82.74 crores (US$ 115mln ) in addition to the unspent balances of Rs. 28 crores. The project in consultation with the Bank team had
                         agreed on a detailed Action Plan for utilizing the full amount during the course of next one year. Some of the key activities included in the action plan were: a) the construction of the
                         remaining Taluk Resource Centers (TRCs)/Samarthya Soudhas at the taluk level; b) establishing fully functional Satellite Communication facilities/studios (SATCOM); c) allowing the
                         Gram Panchayats (GPs) to complete the utilization, accounting and reporting of the block grants financed by the project; and d) completion of the impact evaluation and end-of-
                         project survey. The progress till date is :

                         Construction of TRCs - Out of 34 remaining Samarthya Soudha buildings in August 2012, 26 are completed, 8 are at various stages of progress i.e. 4 are at completion, 2 are at roof
                         level and 2 are at lintel level. 163 buildings have been completed till date out of a total of 175 resource centers.

                         SATCOM centers - Civil works for the 5 district sub-centers have been completed. Work on procurement and commissioning of equipment has been entrusted to Government of
                         Karnataka enterprise. The mission has discussed the timeline with the State Institute of Rural Development (ANSSIRD) responsible for completing this activity. Installation process
                         would be completed by October and the plan is to have fully functional statellite studios by end November.

                         Block grants - According to the project, all block grants releases have been completed. The completion of works and the utilization certificates will need to be obtained after the
                         money has been fully accounted for by the GPs. Total Savings (outstanding balances) of Rs.61.08 crores have been released as 6th installment to 1175 Gram Panchayats. The
                         unspent balance includes additional funds made available as a result of exchange rate fluctuation amounting to Rs. 55.44 crores. The mission noted GP unspent balance is currently
                         to the extent of Rs.97 crores ($16 million) including fresh releases of Rs.56 crores ($ 9 million) for which action plan is yet to firmed up and tenders and work orders are yet to be
                         issued . According to the Bank mission, there is a high probability that GPs would not be able to complete the works before the closing date and the entire amount could become
                         ineligible and refundable to Bank.

                         End of project survey - The field work is now complete. The consultants will be submitting the report by end November. Bank team is working closely with the consultants on this
                         issue and the project is also monitoring the work closely.
