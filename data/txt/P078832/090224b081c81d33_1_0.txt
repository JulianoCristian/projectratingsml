                         The development objective of the project is to improve the effectiveness of service delivery by Karnataka Gram Panchayats (village governments) particularly with
                         respect to the management of public resources and the delivery of relevant services that the rural people prioritize.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been under implementation for over five years and is currently rated as moderately satisfactory in implementation progress and in achievement of Project
                         Development Objectives. The project closing date was extended by one year and the project now closes on December 31, 2013. The Project development Objectives are evaluated
                         on the basis of three parameters which include an increase in the number of Gram Sabhas and Ward Sabhas with high and representative participation and relevant participatory
                         plans reflecting community preferences on local population, rise in the satisfaction of village residents with service delivery by GPs and lastly a gradual increase in own tax revenue

                         and stronger financial health of GPs. The no. of Gram Sabhas have consistently risen from a low base of about 4000 to over 7000 Gram Sabhas with rising local representation and
                         plnas reflecting community needs. The collection rate of own source revenue in 37.3% in 2011/12 compared to the baseline of 31%. Field visits to about 20 GPs covering 4 districts
                         and Focus Group Discussions show that village residents are satisfied by the services rendered by the GPs. Village residents appreciate the works undertaken by the GPs and the
                         way participatory planning is taking place at the grass root level. However, it needs to be noted that there is scope for further improvement in improving the quality and efficiency of

                         last mile delivery. The post procurement review 2013 overall findings from the field show some improvement in participation of bidders in tendering, though low participation continues
                         to be a systemic issue to be addressed by the state; bidding outcomes, and implementation of a GP level Procurement Monitoring tool. All works were found to be completed and
                         being used by the beneficiaries. This reiterates the fact that general public appreciates the assets created at the GP level and the residents are using the facilities/works created
                         through participatory planning (i.e work plans). There continues to be improvement in documenting of procurement, payments and completion certificates of works.

                         PROGRESS ON THE REMAINING ACTIVITIES (for which the extension was sought)
                         a) the construction of the remaining Taluk Resource Centers (TRCs): Out of the remaining 34 TRC buildings, 23 buildings are completed, 11 are at various stages of progress i.e, 7
                         are at completion, 2 are at roof level and 2 are at foundation stage. There were 4 Samarthya Soudha Buildings that were cancelled which included Mysore, Madikeri, Bangarpet and
                         Srinivaspura. In the recent steering committee meeting it was decided to resume the construction of Samarthya Soudha at these Taluks also. Accordingly the Chief Executive
                         Officer’s and Executive Officer of taluka’s of the concern districts have been addressed letters to identify the land for construction. With the exception of Bangarpet, rest have
                         identified the site for construction of the TRCs.

                         b) establishing fully functional Satellite Communication facilities/studios: There seems to be concerns emerging on the procurement of equipment for the SATCOMs. There has been
                         a substantial delay in signing the agreement with the firm who will be supplying the equipments. The project team is expected to resolve this issue by the end of the month. Since
                         there will not be any further extension to the project, it is critical that the satellite facilities are fully functional by December 2013.

                         c) allowing the Gram Panchayats to complete the utilization, accounting and reporting of the block grants financed by the project: The project disbursements are on track and are
                         expected to reach 98% before the project closure with an expected saving of XDR 1.7 million ($2.55 million, Rs.136 million) . The project has been informed that they should not
                         transfer any block grant (BG) after 31st May 2013 in order to ensure the GPs receiving the block grant are provided at least six months to execute the works. The FM systems are
                         working well and the UC’s have been collected by the project. The Panchatantra implementation progress has been very good in the past few months. In the last six months, the
                         backlog of 2010-11 of 604 GPs and 2011-12 (2811 GPs) has been completed.

                         d) completion of the impact evaluation and end-of-project survey: The end-line field survey began in mid April. Enumerators were trained and are now in the process of collecting
                         data.
                         The collection of data will be completed by end July. Bank team has been working with the institute that is conducting the field survey.

                         In overall terms, implementation progress is Moderately Satisfactory with concerns on the procurement of equipment for the satellite studios which the project is planning to expedite.
