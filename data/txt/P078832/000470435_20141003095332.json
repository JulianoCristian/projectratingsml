for India were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Strong, top-down state commitment and action is critical to\n            the success of decentralization and this \u0093block grants plus\n            capacity building\u0094 approach. The approach of discretionary\n            block grants complemented by capacity building has proved\n            its potential, even if it may require modification to\n            continue having strong impacts. It is critical that the\n            M&E and management information system of\n            decentralization projects are more robust and well thought\n            through, even if this is challenging for this type of\n            project. It is important to have a performance assessment\n            system that has good enough standards of accountability but\n            that is also realistically tailored to the existing\n            capacities of GPs in the \u0091backward\u0092 areas. Capacity building\n            efforts would need to be better tailored and more\n            appropriately targeted and rolled out if the full potential\n            of the block grant system is to be realized. It is important\n            to ensure that the GP plans and their implementation\n            sufficiently reflect changing constituent preferences and\n            the interests of the more excluded groups. Improved\n            information and education campaigns could contribute to the\n            strengthening of the GP planning, resource management and delivery."}, "docdt": "2014-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
