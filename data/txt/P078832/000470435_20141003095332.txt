1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and State Context

1.   At the time of appraisal, most of India's poor lived in rural areas and were lagging behind
     on a number of development indicators. Seventy two percent of India's population was
     resident in its rural areas and 30 percent of these were reported to be living below the poverty
     line 1 at the time of preparation and appraisal of the Project. The Project Appraisal Document
     (PAD) noted that compared with other countries India spends a larger proportion of GDP on
     rural development, about US$ 7 billion by some accounts, but despite some progress, results are
     not commensurate with the magnitude of the expenditures. Rural areas continue to lag behind
     the urban agglomerations in poverty and social and economic indicators.

2.   In spite of programs to address the needs of the rural poor, traditional delivery
     mechanisms were unable to cope with the magnitude of the challenge of providing services
     to more than 700 million rural people often in locations of limited accessibility. The national
     and state investments were fragmented in nature, having significant administrative costs. These
     investments were embedded in complex administrative procedures and somewhat narrow
     objectives, and they were not fully utilized by the diverse and heterogeneous population.
     Consequently, a big proportion of national funds remained undisbursed at the local level.

3.   As one response to the challenge of reducing poverty, improving basic services and
     strengthening the delivery mechanisms, India opted for decentralization. The objective was
     to bring the government closer to the people, in particular the rural poor. In 1993, a revision to
     the Constitution (73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments) created rural governments at the
     district, block and village levels and mandated states to hold periodic elections for these bodies
     and devolve functions and funds to them. In 2006, the national administration saw rural
     governments as the key mechanism for delivering key services to rural people and one of its
     priorities was to make this approach work in some states to serve as an example and a model for
     the rest of the country. By 2006, the progress in states on devolution had been mixed, with
     limited devolution of the 3 Fs – Functions, Funds and Functionaries.

4.   At the time of preparation and appraisal, Karnataka was considered to be India’s fastest
     growing state, although it faced a number of poverty and development challenges.
     Karnataka was mostly known for its strong growth in the services sector, in particular the IT
     sector. However, the high growth benefited largely the urban sector leaving vast disparities
     between the urban and rural areas and between different regions of the state. At the time of
     Project preparation and appraisal, Karnataka ranked eighth among 29 states in absolute number
     of poor people (with 14 million), and ninth in absolute number of rural poor (about 8 million)
     more than any other southern state. In terms of percentage of poor people, it ranked seventh in
     India close to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. It also ranked poorly in child
     malnutrition and access to roads. A state High Powered Committee (2002) reviewed the status of
     regional disparities according to several indicators and identified 39 rural blocks (Taluks 2 )

       The Project Appraisal Document (PAD, May 2006) quoted 756 million rural population in India out of a total population of 1.05
     billion (Census 2001). Of these 30 percent were below poverty line. However, these figures for 2004-05 have been revised in the most
     recent Planning Commission Poverty Estimates (Expert Group chaired by Suresh D. Tendulkar) which shows 42 percent of rural
     people below poverty line in India during this period.

                                                                      1
     concentrated primarily in Northern Karnataka as the most backward 3, with another 75 Taluks
     considered to be lagging in development indicators (out of 176). These Taluks also showed the
     highest concentration of scheduled caste, dalit, and tribal people.

5.   Karnataka had a longer history of active rural local governments, it was a pioneer in
     certain initiatives of sub-state devolution and its 1983 reforms served as the basis for the
     1993 Constitutional Amendments. In 2002, the Report on Rural Decentralization 4 by
     Government of Karnataka (GoK) outlined the strategy to improve rural governance and
     empowerment of local governments. Following this strategy the state undertook a series of
     policy initiatives towards devolution which included - (i) Amendments to the State Panchayat
     Act; (ii) devolution of 29 subjects and 28 percent of public expenditures to district, block and
     village governments; (iii) clearer expenditure assignments; and (iv) the introduction of Block
     Grants (BG) in the transfer system, along with improved financial management and planning
     guidelines. The State Government through a Government Order of October 16th, 2004 mandated
     its line agencies to transfer to the Panchayats activities which had been devolved to them and
     required international organizations, including the World Bank, to implement its Projects
     through the Panchayat system. Karnataka saw decentralization as one instrument to address
     regional disparities if it could be pursued in an equalizing fashion by divesting more resources to
     the poorest blocks and villages and by developing capacity at the local level.

6.   Karnataka, despite its impressive record, had a long way to go before its local bodies could
     fulfill their potential. The block grants were small and unpredictable; generally, these grants
     were the same for every Gram Panchayat (GPs) 5 independent of population, poverty or need. At
     the same time, there were high informal and formal transaction costs for local residents in need
     of alternative services. The majority of rural poor could be targeted and reached only by the
     lowest level of the village government, the GP, and this level was also the one with the best
     information on local needs and demands.

7.   The effectiveness and efficiency of the system for resource transfers from the central to the
     state and local levels was limited because of the scheme based nature of programs
     (essentially tied transfers). This resulted in large disparities in service delivery, considerable
     delays and associated opportunity cost and a failure to take local preferences systematically into
     account for service delivery options. The transfer system was driven by tied schemes that limited
     the ability of local governments to adjust resource allocations to local needs. Block grants were
     small and unpredictable and of the same size for every Gram Panchayat (GP) independent of
     population, poverty or need.

8.   Enhancing the own resources and capacity of Gram Panchayats were also important
     priorities. Fiscal stress at the state level made it difficult to finance the huge needs of rural
     governments, particularly in the disadvantaged areas. Some of the estimates calculated the
     requirement to be over one billion US dollars. As a result, efforts by the Panchayats were
     required to mobilize their own resources through increased revenues. Meanwhile, capacity
     building was also an important challenge requiring a continuing process of training and hand-
     holding for over 5000 local bodies and 100,000 local elected representatives as well as

      enhancements to the local government accounting system to strengthen linkages between
      planning, budgeting, spending and monitoring.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

9.    Given the record of Karnataka in empowering local governments, it was considered
      opportune for the Bank to support the ongoing decentralization process. In addition, the
      Bank’s active multi-sector involvement in Karnataka – health, education, watershed, rural water
      supply – required effective and efficient local bodies for implementation through creating
      appropriate capacity to deliver a wide range of services. Supporting these local bodies through
      an umbrella operation, in addition to State schemes and Bank funded sector Project, was also
      mitigating the risk of Panchayats being transformed into service agents for higher levels of
      government rather than into true local self-governments.

10.   Rural decentralisation was also a key pillar of the India country strategy, and the Project
      could build on important Bank analytical work. The Bank’s India Country Strategy (2001-
      2004) highlighted a specific need of improving government’s effectiveness through
      decentralization and accelerating pro-poor rural development through more effective delivery
      mechanisms, and by strengthening the rural safety net and beneficiary participation. The Project
      would help in operationalizing the recommendations from the Bank’s intensive Economic and
      Sector Work on decentralization. Also, the subsequent Country Strategy (2005-2008), envisaged
      a substantial increase in its volume of lending for community driven rural programs.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

11.   The original Project Development Objective (PDO) in the Project Appraisal Document
      (PAD) was stated as follows. “The development objective of the Project is to improve the
      effectiveness of service delivery by Karnataka Gram Panchayats (village governments)
      particularly with respect to the management of public resources and the delivery of relevant
      services that the rural people prioritize”.

12.   The progress towards the PDO is measured by the results framework outlined in the PAD
      (Annex 3). The results framework has the following indicators (Table 1).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.   The PAD identified Gram Panchayats as the primary beneficiaries of the project. Based on
      the PAD, the ICRR interprets the primary beneficiaries as the GPs, which include GP
      functionaries and elected representatives, in terms of improvements in their capacity and their
      benefitting from improved systems and procedures. Citizens resident in GPs of the Project area
      (comprising of the most backward 39 taluks) and the State Government were also identified as
      beneficiaries in terms of improved delivery, policy environment, monitoring and evaluation, and
      learning.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.   The PDO was intended to be achieved through the implementation of four Project
      components, which represented an allocated IDA financing of US$ 120 million over a 5.5
      year period. Support under the Project followed a dual approach of programmatic support (for
      Component A: Block Grants to GPs comprising US$ 113.3 million) and traditional investment
      lending (For Components B, C and D comprising US$ 6.7 million) 6.

                  Type of Support                                          Component
            Programmatic                          A: Block Grants to 1341 GPs in 39 ‘most backward taluks’
            Investment                            B: Building information systems for constituents
            (state-wide, 5629 GPs)                C: Building the capacity of Panchayats
                                                  D: Building Capacity of State (Setting up of DAC)

Component (A) Block grants to Gram Panchayats

15.   This programmatic component would finance block grants to GP for the delivery of services
      listed in the Panchayats’ perspective/participatory plans and budgets. To be eligible for the
      block grants, GPs would have to put in place the new Financial Management and Accounting
      System prepared by the state of GoK acceptable to IDA. In addition to the above, GPs that were
      eligible would also need to implement the new planning guidelines, and hold regular Gram




      6
       According to the cost estimates provided in the Project Appraisal Document, Annex 5 (Pg. 40), the total Project cost is US$ 133.3
      million. Of this, the IDA funding was US$ 120 million. Block grant was 100 percent reimbursable under IDA while IDA funded only
      one-third of components B, C and D and the remaining was funded by GoK.

                                                                      4
      Sabha 7 meetings with open participation and public display of financial management and
      procurement information.

16.   The block grants were to be based on a formula aimed at supporting inclusiveness and
      poverty alleviation. The formula in the first year gave weight to poverty (the population of
      scheduled castes and scheduled tribes), area (a proxy for costs of service provision), and illiteracy
      (proxy for service deficit). From the second year onwards, the block grants were to be transferred
      to eligible GPs based on a revised formula which would also incorporate some performance
      indicators. The basis of the formula from the second year would be to equalize over fiscal
      disparities and needs in the ‘most backward’ GPs.

Component (B) Building Information Systems for Constituents

17.   This component would increase the capacity of rural people (especially poor), to voice their
      demands on local bodies and hold them accountable for performance. This was to be
      achieved through three distinct activities – (i) creation of special mobile communication units; (ii)
      a Planning unit of the District Government that would make information on service delivery
      available at the village level through various channels; and (iii) the provision of technical
      assistance through organized groups/associations (self-help groups, watershed associations etc.)
      to make people aware on how to access and use available government programs and services.

Component (C) Building the Capacity of Panchayats

18.   This component aimed at creating capacity at the District, Block and Village level to
      function effectively as a local level of government. Since GPs were the weakest link, most
      capacity building efforts were envisaged to be targeted at this level. In total 5,629 local
      governments (GPs) and 100,000 elected representatives were intended to benefit from this
      component. Specifically, this component would include; - (i) creation of resource cells; (ii) a
      service delivery monitoring system; (iii) training programs for Panchayats; (iv) computerized
      financial management systems (included rolling out an accounting software called PanchaTantra)
      for GPs and; (v) an environmental management framework for Projects undertaken by the PRIs 8.

Component (D) Building the capacity of the state

19.   This component would enhance the state level capacity to monitor, facilitate and guide the
      Panchayat. Specifically it would include:

          • Creation of a Decentralization Analysis Cell (DAC): The DAC was expected to perform
            tasks such as analysis, evaluation, monitoring of fiscal flows to panchayats, own revenues
            and service delivery, and policy analysis.
          • Establishment of a Panchayat monitoring system at state level: The system was intended
            to monitor Panchayat fiscal and service delivery data and policy support.
          • Strengthening of the State Institute for Rural Development: This was to finance
            equipment for the Abdul Nazeer Sab State Institute for Rural Development (ANSSIRD)
            campus in Mysore and the creation of ANSSIRD training centers (satellite studios-
            SATCOMs) at the Taluk level equipped with audio-visual capabilities.

        • Restructuring of line agencies: This would cover technical assistance to the State line
          agencies for the design of their institutional restructuring towards new roles in a decentralized
          service delivery framework.

      Not Applicable.

1.7 Other significant changes

20.   Level 2 restructuring to extend the Project closing date was carried out three times. The
      original Project closing date was December 31st, 2011. The Project finally closed on March 30,
      2014 with extensions of nine months in 2011, 12 months in 2012 and three months in 2013 9.
      Broadly, the activities that were to be completed during the extension period included: (i)
      procurement and installation of computers and peripherals in 5629 GPs and 176 Samarthya
      Soudhas (TRCs) as agreed in the Action Plan 2013; (ii) the completion of construction of the
      remaining TRCs; (iii) installation of studio equipment for the five satellite studios (SATCOMs)
      and establishment of fully functional communication facilities; (iv) allowing the GPs to complete
      the utilization, accounting and reporting of the block grants financed by the Project; and (v)
      completion of the impact evaluation study based on an end-of-Project survey.

21.   The 2012 extension was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in the dollar. As a result
      an additional amount of INR 82 crores (US$ 13 million) accrued to the Project in July 2012 over
      and above its original allocations. At the same time, there were unspent balances of INR 28 crores
      (US$ 4.5 million) remaining from the original Project allocations. In order to fully utilize the
      huge amount the Government requested a one year extension. Among the available funds, a
      major share was provided to GPs as BG in the form of a sixth annual tranche.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.   The Karnataka Gram Swaraj Project (KGSP) 10 was a pioneering operation of the Bank as
      it was a first-generation decentralization Project in India as well as in South Asia. The
      Project design covered block grants to the lowest tier of local government, capacity building at
      various levels, information for stakeholders and creating support infrastructure.

23.   The Project design built upon a considerable body of analytical work carried out prior to
      Project agreement. The Economic and Sector Work (ESW) portfolio of the World Bank had
      carried out a series of analyses 11 on decentralization in the years running up to the Project. This
      had also involved discussions with government officers, policy makers, academics and activists
      working on issues of decentralization in Karnataka and other states.




      9
        On March 26, 2011, and subsequently on October 12, 2012 a level 2 restructuring was undertaken; this was to extend the closing of
      the Project by nine months and then by 12 months, respectively. On November 20, 2013, a further three month extension to the Project
      was granted.

      connection with these.

                                                                      6
24.   Karnataka put in place a decentralized framework prior to Project effectiveness that aimed
      to support implementation. The Government of Karnataka (GoK) undertook a number of steps
      which included the following: (i) developed a Decentralization Strategy in 2002 and since,
      amended its Panchayat Act; (ii) redesigned the financial management framework for Panchayats,;
      allocated 28 percent of government budgets to the Panchayat (three-tier) system; (iii) assigned a
      block grant of US$ 6,611 to each Gram Panchayat; (iv) developed clear expenditure assignments;
      (v) consolidated many of the state tied schemes (initially over 600) into a smaller number of
      budget lines; and (vi) transferred most of these schemes to the Panchayat system through a
      government order in 2004.

25.   Project risks were well identified at the design stage. The Bank had identified the substantial
      risk of weakening commitment to Project goals emanating from multiple factors – political
      economy issues, fiscal stress at the state level, changes in political and administrative leadership –
      and the possible undermining of block grant transfers as envisaged in Project design. The
      disbursement arrangements were designed to mitigate these risks as much as possible, with a
      formula based transfer system. The formula-based grant allocation system was to include
      incentives for own-revenue generation, planning guidelines were to cover a large range of
      services, and monitoring of service delivery was expected to provide the necessary feedback for
      correction, as needed. There was also the expectation that economic restructuring loans (another
      lending operation of the Bank with GoK) would improve state level expenditure management.

26.   All the risks identified at the time of appraisal, however, could not be addressed adequately
      at entry. The slow pace of GP capacity building was seen as a substantial risk and sought to be
      addressed through provision for outsourcing to populate the resource cells at the block. The slow
      pace of instituting the financial management system was also identified as a risk. However, as
      this was a state-wide initiative, there were limitations in what the Project could take up at the
      Project’s entry stage. The risk of according low priority to the decentralization cell was sought to
      be addressed through an up-front agreement with the State Finance Department on the role of the
      DAC and the provision of a full-time officer to head the DAC.

27.   The design of the project as a decentralization-focused one was made based on learning and
      experience with other design models. Three key learnings were integrated. First, the project
      was not designed as a rural poverty project 12. Given their size, Bank projects have limited impact
      unless they can contribute to mainstream programs. Second, GoK had access to many state and
      central schemes that target vulnerable groups, and there were already a large number of
      community organizations and self-help groups operating in the state. Many of those schemes
      were financed as central grants and therefore the priority for the state was not to borrow to
      increase the total amount of targeted schemes and funds, but rather to improve implementation of
      the existing ones. Finally, the weakest link for improving local governance was the local
      government itself. The project was also not designed as a standalone project and instead opted for
      working through the government system. The reformed financial management system prepared
      by the Government offered enough assurances for the Bank’s fiduciary requirements.

28.   Activation of Gram Sabhas with increased participation was one of the drivers designed in
      the Project to move towards service delivery responding to local priorities and increased
      accountability. This design was informed by the experience from a range of local governance
      projects, which suggests that: the presence of organized groups of poor people can help to ensure
      transparency and accountability of local governments to them; Panchayats needed to be involved

      in local infrastructure planning to ensure its sustainability; and Gram Sabhas (village assemblies)
      generally take place when they have relevant decisions to make. Also, where communities
      contribute towards local investments these can be implemented at lower costs and are more likely
      to be sustained.

29.   The project also focused on the most backward Taluks in the state. The risk of shifting
      resources away from most needy jurisdictions was addressed through the focus of the project on
      the GPs in the 39 most backward Taluks of Karnataka. This was written into the project’s legal
      agreement.

30.   The Project design, overall, adopted a the blended approach of having a programmatic
      block grant support with investment lending embedded in institutional and capacity
      strengthening at the district, block and village level. The block grants were to be used as a
      vehicle to catalyze institutional strengthening and building the capacity of the system to
      implement the policy framework (2002) 13 of GoK. Project execution became easier once the GPs
      aligned themselves in accordance with the new financial reporting and accounting systems and
      the planning guidelines.

2.2 Implementation

31.   The Project facilitation team (PFT) experienced some implementation delays, especially in
      the first two years, which slowed progress; but the pace largely picked up thereafter and
      more comprehensively after corrections at Mid-Term Review. There were initial challenges
      (especially with staffing of the PFT and DAC) with the pace of the implementation of the Project.
      This was accentuated by changes in administrative leadership14 at the state and also changes in
      political leadership 15 at the time of the start of the Project. Also, an amendment to the Panchayat
      Raj Act was passed in April 2007 by the Legislative Assembly and awaited assent of the
      Governor, and this presented a hindrance 16 to project implementation. Discussions with the state
      government on the Project were suspended for a brief period (till October 2007), until the
      outcome of the amendment and its implications were clear. During this phase, implementation
      gaps were identified in all components, but primarily in the planning process and the information
      to constituents, as these activities related to the disbursement of BGs and their utilization.

32.   In 2008 state elections were held and the Project had to face challenges of significant
      turnover of staff in the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department including their
      senior management, though this eventually settled down. During this period the Project progress


      13
         Amendment to the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act (2002) included- : (i) creation of Ward Sabhas (neighbourhood assemblies) as the
      lowest unit of constituent representation and participation to enhance accountability downwards; (ii) allow associations of Gram
      Panchayats to explore economies of scale in service delivery; (iii) allow outsourcing to technical staff for the delivery of Panchayat
      services. Along with amending its Panchayat Act, the GoK has also taken other significant rural decentralization policy initiatives.
      These include: putting in place a new accounting and reporting framework for Panchayats, issuance of new planning and procurement
      guidelines , issuance of a government order to enhance transparency of Panchayat expenditure, granting Panchayats the independence
      to make payments without taking approval from the Taluk, increasing State block grant to GPs, development of a capacity building
      program on Panchayat duties and responsibilities, institutionalization of a fiscal information collection system on Panchayats and the
      completion of the enlistment of all taxable entities for property taxes in 123 Taluks out of 176.
      14
         New administrative leadership had taken charge at the time of the first supervision mission (November 2006). There was a change
      in leadership by the time of the next mission (June 2007) and again by December 2007.
      15
         The state government changed in 2006 and again following elections in 2008, with a brief interregnum when the state was under
      President’s rule.
      16
         On April 21, 2007, the Karnataka legislative council (upper house of the legislature) passed an amendment to the state Panchayati
      Raj Act, 1993, to take over the role of panchayats in selecting beneficiaries for development programmes at the village-level. "If the
      gram panchayat fails to prepare beneficiaries' list in respect of housing schemes or other programmes funded by the government, then
      a committee headed by the member of the legislative assembly (MLA) from the constituency shall select the beneficiaries…"

                                                                        8
      was disrupted and BG disbursements started slowing down. Some components on capacity
      building did not take off in the manner agreed upon with the Bank and the decision to conduct the
      baseline survey was postponed. This all contributed to a rating of ‘moderately unsatisfactory’ in
      the two ISRs of 2008. However, once the impact of the elections settled down the Project started
      showing positive changes, but the team continued with a MU rating given that the positive
      changes were fragile and had to be sustained for a longer period of time.

33.   At MTR, steps were taken to address some key implementation weaknesses that had crept
      into the Project. The MTR recommended that the operational focus of the Project for the
      remaining years should be on achieving the following institutional development results: (i) The
      effort to strengthen the GP financial management capacity should continue; (ii) the Project should
      build on enhanced grassroots participation and further improve the quality of the GP planning and
      execution process and the development impact of GP spending; (iii) the Project should initiate
      targeted capacity building interventions to develop GPs’ own revenue capacity; and (iv) the
      Project should significantly strengthen the management of the Decentralization Analysis Cell
      (DAC) and build its fiscal analysis and advocacy capacity. As a result the Project turned around
      significantly post Mid-Term Review.

34.   In addition, during MTR, the legal covenants governing the BGs were simplified to enhance
      their utilization. GPs initially had difficulty in interpreting and meeting the FM and accounting
      covenant 17 of the BG. This created bottlenecks in fund flow and utilization of BGs in the first
      two years of the Project implementation. The covenant was simplified and converted into
      quantifiable indicators 18 during the MTR in order to facilitate easy access and utilization of BGs
      by the Project GPs. Enforcing these conditions signaled to GPs the importance of financial
      management discipline which played an important role in facilitating smooth Project execution.

35.   On the ground the five year perspective plans were implemented in a large number of GPs
      and were seen as important in capturing local preferences at the GP. The perspective plans
      provided flexibility through the annual action plans for accommodating the evolving changes in
      local preferences. However, not all Project GPs made use of the annual action plans to make mid-
      course corrections. In addition, information Education & Communication (IEC) activities were
      carried out in the form of media outreach in 39 taluks. 19 GPs started disclosing information
      related to budget, tenders, revenue collection, work plans, audit compliance/findings to the public
      through Ward/Gram Sabhas, display of information in the GP offices and awareness posters. The
      disclosure in the Project GP’s was 98 percent.

36.   In 2010, the Project deliverables were reviewed and the focus shifted to the implementation
      of procurement tasks – construction of Taluk Resource Centers and the studios for Satellite
      Communication - that had slipped. Subsequently, most of these were completed by the time of
      Project closure and permanent infrastructure in the form of Taluk Resource Centers (172 centers)
      and SATCOM studios (five studios) were established.



      17
         GPs would receive annual block grants if they meet the following eligibility criteria: i) Having implemented GoK’s new FM and
      Accounting System; ii) Having implemented GoK’s new Planning Guidelines; iii) Having held regular Gram Sabhas with open
      participation; iv) Having publicly displayed FM and procurement information.
      18
         In agreement with GoK, the first covenant was elaborated as: a) The GP should have submitted UC for 70% of all cumulative
      installments; b) The GP Project accounts should have been audited for the FY 08-09; c) The GP accounts for all funds in FY 08-09
      should have been completed by the CA firm; d) The GP complies with internal audit findings, where applicable.
      19
         The Project initially focused on a media outreach program in 39 Taluks to inform residents about the project and enable them to
      track Project progress. In addition to the media campaign, residents were informed about the roles and responsibilities of GPs and
      service delivery performance at the village level through awareness campaigns such as kalajathas (street plays), short films, skits, etc.

                                                                         9
37.   During implementation, the demand from flagship programs like the Mahatma Gandhi
      National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) also stretched the training
      organization capacities, which itself was already undergoing change as a result of the
      project. The State Institute of Rural Development (ANSSIRD) was challenged by the need to
      design and deliver training programs for the GPs as indicated by the Project. This was stretched
      further with the advent of flagship programs. Demands on the ANSSIRD for providing training to
      functionaries involved in the national flagship program – MGNREGS – was immense.

38.   The DAC took some time in getting staffed and active, but took up a significant volume of
      work during the Project period. The DAC devised the formula for the block grants, developed
      concept notes, (for example, on how to make TRC sustainable, assisted in implementation of
      Panchatantra financial management software) and created the fiscal database information
      system. 20 The DAC also reviewed the baseline socio-economic data. The data compiled by DAC
      was expected to be used by other departments but this does not appear to have happened.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.   The KGSP Results Framework included a number of critical performance indicators to
      monitor progress towards the Project Development Objectives (PDO). Assessment of results
      at times was, however, difficult in the absence of timely and reliable baseline values for certain
      indicators prior to Project initiation; and by the fact that some indicators were not fully defined
      (as noted below in this ICRR). However, project team ensured that these data gaps were
      adequately addressed during Project implementation. A reliable database was established during
      the Project implementation which helped in regular and timely monitoring of results in the Project.
      This is one of the pioneer decentralization projects where an impact evaluation was envisioned
      and completed by Project closure.

40.   Annual submission of data related to progress in the Project by GPs and Taluk Panchayats
      (TP) was the key source of information which facilitated regular monitoring. The
      Decentralization Analysis Cell (DAC) established systems for monitoring of fiscal flows,
      collection of own revenues and service delivery performance, aggregating data collected at all
      three levels. Panchatantra was a key strength in the Project which enabled real time monitoring of
      progress at the GP level.

41.   The baseline survey for certain indicators was delayed to 2009 when the Project had
      completed almost three years of implementation. As a result of this, some of the baseline
      values were not representative of the initial conditions of the GPs at the start of Project
      implementation. Despite the difficulties in the timing of the surveys, the results from both
      baseline and end-line had important findings and recommendations.

42.   Preparation of detailed Aide Memoires 21 based on field visits were instrumental in
      appraising Project implementation progress. This facilitated corrective measures from time to
      time towards the achievement of PDOs within the stipulated timeframe. Systematic follow-up on
      results was possible through regular progress reports submitted by the PMU.

                                                                       10
Environment

43.      There was inadequate emphasis on environmental frameworks during the MTR. The
         implementation of the Environmental Management Framework (EMF) was weak in this Project
         due to lack of awareness among GP officials, inadequate training, mentoring and supervision by
         the Project. Over time and more recently the Project took steps20 to address this issue and four
         rounds of training on Environment OK cards 22 were held towards the end of Project. These
         efforts, however, needed to be sustained over a much longer period of time to institutionalize the
         environment safeguards as an integral part of the operational design. 23

Social

44.      The Project met most of the social safeguard measures elaborated in the PAD. This was
         made possible through the fiduciary framework which facilitated participation and inclusion of
         vulnerable and excluded groups in Gram Sabhas. The design of the perspective plans was
         inclusive enough to take care of the women and SC/ST population of the Project GPs.

Procurement

45.      Residents visited during the annual post procurement review expressed satisfaction with the
         transparency in procurement brought about by the tendering process under the Project.
         The improved procurement procedures resulted in creation of better quality assets at the GP level.
         The procurement of equipment for the SATCOM centres had been a major area of concern in the
         Project for several years. During the Tenth Implementation Support Mission a major
         breakthrough was achieved in finalizing the bidder for supply and installation of equipment’s in
         the SATCOM studio. Several annual Post Procurement Reviews highlighted that the majority of
         the contracts under the Project complied with the requirements elaborated in the PAD.

Financial Management

46.      Fiduciary risk was rated ‘high’. Mitigating measures were designed to address the risks
         mentioned in the PAD through a framework governing Block Grant approval, usage, accounting
         and assurances set out in the appraisal and captured in the legal covenants. In addition, the
         financial management framework for the Project was seen as supporting the overall development
         objectives of the Project.

47.      Fiduciary assurance mechanisms prior to MTR were limited to annual external audit of the
         GP block grant account (instead of the entire GP account), internal audit on a sample basis,
         and the Utilization Certificate. Timely and high-quality audit of the entire GP accounts was not
         emphasized. The GP eligibility criteria designed to give GPs incentive to adopt transparency and
         accountability practices were not enforced24. In the corrections post-MTR, an eligibility criterion
         for GPs to access BG was enforced and auditing of GP accounts taken up through Chartered
         Accountant firms.

            Mandatory checklist of adherence to environmental guidelines before commencement of construction works.
         23
            An environment review (2013) by the Bank found that the works carried out under KGSP did not have any negative environmental
         impacts; instead it highlighted that the assets created can have a positive impact in the community. Some key suggestions included: (a)
         annual planning in GPs must be preceded by a review of the works and assets created in the preceding years to assess the usage status
         and to gather learning; (b) screening tool and OK cards need to be more specific and simple; (c) more focused training program for
         engineers.

            MTR

                                                                           11
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

48.   The government’s commitment towards correcting regional imbalances through deepening
      decentralization is reflected in its request for the next phase of the Project. GoK has
      requested a second phase for the Gram Swaraj Project as an IBRD loan of US$ 220. The phase II
      emphasizes expanding the scale and coverage of KGSP by including an additional 1244 GPs from
      40 ‘more backward’ Taluks. However, the institutions and the capacity that was developed under
      the first loan will need to be sustained over a longer period of time including the second phase.

49.   The introduction of the improved financial management system needs to be sustained.
      Substantial support was provided by the Project on the roll out of Panchatantra. Fully sustaining
      may be a challenge, as skilled personnel are not available at the GPs. Appointment of suitably
      qualified personnel like trained Chartered Accountants, a dedicated and well-resourced cell on
      Panchatantra at the PMU and Taluk level are required on a continuous basis for providing
      guidance and support to the GPs.

50.   It would be recommended to strengthen Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) management and
      there is a need to fix tenures of officials and consultants to ensure stability in the Project.
      The tenure of the staff and consultants at the Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) could be fixed for
      effective implementation of the Project. In addition to insulating Project staff from frequent
      changes/transfers, the Project Director could be a high-level officer (at Secretary level, as per the
      PAD) and not someone with an additional charge of the Project. Also, there could be efforts to
      streamline the multi-layered process of obtaining internal clearances with regards to the Project.

51.   Monitoring systems at the sub-district level could be improved. Monitoring of progress in
      different projects suffers due to the span of coverage and inadequate personnel at the Taluks.
      GoK has suggested the formation of cluster-level cadre to assist the Taluks in M&E. Also, under
      the Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashakthikaran Yojana (RGPSA), additional personnel (mostly
      engineers) have been provided to reduce the work load of the Taluk personnel.

52.   A substantial number of assets were created during the Project and there would need to be
      an emphasis on their Operation and Maintenance (O&M). Sustainability of assets created
      need attention through appropriate O&M. More than 52,000 works have been created under
      KGSP which need to be sustained through a proper mechanism for maintenance as well as a
      strategy for prioritizing maintenance expenditure.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
    Rating: Substantial

Relevance of Objectives sub-rating: High

53.   The PDOs remain highly relevant to, and consistent with, Government of India’s and
      Government of Karnataka’s current development priorities. A recent report 25 from the GoI
      illustrates the central importance of the PRI system in India for ensuring more effective and
      efficient delivery of services, amongst other things. Similarly, GoK, through setting up of a


      25
           Expert Committee on ‘Leveraging Panchayats for Efficient delivery of Public Goods and Services’, GoI Report 2013

                                                                       12
      committee to amend its existing Panchayat Raj laws 26 has signaled, to a good degree, its
      continued prioritization for decentralization strengthening. In addition to this, GoI and GoK have
      formally accepted the centrality of local governments in delivering services in a range of
      significant flagship anti-poverty programs, such as MGNREGS, which emphasizes that the basic
      objectives of the Project retain a high relevance in this context.

54.   In spite of some shifts in GoK priorities during Project implementation, GoK has re-
      emphasized decentralization as a high priority, which is illustrated by the preparation of a
      substantial follow-on investment lending operation. The changes in political leadership (in
      2006 and 2008) and the accompanying changes in the executive led to some decline in
      prioritization of decentralization. However, even with changes in the government at the State
      level over the Project period, the Project continued to receive support from the State Government.
      More importantly, the GoK has more recently illustrated the high priority it accords to this type of
      project by requesting and preparing a follow-on decentralization project for US$ 220 million.
      The phase II of the project follows the same aspects of its predecessor with an expanded
      geographic coverage and stronger performance triggers. Moreover, KGSP’s focus on backward
      Taluks in the north eastern part of Karnataka and its emphasis on balanced regional development
      in Karnataka remains highly relevant, as illustrated by the fact that GoK wishes to continue its
      focus in the North and to focus on the more and most backward Taluks.

55.   The PDOs also remain highly relevant to the Bank’s current country partnership strategy,
      2013-2017. A number of points can be briefly highlighted. First, the CPS notes the critical
      importance of rural development in India where there is a high concentration of India’s poor; and
      KGSP focused on rural development. Second, the CPS recognizes that strong rural local bodies
      are critical in improving access to basic services, and that more progress needs to be made in
      empowering such bodies. Third, the CPS has a key pillar on ‘inclusion’. The decentralization
      agenda is highly relevant here, as decentralization strategies aim to encourage improved inclusion
      of local constituents in development processes, as well as inclusion of marginal groups within
      those constituents, which is illustrated through the range of reservations for excluded groups in
      the PRI system in India. This amounts to decentralization being an important element of the CPS’
      focus on shared prosperity.

Relevance of Project Design & Implementation Sub Rating: Substantial

56.   The Project design was largely consistent with the PDOs and targeted important areas for
      achieving the objectives. The design and implementation activities were relevant insofar as they
      drew on a range of important analytical, preparatory work (as described above). The block grant
      design model was also very relevant insofar as it attempted to address identified bottlenecks and
      constraints in the existing system. For instance, the grants targeted the lowest tier of elected rural
      local governments which were key areas in need of support, and the untied nature of the grants
      was intended to facilitate greater responsiveness to local demands and needs. The Project design
      was also highly relevant to the state’s agenda of balanced development, as the Project directed
      resources to the ‘most backward’ Taluks. Moreover, the Project design and implementation also
      supported targeted capacity and institution-building activities to strengthen planning and delivery
      mechanisms to complement the untied grants.




      26
         A committee has been set up by the GoK to examine necessary amendments to the State PRI Act which is expected to submit its
      report on October 2, 2014. These amendments are likely to deepen the decentralization process in Karnataka and strengthen capacity
      at the GP level.

                                                                     13
57.   There were, however, some aspects that could have been addressed to increase the relevance
      of the Project design and implementation. Although the blended (mix of programmatic and
      investment lending) design of the Project was a key strength; the limited capacity of the ‘most
      backward’ Taluks resulted in difficulties to respond to Project activities on a timely basis. In
      terms of implementation, the Project implementation was relevant and responsive to the
      achievement of the PDOs. For example, the Project responded to the requests from GoK to
      extend the closing date of the Project to utilize remaining funds and make further progress
      towards the PDOs. On the other hand, implementation relevance could have been increased in
      various ways. For example, components B, C and D were fully rolled out on a state-wide basis
      but their implementation was challenging given the scale and delays in execution of activities. In
      addition, the implementation relevance would have been increased had it found a way to adapt to
      the launch of the MGNREGS program, which diverted attention away from the capacity building
      activities and, to some degree, reduced the relevance of the block grants by pumping considerable
      resources, albeit tied, to the GP level.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
    Rating: Substantial

Attribution and Results Measurement

58.   In order to assess the extent to which the project achieved the PDO, the Project approach
      and results framework indicators were scrutinized. The Project Development Objective was
      ‘to improve the effectiveness of service delivery by Karnataka’s Gram Panchayats (village
      governments) particularly with respect to the management of public resources and the delivery of
      relevant services that the rural people prioritize’. The ICRR considers those results that can be
      reasonably attributed to the Project activities. 27 According to the PAD, it was expected that
      emphasis on Gram/Ward Sabha planning would result in improved capture of local needs and
      priorities. Also, it was expected that the provision of untied funds alongside capacity
      development would result in construction of assets and provision of services that address the
      above local needs and priorities. It was similarly expected that these activities at GP level would
      be strengthened and facilitated by state-level strengthening of devolution, capacity support and
      monitoring and evaluation. The results framework indicators were developed broadly in line with
      this thinking.

59.   It is judged that the PAD’s results indicators are, in spite of certain limitations, useful
      measures of progress towards the PDO and are the best available measures for this ICRR
      given data availability. As such, as per IEG guidelines, the below assessment is based on the
      official indicators and targets outlined in the PAD. However, a few RF indicators lacked clarity
      in the PAD and the supporting evidence is patchy in certain areas; in such cases the ICRR team
      has based its judgment on available borrower documentation, as flagged at relevant points below.
      Where necessary, the ICRR team has made clear its interpretation of the indicator, including in
      the footnotes, and has triangulated the available evidence to reach the best possible judgments.

Assessment of Achievement of PDOs by Indicator 28



      27
         It is difficult to directly attribute certain results to the Project, not least because of limitations in some of the available data.
      Nonetheless, those areas that can be reasonably attributed are considered, alongside those areas where the Project has been registered
      to make a notable contribution to results.
      28
         For a number of indicators the ICRR has used baseline information from 2006-07 from the KGSP MIS database to assess results. In
      areas, where the MIS database fell short, the team has used information from 2009 baseline survey.

                                                                        14
      PDO-Level Indicator: Rising number of Gram or Ward Sabhas with high and representative
      participation and relevant participatory plans reflecting community preferences of local
      population
      Target: 60% (increase against baseline)

60.   Achievement sub-rating: substantial. There was a 72% increase in the number of Gram and
      Ward Sabhas held, thus the target of a 60% increase was exceeded. 29 In addition to this, there
      was a 33% increase of women participants and a 21% increase in SC/ST household members
      between 2006-07 to 2011-12. 30 In spite of this exceeding the target, the rating is conservatively
      assigned as substantial because of the lack of definitional clarity on what is meant by ‘high and
      representative participation’. 31

      PDO-Level Indicator: Rising satisfaction of village residents with service delivery by Gram
      Panchayats
      Target: 60% (of surveyed residents felt their services are better in comparison to neighbouring
      GPs)

61.   Achievement sub-rating: modest. This indicator cannot be fully measured since there was no
      baseline defined at the time of PAD preparation and appraisal; the baseline was conducted in
      2009. The end-line survey found that 55% of respondents from Project GPs felt services were
      better in comparison to non-Project GPs against a 2009 baseline survey of 48%. Based on this
      available data, only modest progress in this area can be evidenced. The Project’s endline survey
      found that 90% of stakeholders thought that the quality of assets created under KGSP were worth
      the investment in comparison to other schemes such as BRGF and MNREGA. 32

      PDO-Level Indicator: Gradual increase in own source revenue and strong financial health of
      village governments.
      Target: INR 67 crore (USD 16 million)

62.   Achievement sub-rating: substantial. The end value achieved was INR 59 crore (USD 14
      million), so the target was not achieved but substantial progress (from a baseline of INR 25 crore,
      OSR more than doubled) was made. It is worth noting that OSR collection in Project GPs grew
      at an annual average growth rate of 22.69% as compared to the state average of 12.72% from
      2006-07 to 2012-13.




      29
         In other words, Gram Sabhas increased with an annual average growth rate of 12 percent and an overall increase of 72 percent
      during the Project period. The practice of convening Gram Sabha meetings to identify projects was more prevalent in Project GPs.
      The Participatory Rural Appraisal conducted as part of the End-line survey (2014) also found that, in almost all villages surveyed, the
      first time they held a ward sabha was under the KGSP Project. Ward Sabhas that were conducted for the first time ever in almost all
      the villages was under the KGSP Project.
      30
         However, the total attendance – of these groups – remains low at about 3-5 percent of the population enumerated.
      31
         The PAD does not clearly define and measure ‘high and representative participation’ or ‘relevant participatory plans reflecting
      community preferences of local population’. The available data in the borrower ICRR does, nonetheless, indicate representation
      across the range of groups, as well as increases in the number of people attending during the Project lifetime.
      32
         It can also be noted that focus group discussions conducted as part of another study in 20 Project GPs concluded that community
      members were satisfied with service delivery in GPs due to improved procurement practices and transparency measures. In sum, an
      impact evaluation notes that assets that were constructed under the Project were rated better (on dimensions of quality of design and
      construction) in Project GPs compared to non-Project GPs, both by engineers and in focus groups. Additionally, the end-line
      studies gave some insights into prioritization issues – the end-line evaluation documented the major problems reported by the
      stakeholders in order of priority as: water supply, roads, drainage, toilets/sanitation, electricity, health care, transport, housing and
      employment in that order. These four priorities received 70.75 percent of the investments made under the BG. In comparison, the
      other two partially untied schemes studied at end-line (NREGA and BRGF) invested 19 percent and 15 percent of their funding on
      these aspects.

                                                                        15
      Intermediate Indicator: Increased block grants to poor Panchayats equal to IDA disbursements
      based on formula
      Target: 100%

63.   Achievement sub-rating: high. The Project achieved 100% disbursement of IDA block grants 33
      by the end of the Project, which means that the target was fully achieved.34

      Intermediate Indicator: Panchayat budgets executed according to plans and procedures
      Target: 90%

64.   Achievement sub-rating: substantial. The target was exceeded, at 95%, by the end of the
      Project with budgets executed according to stipulated plans and procedures. However, it is
      deemed that progress was substantial, and not high, because the 5 year perspective planning was
      largely not updated for any mid-course corrections so plans were not able to capture changing
      constituent priorities. 35

      Intermediate Indicator: Timely releases equal to budgets and entitlement
      Target: 100%

65.   Achievement sub-rating: high. The target of 100% was met by the end of the Project.

      Intermediate Indicator: GP revenues, expenditures, and procurement decisions publicly disclosed
      in 90% of GPs
      Target: 90%

66.   Achievement sub-rating: substantial. The target was achieved as, by 2013-14, 1273 GPs (94%)
      regularly displayed information. However, the extent of the regularity of the disclosure and the
      detail and accuracy of the information is not measured by the indicator or the available end-line
      survey data, hence the sub-rating is judged to be substantial.

      Intermediate Indicator: Number of trained members and periodicity 36
      Target: 228,771 identified people trained 37




      33
         Compared to the statutory grant release of a fixed amount to each GP, the Project provided BG which was formula based and thus
      accounted for the size and nature of the population in the GP.
      34
         For informational purposes, although the basis for disbursement and the significance of the quantum appears to have had some
      problems in the initial stages, the disbursement of Block Grants was reported to have been as planned and timely. After the MTR, the
      disbursement of two annual installments was converted into a single annual installment. In the later stages of the Project, an
      additional sixth tranche of disbursements (due to availability of additional funds resulting from exchange rate fluctuations) was also
      achieved compared to the five annual tranches expected during the design
      35
         The apparent weakness was that citizen priorities were not accurately reflected in GP funding proposals, as the GPs were asked to
      stick to the five-year plans, prepared at the beginning of the Project. In terms of lesson learning, the five-year perspective plan
      limitations were: (i) variable quality; (ii) shortcomings in community participation processes of planning; (iii) strong orientation
      towards physical infrastructure and construction; and (iv) rigidity of guidelines that prevented adjustment of annual plans based on
      evolving needs and priorities of the community.
      36
         There is an inconsistency between the results framework and the table on arrangements for results monitoring in the PAD in terms
      of the capacity building component C and D. The table on arrangements for results monitoring does not provide any baseline or target
      values for intermediate outcome indicators on number of trained members and periodicity, TRCs and DAC. In order to overcome this,
      the ICRR team has consulted the range of official documentation and validated this through discussions with the range of stakeholders.
      37
         The end target was not specified in the PAD, therefore the conclusion has been reached and validated based on the borrower’s ICRR
      (as outlined in Annex 6). However, periodicity was not targeted or measured as per the documentation, even though it is mentioned in
      the indicator. Given that it is not targeted by either Bank or borrower documentation, the ICRR does not consider periodicity in its
      evaluation.

                                                                       16
67.   Achievement sub-rating: substantial. The target was not defined in the PAD but is present in
      the borrower ICRR. The Borrower’s ICRR indicates that 179,887 people were trained
      (representing 79% of the target), which can be judged as substantial progress towards the target.

      Intermediate Indicator: Taluk training centers
      Target: 176. 38

68.   Achievement sub-rating: substantial. The construction of Taluk resource (or training) centres
      (TRCs) was envisaged state-wide for all of the state’s 176 Taluks. 172 were constructed under the
      Project (98% of the target), which marks substantial progress.

      Intermediate Outcome Indicator: Fully staffed decentralization cell
      Target: Fully staffed decentralization cell.39

69.   Achievement sub-rating: modest. The Decentralization Analysis Cell (DAC) was established in
      the initial Project years. It was fully staffed in the initial years but in later years there was a high
      turnover of staff. By Project close the DAC was not, however, fully staffed with relatively thin
      staffing. As such, progress is judged to be modest. The DAC also fulfilled a substantial amount
      of functions over the Project life 39, though this is not captured in the formal target and hence not
      directly considered in the ICRR rating.

      Intermediate Outcome Indicator: Improved financial management system available in at least
      5000 GPs
      Target: 5000 GPs (state-wide).

70.   Achievement sub-rating: high. The target was fully achieved by the Project close as 5629 GPs
      (100%) had adopted the improved financial management system. The Project also contributed to
      the roll-out and uptake of financial management software, as described below. In addition, it was
      found that reportage of tendering process followed for procurement was higher in Project GPs
      and double-entry book-keeping systems were adopted more frequently in the Project GPs. 40

      Additional key progress areas and achievements

71.   While the analysis and ICRR rating – as per IEG guidelines – is largely based on the
      achievements related to the formal PAD indicators, other areas of Project activity and



      38
         The end target was not specified in the PAD, therefore the conclusion has been reached and validated based on the borrower’s ICRR
      (as outlined in Annex 6).
      39
         Despite some limited leadership and limited resourcing the DAC produced substantial good quality analytical reports – included
      budgetary outcomes in terms of spending and revenues raised budgetary balances and shortfalls, tax effort, and the match between
      budget projections and actual outcomes. This relied heavily on data produced by the fiscal information system which included
      Formula Evaluation, Monitoring of Compliance, Revenue Mobilization Analysis, Best Practices, Expenditure related assignments.
      40
         In order to provide information, the following points should be documented: the Project undertook various efforts to address the
      issues such as non-availability of budget estimates, absence of a mechanism to compile information on revenue collection,
      unsatisfactory bookkeeping at GP level, and absence of standards for accounting through introduction of improved financial
      management system in all 5629 GPs in the state. Required actions were assured to be taken up to create a panel of CA firms in
      consultation with KSAD to conduct special reviews in both Financial Management and Procurement at the GP level. The Project
      influenced GPs to make use of the services of Chartered Accountant for strong internal audit of Finances which include process audit
      which starts from the processing of Perspective plans prepared at Gram Panchayats including the tender process/shopping methods
      involved, work clearance order, work execution with photos at all three phase before, present and after, record maintenance, bill
      maintenance (Measurement Books), cash book entries. It is also worth noting that 91% of ‘Most Backward GPs’ covered under KGSP
      completed audits in time during Project period against the state average of 86%. [Empirical Impact Evaluation Study on Karnataka
      Panchayats Strengthening Project (Gram Swaraj), Centre for Management and Social Research (CMSR), March 2014].

                                                                      17
      Project contribution to progress are considered. These areas are briefly summarized in the
      following bullets:

  • The Project contributed to the roll-out of, and capacity building for, a financial management
    software – ‘Panchatantra’ 41 – to help GPs improve their financial management, although there is
    progress still to be made. The Project was instrumental in strengthening Panchatantra
    implementation by, among other things, providing one desktop computer and MS office software
    to each of the 5629 GPs in Karnataka. In addition, the Project, in coordination with ANSSIRD,
    supported the training of more than 10,000 staff of GPs on Panchatantra which accelerated its
    roll-out. 42
  • The Project facilitated improved access to basic services through its activities. In total, the
    Project enabled the construction of more than 25,000 roads, 8029 drainage lines, 1652 community
    toilets, 2947 drinking water facilities, 1537 Anganwadi Buildings and a number of other assets
    which were essential to address the infrastructural gaps in the communities.43
  • The Project contributed to increased overall awareness amongst people about the PRI system.
    According to the end-line survey, Project informational activities appear to have contributed to
    increased awareness of GP activities, revenue issues and the importance of operation and
    maintenance of assets. However, these informational activities were relatively limited in scope
    and reach.
  • The KGSP framework has arguably helped indirectly, to some degree, to facilitate the GP
    absorption and use of funds from other GoI flagship programs. While this has not been
    rigorously measured, anecdotal evidence suggests that the Project contributed to this by providing
    GPs with a strengthened system to facilitate better reporting, accounting, auditing and
    documentation.
  • There has been a documented improvement in some indicators reflecting broader institutional
    improvements, even if this cannot necessarily be directly attributed to the Project activities. End-
    line studies point to the improvement of indicators, including: (i) discussion of annual action
    plans in GP meetings; (ii) discussion of budgets in Gram Sabha; (iii) participation in Gram
    Sabha/Ward Sabha meetings; (iv) voting in GP elections; and, (v) access to GP Adhyaksha 44.
    However, these improvements are visible in Project and non-Project GPs and seem to indicate
    overall improvements state-wide. This would require further evaluation.

      Overall Rating for Achievement of the PDO

72.   It is judged that the achievement of the PDOs, according to the identified indicators, is
      substantial based on the achievement of target values by the closure of the Project. Table 2
      summarizes the achievements per indicator and aggregates these totals. The table illustrates that


      41
         Panchatantra is a web-based application introduced by GoK with support from National Informatics Centre (NIC) of GOI with an
      aim to reduce the manual tasks, increase the accuracy of financial statements and ensure transparency of Gram Panchayats in the state.
      Panchatantra is currently used by all 5629 GPs in the state. Panchatantra allows GPs to feed in their accounts, meeting proceedings,
      Gram/Ward Sabha details, Jamabandi / Social Audit etc. Further, through Panchatantra, all necessary information related to the GP is
      accessible to the public, which includes the budget information and expenditure status. GP members are allowed to track the status of
      their applications & grievances through the web based portal. Panchatantra enables real time monitoring of GPs by the Zilla Panchayat
      and Senior Officials at the state level through tracking of day to day financial transactions.
      42
         Training was provided to complete the full cycle of data entry for producing the necessary reports and citizen service through the
      Panchayat Enterprise Suite. The Project also provided support in the selection and deployment of Chartered Accountant services for
      the audit and handholding of GPs. The Project also supported e-governance initiatives for issuing certificates and licenses from the GP.
      The Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has undertaken e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (e-Panchayat MMP) with a view to
      introduce and strengthen e-Governance in Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) across the country and build associated capacities of the
      PRIs for effective adoption of the e-Governance initiative. Under this Project, Panchayat Enterprise Suite (PES) has been
      conceptualized which comprises 11 Core Common applications.

       27% of the targets were high, 55% were substantial and 18% were modest, with no targets having
       negligible results. In other words, 82% of the indicators were substantial or above. As a result of
       this analysis and the review of the overall relevant Project achievements, the efficacy rating is
       judged to be substantial.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

73.    While precise rates of return cannot be calculated for this type of project, the Project
       efficiency can be only broadly judged based on a qualitative analysis of available data. As
       stated in the PAD, it is not possible to estimate the rate of return associated with this investment,
       or to come to a conclusion about the magnitude of the flow of benefits over time. The difficulty
       in quantifying benefits is because many are very difficult to measure, in particular the efficiency
       gains that come with a decentralization program that involves the local population more directly
       in choosing the package of services that they “want.” Nonetheless, there were some substantial
       positives in terms of efficiency: (i) the disbursement of BGs was 100 percent and its utilization by
       the Project GPs was 95 percent of the total funds disbursed; and, (ii) as noted above a range of
       progress against the target indicators was registered as a result of the use of these funds.
       However, while bordering between modest and substantial, the efficiency is ultimately judged to
       be modest on the following grounds: (i) the difficulty in measuring economic rates of return in
       this type of project; (ii) the Project required three time extensions to complete the planned
       activities; and, (iii) some of the capital created by the Project, e.g. TRCs or SATCOM centres,

                                                                 19
      could not provide benefits within the Project due to their late construction, even if one might
      anticipate future benefits from these investments.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.   Based on the assessment of the Project’s relevance, efficacy and efficiency, the ICRR can
      justify an overall outcome rating of ‘moderately satisfactory’. The ICRR considered the
      relevance of objectives as ‘high’ and the relevance of design and implementation as ‘substantial’.
      The combined rating for relevance (objectives and design) is rounded downwards to ‘substantial’.
      The efficacy rating – achievement of PDOs – is considered as ‘substantial’ as the Project
      achieved most of the intended outcomes (see Table 1) as per the PAD indicators and contributed
      to other PDO-relevant areas of progress, even when controlling for data and attribution challenges
      and when considering that further progress could be made. Efficiency was considered as ‘modest’
      as explained in the previous section. Combining these ratings, as per IEG guidelines, led to a
      ‘moderately satisfactory’ rating. In short, it is judged that the Project, all points considered, had
      moderate shortcomings in the achievement of its pre-defined objectives, its relevance today and
      its efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

75.   The Project design did not explicitly aim at impacting poverty, gender and social
      development in its official indicators. However, the PDO aimed at improvement of the
      effectiveness of service delivery by GPs particularly with respect to the management of public
      resources and the delivery of relevant services that the rural people decide and prioritize. Also, it
      was found that, as noted above, there was a 32.7% increase of women participants and a 20.6%
      increase in SC/ST household members in Gram Sabhas of the Project GPs between 2006-07 to
      2011-12, which suggests some gains in respects to gender and social development although the
      impacts of their participation on GP prioritization and outcomes was not measured. There was no
      measurement of poverty reduction as a result of the Project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

76.   There are important lessons in the Government of Karnataka “Impact Evaluation Study”
      for future operations both within the state and for other Indian states. The study reiterated
      that the broader objective of the Gram Swaraj Project was to strengthen the Gram Panchayats.
      The block grants over the past six years have enhanced the capacity of the GPs in meeting the
      development needs and priorities; the funding was untied and reliable. The investments under the
      Project have created a model in local governance through its transparent (tender system),
      accountable and participatory processes. The assets built have raised the satisfaction levels of the

                                                       20
      local citizens with the Panchayats - in sectors where the KGSP invested - thus making GPs more
      responsible and responsive. The various awareness campaigns and other project initiatives have
      contributed to a large extent in making residents aware of the importance of Gram and Ward
      Sabhas. The soft component of the KGSP covered the entire Karnataka leading to the
      enhancement of the capacity of stakeholders not only in the 39 most backward Taluks but also of
      the rest of the State. The KGSP has also created permanent infrastructure in the form of
      Samarthya Soudhas (capacity-building centres/TRCs) and SATCOM sub-centres. See Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Substantial

77.   There are various reasons to be optimistic about the prospects of maintaining the Project’s
      development outcomes, in particular in the shorter term. The government and implementing
      agencies have shown general commitment towards the Project. During the course of the Project,
      various aspects of risk identified have been mitigated, to some degree, by measures that were
      institutionalized. For instance, the eligibility criteria for BG were modified and the
      institutionalization of the new financial management system has increased the likelihood of
      sustained gains in these areas. There are also reasons to judge that a number of the gains will be
      maintained and not reversed, especially as a number of post-operational steps have already been
      undertaken, namely through GoK’s commitment to a follow-on project (see Section 2.5).

78.   However, if some future remedial steps are not undertaken, there are some areas of risk
      over the medium term. Five main risks have been identified and assessed for their likelihood
      and potential impact:
 (i) There is a risk that the BG model, without some modification, may be less relevant if the total
       size of untied transfers is not comparable to the large amount of tied resources available via
       other schemes. As noted, the emergence of schemes – such as MGNREGS – has dwarfed the
       relative amount available via block grants, even if evaluations suggest that the BG model has
       retained its importance as gap-filler and provider of good quality assets. 45
 (ii) There is a risk that GP gains – in terms of their ability to deliver and maintain services – would
       not continue in the absence of continued and tailored capacity development support. Capacity
       building activities would need to be continued and strengthened to ensure continued progress.
 (iii) There is a risk that the occurrence and quality of Gram Sabhas could decline if the planning
       process for BGs, and other schemes, does not clearly incentivize continued participation. This
       means that strengthened interventions and attention would be needed to ensure that the planning
       processes are straightforward, responsive to bottom-up preferences and flexible enough to allow
       for the integration of changing preferences.
 (iv) There is a risk that more marginal groups would not sustain and increase their participation in
       the GS without top-down measures to ensure that weaker groups’ voices are fully heard. While
       excluded group participation increased during the Project lifetime, assessments in Karnataka
       point to how important it is that such groups are provided with capacity support and top-down
       facilitation to ensure they have a fair say over planning outcomes.46

79.   In overall terms, the risk is broadly judged to be substantial, although this level of risk
      could be notably reduced if remedial actions are taken. The rating recognizes that a number
      of the gains made under the intermediate indicators are likely to be maintained. However, there

      are certain risks, as noted above, which are substantial when one balances the likelihood of them
      materializing against their potential impact over the medium term. These risks could be mitigated
      to some degree with the effective design and implementation of a follow-on project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

80.   There were key strengths in ensuring quality at entry. The Project emerged from a long term
      engagement between the Bank and the Government of Karnataka, and the design was informed
      by robust analytical work and lesson learning. The objectives were and remain highly relevant to
      development priorities in Karnataka and India more broadly, as noted above. Furthermore, the
      operational design was arguably simple, realistic and flexible enough to integrate learnings early
      on during Project implementation. The combination of a programmatic approach towards block
      grants and a traditional investment lending for capacity building balanced the creation of assets
      with institutional strengthening, the facilitation of more participatory planning and the creation of
      demand for adequate capacity at the taluk level in the form of TRCs and communication facilities.
      In addition, the BG eligibility criteria and fiduciary framework was relatively well designed, and
      the risk management framework was relatively robust delineating the risk management measures
      for each component. The Project design also envisaged a strong evaluation strategy and end-of-
      project survey, though there were some flaws in its implementation as flagged in this report.
      Overall, this broad design – in spite of course corrections (described in the next paragraph) –
      proved to be largely appropriate which is also evidenced by the final project results.

81.   However, there were design limitations, particularly regarding disbursement procedures
      for block grants and missing baselines in the result framework. The initial Project design
      proved somewhat ambitious for a first-generation project given the existing levels of capacity at
      the GP level. In particular, the disbursement procedures for the block grants required adjustments.
      Similarly, baselines were not determined for all results indicators at the beginning of the Project
      in 2006, which could be judged as a major design flaw. Given that these design limitations
      adversely affected the initial years of the project, it is judged that, overall, Bank performance for
      quality at entry is ‘moderately unsatisfactory’.

(b) Quality of Supervision
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.   The quality of supervision is rated ‘moderately satisfactory’ reflecting the successful efforts
      to concertedly address initial implementation challenges and ensure achievement of Project
      objectives. Overall, the Project was closely supervised despite two changes in task team
      leadership. Documentation and field support was, overall, strong. Eleven supervision missions
      were conducted over seven years with intensifying efforts following the mid-term review (MTR).
      The initial implementation challenges were properly identified during supervision missions, as
      reflected by the temporary ‘moderately unsatisfactory’ ratings of the Project and identification of
      the problems in the ISRs. Corrective actions were subsequently taken to improve implementation,
      for instance by adjusting the disbursement procedures for the block grants.

83.   The project was restructured three times, demonstrating the Bank’s proactivity to respond
      to client demand and adjust to unforeseen developments such as the allocation of the

                                                       22
       additional foreign exchange gains. However, stronger measures could have been taken to revise
       and strengthen the initial results framework and related Project monitoring and evaluation
       arrangements at an earlier stage of implementation. Nonetheless, with the active and visible
       implementation support, particularly in the final years, the Project was fully disbursed and
       achieved visible results on most PDO indicators. The Bank team also supported the impact
       evaluation with an end-of-project survey, which helped provide pointers for a possible future
       intervention. Overall, the quality of Bank supervision is therefore considered “moderately
       satisfactory”.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.    This rating of ‘moderately satisfactory’ is based on combining the rating from (a) and (b)
       above, as per ICRR guidelines. 47 Overall, this recognizes the design flaws in the project, but
       balances this with the design strengths and the relatively responsive supervision; all of which
       made a contribution to full disbursement and the achievement of project results (as outlined in
       section 3).

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.    Government performance is rated as ‘moderately satisfactory’, which balances the
       challenges experienced in Project management during the initial years with the strong
       performance after the MTR. During the initial years of the Project, Government performance
       was affected by changes in the political leadership of the state which temporarily reduced the
       attention accorded to decentralization and the Project relative to other priorities. However, despite
       these changes, basic Government support to the Project was maintained during the earlier years,
       and this was reinforced in the later years of the Project. With close monitoring by senior officials
       in the Government, the credit could be closed successfully with all major Project activities being
       completed, a number of results achieved and almost 100 percent disbursement. The Government
       has reiterated its strong commitment to the decentralization approach with its request for a new
       loan from the Bank.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86.    The performance of the implementing agency is also rated ‘moderately satisfactory’
       reflecting implementation challenges in the early years that were subsequently effectively
       addressed. The implementing agency (the Project Facilitation Cell/Project Management Unit)



       47
         As IEG guidance stipulates, ‘when the rating for one dimension is in the satisfactory range (Moderately Satisfactory or better) while
       the rating for the other dimension is in the unsatisfactory range, the rating for overall Bank Performance normally depends on the
       Outcome rating. Thus, overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory IF Outcome is rated in the satisfactory range or
       Moderately Unsatisfactory IF Outcome is rated in the unsatisfactory range, except when Bank performance did not significantly affect
       the particular outcome’. It is therefore judged that a combined MS rating is correct in this instance.



                                                                        23
      was under the purview of the State Government itself. Its performance is therefore examined in a
      similar context to the performance of the Government. Frequent turnovers in Project leadership
      affected Project performance over the initial 2-3 years resulting in delays in implementation.
      However, the performance improved considerably thereafter. The MTR noted that a new team
      had ‘energetically taken up the task of improving Project performance’. By the time of credit
      closing (March 2014), the performance of the implementing agency, which allowed the
      completion of Project activities and full disbursement, was recognized by the last Bank mission. 48
      The overall rating of Implementing Agencies’ performance is therefore assessed as ‘moderately
      satisfactory.’

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.   The overall Borrower performance is rated ‘moderately satisfactory’ based on the
      combination of Government performance and Implementing Agencies’ performance
      throughout the Project. As outlined above, both the Government and the Implementing
      Agencies experienced implementation challenges in the initial years of Project implementation
      which were subsequently addressed through strong commitment especially following the MTR.
      In the end, the Project showed visible results and disbursed fully, due in large part to the actions
      of the government and implementing agency.

6. Lessons Learned

88.   Strong, top-down state commitment and action is critical to the success of decentralization
      and this “block grants plus capacity building” approach. The variation of support to the
      Project due to changes in the political and executive machinery had an impact on Project
      performance at specific junctures. This underlines the need to fully understand the political
      economy of decentralization and to find measures to mitigate such risks. It also underlines the
      importance of ensuring a strong policy framework and enabling environment for decentralization
      in parallel to bottom-up and local strengthening. The DAC was one important step in this regard,
      although it would require further strengthening in order to ensure greater influence on the
      thinking of the state on such matters. Similar lessons, regarding the critical importance of top-
      down state support for decentralization, have been learnt in other states in India and in
      international experience.

89.   The approach of discretionary block grants complemented by capacity building has proved
      its potential, even if it may require modification to continue having strong impacts. It has
      contributed to the improved management and citizen-centered prioritization of resource allocation
      at the GP level. The KGSP was one of the Bank’s first local government strengthening projects
      that shifted away from sectoral projects on the one hand, and from community-driven
      development projects, on the other. However, given the risk that BGs may be dwarfed by other
      existing schemes in India, the BG model may need to be modified so that it serves as a more
      direct vehicle and incentive for convergence with existing schemes; so that it continues to add



      48
         To utilize the additional amount that had accrued to the Project due to exchange rate fluctuation, the Project proposed the
      procurement of 5629 computers for all GPs of the state. As the total estimated cost of 5629 computers with peripherals was more than
      USD 2 million, it was decided to opt for International Competitive Bidding. In spite of capacity constraints of the client to handle such
      a large procurement process, the client took this as a challenge and successfully managed to award the bid in a record time of 20 days.



                                                                         24
      value by filling critical gaps and contributing to broader development outcomes; and, so that it
      continues to catalyze critical institutional change.

90.   It is critical that the M&E and management information system of decentralization projects
      are more robust and well thought through, even if this is challenging for this type of project.
      This lesson has a number of key interrelated points. First, a robust baseline and impact evaluation
      framework would be required. The absence of a baseline in certain areas during the initial stages
      of the Project posed challenges for measuring progress. Second, the key PDO and intermediate
      indicators would need significant thought to ensure that they are capturing the most important
      elements of resource management, service delivery, participation and inclusion, as some
      indicators were too vague in the Project.49 Third, in future projects it would be important to adopt
      PDO indicators that are further down the results chain, in order to consider impacts, where
      feasible, on service delivery, social and human development outcomes. Finally, a flexible and
      responsive management information system, to regularly track results on the ground and facilitate
      course corrections, was lacking in this Project and could be adopted in future projects. 50

91.   It is important to have a performance assessment system that has good enough standards of
      accountability but that is also realistically tailored to the existing capacities of GPs in the
      ‘backward’ areas. KGSP established performance indicators for measuring the annual
      performance of the ‘Most Backward GPs’ covered under the Project. However during the initial
      stages of the Project most of the GPs lacked the necessary capacities to adhere to the standards, in
      addition to limited skills to compile relevant information, which hindered uptake. Therefore,
      future projects should have a simple system driven by certain Minimum Mandatory Conditions
      and intermediate indicators which are dynamic in line with the improving capacities of the GPs.
      On the other hand, such performance standards would need to be demanding enough to provide
      incentives for institutional transformation and would need to ensure process monitoring to
      confirm that such standards are being implemented throughout. 51 This could be approached by
      using base-level grants – which require minimum conditions – and an additional performance
      grant that is added when certain standards and outcomes are achieved.

92.   Capacity building efforts would need to be better tailored and more appropriately targeted
      and rolled out if the full potential of the block grant system is to be realized. There is a risk
      that GP gains – in terms of their ability to deliver and maintain services – would not be sustained
      in the absence of continued and tailored capacity development support. In addition, such support
      could be better targeted and tailored so that a range of groups beyond GP functionaries – such as
      community based organizations, facilitators, excluded groups and elected representatives 52 – also
      receive appropriate forms of capacity strengthening. It would be helpful if a strong capacity
      needs and gaps assessment was carried out prior to developing subsequent capacity development
      plans. The capacity strengthening could be dynamic and field-based to increase the chances of its
      application in real-life circumstances. The Project also illustrated the large, and often unmet,


      49
         During the course of the Project, there was limited capture of information at the GP level on the extent and quality of participation
      (attendance levels, inclusion of women, vulnerable groups, etc.) and also the causal chain to good planning and budgeting practice.
      50
         Strengthening M&E systems also points to a need to review the Project management and delivery structures to ensure better
      responsiveness and monitoring. In KGSP, there was no direct field presence of the Project team in the districts. Disbursement to GPs
      and monitoring had to be managed centrally from the Project Facilitation Cell. While the staffing of TRC assisted in this, it also
      diverted them from their core task of capacity building to a monitoring role.
      51
         This could be achieved for instance by developing, from the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, and periodic Government Orders, a set
      of simply measurable indicators that are tracked regularly. A composite index can be devised thereon – this can help determine a base
      level grant, and further, an additional performance component as top-up for better performers on the State’s own parameters. Over the
      years, the threshold could be very gradually raised. This approach could hard-wire monitoring and evaluation to some of the core
      decentralization indicators, apart from serving the need for Project management.

      demand for ‘just-in-time’ technical support, handholding and trouble-shooting to GPs and other
      stakeholders to carry out their functions. 53 These issues could be addressed in the planned
      follow-up project.

93.   It is important to ensure that the GP plans and their implementation sufficiently reflect
      changing constituent preferences and the interests of the more excluded groups. This could
      be achieved through a number of measures, including the following: ensuring that the planning
      process is periodically updated to reflect changing preferences; providing top-down support,
      facilitation and monitoring to ensure that the plans are sufficiently representative and
      participatory; and, providing targeted capacity support to typically marginalized groups. In a
      number of cases, it has been found that if such a planning process is not robust and inclusive, the
      incentives for people to participate in the Gram Sabha are likely to decline over time.

94.   Improved information and education campaigns could contribute to the strengthening of
      the GP planning, resource management and delivery. The Project made some gains in
      improving levels of awareness, but it might have gone further. A more extensive and multi-
      channel information campaign – to inform actors of their duties and entitlements – could
      potentially change behaviors and improve the usage and implementation of the BGs.

        The Project experience suggests that it is necessary to provide continuous training and trouble-shooting for the relatively novice
      local government functionaries in their participatory planning exercises, prioritization of their schemes, in the procurement process,
      and in maintaining quality during scheme implementation. Under the KGSP such handholding seemed to be limited, and a follow up
      project should support more regular technical support and training, cascading from the district through the Taluks to the GP-level. This
      points to two considerations for future: (1) the strategy for delivering capacity support needs to be dependent on more than a singular
      channel; and, (2) should be designed to respond more swiftly to day-to-day demands and needs. This also means that a mix of public,
      private and non-governmental institutions could be deployed to provide different types of support.

A. GOVERNMENT OF KARNATAKA’s EMPIRICAL IMPACT EVALUATION STUDY ON
KARNATAKA GRAM SWARAJ PROJECT, MARCH 2014 58

Executive Summary

THE CONTEXT
Karnataka occupies a unique position in the country with respect to democratic decentralization. The
State has an enviable track record of devolution of powers to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) as
envisioned by the Constitution of India. Local governance in the State has taken off, propelled by
regular elections and steady headway made by the Gram Panchayats (GPs) towards delivering basic
services to citizens. Despite the rapid strides, the local administration is still constrained by insufficient
resources to address the growing demands for more and better services.
In order to make GPs stronger and more vibrant and viable institutions of local self-governance, a
critical policy imperative is to provide them with additional resources and also encourage them to raise
resources that are commensurate with their requirements and enhance their capacity to utilize the
resources. Resources utilized towards services that are prioritized locally would lead to greater
satisfaction among the local population.
THE ENDLINE EVALUATION
This end-of-project study evaluates the KGSP Project interventions. The Project conducted a baseline
survey in 2009. This end line survey follows the same methodology as the baseline in terms of sample
locations and respondent categories. The baseline was conducted in 100 GPs consisting of 50 treatment
or Project GPs and 50 control or non-Project GPs. The sample GPs represent 19 districts and 68 Taluks
(38 Treatment and 33 Control).

The end line evaluation comprises five components: (1) Household survey (2) GP Member Survey (3)
GP Secretary Survey (4) GP assets survey (5) PRA (Participatory Rural Appraisal). The assets survey is
exclusive to the final evaluation as such a survey was not conducted in the baseline (the table below
summarises the sampling design).
HIGHER INVESTMENTS BY GPs TO IMPROVE SOCIAL INDICATORS
•    The untied block grants have improved the investment capacity of the Project GPs. The funding
     has been provided for the past seven years - from 2006-07 to 2012-13. During the Project period
     each treatment GP received an annual average funding ranging from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 9 lakh.
•    The block grants constituted some 9% of the total annual GP finances during the Project period.
     The proportion is substantial given that the funds are untied and reliable.
•    The overall GP budget in general has risen over the years across the treatment and the control
     GPs. Increasing own-source revenue and scheme-based funding are crucial contributory factors in
     this respect.
•    The mean annual budgetary levels have increased from around Rs 20 lakh in 2006-07 to more
     than Rs 70 lakh in 2012-13. The upward trajectory of treatment GPs during the KGSP period is
     accounted for largely by the block grants and internal revenue.
•    The KGSP is distinctive as its funding being discretionary and the total grants have been invested
     in assets and services that enhance human development; in relative terms, the Project invested the
     highest proportion of funding in meeting community priorities – making it stand out from similar
     schemes such as NREGA and BRGF whose primary objectives are different.
GRADUAL INCREASE IN OWN-SOURCE REVENUE (OSR) OF GPs
•    The own-source revenue (OSR) has been on the rise across the intervention and the non-
     intervention GPs. But the OSR of Project GPs has grown faster during the Project period. Mean
     revenues of Project GPs from OSR has raised from Rs 2.40 lakh to Rs 3.78; corresponding
     figures for control GPs are: Rs 1.62 lakh and Rs 3.54 respectively.
•    Household survey covered two important sources: property tax and water tax covering two
     reference periods: (1) taxes paid in the past 12 months (2) taxes paid in the 12 months before the
     last GP elections. In the previous financial year, the proportion of households paying house tax in
     the Project GPs is higher than that of the control GPs. Similarly the percentage of households
     paying water charges has also raised in the Project GPs to a level that is higher than that of the
     control GPs.
•    During the other reference period too, treatment GPs had done better regarding both house tax
     and water charges: in the end line the Project GPs have outperformed their control counterparts
     by 7% with respect to property tax. When it comes to water charges as well, in the end line, the
     proportion of water tax-paying households in treatment GPs is higher by 5%.
•    In treatment group around three-fourths of GP Members participate in tax collection whereas the
     corresponding figure for the control GPs is less than two-thirds.
•    Findings from the GP Secretary component evidence that a higher proportion of treatment
     Secretaries reported in favour of indicators such as: extent of collection of taxes; participation of
     ward members in tax collection; share or importance of own-source revenue; and levels of annual
     budget handled by GPs.
•    FGDs (Focus Group Discussions) with stakeholders reveal that the tax compliance is better in


                                                      36
    treatment GPs on account of the efforts on the part of GP officials and Members in motivating
    citizens; training interventions have improved their awareness levels in this regard. The quality
    assets built under the Project over the past 6-7 years reflecting people’s preferences have also
    made a difference.
•   Secondary data reveals that during the Project period the OSR collection of Project GPs - as a
    proportion of the current demand - had entered a higher trajectory indicating an improved
    performance. Regarding per capita OSR, around the launch of the Gram Swaraj Project, the per
    capita revenue of treatment and control GPs hovered around the same level (Rs 25). From 2007-
    08 – after the launch of the KGSP – the per capita fiscal performance of the Project GPs entered a
    higher trajectory.

PARTICIPATORY PLANS REFLECTING COMMUNITY PREFERENCES
•    The Project GPs prepared action plans for the Gram Swaraj works through participatory
    processes. The finalisation of action plans was preceded by Ward Sabhas to identify works at that
    level. Stakeholder surveys collected evidence with regard to the main problems faced by the
    community; this is used to ascertain whether the perspective plans reflect the people’s preferences.
    Problems reported by stakeholders in order of priority are: (1) Water (2) Roads (3) Drainages
    (4) Toilets and Sanitation (5) Electricity (6) Health Care (7) Transport (8) Housing.
•   Perspective plans, in large measure, contain the community priorities. This is also reflected in the
    investments made in the infrastructure. The bulk of the block grants (71%) have been invested in
    assets that address the top four problems stated above; the corresponding proportions of similar
    schemes are much lower – NREGA (19%) and BRGF (15%). Water sector, however, should have
    received better attention under the KGSP.
•   But the community has welcomed every asset built in their village. The stakeholders found every
    asset useful and reported that the assets meet their needs and priorities. Given the huge gap that
    exists between supply and demand every asset/service is considered as a vital addition.
•   Water supply systems have been built under the KGSP in all GPs. But water remains a high
    priority. The following points emerge from FGDs with stakeholders: (1) In addition to water the
    community also identified other needs and priorities. The Project was expected to meet their
    needs in all important sectors. (2) If the Project had focused only on water supply it would have
    become a water supply scheme (3) A typical GP consists of at least 5-6 villages. The Project had
    to spread the investments across the constituent villages to achieve equity. This would not have
    been possible if the Project had focused only on one or two sectors.
•   Given the number of villages in a GP the Project GPs had to balance the competing priorities and
    demands (5) Water is a chronic problem with geographical, social, environmental and public
    policy causes as well as implications. (6) There are other schemes or projects that exclusively
    focus on water supply.
•   A comparison of problem ranking by stakeholders between the baseline and the end line shows
    that certain sectors witnessed visible improvements while others remain under-addressed. The
    sectors that have seen greater improvements are: (1) Roads (2) Sanitation (3) Electricity (4)
    Housing. The areas that need better policy attention are: (1) Water (2) Schools and Anganwadis
    (3) Drainages (4) Streetlights. The extent of inclusion of community priorities in an action plan
    also hinges on how representative the Gram Sabhas and Ward Sabhas are in terms of both the
    level of attendance and social composition of the participants.
INCREASED NUMBER OF ASSETS BUILT IN THE GP
•   There has been a visible increase in the number of assets built across the treatment and the control

                                                    37
    GPs. In the treatment GPs, the Gram Swaraj Project has made a visible impact in the number of
    assets built over the past 7 years (from 2006-07 to 2012-13).The number of assets built by a
    typical GP in a year with block grants ranges from TWO to as many as SIXTEEN. The average
    number of assets built per year falls in 3-to-11 range.

•   The KGSP also ensured both spatial and social distribution by spreading the assets most equitably
    ensuring quality through an open tender system. The range of assets reflects the level of
    fulfilment of local needs covering almost all social sectors. The assets include:
    (1) CC roads (2) BT roads (3) Formation or kutcha or metalled roads (4) Water tank/cistern (mini
    water supply system) (5) Boundary walls, usually with gates, around structures such as schools,
    GP buildings, health centres and anganwadis (6) Street lighting/solar lamps (7) Roadside
    drains/sewers (8) Water taps/pipeline (9) Dhobi ghats (10) Bus shelters (11) Bore wells (12)
    Additional room(s) or extensions (13) New buildings (such as GP offices, anganwadis, libraries,
    veterinary hospital and school kitchens) (14) Community toilets (15) Community halls (16)
    Culverts and bridges (other cross-drainage systems) (17) Repairs/renovations to existing
    buildings (18) Stone slabbing of roads (19) Check dams (20) Shops (to be managed by GP).
INCREASED QUALITY OF ASSETS BUILT IN THE GPs
•   The quality of assets built under the KGSP is much superior - compared to that of the
    infrastructure created under two comparable schemes - the Backward Regions Grant Fund
    (BRGF) and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act/Scheme (NREGA).
•   Quality was assessed by stakeholders or asset users as well as by engineers. With respect to the
    stakeholder assessments, the proportion of users who reported that the quality of KGSP assets
    was “good” is 72%, as against 31% and 51% for BRGF and NREGA assets respectively.
•   The quality assessment by engineers also proves that the quality of Gram Swaraj assets has been
    the best. The proportion of the select assets rated “good” by engineers is highest under the Gram
    Swaraj.
•   The evaluation carried out regressions to find out the drivers of quality. The results show that the
    processes followed by the Project GPs in the execution of civil works determines the quality to a
    large extent; these factors are: (1) Number of tenders (2) Time taken to build the asset (3) Double
    entry book keeping (4) Asset identification through Gram Sabha (5) Year of asset creation (6)
    Level of investment. However, the exact combination of the above stated independent variables
    varies according to the quality assessor (stakeholder or engineer) and the type of asset (say CC
    road or drains) in question.
•   Tests of significance were carried out separately for CC roads (leading common asset) and all
    assets combined. Results show that the better quality of KGSP assets, in general, are statistically
    significant @ 90% level.
RISING SATISFACTION OF CITIZENS WITH SERVICE DELIVERY BY GPs
•   The infrastructure created under the KGSP has in general had a positive impact on some key
    facilities and services in the Project GPs. The three stakeholder components of the evaluation
    asked the respondents as to how does a given facility in their village compare with that of
    neighbouring villages. The respondents were expected to rate the quality of the facility or service
    in terms of: BETTER, SAME and WORSE. Seven such services or facilities were selected for
    ascertaining the perceptions of the above stakeholders: (1) Roads (2) Streetlights (3) Anganwadi
    (4) Health Centre or PHC (5) Primary School (6) Drinking Water (7) Drainages.
•   The results regarding the perception BETTER show a mixed picture. As far as the household
    level responses on roads in the end line are concerned, the proportion of households reporting

                                                    38
    BETTER is higher in the treatment GPs by almost 9%. Even with respect to drainages the
    satisfaction levels (BETTER cases) among the Project GPs are higher. The broad trend with
    respect to these two facilities reflects the impact made by the KGSP Project through its
    investments in infrastructure.
•   Regarding the other services the pattern in the end line is mixed with both Project and non-Project
    GPs showing more or less same satisfaction levels with respect to streetlights and drinking water;
    and the BETTER proportions are marginally higher among the control GPs regarding the other
    services. But the baseline status also exhibits a mixed picture in that the satisfaction levels were
    already marginally higher in the control group when it comes to the facilities of roads,
    streetlights, anganwadi, health care and primary school.
•   Difference-in-Differences (DoD) models were run on the household satisfaction levels with the
    above stated set of facilities. The levels of difference arrived at were found to be statistically
    significant with respect to roads and drainages.
•   Despite the mixed results it can be inferred in broad terms that the stakeholders in the Project GPs
    are happy with the visible improvements that they experience in areas where the bulk of the
    KGSP investments were made, that is, roads, drainages, anganwadis, sanitation and schools. The
    impact has not reached the same level in other sectors due to their thin distribution.
•   Evaluation of this indicator had encountered certain methodological limitations since it was
    difficult to ascertain whether the respondents were comparing a given service with that of a
    treatment GP/village or a control GP/village. Moreover, in addition to GPs the respondents
    reported other agencies or departments as responsible for providing a given service.
GRAM AND WARD SABHAS WITH HIGH AND REPRESENTATIVE PARTICIPATION
•   Responses of stakeholder groups were elicited regarding this indicator. The awareness levels
    about Gram Sabha and Ward Sabha have improved since the baseline across treatment and
    control GPs; but there are no major differences between the intervention and the non-intervention
    GPs.
•   Another question was on whether they ever attended a Gram Sabha or Ward Sabha. The
    participation levels have witnessed considerable improvements since the baseline in both
    treatment and control GPs: from 55% to 84% in Gram Sabha and from 56% to 74% in Ward
    Sabha. However, there are no big variations in the attendance levels between treatment and
    control situations.
•   Regarding the number of Gram Sabhas and Ward Sabhas attended, the frequencies covered are
    one, two and more than two. There are no significant variations in the proportions of households
    that attended Gram Sabhas and Ward Sabhas covering the three frequencies.
•   Findings of the end line survey with respect to Gram Sabha and Ward Sabha participation levels
    by gender and caste categories (SC, ST, OBC and General) show that there are no perceptible
    variations between male and female participation levels between the treatment and control
    groups. Similarly, the end line findings do not show big variations between the participation
    levels by the four social categories between the Project and non-Project GPs. On the other hand,
    baseline data throws up highly mixed results.
•   In order to evaluate the real impact (in view of mixed results between baseline and end line)
    Difference-in-Differences (DID) models have been used. The differences in Gram Sabha and
    Ward Sabha participation levels are not significant, statistically speaking - indicating that the
    impact had not reached the levels that would have been quantitatively visible and significant.
•   Secondary data on the number of Gram Sabhas, Ward Sabhas and GBMs conducted by GPs show

                                                    39
    that in 2012-13 both treatment and control GPs conducted broadly the same number of Gram
    Sabhas while the treatment GPs fare marginally better with respect to the number of Ward
    Sabhas. It seems that in 2013-14 the treatment GPs began improving their performance regarding
    Gram Sabhas while continuing their lead with respect to Ward Sabhas. Overall 2013-14
    represents a minor shift in favour of Project GPs. However, data for at least for five years would
    allow one to draw reliable inferences in this regard.
•   The household survey does not seem to have fully captured the impact on this front due to certain
    methodological limitations: (1) relatively small household sample (2) the baseline was conducted
    after the Project had taken off (3) barring some special interventions, the capacity-building
    component in general was common to both treatment and control GPs (4) A considerable
    proportion of respondents in the end line are different from those of the baseline.
FINDING OF PRA (PARTICIPATORY RURAL APPRAISAL)
•   The broad trend across the sample GPs is that the frequency of Ward Sabhas is not in line with
    the mandate of the Panchayati Raj Acts and other policies and guidelines; hence the track record
    on this front is uneven. By contrast the Gram Sabha is increasingly playing a vital role in local
    governance.
•   Through its soft components the KGSP aimed at ensuring higher and more representative
    participation in Gram Sabhas and Ward Sabhas. This was done under the stakeholder capacity
    building strategy. The PRA reveals that for the first time Ward Sabhas were conducted in almost
    all the villages under the Gram Swaraj Project. As a result the awareness levels about the
    relevance and effectiveness of the Ward Sabha increased leading to improved participation.
•   Participation levels at Gram Sabhas were higher compared to such previous meetings. The GP
    functionaries and community members who underwent training played a vital role in ensuring
    high and representative participation at Gram Sabhas.
•   The frequency of Ward Sabhas has increased in the treatment GPs in general during the Project
    period. This in turn had influenced GP functionaries to meet the expectations by conducting more
    Ward Sabhas. In general the KGSP impact on Ward Sabha and Gram Sabha participation is
    relatively higher in GPs where the GP representatives and officials are proactive.
•   In treatment GPs both Ward Sabhas and Gram Sabhas have been conducted with earnestness and
    commitment. Stakeholder consultations reveal that people’s participation has improved on
    account of the following processes: (1) The block grants constitute the largest source of untied
    funding (2) People’s needs and priorities have been addressed through block grants (3) Regular
    monitoring and review of the Project implementation.
HOW THE PANCHAYATS HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED
    The broader objective of the Gram Swaraj Project was to strengthen the Gram Panchayats. The
    following impacts of the Project interventions have contributed to the strengthening of GPs:
•   The block grants over the past six years have enhanced the capacity of the GPs in meeting the
    development needs and priorities; the funding was untied and reliable. The investments under the
    Project have created a model in local governance through its transparent (tender system),
    accountable and participatory processes.
•   The assets built have raised the satisfaction levels of the local citizens with the Panchayats - in
    sectors where the KGSP invested - thus making GPs more responsible and responsive. The
    training and other capacity-building initiatives have made local stakeholders aware of their roles
    and responsibilities. Interventions such as double-entry book keeping, auditing and Panchatantra
    have made governance more efficient and transparent. The Project interventions have facilitated

                                                    40
    higher tax compliance.
•   Thanks to the Project initiatives a large proportion of local citizens have been made aware of the
    importance of Ward Sabha and Gram Sabha. As a cumulative impact of the Project interventions,
    participation levels in Gram Sabha and Ward Sabha have marginally improved.
•   The investments in assets that meet community preferences to a great extent have had both direct
    and indirect impacts on social indicators. The Project has raised the expectations of the
    community making GP functionaries more responsive and responsible.
•   The spread of the assets built under the KGSP has been equitable – in both social and spatial
    terms.
•   The soft component of the KGSP covered the entire Karnataka leading to the enhancement of the
    capacity of stakeholders not only in the 39 most backward Taluks but also of the rest of the State.
    The KGSP has also created permanent infrastructure in the form of Samarthya Soudha’s
    (capacity-building centres) and SATCOM Sub-Centres.
COMPLEMENTARY FINDINGS
•   The KGSP has been implemented in a more responsible and transparent manner; two factors are
    relevant here: the hard component (block grants) and the complementary soft component
    (capacity building). Monitoring by the State Government and other stakeholders also helped.
•   The untied nature of block grants had made the Project more participatory and equitable. Large
    scale funding under the NREGA (rather unlimited funding as the scheme is demand-driven) in
    later years seems to have partially shifted the focus.
•   The practices and processes introduced by the KGSP have been made mandatory for other
    schemes and projects as well, such as preparation of action plans through Gram Sabhas; double-
    entry system; and online entry of program-related and socio-economic data.
•   The coverage of stakeholders under training programmes had slowed down in the later years of
    the Project period. As stakeholders perceive, it is the tender work that makes the KGSP
    distinctive. This particular requirement had greatly contributed to the quality of works.
•   Unlike the Gram Sabha the performance of Project GPs with respect to Ward Sabhas was uneven.
    The soft interventions were not given the level of priority they deserve; such interventions would
    have contributed to better participation in Gram Sabhas and Ward Sabhas.
•   The KGSP has had much greater, verifiable and visible impact on the infrastructure that has been
    built through its core component. Here one can find a correlation between the impact and the
    scale of the intervention.
•   With respect to the soft interventions—and even the hard interventions to some extent—we need
    to look at the context in which the KGSP has been implemented. The Project period coincides
    with the launch of several centrally sponsored flagship schemes that were aimed at achieving the
    broader goal of inclusive growth. The flagship schemes cover the full range of social sectors. In
    addition, there are Government of Karnataka schemes and externally-aided projects. The
    guidelines of other schemes and projects also require the GPs to ensure community participation,
    transparency, equity and accountability. It is in this context that the evaluation tried to assess the
    impact of the KGSP.
•   The KGSP had the advantage of up taking the findings of the 2009 baseline survey in order to
    make course corrections.
•   Training interventions by ANSSIRD and other agencies covered the entire state; from a

                                                     41
    methodological perspective this has “contaminated” the control GPs and caused difficulties in
    isolating the impact of KGSP.
•   The aspects of participation, frequency, representativeness and “voice” with regard to Gram
    Sabha and Ward Sabha fall in the realm of institutions. Transformations in these indicators take
    time and require sustained and targeted interventions.
•   In general the control GPs are more urbanised and better connected to their respective Taluk and
    district headquarters. For instance in Bidar, Gulbarga and Raichur districts almost all control GPs
    were selected from their respective urban Taluks as only the urban Taluks were available outside
    the most backward Taluks. In order for the Project impact to be visible the treatment GPs first
    need to catch up with their control counterparts – at least with respect to some indicators – and
    then need to overtake them. These factors need to be taken into account while evaluating the
    impact of the KGSP.
•   The capacity-building interventions experienced an interruption—and some erosion of capacity at
    GP level—due to the change of GP bodies after the 2010 Panchayat polls. The previous GP
    bodies were in office during the launch of the KGSP and attended both special and regular
    training sessions. Nearly 85% of GP Members were new incumbents following the 2010 GP
    elections who had to learn the KGSP processes, requirements and related themes afresh following
    the departure of trained and experienced GP Members.

B.   DOCUMENTATION OF GRAM SWARAJ PROJECT 2014 54

I.   OBSERVATIONS

     Based on the review of documents, interactions and focus group discussions the following are the
     key observations from the study team:
•    Community Participation: The Gram Swaraj Project witnessed a revival in terms of community
     participation in planning of activities at the grass root level. The priorities and preference of the
     villagers were taken in to consideration while deciding on the utilization of money received under
     block grants. This paved way for addressing the basic infrastructure related problems of some of
     the backward Panchayats of the state with necessary community consensus. However it was
     observed that no participatory techniques were adopted in a systematic way to identify the
     needs of the community. The study team also found that the participation of the community
     members was not much evident during the implementation phase. During execution of the work
     by the contractors the role of the community was limited and apart from individual
     monitoring initiatives by elders of the community no collective initiatives were carried out.
     Community members from different sections of the community expressed their satisfaction about
     the development works carried out by under the Project.
•    Frequent transfers of officials: A major problem faced by the Panchayats during the
     implementation of the Project was the frequent transfer of officials such as PDOs and EOs. For
     e.g. Hoguntta Gram Panchayat of Chitapur Taluk witnessed frequent transfer of PDO (Panchayat
     Development Officers). Since the inception of Project, four PDOs have been posted there and
     presently the secretary who is given additional charge of PDO is the fifth resource for the same
     position. The present PDOs expressed that although the transfer is within same Taluk but it
     affects implementation of Project in terms of execution of plans, approval of annual action plan,
     submission of utilization certificate etc. Maintenance of Project related documents was also
     affected due to frequent transfers. It was observed that there is a lack of proper systems for
     handing over the documents related to the Projects to new officials. In most of the places the new
     officers faced difficulties in retrieving information from the past.
•    Insufficient resources at TRCs: Interactions with Elected Representatives revealed that they are
     pleased about the formation of Taluk Resource Centres. They are of the opinion that they are able
     to receive help from the Taluk Resource Centre as and when there is a need. However all the
     elected representatives responded that the Taluk Resource Centres are not equipped with the
     necessary staff as most of the TRCs covered under the study have only Computer Operator
     or Accountant. As a result the only help they are able to seek from TRC is with regard to the
     computerised accounting system, accounts, and documentation. The Elected Representatives and
     the PDOs are of the opinion that the TRCs need to be staffed with sufficient number of
     resources so that their assistance can be sought for the day to day functioning of the
     Panchayats.
•    Maintenance of TRCs: The Taluk Resource Centres are constructed using the one time
     construction grant received from Gram Swaraj Project. Most of the Taluk Resource Centres are
     regularly being used for providing trainings for PRIs and line department staff. However the
     maintenance of TRCs poses a big challenge for the Taluk Panchayats. There is no specific fund
     available for the repair works of the TRCs.
•    Maintenance of assets created: The Project was successful in addressing some of the basic
     infrastructure needs of the most backward Panchayats in the state. However the Project is yet
     to address the need for any mechanism for the maintenance of assets created under the



     54
          Report by ICRA Management Consulting Services, Limited (IMaCS), 2012

                                                                   43
      Project. In Kaidhalli village of Honguntta Gram Panchayat, public toilet was constructed
      using the money received as Block Grant. The need for public toilet emerged during ward
      Sabha and it was finalized during Gram Sabha. The toilet was constructed by Panchayat using
      Block Grants fund. The constructed toilet did not have any water or tap connection due to which
      villagers find it difficult to make use of it. The path way to the public toilet was also found
      congested and blocked by shrubs. The villagers feel that, if water connection is provided in the
      toilet then it can be utilized and will serve the need of the villagers. Interventions for addressing
      similar kind of issues are required to ensure that the assets created are being utilized at its
      best.
 •    Works under Gram Swaraj and Other projects: The study team found that there have been
      significant differences between the systems adopted for the activities carried out under Gram
      Swaraj Project and that of other schemes. Under Gram Swaraj it was mandatory that the
      community will decide and prioritize the activities to be undertaken under the Project
      where this is not evident in similar projects being implemented in the Panchayats. The Project
      ensured the utilization of the money as the next instalment of the block grant will be released only
      after utilizing the 70% of the previous instalment. Considering procurement, the Project has put
      proper systems in place for the activities carried out under the Project. All procurement activities
      carried out under the Project was through tendering process which further ensured transparency
      along with other measures.
 •    Application of Environment Management Framework: The Project has put in place systems
      to make sure that the environment will not be suffered as a result of the construction works
      undertaken under the Project. However the observations revealed that the application of
      environmental guidelines was handled as just another duty than effectively implementing the
      same by identifying the possible risks and mitigating the same. Though most of the work files are
      placed with OK cards, none of the cards carried any information with regard to the
      identification of environmental risks and the means adopted to mitigate the same.

II.   RECOMMENDATIONS

      The key recommendations derived from the exercise are given below:

 •    Management of Assets created: Gram Swaraj Project invested tremendously in developing
      assets in the most backward Panchayats of the state. However the management of the assets
      generated has been identified as an issue which is not sufficiently addressed by the Project. There
      should be systems in place to ensure that the outcomes of the Project will be sustainable and the
      assets generated under the Project are being managed properly. Panchayats should be guided to
      identify measures and strategies to ensure the maintenance of the assets generated under the
      Project. The systems such as community based monitoring and maintenance systems such as user
      groups and user fees should be adopted to make sure that the assets generated are maintained
      properly.
 •    Resources at TRCs: The formation of TRCs at the Taluk level was aimed at providing
      technical support to Panchayats. However as of now most of the TRCs do not have
      sufficient number of resources to carry out the mandates of TRC. Most of the TRCs only
      have a Computer Operator or Accountant. It is important to make sure that the TRCs are fully
      equipped with the proposed personnel such as Social Mobilizers, Accountants and Computer
      Operators which will help in addressing the needs of the Panchayats.
 •    Need for training Follow-up: ANSSIRD has carried out an incredible task by delivering
      number of training programmes aimed equipping the elected representatives and officials to
      undertake their tasks effectively. However it was observed that there are no systems in place
      to assess the impact of the training programmes and monitoring mechanisms to see how well


                                                       44
    they are able to apply the knowledge in their day to day affairs at the grass root level. Therefore
    there should be systems such as random monitoring field visits and interactions with the
    participants to understand the problems they face in applying their knowledge in the real field
    situations. There should be systems in place to see the trainings imparted through satellite
    systems are being well understood and received by the participants. There should be pre and post
    assessment systems to see how effective the satellite trainings were in educating the participants.
•   Need for improved Community Participation: Gram Swaraj Project was instrumental in
    enabling community participation in the decision making process at the grassroots level.
    However the community participation was limited to deciding and prioritizing the type of
    development works. It was very limited during the later stages of implementation. The Project
    envisages increased participation of the community yet failed to device any strategy for the same.
    The absence of the social mobilizers at the Taluk Resource Centre also limited the scope of
    enhanced community mobilizations for undertaking community based monitoring and social
    audits. Therefore it is important to establish systems and practices in place to ensure
    community participation at all levels of the Project.
•   Effective implementation of the Environment Management Framework: The Project
    adopted systems for managing environmental risks associated with the Project by
    implementation of an environmental management framework. However evidences from the field
    shows that the implementation and application of the same was not that effective as
    expected. Therefore within the available timeframe the Project should ensure that systems are in
    place accomplishing the objectives of environmental management framework. There should be
    frequent monitoring visits from the PMU and District Planning Units to see how effective the
    Gram Panchayats are in implementing the Environment Management Framework and whether
    the Executive Officers at the Taluk Panchayat are effective in monitoring the same. Policy
    level decisions by the Government are also required for an effective implementation of the
    same.
•   Training Need and Impact Assessment: There is a need for rapid training need assessment
    before the start of each training and quick impact assessment during the closure of the training.
    This quick need assessment will help the trainers to understand the knowledge levels of the
    participants and systematically address the training needs by being flexible in their training
    approach. The quick impact assessment will help the trainers and training material developers to
    understand how many the participants were able to learn from the current training and on
    which areas the participant needs specific attention in the subsequent trainings.
•   Expansion of Gram Swaraj Project: Gram Swaraj Project was successful in addressing the
    micro level development needs of the Gram Panchayats in the most backward blocks of
    the State. It has proven that enhanced community participation is a must in addressing the
    development needs of the communities. When most of the other schemes for the
    Panchayats provide tied funds for the Panchayats, Gram Swaraj Project gives untied funds
    to address the felt development needs of the community. The predictable nature of fund
    allocation under Gram Swaraj Project has helped Panchayats to be prepared for
    management of the funds. The key interventions such as revised procurement systems and
    implementation of the environment management guidelines are few among the best practices
    shown by the Project. Studies have been undertaken to see how the Project has brought out
    various best practices which can be replicated in other parts of the state and country.
    Expanding similar interventions to other blocks and Panchayats with similar indicators after
    drawing lessons from the successful aspects of Gram Swaraj Project will definitely able to
    bring outstanding results in the on-going development process at grass root levels which
    further strengthens the decentralization process. Therefore, it is recommended to expand the
    Project to all Districts and Gram Panchayats of the State by ensuring enhanced community
    participation and improved monitoring systems.

Background
Backwardness and regional imbalances are always the factors that hinder the development of
States as well as the Nation. Efforts have been made under various development programmes to
realize Gandhiji’s concept of Gram Swaraj. In spite of these efforts the issues of backwardness
and regional imbalances continue to occupy centre stage in our policy making process. Steps have
been initiated to find out reasons for such backwardness and imbalances and find means to
eradicate them. With the great hope that backwardness and imbalances could be eradicated
through the Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRI), the States have initiated several programmes.
Backwardness can be attributed to several factors and important among them are issues related to:
   1. Social and cultural factors
   2. Economic factors
   3. Political situation- that is the decision making process (if people are weak in decision
      making process they are bound to remain backward)
   4. Administrative factors (here the services provided and at what level of efficiency is
      important)
Apart from this the lack of infrastructure facilities, Institutional mechanisms at the grassroots
level, lack of awareness, knowledge, skills among the community and the levels of delivery of
services through participatory initiatives also play an important role.
In Karnataka, several efforts have been made to address issues related to backwardness and
regional imbalances. Most important among them is the recommendations made by the committee
headed by the well known economist Dr. D. M. Nanjundappa about the efforts to be made to
eradicate regional imbalances in its report. In this report all the Taluks have been classified as
Most backward, The More backward, the backward and the Relatively Developed Taluks. Several
programmes have been taken up in this regard since several years and financial resources are
being released to these backward regions to supplement them.
At the Institutional level, during the year 1987 Karnataka initiated the first generation
decentralization reforms with “central theme” of creating and empowering strong district level
local government. The constitutional 73rd amendments of 1993, with its emphasis on reservations
for deprived classes constituted second-generation reforms while the strengthening of the
decentralization initiatives formed the third generation reforms. The aim was to strengthen the
accountability, enhance the transparency and role clarity. The emphasis was on good governance,
transparent and accountability through decentralization and to make the PRIs truly institutions of
local self- governments. In this regard, there was need of additional resources to be provided to
Institutions at the grassroots level especially Gram Panchayats to encourage them in increasing
resources to address their needs and to enhance their capacity in utilising these resources.
Gram Swaraj- An Overview
Karnataka has been in the forefront of administrative decentralization and devolution of powers to
the Panchayats as envisaged in the Constitution. It has been observed that the Panchayat Raj
Institution structure in Karnataka has now been stabilized and strengthened with regular elections.
However, to make them truly institutions of local self- governments, there was a need to provide
Gram Panchayats with additional resources and also encourage them to raise their own sources
through capacity building initiatives. Resources utilized towards services that are prioritized
locally would lead to greater satisfaction among the local population. The Project gave special
emphasis to improve the service delivery by Gram Panchayats particularly with respect to the
management of public resources and the delivery of services that the local people prioritize and
decide.

Project Objectives
The major objective of the Project in the 39 ‘Most Backward Taluks’ was to provide them
opportunities towards improving their present conditions particularly with respect to the
management of public resources and the delivery of relevant services that the rural people
prioritize. In order to achieve this objective, the Project focused on:
    • Build capacity of the Grama Panchayats (GPs), Taluk Panchayats (TPs) and Zilla
         Panchayats (ZPs) Improve framework and guidelines for own revenue collection.
    • Provide formula-based Block grants to 1341 GPs in the ‘Most Backward Taluks’
    • Revamp financial management and procurement system.
    • Improve the effectiveness of service delivery across a range of services that have
         devolved on them under the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, 1993 (KPR Act, 1993)
Project Area
The Project was implemented in 1341 GPs, coming under 39 ‘Most Backward’ Taluks in 15
Districts identified in the Nanjundappa Committee Report. The list of the 39 Most Backward
Taluks is annexed as Annexure-1. However, developing the capacity of the institutions at all
three tiers of Zilla Panchayats, Taluk Panchayats and Gram Panchayats by imparting training to
PRI members and functionaries was taken up in the entire state.
Project Description
The “Gram Swaraj Project” (GSP) is a Panchayat Strengthening Project conceived and assisted by
World Bank and was implemented through Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department
(RD&PRD), Government of Karnataka from 2006-07. The State Government intended to
strengthen the ‘most backward Taluks’ constituting 1341 Gram Panchayats. The focus was to fill
the administrative and development gaps in the GPs, designed with optimum scope for improving
efficiency and effectiveness. Initially, it sought to increase the resources for development in these
backward GPs by providing untied grants. Along with this, it also sought additional efforts on the
part of GP functionaries to generate own source revenue (OSR) and thereby increasing their
capacity to undertake higher investment. In addition to this, to improve the local management
capacity, the Project allocated, formulae based block grants rather than tied funds, so that GPs
could carry out their own prioritization and planning. The Project duration was initially fixed at 5
years and a detailed planning, budget allocations were designed. The Project was designed based
on realized efficiency gains from improved processes and capacity building measures with the
innovative idea of establishment of Taluk Resource Centres (TRCs) and SATCOM Studios. The
critical aspects of these arrangements included the establishment of the Decentralization Analysis
Cell which is responsible for analysis, evaluation and monitoring of panchayat fiscal and service
delivery performance, strengthening of ANSSIRD and restructuring of line agencies.
Intervention Strategies
A. Infrastructure Development
GSP displayed transparent approach so that people were aware of the scheme being allocated to
different local governments and the services/outputs expected to result there from through
ward/gram sabhas held. Provision & maintenance of drinking water supply, health & sanitation,
inter road connectivity, asset creation etc. are some of the important civic responsibilities of GPs.
The intervention of GSP in the matter of service delivery in the GPs, revealed an overall positive
outcome. The service-wise physical achievement made is presented in the below table.

Table shows 55127 works of different types approved by Gram Sabhas as per action plan were
completed. It can be seen that major works carried out are roads, sanitation and other
infrastructure. The nature of works taken up with Gram Swaraj Project funds included Concrete
Roads, Community Toilets, Cisterns, and Buildings. The works carried out strictly adhered to the
Environmental Framework guidelines designed under the Project which included the issue of OK
cards. This helped in assessing the environmental impact in the Project area. The importance of
the environmental safeguards and frameworks were discussed in the gram sabhas for creating the
awareness among the community. Apart from this an unique pilot work was taken by installing
solar lights in Pudukote Kaval village of Bheemanahalli Gram Panchayat in HD Kote Taluk of
Mysore District.
The investments made through block grant to GPs have created a model in local governance
through its transparency, accountability and participatory process. Incurring expenditure by the
Gram Panchayat on asset creation, better service delivery such as interlinking concrete cement
roads, portable drinking water supply vide cisterns, pipelines, better drainage & sanitation facility,
solar lights etc. should be seen not as an asset alone but their indirect impact on health hygiene
and socio-cultural behavior. This should also be considered along with infrastructure
augmentation and increasing the involvement of civil society in planning and its execution
through discussions and effective participation in ward/gram sabhas.
B. Capacity Building
Taluk Resource Centers (TRC): The concept of TRC was a built-in objective of the Project for
the capacity building of PRIs with and intention of providing space for better environment and
easy accessibility to impart training comfortably to facilitate various Training programs organized
by Abdul Nazir Sab State Institute of Rural Development (ANSSIRD) for the elected
representatives of Panchayat Raj Institutions and also functionaries of these Institutions that
included other Government Departments like Agriculture, Education, Women and Child
Development etc., which co-function with Panchayat Raj Institutions by setting up a permanent
structure in the name of TRC. In addition, Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) were also
allowed to impart training to groups like Self Help Groups (SHGs) which are engaged on income
generating activities. Taluk Resource Centers also facilitated to save the precious time and carry

                                                 51
out the multifarious responsibilities of Chief Executive Officer (ZP) Taluk Panchayat Officers
(TP) and GP Officials. To carry out the functions of the centre, expertise was needed in three
areas: (i) Accountant for accounting and financial management (ii) Computer Operator for
technical specifications, design and oversight of investments in small infrastructure; and (iii)
Social Mobilizers to mobilize the most vulnerable groups, assist Panchayats in targeting services
to them, and in promoting participation and facilitating decision-making at village meetings.
Service Delivery Monitoring System:
The focus in the Project was also on improving the Transparency and Accountability mechanisms.
One of the initiatives was the transparent approach adopted through display board on various
works carried out under the Project. Details of allocations, technical specifications and other
relevant information were put on display boards maintained by Gram Panchayats.
ANSSIRD played a vital role in monitoring the service delivery by imparting effective trainings
to representatives of SHGs, Anganwadi workers, health assistants, elected representatives,
officials of Gram Panchayats and Chartered Accountants. In this view, ANSSISRD also had set
up a Committee of Experts for designing of training modules. The Committee comprised of
academicians, panchayat and NGO representatives, artists and designers. ANSSIRD brought out
a variety of charts, wall newspapers and posters in various aspects of service delivery aspects,
poverty alleviation and development for dissemination to all gram panchayats. In addition, to the
existing film materials of the Institute, a series of films were created inter alia on the following
issues:
    • Panchayat raj, poverty alleviation & food security – inter-linkages between income, work,
         food, nutrition, health, HIV.
    • Feminization of poverty – caste, gender and bonded labor
    • Vulnerable groups in agriculture
    • Poverty alleviation, credit and access to resources
Building the Capacity of the State
This component had put in place key mechanisms at the state level to enhance the states’ capacity
to monitor, facilitate and guide the Panchayat system. It included Facilitation Cell,
Decentralization Analysis Cell and ANSSIRD.




The Facilitation Cell: it was responsible for overall implementation of the Project with
management and coordination of all stakeholders. It regularly monitored the Project area Gram
Panchayats on its work implementations, grant utilization, procurements aspects, financial
management aspects and timely completion of works for the allocations/releases done.

Information Systems for Constituents
This component was to increase the capacity of rural people, in particular the poor, to voice their
demands on local bodies and put pressure on them to perform. This was achieved through three
distinct activities. It concentrated on increasing the ability of rural people to watch their demands
on local governance and elicit responses from the poor, women, scheduled caste and scheduled
tribes and also to enhance the awareness on IEC activities.
Information Education & Communication (IEC) aspects focused on empowering the community
organizations and Gram Panchayat Officials on their roles and responsibilities, service delivery
performance at the village levels etc. Initially, Project focused on media reach program in the 39
Taluks by informing the media about the Project, to help them in monitoring via reporting on the
Project as it evolves. ANSIRRD planned a comprehensive program for GSP activities to be
executed and implemented. It included intensified emphasis on Projects objectives, procedures,
grievance mechanism, planning process by portraying that the GPs are the autonomous
government structures and that its citizens/people have all right to define the expenditure
priorities in their boundaries through awareness campaigns such as kalajathas, short films, skits,
etc.. With this, the GPs started disclosing information to public through ward/gram sabha and
posters: full budget, beneficiary, tender calls, contracts, revenue collection, work plans, audit
compliance/findings, implementation of promised changes to bring in the transparency in the
local governance;


                                                 53
Panchatantra- To add up to this, a innovative multi-dimensional classification software which
was more computer friendly and facilitates easy retrieval of information and flexible reporting
was introduced by the State Government and it portrays all required data/information to the
public domain. The GPs are able to feed in their accounts, meeting proceedings, gram/ward sabha
details, general information, Result Framework Documents, Jamabandi/Social Audit etc. from the
panchayat level itself. Detailed information on assets and liabilities owned/created is also
maintained in Panchatantra which is the only one mechanism in validating this information from
the accounts. To use the software in an efficient manner the intensive trainings were held under
Gram Swaraj by providing Technical Assistance through MIS Coordinators at Taluk Level with
aid of NIC. Panchatantra also helps in tracking of day to day financial transactions, reducing
manual work etc. Further, to boost the GPs the Government of Karnataka also adopted the GP
grading system based on their performance in achieving their goals on role and responsibilities.
The 5629 Gram Panchayats of Karnataka are furnished with a Desktop Computer and MS office
under GSP fund for strengthening the information system with respect to the automation of Gram
Panchayats.




                                              54
Building the Capacity of Panchayats
This component created capacity at the
                                                         District: Chikkamagalore
District, Block and Village level to
                                                          Taluk : Chikkamagalore
function effectively. Since the Gram Estimated cost:37.00 Lakhs Year of Construction: 2011-12
panchayats were the weakest links, most GSP Fund: 25.00 Lakhs      Other Funds: 12.00 Lakhs
capacity building efforts were targeted at
this level. Various works carried under
the Project acted as a organic link
between the GPs and the community.
The GPs received the block grants and
its strengthening with an impact for
better and transparent flow of resources,
better utilization of funds, transparent
procurement system, creation of
capacities and system to manage
resources, demand from panchayats to
learn more environmental and financial management planning, discipline the system to respond
better to local people and local needs.
The disbursement of block grants has been done in accordance to the Project commitment. For
this purpose the formula was devised for all the five financial years. In collaboration with the
World Bank, and efforts of DAC a formula was devised to avoid the discrimination in the
allocation of block grants for these gram panchayats as the parameters specified in the Operation
Manual (OM) and monitoring compliance was not considered for avoiding discrimination. Hence
the following formula was devised and then revised periodically based on population, SC/ST
population, literacy rate and Geographical area for first year and population and SC/ST
population considering for the remaining four years. Further the GPs were imposed with 7 criteria
to be followed for the timely releases of block grants under GSP in respect to their increasing
capacity buildings. Eligibility criteria for the releases of block grant to GPs under GSP: - 1) 70%
& above expenditure made against the previous releases and furnished UCs, 2) Audit for the
fiscal year, 3) All accounts of GPs completed by CA firm, 4) Internal audit compliance, 5)
followed GoKs planning guidelines, 6) continuously gram sabha held with open participation and
7) publicly displayed FM and Procurement information.
The graph shows the progress of
Project along with its peak time of
fund flow. The above table reveals
that on an average 87.04% of the
released block grants were spent by
each GP. They maintained this
expenditure level in each year during
Project period. This is a good
achievement on the part of GPs
considering their background. Further,
it can be observed that expenditure
made is more than 68 per cent under
component B, C and D activities.
Financial Management: The main
challenge was to improve financial management with Procurement & Internal Controls by the
functionaries of GPs viz resource mobilization, quality and maintenance of accounts,


                                                55
transparency and accountability in the financial matters. Required actions were assured to be
taken up to create a panel of CA firms in consultation with KSAD to conduct special reviews in
both Financial Management and Procurement at the GP level. As an initial step during February
2008, the Project decided to make use of Chartered Accountant Firms for the re-compilation of
GP accounts for FY 2005-06 and 2006-07 in association with KSAD.
Further, Project influenced the GPs to make use of the services of Chartered Accountant for
strong internal audit of Finances. It includes Process Audit which starts from the processing of
Perspective plans prepared at Gram Panchayats including the tender process/shopping methods
involved, work clearance order, work execution with photos at all three phase before, present and
after, record maintenance, bill maintenance (Measurement Books), cash book entries. Timely
Statutory Audit due to the intervention and monitoring and intervention of Project. Project
adhered strictly to the 7 criteria’s adopted. 100% documentation at state level for all 1341 GPs.
Training was held by ANSSIRD for better Financial Management.
Another important achievement of GPs is making their budget details accessible to the public.
This was done by introducing “Panchatantra” Software where all important data of each GP was
made available to the public. Understanding its importance, GSP took initiative in strengthening it
by providing effective training in coordination with ANSSIRD. This met the lacunae that existed
prior to GSP in transparency, accountability and capacity building.
It may be seen from the below Table that the GPs of GSP have increased own revenue effort
200% and potential 100% when compared to 2005 the pre Project period which was considered as
one of the impact indicator of the Project which has been achieved during the Project period and
after completion of 5 years too. The average total own source revenue (OSR) collection is
increased from Rs.1.72 lakh in 2006-07 to Rs. 5.33 lakhs in 2012-13 which mirrors the above
statement. In terms of average annual growth rate in revenue mobilization it is 22.69 percent
during the Project period 2006-13. Revenue collection from the Property Tax against the demand
for the year 2012-13 is 37.19 percent. This seems not so encouraging but the point to be
highlighted is that, they were at-least able to achieve this level because of the periodical
intervention of the Project or otherwise it would have been still less. Further, it may be seen from
the table that 90.96% of GPs have completed their annual audit of accounts as required under the
Project. Apart from this, the GPs under GSP have adopted the procurement system that the state
is following in a short period of time thus bringing in the uniformity at all governmental level in
the state which in turn led to an adoption of tender process for its planned works.

Own Source Revenue (OSR)
Mobilization: Project emphasis on
increasing OSR has yielded better
results with regard to audit
compliances in GSP villages. Perhaps
frequent supervision had its effect, but
it might have been far more effective
to rely on incentives rather than
administrative reminders. In the most
recent review of the Project,
undertaken a couple of months ago,
there was a discussion on introducing
performance-based rewards to GPs.
However, no study or information
exits on how OSR targets should be set. Presently the determinants of OSR are not known,
underling the need for a study in this regard. Incentives should be designed to promote those
determinants. Informed incentivization would be a key to success but just announcing a reward
may not move GPs optimally to act on this difficult issue of OSR.

Capacity Building: As observed earlier capacity up-gradation of the functionaries of PRIs and
other concerned agencies was an important component of GSP. In this regard it may be observed
that about 79 per cent of the elected representatives of PRIs, Self Help Groups (SHGs) and
officials received training. To strengthen it further, establishment of 5 SATCOM centers (satellite
based training) and face to face trainings at Taluk levels in TRCs (Taluk Resource Centre) was
taken up by the Project.

Environmental Management Frame Work:
The process of assessing the environment impact is based on ‘Environment Guidelines’
formulated under the Project and is authorized through the system of ‘OK’ cards. In order to
educate the implementing agency on environmental frame work, training is conducted by
ANSSIRD, Mysore.
C. Institutional Strengthening
Taluk Resource Centre: It is an innovative and most unique concept which is achieved in
Karnataka under KGSP. There is no as such centre throughout the country with the purpose
mentioned above. It acts as a Taluk hub bridging the gap between Gram Panchayats and Zilla
Panchayats especially providing aid in imparting the trainings to the elected representatives,
officials and public. The TRCs were provided with personnel’s under Gram Swaraj Project Area
for monitoring and implementation of the Projects works and to bridge the gaps. There were
Social Mobilizers, Accountants and Computer Operators who were looking at all works related to
the GSP and Gram Panchayat related works which added up to the capacity building. All 172
TRCs are functioning and further these TRCs have to be strengthened and stabilized for its
optimal utilization in future by providing full fledge staff, equipments and necessary particulars.
Decentralization Analysis Cell (DAC): was responsible for analysis, evaluation, monitoring,
and development of the intergovernmental fiscal system. The unit was essential in providing the
basic analysis and intellectual leadership that will allow government to make its decisions about
the system. At the time the State Finance Commission was constituted, the DAC provided
technical and data support to Finance Commission. This helped in improving the quality of inputs
available to the work of the State Finance Commission, and thereby ensured its results were far
more satisfactory and made them more likely to be accepted.
DAC carried out annual tracking of the fiscal performance and fiscal health of each local
government. This included budgetary outcomes in terms of spending and revenues raised
budgetary balances and shortfalls, tax effort, and the match between budget projections and actual
outcomes. This tracking relied heavily on data produced by the fiscal information system which
included Formula Evaluation, Monitoring of Compliance, Revenue Mobilization Analysis, Best
Practices, Expenditure related assignments.
This Cell has many achievements to its credit. The important among these are: collection and
dissemination of fiscal data of the PRIs in the state for the period 2005-06 to 2010-11; collection
of socio-economic information for all GPs in the state for the year 2005-06 is in public domain.
Further, it has carried out a handful research studies on the issues such as construction of outcome
indicators; tribal inclusion in the local governance and development, fiscal analysis etc. It also

                                                58
entrusted certain studies to external institutions such as “A Study of Panchayats Finance in
Karnataka”, “Understanding determinants of own sources revenue mobilization (Monitoring
Compliances) in Karnataka’s Gram Panchayats”, “Documentation of Best Practices adopted by
Gram Panchayats in the State”. Involved in preparation of Terms of References, RFPs,
Feedbacks/Suggestion/Critical Comments on the reports received at different levels and a tight
monitoring was done to get the required output.
As the preliminary responsibility DAC analysed and proposed adjustments to the formula to find
the eligible local governance by their achievements for the fund allocation done by the
government and also devised formula for introducing incentive grants based on the performance
of Grama Panchayats under GSP. A recursive analysis on the fiscal data maintained paved way to
suggest a Standard Operating System for State Accounts Department (SAD) and RDPR.
Involved in various activities of RD&PR Department like:

E. Project outcomes
Key Performance Indicators:
Service delivery: This indicator has been stressed under GSP and has achieved it with better
rating. This is proved by the typologies of works carried out with the quality comparison done
under many research works. The Review of Gram Swaraj Project in Koppal District, Karnataka:
Some Policy Perspectives shows statistical significant evidence on better service delivery
compared to the non-Project area; Empirical Impact Evaluation Study on KGSP throws light on
the better quality and durability of physical works carried out in the Project area especially of
streetlights, roads and drainages. It also speaks on asset survey with cross cut analysis on the
quality, cost-effectiveness, transparency and equity which rates high in the treatment area when
compared to other programmes/schemes.
Own source revenue: Important indicator to rate the Project’s performance is OSR. The regular
monitoring and intervention by the Project has led to the increased growth rate in OSR. This is
annexed in the “Understanding Determinants of Own Source Revenue in Gram Panchayats of
Karnataka. The recommendations
on OSR and the existing state on
the indicator are depicted in detail
under “Study of Panchayat
Finances in Karnataka”.
People participation rate

The above Table and Graph
clearly indicates the increase in
people participation during Ward
Sabha and Gram Sabha. Especially
the participation of weaker
sections like., SC/ST and Women
is increased to the greater extent.




                                               62
F. Impact Assessment Studies

A number of studies that measured the impact assessment of various initiatives under the
Project had been commissioned. These studies looked into specific aspects of focus and
provided scope for mid-term course correction of various initiatives under the Project. These
studies were conducted by the Centre for Budget and Policy Studies, Institute for
Development and Empowerment, World Bank Independent Evaluation Team and Madras
Institute of Development Studies. The first two studies focussed on issues related to fiscal
performance of Gram panchayats. The study by the independent evaluation focused on a
comprehensive study commencing from conducting a baseline and monitoring the programme
over the entire duration of the Project. The study by the Madras Institute of Development
Studies focussed on evaluation of the capacity building component of ANSSIRD and also
developed the decentralised sustainable development indicators that paved the way for
ranking of Gram Panchayats in Gram Swaraj Project area by using the measurable and
monitorable indicators. The details of few of these studies are enclosed in the Annexure.

Summary
The Gram Swaraj Project implemented in the state provided an opportunity to take measures
at strengthening of the grassroots level institutions in the most backward Taluks in the state.

the steps taken at the macro level for strengthening of the institutions. The impact assessment
studies have shown the way forward for ensuring more transparent and vibrant mechanisms to be
put in place to ensure the success of such projects.

                    Understanding Determinants of Own Source Revenue
The Constitution has placed the Gram Panchayat at the centre of the rural governance. While
Article 40 of the Constitution envisages the Gram Panchayat to function as vibrant units of local
self governance, an attempt turn this into a reality has been made with the 73rd and 74th
Constitutional Amendments which have created constitutionally mandated third tier of
government in the rural and urban areas respectively. Karnataka has been in the forefront of
experiments with the decentralization in the country. The decentralized governance set up came
into existence in the state much before the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments.
Of the three levels of local government, Gram Panchayat is the lowest tier and is closest to the
people. It is also the only tier of local government which has the power to tax as per the
Karnataka Panchayat Raj act 1993. The own source revenues include taxes on land and buildings,
the water charges, license charges, fees for various services and certificates provided by the GP.
In addition to these, GPs receive grants from the state and central governments. These grants are
generally tied to specific purpose of development activity. The Thirteenth Finance Commission
(TFC) highlighted the need for the augmenting the revenues through better tax administration and
improved collection efficiency along with provision of better quality of services. Accordingly, the
concept of performance based grants was introduced for the TFC period starting from 2010-11.
The Own Source Revenue (OSR) in the GP has been the subject of many studies. These studies
have examined the aspect of low OSR collection and reasons for the same. Reluctance on the part
of the GP to rise own revenues has been as a principal reason for low OSR. Proximity to voters is
a factor that works adversely in the OSR collection as highlighted by many studies. This situation
is further aggravated by the state and central governments using GPs as agents for implementing
a variety of their developmental programmes stretching their already scarce resources. Higher
literacy and lower dependence on agriculture, both indicators of economic development, were
found to positively correlate with OSR in the state of West Bengal. Generally, the studies find a
positive correlation between economic development and the level of OSR.
The present study attempts to identify determinants of OSR in the GPs of Karnataka. A purposive
stratified sample of 128 GPs, equal number of good performing and poor performing GPs, were
selected for the purpose of the study. The administrative division as well as the development
category as identified by the High Power Committee for Redressal of Regional Imbalances
(HPCRRI) headed by Dr D. M. Nanjundappa was considered while selecting the sample GPs.
The sample GPs are spread over all the four divisions, 24 districts and 64 Taluks. Instruments for
primary survey were piloted in a GP followed by their finalization in consultations with experts
and Decentralization Analysis Cell. In addition to primary data collection, the study also involved
interviews with the GP members as well as the Focus Group Discussions with select members of
public in the GP.
The secondary data analysis was done on the basis of socio economic survey data provided by the
RDPR. In addition to confirming the relationship of OSR with variables of economic
development, the secondary data also revealed issues relating to tax administration. The outlier1
GPs were analysed to identify the underlying factors for poor performance despite favorable
circumstances and good performance in spite of unfavorable circumstances. It was seen that the
GP elected members’ experience and education had a positive correlation with OSR collection.
Good performing outliers were seen to have better tax record management.
The primary data analysis involved relating OSR performance with various demographic,
socioeconomic and other variables like population, literacy, the distance to the Taluk and district
head quarter, closeness to highway, proportion of SC/ST in the total population. The primary data

                                                66
analysis also involved detailed examination of tax administration, book keeping, tax collection
efforts, updating of various registers and so on. The GP members’ interview were analysed for
their responses. The FGD and the field observations were also analysed.
The study finds that management of tax records including their periodical updating, availability
of adequate human resource capacity, attitude of elected members were some of the significant
determinants of OSR. The study revealed that the differences across divisions were more marked
than across development category.
On the basis of determinants identified by the study, it is felt that there is a need for a)
supervision of GPs by either the TP or ZP in respect of revision of tax rates, enhancing the tax
base and overall performance with regard to OSR collection, b) improvement of tax
administration in terms of engagement of sufficient number of bill collectors, payment of their
salaries in full and on time, proper maintenance of tax related records, etc. c) building capacity of
elected representatives in tax administration and motivating them to take leadership role in
development of the GP.

                          Study of Panchayat Finances in Karnataka

The findings based on the analysis of the secondary data it is summarized as follows:
•   The socio-economic data was made available for one year only. In the absence of
    comparative data for the subsequent years the data could not be used for analysis. The data
    was used for statistical analysis but no significant correlation could be found on the issues
    covered in the study. However the efforts made to collect the authentic data village wise for
    each of the Gram panchayats in the state need to be appreciated and the format can be used
    for up gradation of the data on a regular basis by the Gram panchayats in the state. The
    enormous data thus collected could be very useful for preparation of a plan/action plan at the
    Gram Panchayat level. It is essential to keep in mind that the data collected could be used to
    develop indicators which can measure the performance of Gram Panchayats in those areas. A
    format with the list of indicators that were tested and finalized in a Research Project under
    Gram Swaraj conducted by the Madras Institute of Development Studies is suggested in the
    recommendations.
•   The data available on the receipts and expenditure of Zilla Panchayats indicates that the funds
    released have increased from Rs.4279 crores to Rs.5515 crores during the period 2005-06 to
    2008-09. The expenditure also has increased from Rs. 4572 crores to Rs.4801 crores during
    the period. The percentage of utilization of funds has increased from 80.3 per cent to 87.05
    per cent during these years. The details of receipts and expenditure under different
    schemes/heads indicates that sectors like Education, Health and Family welfare and rural
    development programmes receive the maximum share. Water Supply and Sanitation which
    received nearly Rs. 402 crores funds during the year 2005-06 received Rs. 2.86 crores during
    2008-09 due to transfer of schemes to the Gram Panchayats. The percentage of utilization of
    funds is also significant in these sectors and schemes. However data on the expenditure
    incurred under the plan and non-plan would have shown more interesting results.
•   The details of capital account expenditure show that the Water Supply and Sanitation sector,
    Welfare of SCs/STs/OBCs followed by construction of Roads and Bridges get the maximum
    share under the head. However there has been a drastic reduction in the outlay available for
    the water supply and sanitation sector from Rs.348 crores in 2005-06 to Rs.1.90 crores during
    2008-09. A possible reason for this could be that the maintenance of all water supply schemes
    was transferred from ZP to Gram Panchayats. Overall figures indicate that the capital outlay
    available to the Zilla panchayats constitutes a small percentage of the total receipts for the
    year.
•   There are a few sectors where the percentage of utilization of funds exceeds the receipts and
    the same needs close scrutiny. During the period the opening balance at the treasury has not
    shown much variation but with the banks it has increased by nearly 16 times from Rs.50
    crores to about Rs.814 crores during the period 2005-06 to 2008-09.
•   The analysis of the receipt and expenditure of Taluk panchayats also shows that certain areas
    have recorded impressive performance across all categories of Taluks. The capital account
    expenditure across the Taluks is not significant.
•   The analysis of the Taluk panchayat data on the receipt and expenditure under various
    development heads indicates that they do not receive sufficient grants to take up any
    meaningful development works in the Taluks. The picture is the same across all categories of
    Taluks. Even where the funds are released they are mainly related to salary expenses or the
    funds which are released to the gram panchayats through the Taluk panchayats.
•   There has been a significant increase in the opening balance of Gram Panchayats over the
    years. The reasons for this can be traced to the increased flow of funds to the Gram
    Panchayats especially under the MNREGS, delays in the utilization of funds etc. Discussions

                                                68
    with the GP officials during field visits indicated that this is also due to late release of funds
    by the State and Central governments for various development schemes during the end of the
    financial year.
•   The own source revenue of the Gram Panchayats have improved by more than 50 per cent
    between 2005-06 and 2008-09. This increase has taken place across all the districts in the
    states and different categories of Taluks.
•   The percentage of own sources of revenue to total funds available with the gram panchayats
    shows a decreasing trend from 13.41 per cent to 8.83 per cent. This is possibly due to
    increased grants for various development schemes released to the Gram Panchayats.
•   Grant-in-Aid as a percentage of total funds of the Gram panchayats has been showing a
    decreasing trend during the study period
•   Resource mobilization through taxes by the Gram Panchayats as percentage to total funds
    (including the opening balance) has decreased and Non-tax revenue also shows a similar
    trend. The data shows that the revenue from the tax and non-tax sources have been increasing
    across the districts during the period.
•   Percentage of Tax revenue to total own source of revenue has marginally increased whereas
    there has been a decrease in the non-tax revenue mobilization by the gram panchayats over
    the years.
•   The general picture that emerges from the analysis of the per capita income across the GPs in
    the districts in the state indicates that over the period in a majority of the district’s the per
    capita tax mobilization has increased over the period. There are districts which have shown
    significant improvement in the tax mobilization efforts.
•   Property Tax is one of the important sources of revenue even though it constitutes a small
    percentage of the total revenue of the gram panchayats. A noteworthy feature across many
    districts is that the per capita property tax mobilisation has shown significant increase during
    the study period.
•   The non-tax mobilization efforts also showed marginal improvement in many of the districts
    across the state. However the relatively developed districts in terms of agricultural activities
    showed a negative trend in non-tax resource mobilization.
•   The Total Own Source resource mobilization by the Gram Panchayats across all the districts
    of the state has shown an increasing trend during the study period. The total funds that
    accrued to the Gram Panchayats in the state comprising tax, non-tax, and grants from State
    and Central governments have shown significant increase from 931 crores to 2259 crores
    during the years 2005-06 to 2008-09. This is due to increased flow of funds for development
    works under some of the flagship programmes of the State like MGNREGS, Rural Housing
    etc. Similar is the trend with respect to expenditure pattern by the Gram Panchayats which has
    increased across all the districts of the state. This is also due to the reason that the expenditure
    on development schemes has been increasing over the years at the grassroots level.
•   Fiscal data on expenditure as a percentage of the total funds available with the Gram
    Panchayats show a decreasing trend from nearly 76 per cent to 72 per cent during the study
    period. This is also one of the reasons for the rapid increase in the opening balance of the
    Gram Panchayats. A possible reason for this could be that the staff at the Gram Panchayat
    level is overburdened with the implementation of a large number of schemes coupled with
    delays in getting necessary administrative and technical approval for projects. However the
    administration needs to be toned up for effective utilization of funds.
•   Expenditure by the Gram Panchayats has been showing a steady trend during the study
    period. The district wise expenditure shows variations from year to year. The point to be
    noted is that the larger issues related to devolution of functionaries to the Gram Panchayats
    along with adequate freedom in expenditure decisions need to be addressed at the policy level.
•   The field studies also focused on another important issue of functioning of Gram panchayats
    as per the provisions of the Act. The initial analysis of the data shows significant

                                                  69
improvements in the functioning of GPs in GS Project area compared to non-GS Project area
under certain issues. It may added here that the focus of the field visits was on regular conduct
of monthly GP meetings, ward sabha, gram sabha, formation and functioning of standing
committees, preparation of budget and action plans, Jamabandi and audit related issues,
maintenance of records, and certain social development parameters and service delivery
related issues etc.

The Review of Gram Swaraj Project in Koppal District, Karnataka: Some Policy
Perspectives
This report presents a review of the Gram Swaraj Project (GSP) implemented in four Taluks of
Koppal District. The exercise has a limited coverage in area because the intent was to go beyond
official data and examine Project outcomes as viewed in household perceptions on Project
outcomes and analyze this information econometrically. The question we faced while designing
this exercise was whether we should go extensive and keep focus on official data or reduce the
geographical coverage but make the exercise more intensive by obtaining detailed information
and analysing it thoroughly. Since a larger macro exercise to evaluate GSP is already in the offing
and since variability in changes of outcomes obtained from official data across the state was
rather narrow, the decision was taken to increase the depth of analysis and focus on finding out
how households evaluated the Project results.
Accordingly, 240 households were selected randomly across 12 village situated in 6 Gram
Panchayats (GPs) of Koppal district, a half of which have been implementing GSP and the other
half have not had the Project and thus were taken to be control GPs. The ‘treatment’ and ‘control’
dichotomy in sample helped us separate the effects of the Project from other effects on outcomes.
The Project has aimed to fill key development gaps in 39 most backward Taluks of the state. First,
it has sought to increase the development resources of these backward GPs by not only
emphasizing on higher generation of own source revenue (OSR) but also by giving Project grants
to increase their capacity to undertake investment. Additionally, keeping in view the need to
improve local management capacity, the Project sought to allocate block grants, rather than tied
funds, so that the GPs can carry out their own prioritization and planning. Third, through
extensive training and equipment supply the Project sought to build local management capacity in
both handling of operations and procurement and accounting. Fourth, a number of process
improvements were promoted such as tendering of works, internal audit and mandating the
release of tranches of grants conditional to completing accounting of funds already released.
Finally, it sought to promote enhanced participation, transparency and accountability. The
expectation was that these process improvements would not only yield efficiency gains in the use
of GSP resources but would also have spillover benefits and thus improve local service delivery
in general.
The review exercise has shown that GSP outcomes were not realized fully as expected. The score
is mixed at best. While OSR did improve in treatment GPs, over the control ones, and
performance on audit and account keeping improved, it was not clear if gains indeed reflected the
full potential of the process improvements. For one, though OSR performance improved over
control GPs, yet it remained far below the goals set by the Project. In regard to process
improvement practices, such as gram sabha attendance, representation of the weaker and
marginalized sections in such meetings showed little improvements. The spill-over benefits
seemed limited at best, as the quality of services delivered across treatment and control villages
showed no (statistically) significant variation. Significantly, denial of wages programmed under
MGNREGA was consistently lower for the households in GSP villages than for households in
non GSP villages. But school, health and water services showed no correlation whatsoever with
whether a village had GSP or not. This pointed to the fact that sector services ran quite
independent of the household views, thus calling for convergence of services for more effective
monitoring and programming.
This rather a mixed result posed a serious question. Why should enhanced participation,
transparency, accountability, local financial autonomy local selection of works and local role in

                                                71
procurement should all have no clear impact on outcomes? These improvements are known,
theoretically as well as in development practices globally, to make a positive difference. Why
then did they not have a significant impact on the results of this Project? This led us to examine
various aspects of the Project design. The exercise brought out two sets of design gaps: a system
gap and a number of policy gaps which did not allow intended process improvements to occur
fully or to improve results.
The system gap discussed in the report refers to seriously weak accountability in implementing
the Project as also in delivery of rural services in general. Since community gets most of these
services free, and the suppliers of service is paid not by the recipients of service but by
government agencies that do not directly benefit from the service, the accountability equation
becomes unclear in the situation. The supplier may not care for or be sensitive to the needs of the
recipients of service, and may thus not have adequate incentive to ensure quality. In fact, the
funding agencies or their lower hierarchy may seek rent where they can manage net personal
gains, rather than drive the providers towards best performance. Recipients of service, on their
part, may have very little control over providers or recourse against delivery failures due to
difficulty of access and lack of easy recall of public servants, elected and tenured.
This broken accountability chain may further weaken recipients’ demand for quality of Project
outcomes due to public goods failure inherent in the situation. 55 All this may lower effective
monitoring and seeking recourse in event of failures or quality compromises. This calls for fixing
the system gap. The report recommends the setting up of an independent monitoring mechanism
to ensure accountability.
The report underlines several policy gaps. First, it emphasizes the need for explicit incentives for
performance in several aspects of Project outcomes. In particular, it advocates for incentivizing
OSR collection and performance of GPs in several other areas. It also calls for balancing
participation of the weaker section in gram sabhas especially to enhance their say in selection of
works. It calls for integrating various works while tendering so that tenders are not fragmented
and are of a minimum size to attract established contractors. It underlines the need for enhancing
transparency such as by pasting information on GP notice board about procurement quantities and
costs, wage payments, payment received by each laborer. This will allow villagers to have easy
access to these pieces of information and effective monitoring.
The report also advocates a compact approach in selection of work, so that approval of work is
tied to villagers undertaking feasible and monitorable social responsibilities, in lieu of receiving
public funds for their proposals. These responsibilities may include girls’ school attendance,
prevention of early marriage, birth control or improvement in sanitation.
Above all, the report underlines the need for a continuous listening to the field by an expert group
with a view to identifying programme and policy gaps and making policy proposals for correcting
institutional and policy hurdles. The recommendations of this group should be submitted directly
for consideration by the government. It is only through constant upgrading the programme and
policy environment that can significantly improve efficiency and effectiveness of rural services.
The report recommends the combining of the independent monitoring and the policy review and
development functions into one mechanism.

To conclude, the report makes the following major recommendations:

  i.    Setting up of a mechanism for independent monitoring of services and continuous




                                                72
              listening to the field with a view to identifying institutional and policy hurdles holding
              results of GSP and other rural services, and to periodically propose reform.
  ii.         Incentivise Project activities and goals such as OSR collection, and enhance transparency,
              accountability and participation (ITAP) in Project processes.
 iii.         Promote convergence of services in planning and monitoring.
 iv.          Promote compact approaches for behavior change, better monitoring and for higher
              accountability.


                            Comments from the Borrower’s on Draft ICR

This has reference to your email dated September 9, 2014. The comments of the Project
Monitoring Unit on the draft ICR are as follows:

    i)            In the rating summery the outcomes, Bank performance and borrowers performance
                  are rated Moderately Satisfactory. The project outcomes are substantial and highly
                  replicable in nature. Some of the outcomes have already been replicated and adopted
                  in non project GPs and in other programmes implemented by the Rural Development
                  and Panchayat Raj Department. To achieve this, Project Facilitation Team has put in
                  all its efforts with the help of timely intervention and support of World Bank. Bank
                  has given full co-operation and advise not only in Programme Implementation but
                  also in timely release of funds. Hence the rating of the Project Outcomes, Borrowers
                  performance and Bank performance should be ‘Satisfactory’.

    ii)           In Page no.11, para no.43, there was a mention about Project Facilitation Cell at State
                  level. The sub unit was created at Gulbarga one of the northern districts of the state to
                  cater the needs of northern taluks of the project. This has helped in better co-
                  ordination and implementation of the project.

    iii)          In page no.12 at the end of the para 44 the word effectively to be inserted (Which did
                  not happen effectively).

       iv)        In page no.13, para no.51- as per the base line report District level trainings, refresher
                  trainings and workshops were conducted to educate the stakeholders as an IEC
                  activity.
