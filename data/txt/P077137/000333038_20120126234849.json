development outcome was low, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: measures to increase efficiency\n            and cost effectiveness in the sector are well received by\n            the market. Users responded positively to the Project by\n            increasing the size of vessels operating in the project\n            waterways. Developments similar to the Project can be\n            replicated taking advantage of experience gained in inland\n            waterway network planning, macro-economic considerations,\n            technical design, safety provisions and environmental and\n            social safeguards. Overseas training plans designed for\n            implementation need to be more realistic and modest with due\n            consideration given to government regulations on overseas\n            travel. Land acquisition has become more contentious and\n            more time has to be given to resolve differences over compensation."}, "docdt": "2011-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
