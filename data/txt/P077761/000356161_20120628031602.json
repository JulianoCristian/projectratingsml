  performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: long term involvement is very important. A quality\n            implementation body is vital. Private sector market growth\n            should be carefully managed where possible. Stakeholder\n            consultation throughout the project cycle is necessary. Risk\n            analysis should be carried out also during implementation.\n            Performance-based incentives to selected developers are key\n            in enabling communities to get expert support.
