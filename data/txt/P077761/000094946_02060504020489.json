Renewable Energy for Rural Economic\n            Development Project, aims at improving the quality of rural\n            life, by utilizing off-grid renewable energy technologies,\n            to provide electricity in remote areas, and, in addition,\n            promote private sector power generation from renewable\n            energy resources for the main grid. The key components of\n            the project are: 1) grid-connected renewable energy power\n            generation, by enabling, on a large scale, the refinancing\n            support for mini-hydro projects, and, by extending support\n            to two other commercially available renewable energy sources\n            - wind and biomass; 2) solar photovoltaic (PV) investments,\n            by integrating refinance, grants, and technical assistance\n            (TA) support, aiming at solidifying the existing\n            middle-range solar home system market, and expand to smaller\n            systems accessible to the poor, and community applications\n            for health clinics, schools, public services; 3) independent\n            grid systems, which will support commercialization of\n            village hydro, and other community-based independent grid\n            systems, through refinancing, and grant support. TA will\n            address issues such as electricity use for income generation\n            activities, once the grid connection is in place, while the\n            status of independent grids within the sector reform agenda,\n            will be emphasized in the broader sector TA; 4) TA, and\n            limited credit support to prod private sector development in\n            the provision of energy efficiency services, and demand side\n            management will be provided, including the integration of\n            sustainable implementation of such programs into sector\n            reforms; 5) cross-sectoral energy applications, i.e.,\n            provision of credit support to rural enterprises, TA to\n            service institutions for energy development, and\n            co-financing support for investments in selected areas; and,\n            6) TA (in addition to the component-specific assistance) for\n            project administration, subproject promotion, technology and\n            capacity building, and, monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2002-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
