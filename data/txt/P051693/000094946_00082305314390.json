The\n            project objective has been met; the project has been highly\n            successful in promoting the strengthening of Salta's\n            fiscal situation. The operation has promoted the\n            implementation of important reforms in the health and\n            education sectors aimed at ensuring an efficient and\n            responsive delivery of public services within fiscally-sound\n            policies. The key lessons of experience include: 1)\n            Quick-disbursing loans supporting well-defined reforms can\n            be effective tools in promoting structural adjustment at the\n            sub-national level. 2) For the reforms to be sustainable, a\n            consistent system of incentives has to be in place at the\n            national and provincial levels. 3) It is important to\n            capitalize on potential windows of opportunities. 4) The\n            success of structural adjustment loans (SALs) depend on a\n            combination of factors, among the most important of which is\n            strong political support. 5) Provincial SAL operations\n            require strong coordination across sectors to ensure that\n            policy conditionality reinforce the strategies adopted in\n            each sector. 6) It is important to enhance public\n            participation and to educate the general public on the goals\n            and objectives of the reforms to ensure their success and\n            sustainability. 6) The combination of effective sector\n            leadership for reforms and participatory mechanisms in the\n            design and implementation of reforms is a powerful tool for\n            pursuing institutional change."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
