creating or permitting the creation of such lien, shall make ex-
press provision to that effect; provided, however, that, if for
any constitutional or other legal reason such provision cannot be

interest and other charges on, the Lo.an. by an equivalent lien on
other public assets satisfactory to the Bank.

lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely

ing in the ordinary course of banking transactions and securing a
debt maturing not more than one year after its date.
