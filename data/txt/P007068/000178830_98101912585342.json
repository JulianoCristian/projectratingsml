sector which, in turn, will\n            help generate employment, improve income distribution, and\n            promote regional development. In order to achieve these\n            objectives, a line of credit totalling US$55.4 million will\n            be made available to the SSE sector. CFN will also continue\n            to manage a program of technical assistance to SSEs, and\n            will receive technical assistance in order to improve its\n            financial information systems. About 1,200 subloans\n            averaging US$45,000 are expected to be made to individual\n            SSEs with fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, of no\n            more than US$350,000 equivalent. Investments partially\n            financed by these subloans are expected to create about\n            6,000 new jobs."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
