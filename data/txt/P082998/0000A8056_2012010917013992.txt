                         1.        Substantial improvement on implementation has been achieved in the last six months. Thus, in addition to the two contracts (Assosa-Blue Nile- Guba) completed last
                         August 2010, two more contracts (Gobgob-Gashena and Magna-Mechara and) have been substantially completed and handed over to ERA as of and December 20, 2010 and March
                         23,2011 respectively- bringing the total completed projects to four. Two more contracts (Gashena-Woldiya and Assela-Dodola) are expected to be completed before end of December
                         2011, while the other two (Dodola junction- Goba and Shire-Adiabun) - between April and June 2012. This is also reflected in disbursement levels which has reached 88.1 %: 11%

                         increase from the previous mission in April 2011. Shortage in supply of cement, which was a bottleneck in most of the projects in the past, is now resolved with the operational of a
                         number of new cement factories in the last six months, increasing the supply of cement in the country.

                         2. With regard to technical assistance services (TA), all are complete except the Financial Management study which was signed in September 2011 after long delays due to various
                         reasons. The study is expected to be completed in June 2012.

                         3.       Poor quality of works in urban sections, non compliance to safeguard requirements, protection of cut slope, and safety measures at work places - remain a concern in on-
                         going projects. The status of these shortcomings should be further monitored by ERA management, and be shared with various stakeholders through information dissemination
                         means to raise attention.

                         the contracts, there are concerns regarding works quality in town sections, insufficient measures taken in reinstatement of of borrow areas, protection of cut slope, and safety
                         measures in works site and project road - which need to be addressed. The status of these shortcomings should be further monitored by ERA management, and be shared with
