                         1.         Except two contracts (Assosa - Blue Nile - Guba) which are substantially completed as per their original works program, progress of the remaining civil works contracts
                         (six) are behind schedule partly due to weak site management of contractors. Some contractors have been affected by recent short supply of cement. Substantial improvement is,

                         2.        There is however a concern on works quality in town sections, insufficient measures taken for restitution of borrow areas, protection of cut slope, and safety measures in
                         works site and project road - despite repeated instructions given to the contractors by ERA to rectify. The status of these shortcomings should be further monitored by ERA Executive
                         Project Team, and be shared with various stakeholders through information sharing/dissemination means to raise attention.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Though delayed from their works program, all of the civil works are now progressing and are expected to be completed within a year or so from now. However, for some of the
                         contracts, there is concern regarding works quality in town sections, insufficient measures taken for restitution of borrow areas, protection of cut slope, and safety measures in works
                         site and project road - despite repeated instructions given to the contractors by ERA to rectify. The status of these shortcomings should be further monitored by ERA Executive
                         Project Team, and be shared with various stakeholders through information sharing/dissemination means to raise attention.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
