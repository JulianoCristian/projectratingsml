                         1.        Substantial improvement on implementation achieved in the last six months. Thus, in additional to the two contracts (Assosa-Blue Nile- Guba) completed last August 2010,
                         one more contract (Magna-Mechar) was substantially completed and handed over to ERA on 31 March 2011. Another three contracts are expected to be completed in the next 4-6

                         month, and the remaining two contracts - from January to June 2012. The is also reflected in disbursement levels which has has reached 77.4 % - a 13% increase from the previous
                         mission. The consultancy services are all progressing well, except for one contract - Consultancy Services to enhance Financial Management system of ERA ,which is currently at the
                         final stage of the selection process.

                         2.      There is however a concern on works quality in town sections, insufficient measures have been taken for restitution of borrow areas, protection of cut slope, and safety
                         measures in works site and project road - despite repeated instructions given to the contractors by ERA to rectify. The status of these shortcomings should be further monitored by
                         ERA managemnt, and be shared with various stakeholders through information sharing/dissemination means to raise attention.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         With the current rate of progress, it is expected in addition to the three completed projects, three more will be substantially completed and open for traffic in within 4-6 months, and the
                         remaining two with a year or so from now. However, in some of the contracts, there are concerns regarding works quality in town sections, insufficient measures taken for
                         reinstatement of of borrow areas, protection of cut slope, and safety measures in works site and project road - despite repeated instructions given to the contractors by ERA to rectify.
                         The status of these shortcomings should be further monitored by ERA management, and be shared with various stakeholders through information sharing/dissemination means to
                         raise attention.
