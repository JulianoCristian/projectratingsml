Project development objective Ref. Section Bank Response
The objectives of the project remain unchanged from the APL2, as originally stated, namely, to
assist the Recipient in increasing its road transport infrastructure and improving the reliability
thereof, strengthening the capacity for road construction, management and maintenance, and
creating conditions conducive to private sector participation in the road transport sector. The
additional financing would help in meeting all of the objectives of APL2.

Project description [one-sentence summary of each component] Ref. Section Bank Response
The project has five components: A) Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Federal Trunk and Link
Roads through the (i) Upgrading of the Assela-Dodola & Shashemene-Goba road (246 km); (ii)
Upgrading of the Shashemene-Dodola Junction road (70 km); (iii) Upgrading of the Gob Gob-
Gashena -Woldiya road (194 km); (iv) The upgrading of the Adwa-Shire road (83km) - and the
related construction supervision. B) Construction of Federal/Link and Regional Rural Roads
through (i) the Construction of the Magna-Mechara road (119 km); and (ii) the Construction of
the Assossa/Sherkole-Guba road (137 km) - and the related construction supervision. C) Support
to the Rural Travel and Transport Program through the (i) Preparation of 40 Wereda Integrated
Development Plans; and (ii) Support to establishment of ERTTP institutional arrangements. D)
Institutional Strengthening of ERA. E) Support to accomplishment of Program Objectives
through providing consultancy services to carry out feasibility and EIA studies, as well as design
and design review for roads projects to be included under follow-on operations (APL3, APL4
and by other donors).

Which safeguard policies are triggered, if any? Ref. Section Appraisal of Project Activities
With the original financing of the APL2 project, Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs),
including Environmental Management Plans (EMP), and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for
the above roads were disclosed in Ethiopia and at the Bank's Infoshop in April 2004. The
Dodola junction - Guba road was part of these environmental assessments, as was the existing 6
km road section running through the northern part of the Bale Mountain National Park. The
EMPs for all APL2 roads have been updated following the October 2009 environmental
supervision mission and will be implemented under the proposed second additional financing.
Based on ongoing and future APL2 activities, the Bank's safeguard policies OP 4.01
Environmental Assessment, OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, and OP 4.04 Natural Habitats
have been triggered (due to an oversight, OP 4.04 was not shown as triggered in earlier project
documentation). Also, OP/BP 4.11 (Physical Cultural Resources) was triggered as the policy
applies whenever OP 4.01 applies, i.e. whenever there is likely to be significant civil works.
 I.    Introduction

1.     This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide additional
financing (IDA-Credit) in the amounts of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 65.3 million
(US$100.0 million equivalent) to the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for the ongoing
Road Sector Development Stage II Project ­ APL2 (Credits 39890-ET, and 39891-ET). A 24-
month extension is also sought to extend the closing date of the original project (Cr. 39890-ET),
from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012, to bring it in line with the closing date of the first
additional financing. No changes in the project development objectives, components or
implementation modalities are proposed.

2.      The proposed additional financing would primarily be used to complete the second stage
of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) by covering cost overrun related to surface type design
change from double bituminous surface treatment (DBST) to asphalt concrete (AC) surface
responding to the growing traffic and expansion of town/urban sections reflecting recent
economic growth and urbanization on some of the roads, increased quantities of work items, as
well as construction materials price escalation in the recent years.

3.      The main financing partner for this credit remains the Government of Ethiopia (GOE).
Specific activities are financed by various other donors and are listed in Annex 2 of the original
Project Appraisal Document (PAD Report No. 29877-ET) dated August 23, 2004. The Ethiopian
Roads Authority (ERA) will continue to manage donor coordination arrangements in
consultation with major financing partners.

II.    Background and Rationale for Additional Financing

4.     Country context: Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an average
income per capita of around US$400. The population is estimated by the 2007 census to be 73.9
million people, with 16 percent living in urban areas, and a growth rate of 2.6 percent per
annum. Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa with a land area of about 1.1
million sq km. The fertile highland plateau is used for agriculture and livestock rearing and the
Great Rift Valley, running north to south, splits the plateau into west and east sections.

5.     During FY09, the Ethiopian economy defied the global norm and continued to grow
robustly amidst one of the worst global crises of our time. The economy registered a growth rate
of 9.9 percent (against the IMF's projection of 7.5 percent) - one of the highest in the world.
During the same period, the GOE also managed to successfully deal with its two most pressing
macro-economic problems: high and rapidly growing inflation rate and dwindling foreign
exchange reserves. At the end-of-period, inflation rate fell from the peak of 64 percent in July
2008 to 2.7 percent by June 2009 and further to 0.6 percent by November 2009. Similarly, the
foreign exchange reserves, measured in number of months of imports, increased from a low of
four weeks (or US$800 million) in October 2008 to seven and a half weeks by June 2009 and
then to eight weeks by November 2009 (i.e. US$1.8 billion). The GOE also tightened fiscal
policy and controlled aggregate demand. As a result, the general government domestic
borrowing was reduced to zero in FY09 from 2.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in


                                                1
FY08, by containing expenditure and enhancing revenue mobilization through administrative
measures. The general government fiscal deficit was reduced from 2.9 percent of GDP in FY08
to 1.2 percent of GDP during FY09.

6.      One of the strongest aspects of Ethiopia's fiscal policy is the large and increasing pro-
poor sector spending as a share of the general government budget. Ethiopia's spending on pro-
poor sectors is among the highest in Africa, accounting for over 60 percent of its annual budget.
Spending on pro-poor sectors however has fallen in recent years, both as a share of GDP as well
as a share of total expenditure because of the increased spending on urban housing for poor,
which has traditionally not been included in pro-poor spending, and also due to decline in
overall resource envelope. Pro-poor spending covers water, health and education, improvement
of infrastructure and market connectivity; and rural food security and safety net programs.

7.      The Transport System: Ethiopia's transport infrastructure comprises: (i) a classified
road network estimated (December 2009) at 46,812 km (compared to 24,970 km in 1997) with
about 21,172 km of federal roads (6,938 km asphalt paved) and 25,640 km regional roads ­
along with unclassified rural access roads estimated at some 85,767 km; (ii) a 781 km railway
line from Addis Ababa to Djibouti (about 709 km within Ethiopia); (iii) air transport facilities,
including four international airports, five major domestic airports, and more than 30 other
domestic runways and airstrips; and (iv) a national merchant marine. Almost 98 percent of the
country's export and import needs are presently served through Djibouti port, of which over 97
percent is transported by road.

8.      Original Credit and First Additional Financing: The original APL2 Credit of SDR
110 million (US$160.9 million equivalent) was appraised in May 2004, and approved on
September 22, 2004 with a closing date June 30, 2010. The appraised engineer's cost estimate
was based on the 2003 market price with the costs comparable to unit costs of adjacent sections
and offered prices in country of other contracts in similar terrain and pavement standards
recently awarded. In August 2005, the bids for the eight International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) works bids were opened, and the bid prices offered by the bidders were found to be
higher by between 25 and 201 percent above the appraised prices. Out of the eight contracts,
four contracts were awarded at a price on average about 52 percent above the allocated budget,
and the other four contracts were retendered due to a lack of competition. World market price
increases and the lack of competition were considered the main reasons for the high bid prices.

9.      The first additional financing (AF) of SDR59.8 million (US$87.3 million equivalent)
was requested to fill the financing gap that arose from the awarded prices and the updated
engineer's cost estimates of the four contracts to be retendered. It was approved on June 22,
2006 with an extended closing date of June 30, 2012 considering the anticipated delay due to
the retendering process. The four retendered contracts were opened in February 2007, and it
was found that the retendered bid prices were, on average, some five percent less than the first
bid prices, and were awarded on that basis ­ broadly confirming the accuracy of the estimation
basis for the first additional financing.

10.     The objectives of the project remained unchanged from the original APL2, as stated, to
assist the Recipient/Borrower in increasing its road transport infrastructure and improving the


                                               2
reliability thereof, strengthening the capacity for road construction, management and
maintenance, and creating conditions conducive to private sector participation in the road
transport sector.

11.      The project has five components: (i) Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Federal Trunk and
Link Roads through the (a) Upgrading of the Assela-Dodola & Shashemene-Goba road (246
km); (b) Upgrading of the Shashemene-Dodola Junction road (70 km); (c) Upgrading of the
Gob Gob-Gashena ­Woldiya road (194 km); (d) The upgrading of the Adwa-Shire road (83km)
­ and the related construction supervision. (ii) Construction of Federal/Link and Regional/Rural
Roads through the: (a) Construction of the Magna-Mechara road (119 km); and (b) the
Construction of the Assossa/Sherkole-Guba road (137 km) ­ and the related construction
supervision. (iii) Support to the Rural Travel and Transport Program through the (a)
Preparation of 40 Woreda Integrated Development Plans; and (b) Support to establishment of
Ethiopian Rural Travel and Transport Program (ERTTP) institutional arrangements. (iv)
Institutional Strengthening of ERA. (v) Support to accomplishment of Program Objectives
through providing consultancy services to carry out feasibility and EIA studies, as well as
design and design review for roads projects to be included under follow-on operations (by IDA
and by other donors).

12.     The APL2 project overlapped with the Stage I of the IDA financed Adaptable Program
Lending (APL1) project which was approved June 2003 and closed December 31, 2009. The
Stages III and IV APLs were approved in June 2007 and June 2009, respectively, and their
implementation is in progress. The overall APL, three other completed IDA Credits and other
projects funded by various donors support the GOE's Road Sector Development Program
(RSDP). The RSDP is a rolling program in three phases implemented from July 1, 1997 with
two elapsed five-year phases and an ongoing RSDP Phase III scheduled to close June 30, 2010.

13.     Proposed Second Additional Financing: During implementation of the civil works
contracts, the Borrower requested IDA's No Objection to change surface type design for
Assela-Dodola-Goba and Gob Gob­Gashena road projects from the designed DBST to AC to
respond to reported increase in traffic with a higher growth rate than anticipated at the design
stage. The additional resources required for these surface type changes were not considered at
the time of the first additional financing request since the Borrower confirmed the need with the
related evidence only during project implementation. In addition, increased quantities of various
works items had been necessitated ­ including those responding to expansion of some urban and
town sections ­ together with higher prices of construction inputs and inflation rate that have
prevailed in the country since the approval of the first additional finance (June 22, 2006). The
need to address these factors is considered essential for the successful completion of APL2
Project.

14.     The Borrower, therefore, has requested a second additional financing to fill the financing
shortfall in completing the ongoing works by covering various variation orders and increased
quantities as mentioned above, and help mitigate the effects of the high price escalation and
inflation on the APL2 eight ICB works contracts. The evolution of market prices and the
average inflation rate that the country has experienced in the last three years provide the basis
for re-estimating the additional costs of the project. Now that the required variation orders and


                                               3
 the quantity increase have been fully identified, and the inflation is stabilized, the second
 additional financing is requested on the basis of a robust revised estimate of cost.

 15.     Project performance: The last Supervision Mission in October 2009 rated the overall
 performance as satisfactory with regards to implementation status and meeting the expected
 project development objectives; and the related outcomes and outputs. There have been no
 changes to the original objectives and basic project design, except for the confirmed road
 contract variation orders, and the project has remained in compliance with legal covenants.

 16.    Since the launch of RSDP I (1997), GOE has made remarkable progress in the sector in
 physical, organizational, social, and financial terms. During RSDP I, 8,709 km of roads were
 constructed or rehabilitated ­ of which 2,709 km were federal roads and 6,000 km were newly
 constructed regional roads. During RSDP II, 988 km of roads were rehabilitated, 1,758 km
 upgraded and 628 km constructed as new gravel roads ­ while heavy/emergency maintenance
 was carried out on 4,199 km of asphalt and gravel roads. In addition, 85,767 km of community
 roads were constructed (December 2009) by woredas (local districts). The total classified road
 network of the country reached 46,812 km by the end of December 2009. The overall road
 network in Ethiopia therefore increased by an average of five percent per year between 1997
 and 2009. Table 1 below summarizes the achievements of the road works between 1997 and
 2009, measured in terms of selected access and impact indicators; and the GOE's target values.

 17.     The disbursed amount as of April 7, 2010 stood at approximately US$179.56 million
 which is 70 percent of the total credit amount including the first additional financing. According
 to the disbursement plan by ERA as part of its Action Plan (Annex 5), it is estimated that the
 current balance (approximately US$77.42 million) will be depleted before the end of 2010.

III.      Proposed Changes

 18.     Extension: The proposed additional financing would require extending the closing date
 of the original project by 24 months, from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012, to coincide with the
 closing date of the first additional financing, to allow contract implementation to continue
 utilizing the resources for the entire project, including those for the first and second additional
 financing resources. GOE's letter requesting for the extension of credit closing date and ERA's
 Action Plan have been received by the Bank are attached as Annex 5.



                                                       4
19.     As previously noted, there are no changes in the Project's Development Objectives and
design of the project components, except for the contractual variation orders accepted as
essential, and their implementation modalities. The overall scope of the project in terms of the
components to be financed with IDA funds (including the additional financing) remains the
same as defined in APL2 PAD, except for one sub-component (upgrading of the Shashemene-
Dodola Junction Road), which the GOE decided at the time of the first additional financing to
finance from its own resources, for the national competitive bidding contracts, as these require
100 percent of local currency only ­ thus no IDA financing was required (Project Paper-Report
No. 36265-ET dated May 23, 2006).

20.     Financing Plan: Part of the second additional financing will cover the cost overrun (due
to design variations in the surface type, improvements in some town section roads, increased
works quantities, etc.) and price escalation of construction inputs which has increased
significantly during the last three years. The change in cost of the initial road works affects all
ongoing APL2 road contracts. The additional financing will therefore allow the completion of
the ongoing civil works component. The revised costs and financing by component and source
of financing at the original/initial APL projectand at the first and the proposed second additional
financing are presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4 below with more details presented in Annex 3. Out
of the proposed total US$147.14 million funding gap, IDA will finance US$100 million and the
remaining balance of US$47.14 million will be financed by GOE.

Safeguard Policies that Might Apply

21.     Environment and Social. As was the case under the original APL2 project, the
proposed additional financing operation will trigger OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment; OP
4.12 Involuntary Resettlement; OP 4.04 Natural Habitats; and OP 4.11 Physical Cultural
Resources due to the planned construction and rehabilitation of roads. Due to an oversight, OP
4.11 and OP 4.04 were not shown as being triggered in the original project documentation. As
the objectives and scope of the additional financing operation remains the same as that of the
original APL2 project, the original Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs) for APL2 remain valid and do not require revisions. The EIA reports
discussed the potential adverse environmental and social impacts of road construction and
rehabilitation, including potential impacts on the Bale Mountain National Park and physical
cultural resources. The original EIA reports and the original RAPs were disclosed in Ethiopia
on April 5, 2004, and at the Bank's Infoshop on May 5, 2004. Social mitigation measures have
included and will continue to include prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS).

22.     In the course of the recent APL2 environmental supervision mission, in October 2009,
the safeguard implementation status has been rated as moderately satisfactory due to gaps in the
implementation of appropriate environmental mitigation measures across contracts. The mission
determined that the original Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) would need to be
updated to reflect the current circumstances at the various construction sites, particularly as
regards the existing road (6 km) running through the Bale Mountain National Park. The eight
EMPs for APL 2 contracts were updated accordingly by the contractors and sent to ERA for

                                                              6
review and comments. The EMPs outline the institutional arrangements for environmental
management during road construction and rehabilitation, and are included in the bidding
documents. The updated EMPs were disclosed on March 4, 2010 on the ERA website in
Ethiopia, and during the appraisal, were submitted to the Bank for disclosure at the Bank's
InfoShop (the EMPs were disclosed between March 4 and 9, 2010). Furthermore, as a result of
the continuous dialogue between the Bank and country representatives regarding safeguards
issues during the implementation of APL1 and APL2, the Ethiopian Parliament on July 15,
2005 issued a new compensation law which has much parity with Bank's OP 4.12 Involuntary
Resettlement. The project RAPs that are being undertaken during project implementation
comply with OP 4.12.

23.     Procurement. No additional procurement is envisaged under this additional financing.
All civil works contracts have now been awarded and are ongoing with the overall works
progress as of end February 2010 estimated at 61 percent (physical), but still behind the works
program in general. Enhanced supervision of the works and due diligence review of variation
orders (VOs) by the Client/ERA therefore will continue to be critical for the acceptable cost and
the timely and quality completion of the works. ERA's contract management capacity was
evaluated during the appraisal, and was confirmed as adequate. In addition the justification of
the VOs was reviewed prior to the appraisal. All consultancy service contracts have also been
awarded and are progressing well with some of them completed - except for the procurement of
the technical advisory services (TA) for financial management support to ERA, which is
currently under revision to reflect the nation-wide Business Process Re-engineering outcomes.
The procurement plan was updated by ERA, and was reviewed and found reasonable during the
appraisal.

24.     The proper and professional management of both the consultancy services contracts for
construction supervision and of the civil works contracts is the critical and challenging area of
concern. The high turnover of skilled staff coupled with poor performance by design and
supervision consultants may increase the risk of further cost and time overruns of the contracts.
However, the ERA contract administration team is implementing an action plan to control
quality, cost and time overruns, as well as to ensure timely implementation of the works. The
action plan was reviewed during appraisal and was found to be satisfactory. Further, under
APL3 TA support to strengthen/establish consultants' and contractors' performance monitoring
system, unit costs monitoring system, quality assurance system in procurement, etc. have been
included. These TA services/ supports are ongoing, and should be utilized to enhance ERA's
capacity for contracts administration/management.

25.     Financial Management. Based on the latest FM implementation review mission,
conducted in October 2009, the overall financial management performance for the project is
rated as moderately satisfactory. ERA has adequate accounting, information management and
budgetary control systems. It has adequate and qualified finance staff and strong internal control
system. The Interim Financial Reports of all Bank financed projects implemented by ERA are
now being submitted within the deadline stipulated in the legal agreements. Similarly project
audit reports were submitted within the due date and there is improvement in the timeliness of
entity audit report submission. The entity audit report for the year ended July 7, 2009 was
submitted on February 10, 2010, one month after the due date. However, the entity audit report


                                               7
    was qualified due to limitation in evidence because of unsatisfactory system of internal control
    over the physical inventory and the evaluation of goods in warehouse. All considered the
    financial management systems put in place by ERA for the existing project and additional
    financing are adequate to produce timely reports for monitoring project progress as required by
    OP/BP 10.02.

IV.       Appraisal Summary
    Economic Analysis based on Updated Costs

    26.      The economic viability of the road projects under APL2 was reanalyzed using the
    increased costs of works and the updated traffic volumes. The critical input parameters have
    changed, resulting in changes in economic rate of return of the project. Base year traffic volume
    has increased largely due to rapid economic growth that reached up to 10 percent per annum for
    the latest subsequent years. In addition to the significant increase in the construction cost that
    triggered a need for additional financing, several other physical and non-physical costs have
    also increased due to economic growth and inflation in the country, and international trends (for
    details, ref. Annex 4).

    27.      Economic analysis for the three existing road sections 1 was carried out using Highway
    Development and Management Model Version 4 (HDM4) consistent with the original analysis
    (although the original analysis was carried out using the older version, HDM3, the two models
    share the same analytical framework and basic features). Economic feasibility of the
    construction of the two new sections (Magna-Mechara and Assosa/Sherkole-Guba), where no
    current traffic data is available, was analyzed using producers' surplus approach, assuming that
    the agriculture activities in the influenced areas were similar to those used at appraisal and for
    the first additional financing.

    28.     Economic analysis for these roads had also been carried out earlier (during the first
    additional financing in May 2006) with different construction and maintenance alternatives. The
    then traffic forecast and analysis justified the road to be upgraded from gravel to DBST. The
    construction and maintenance alternatives for the HDM analysis were defined based on the
    improvement options identified for these projects which are summarized in Table 6. The present
    analysis assumes the same start of the construction as for the previous analysis (2006/2007) and
    lasts for 3.5 years due to the additional works, as opposed to the three years in the previous
    analysis, with the road opening to traffic in 2010/2011. The analysis period is 20 years (up to
    2026).

 29.      Recommendation: As presented in Table 7, the upgrading of road to a higher level of
 standard as well as new construction of gravel roads are justified. The economic internal rate of
 return (EIRR) for all road sections exceeds 10 percent. Based on the economic analysis of the
 project options (using revised costs) as well as overall engineering and traffic assessment, it is
 concluded economical to carry out the works as recommended. Details of the economic analysis
 are summarized in Annex 4.

 V.         Expected Outcomes
  30.     There will be no substantial changes in the project's expected outcomes. However, the
  outcome indicators in the Results Framework and Monitoring have been updated
  accommodating the sector core indicators, as well as the extension of the closing date from June
  30, 2010 to June 30, 2012. Also, to avoid duplication of the outcome indicators, the program
  indicators (such as roads in good and fair condition, number of the beneficiaries, etc.) are now
  being monitored under Stage IV Project (APL4) and have been excluded from the updated
  outcome indicators (ref. Annex 1).

VI.         Benefits and Risks
  31.     The outcome of the economic analysis as shown above confirms the benefits of this
  project. The risks associated with this additional financing remain unchanged from those
  already identified in the original PAD (Report No. 29877-ET) dated August 23, 2004. The
  updated Risks and Mitigation table reflecting the recent development is presented in Annex 2.
  Country-specific risks addressed in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), approved on April
  2, 2008 still remain valid.

VII.        Financial Terms and Conditions for the Additional Financing
  32.     The additional financing is provided as a credit on standard IDA Credit terms for
  Ethiopia (i.e., principal amount repayable in 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years). The
  financial management and disbursement arrangements for APL2 will be equally applicable for
  the additional financing. The current financial management and disbursement arrangements for
  APL2 are adequate to handle the financial transactions of the additional financing. While the
  audited ERA entity for the year ended July 7, 2009 was submitted on February 10, 2010 - one
  month after the due date, the project financial statements (APL1, APL2 and APL3) were
  received by the Bank within the due date.

                       Annex 4: Economic Analysis based on Updated Cost

1.      The economic viability of the road projects under Adaptable Program Loan (APL2) was
reanalyzed using the increased costs of works and the updated traffic volumes. The critical input
parameters have changed, resulting in changes in economic rate of return of the project. Base
year traffic volume has increased largely due to rapid economic growth that reached up to 10
percent per annum for the latest subsequent years, and new base year traffic volumes by section
are summarized in Table 1.

2.      In addition to the significant increase in the construction costs that triggered a need for
additional financing, several other physical and non-physical costs have increased due to
economic growth and inflation in the country, and international trends. Table 2 exhibits changes
in input costs (economic, not financial) that affect economic feasibility of the project under
three categories - maintenance unit costs, monetary value of travel time, and vehicle operating
related unit costs. As the table suggests, most of the input parameters have significantly
increased from the values estimated in 2002. Notable changes are found in the maintenance unit
costs, which have increased up to 720 percent between 2002 and 2008. Crew wages and value
of travel time have also significantly increased. An increase in fuel prices is also notable,
reaching five to six fold.

    3.     Economic analysis for the three existing road sections 1 was carried out using Highway
    Development and Management Model (HDM4) in order to be consistent with the original
    analysis (although the original analysis was carried out using the older version, HDM3, the two
    models share the same analytical framework and basic features). The proposed options were
    compared with a "do minimum" case, which assumes a minimum amount of maintenance works
    on the existing road. For each road section under the project, benefits to road users were
    estimated in terms of savings in VOCs and travel time, derived from improved road conditions.
    Then the net benefits were calculated against the total agency costs, including capital
    investment and maintenance costs over the life of the project. Net benefits over the life of the
    project were discounted at a rate of 10 percent. Sensitivity analysis was done for various
    scenarios of costs and benefits, consistent with the original analysis. The results are presented in
    Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRRs) and Net Present Values (NPVs).

    4.      Economic feasibility of the construction of the two new sections, 2 where no current
    traffic data is available, was analyzed using producers surplus approach. The analysis used
    similar assumptions on the agriculture activities in the influenced areas to be consistent with the
    previous analyses (appraisal and the first additional financing). Agriculture prices, which then
    affect producers' surplus, as well as unit costs for vehicle operating costs were adjusted
    reflecting the recent inflation, but based on conservative estimation (used inflation rates
    available from International Monitory Fund country database). Producers' surplus and agency's
    costs over the project life were then discounted to the present value at a rate of 10 percent. The
    results are presented in EIRRs and NPVs.

    5.      For a project to be acceptable for implementation, the proposed investments have to
    result in an EIRR that is at least equal to the opportunity cost of capital in Ethiopia, which is set
    at 10 percent. NPVs are calculated using opportunity cost of capital as the discount rate. The
    economic analysis is done for various alternatives as shown below.

    6.     Construction Alternatives: The surfaces of two road projects (Assela-Goba, GobGob-
    Woldiya) have been proposed to change from the designed Double Bituminous Surface
    Treatment (DBST) to Asphalt Concrete (AC), due to higher than anticipated traffic increase
    from what was forecasted during the design stage. Thus, construction and maintenance
    alternative for the HDM analysis were defined based on the improvement options identified for
    these projects. For each alternative defined, a set of maintenance and improvement standards
    was assigned. The maintenance and improvement standards define the work items proposed on
    the project road over the analysis period. The different alternatives proposed for each road
    section are given below in Table 3. For other road projects under APL2, economic analysis was
    carried out to verify the appropriateness of additional investment in regard to the additional
    works included as variation orders (increased quantities, widening of town sections, etc.).

           Assosa/Sherkole-Guba                                                                   Not built                            New Gravel Road

    7.     Economic analysis for these roads had also been carried out earlier (during the first
    additional financing in May 2006), but with different construction and maintenance alternatives.
    The then traffic forecast and analysis justified the road to be upgraded from gravel to DBST.
    However, the rapid economic growth in the last six years in the country, and particularly in the
    project vicinity area, has brought a substantial change in traffic volume and composition on the
    roads under discussion, which necessitated change in road surface type. Basically, the analysis
    assumes the same start of the construction as was in the previous analysis (2006/2007) and lasts
    for 3.5 years due to the additional works, as opposed to the proposed three years in the previous
    analysis, with the road opening to traffic in 2010/2011. The analysis period is 20 years, i.e., to
    the year 2026. The investment spread was assumed to be: 2008: 10 percent, 2009: 45 percent,
    and 2010: 45 percent.

    8.     As presented in Table 4, the upgrading of road to a higher level of standard and the
    recommended solutions are justified; the EIRR for all road sections exceeds 10 percent. The key
    factors include: (i) current and expected traffic along the routes over the analysis period; and (ii)
    input user costs that have been significantly increased due to economic growth and inflation.
    Among three existing roads, GobGob-Woldiya section had highest EIRR value, attributed to
    worse initial condition of existing gravel road 3 and greater grade and horizontal curvature 4, than
    other roads. On the other hand, Shire-AdiAbun/Adwa section had the lowest EIRR value
    mainly due to its high construction cost, due to a by-pass section of the Axum town.

  The initial condition of existing gravel roads is negatively correlated with the capital and recurrent costs of do-
minimum case. The thickness of Gashena-Woldiya sub-section is 140 mm, thinner than any other sub-sections,
resulting in early intervention (regraveling in the 2nd year) under the do-minimum case. This makes EIRR of AC
option higher. The relationship between initial thickness and capital cost per km is depicted in the figure below.

    This amplifies the impact of improved pavement on VOC.

9.     EIRR values for the two new roads (Magna-Mechara and Assosa/Sherkole-Guba) were
estimated lower, ranging around 12-15 percent. This was mainly because of the different
approach based on producers' surplus and more conservative inputs that were used because
there is no base value for initial traffic.

10. Recommendation: Based on the economic analysis of the project options (using revised
costs) as well as overall engineering and traffic assessment, it is concluded economical to
upgrade these roads to AC standard (see below) and carry out additional works as
recommended, as well as the new construction of gravel road sections.

            Extension of Road Sector Development Program- APL 2 (39890-ET)


I.     The Projects and Follow-up Mechanism

The implementation of Adaptable Program Loan (APL2) project is proceeding well with
different stages of levels of status of civil works contracts. However, it is now clear that the
project will not be completed within the originally intended period. The main reasons
contributing to the necessity of extending the closing date up to the end of June 2012 are partly
due to the increased quantities, but also due to Ethiopian Roads Authority's (ERA) Risk Events
which are beyond its control such as inclement weather conditions, and recent rapid economic
development along the project sites. The works contracts under APL 2 have recorded delays and
cost overrun as a result of additional works, unfavorable weather conditions and price escalation.
In order to enhance progress, ERA has been conducting several meetings with the contractors
and consultants at various levels in the presence of the project engineers (ERA representatives),
project managers and ERA's counterpart Engineers. In the monthly progress meetings, issues
such as progress of works, Right of Ways, design and variation issues have been thoroughly
discussed and remedial measures are being taken to improve the situation.

To expedite the works progress and ensure timely response and decision makings on contractual
and technical issues/problems, the ERA has already put in place an enhanced supervision and
auditing system through frequent higher management site visits, forming an Executive Project
Team for civil works contracts constituting the Director General, Deputy Director Generals,
Manager of the Construction Contract Implementation Division and any of the Branch or section
Heads concerned, Design and Technical Support Division and Road Inspectorates. The
headquarters of the construction firms have also been contacted to strengthen their backstop
system to support their site offices and to communicate directly with ERA on critical issues. Of
civil works contracts Contractual and technical issues, including review of design changes,
variation orders, poor works quality and delays are now directly and thoroughly reviewed by the
Executive Project Team, and remedial measures have been and will be taken in timely and
efficient manner, involving as necessary the contractor's headquarters. The ERA management is
committed to continue strengthening the site supervision under the Executive Project Team and
closely monitor and evaluate the progress, quality and costs of the works.

As a result substantial improvements have been recorded as mentioned below in Section II. In
terms of physical progress of works, still some delays remain inevitable due to additional works
instructed and unfavorable weather conditions in most of the project areas as mentioned above.
Therefore, ERA requests the extension of the APL2 project closing date for 24 months.

As part of it continual effort to improve the situation in the road sector, the ERA has also
committed an agreement with international consultants having a great reputation on consultancy
services for review of Road Sector Development Programmes, Capacity Building Programmes,
Performance Monitoring and Unit Rate Systems and Technical Assistance for Quality
Assurances. Egis BCEOM International of France and WSP of UK are now working on separate
agreements with ERA on the above mentioned programmes and provide technical assistances.

                                                28
WSP, in particular, is currently working on development of Performance Monitoring and Unit
Rates Systems taking into consideration the various geographical nature of the Country, which
will help in establishing a reasonable project specific cost at a particular region or location.

ERA has also developed internal performance evaluation techniques to monitor the performance
of contractors. Thus, each contractor is now being monitored and evaluated using the evaluation
system. The results of the monitoring systems are being communicated to ERA's Engineering
Service Procurement, Design and Technical Support Division on a monthly basis - so that each
contractor's performance is being considered during tender evaluation as appropriate

One of the major problems facing ERA has been timely settling of claims that arise during the
course of implementation. To this effect, as part of the contact, Dispute Review Experts (DREs)
are recruited to all on-going contracts - including those under the World Bank financed projects.
It is expected that these experts would assist ERA in settling claims in case both parties fail to
resolve their differences.

The following is the details of the current status of the individual contracts and Action Plan with
remedial measures to enhance the implementation progress thorough review of variation orders,
cost monitoring and quality.


II.    Status and Action Plan for Speeding up the Progress of Civil Works

1. Nazareth ­ Assela ­ Dodola & Shashemene ­ Goba Road Upgrading Project
             Contract 2: Assela ­ Dodola Junction (116.5 Km.)

Status
The construction of this project has shown slow progress. According to the Contractor's first
revised works program, the Contractor planned to accomplish 67.6 percent of the works before
the end of January 2010. However, he achieved only 33.1 percent - which is 34.5 percent behind
his program.

The Executive Project Team identified the major reasons of delaying factors as poor site
management, shortage of available machineries, delay in production of construction materials,
repeated works on pavement due to poor quality, etc.

Action Plan
With respect of these shortcomings, the Contractor and its headquarters have been instructed to
take all the possible remedial measures to compensate the delay. With regard to the poor
management of resources, the Contractor has taken actions by replacing and mobilizing new
management staffs at the site level. In addition the Contractor has also mobilized additional
staffs to fill the gap of the lack of skilled laborers that the project had faced. Additional
equipment is also being mobilized to speed up the progress. As a result, the Contractor is now
performing better than before. Nevertheless, in light of the fact that the Contractor's progress is
not sufficient enough to make up the slippage and to guarantee timely completion of the project,
the ERA has brought the case to the Contractor's Head Office and called for a senior

                                                29
management meeting between the Contractor's HQ management and ERA teams led by the
Director General. The outcome of the meeting is expected to result better progress of works and
improved management.

In relation to the Variation Order issued for the change of the wearing course from DBST to AC,
the unit rates for the AC has been fixed by the Engineer according to the Contract provision.
However, the ERA and Contractor could not come into an agreed rate although repeated
meetings and discussions were made. Recently, the Contractor has submitted a reduced unit rate
than its previous quotations and both parties are now working together to arrive at an agreed rate
as soon as possible.

2. Nazareth ­ Assela ­ Dodola & Shashemene ­ Goba Road Upgrading Project
         Contract 3: Dodola Junction­ Goba Road Project (132.65 Km)

Status
As per the Contractor's works progress up to the end of January 2010, most of the activities of
the permanent works are in line with the schedule. According to the Contractor's first revised
work schedule, the Contractor planned to accomplish 48.01 percent of work up to the end of
January 2010 and attained 35.87 percent with 12.14 percent slippage. The base course and
wearing course construction progress is however very slow.

The problems observed during the Executive Project Team visit which led to the slow progress
are shortage of construction equipment, lack of proper maintenance, unsatisfactory pipe and pre-
cast rectangular paved water way production, delay in supply of the required asphalt material,
and lack of provision of skilled labors which critically affected the works progress.

Action Plan
Progress meetings have since long been addressing the Contractor's resource management
weakness. Despite several meetings at the site level, and at the ERA head office, the Contractor
could not take practical measures to the satisfaction of the Engineer.

In July 2009, ERA has called the President of the Contractor and conducted an extensive meeting
on mitigation measures. As a result an agreement was reached to improve the situation. As a first
step, additional resources from the Contractor's own fleet were mobilized which covered 80
percent of the requirement, and the remaining plant and equipment were rented from the local
suppliers. Currently the available equipment and plant on site is satisfactory. The Contractor's
previous site management staffs have already been replaced. Additional staffs are mobilized. The
Contractor has, in addition to mobilizing resources, revised his works programme in such a
manner that his resources are planned to give utmost outputs. As a result sectional completion is
agreed as a strategy and he has organized his resources in two main fronts to work on 30km
length each. In addition to the two fronts opened, the Contractor has further been advised by the
Executive Project Team to open an additional new construction front to further enhance its
progress.

The Contractor has already installed the AC plant and all related equipment and plan are on site.
The AC plant is now in the process of commissioning and will start production once it is

                                               30
accepted. The Contractor has produced sufficient aggregate to expedite the base course activities
and commenced the AC wearing courses. At the moment, the Contractor is carrying out the mix-
designs and is expected to be completed within the coming two weeks, and sooner, he is
expected to commence job-mix-design and placing of AC wearing courses on trial section for the
approval of the Engineer.

The Executive Project Team is of the view that the progress of this project is showing
improvements and given the improved management and work progress, it is expected that project
would be completed as planned. Nevertheless, the Executive Project Team will continue closely
monitoring and evaluating the progress of the works.

3. Woreta ­ Woldiya Road Upgrading Project Contract 2: Gob Gob ­ Gashena (86km)

Status
The Contractor has been grated 59 day of EOT as a result of the change of the DBST to AC, and
the revised completion date was set to March 29, 2010. However the Contractor has forwarded
its disagreement against the awarded time and the issue is now referred to the Dispute Review
Expert for its recommendation.

As per the revised contract, including the amounts due to change of the wearing course from
DBST to AC, the Contractor has achieved an overall progress of 62.60 percent against his plan
of 64.4 percent. With respect to progress of individual works, the Contractor has accomplished
the construction of the earthworks and drainage works as planned. In regards to the sub base
activity, there was some delay due to heavy rain in the last rainy season.

Action Plan
ERA has made frequent meetings, both at site and head office management levels involving
Executive Project Team and the Contractor to discuss the way forward to mitigate the delays. As
a result the overall rate of progress of the works has now greatly improved. Notwithstanding
such an improved progress, ERA is still making further push over the Contractor to complete the
works within the contract time. AC wearing course has been commenced in December 2009, and
to-date 30kms of the AC wearing course completed out of the total length of 86km. The
Contractor has produced sufficient aggregate for base course and asphalt wearing course. The
aggregate production is expected to be completed in March 2010.

Despite the efforts and progress as mentioned above, the Contractor has less than two months
time before the contractual completion of the project. With the current pace and the remaining
works load, the Executive Project Team concluded that the Contractor would not be able to
finish the project within the Contract time, and further enhanced works execution during the
defects liability period would become necessary ­ which would be an event for triggering
liquidation damage. The Executive Project Team will therefore continue monitoring and
evaluating the works progress and requesting for necessary interventions by the Contractor's
headquarters.

 4. Woreta ­ Woldiya Road Upgrading Project Contract 3: Gashena ­ Woldiya (108 km)



                                               31
Status
The original completion time, as per the contract, is 28th February 2010. As per the revised works
programme, the Contractor planned to accomplish 98.43 percent of the works by the end of
January 2010; however, the actual accomplishment is 97.0 percent with a slippage of only 1.43
percent. The Contractor has substantially finished the works. Only 4km (half width) of asphalt
wearing course construction is remaining. The total to-date progress in relation to the permanent
work is satisfactory. It is anticipated that the Contractor will finish the remaining works within
the contract time, which is February 28, 2010.

Action Plan
During the course of evaluation and inspection of defects, some sections of the asphalted works
are found to be out of the specification requirements. The Engineer has instructed the Contractor
to rectify the defective works. The methodology of rectifying the defective works is also
approved by the Engineer. The Contractor is now rectifying the defective works, and it is
progressing satisfactorily and would be completed as planned within the contract completion
date.

5. Shire ­ Adiabun Road Upgrading Project (91.8km)

Status
At the end of January 2010, the total to-date progress is 54.60 percent against the Contractor's
planned schedule of 71.50 percent. Construction of earthworks, sub base and base layers are
progressing relatively well. Until the end of January 2010, the Contractor achieved 67.22 percent
against his planned 74.71 percent. However, the AC works is far behind the schedule showing
38.70 percent slippage from his plan.
The main reason of the asphalt works delay was the late installation of asphalt plant and
production of asphalt concrete due to delayed import of bitumen and extended rainy season.

Action Plan
Having noticed the delaying events which belong to the Contractor's accord, the Engineer has
instructed the Contractor to revise its Works Programme incorporating the slippage and all
additional works issued as variation orders. The Contractor has also been advised by the
Engineer and the Executive Project Team to mobilize additional resources to mitigate the delays.
Accordingly, the Contractor has already mobilized additional crew, machineries, and
construction materials such as cement. The action taken by the contractor already led to progress,
though further improvement is required to guarantee timely completion of the project.
The Executive Project Team will continue closely monitoring and evaluating the progress and
will take additional measures depending on the progress.


6. Dera­Mechara Road upgrading Project Contract 2:Magna­Gololcha-Mechara (120km)

Status
The Contractor has planned to accomplish 100 percent of the works up to January 14, 2010
(original completion date). However, he only accomplished 71.62 percent of the works.
Earthworks have been achieved more than the planed, but with respect to the construction of

                                               32
pavement layer 38.2 percent slippage has been observed. The Executive Project Team identified
the major causes of delays as failure to deploy machineries and skilled manpower, less
production rate in the construction of minor drainage and major drainage structures and fuel
supply problem.

In view of the fact that the original contract completion date was January 14, 2010 and due to the
fact that implementation of liquidated damages and other contractual impositions are
necessitated to be applied, the ERA and Engineer has responded to all time and cost related
claims timely. However, the Contractor has refused the ERA's/Engineer's determination and
referred the issue to the DREs. The parties are expecting the DRE's recommendations to be
issued at the end of February 2010.

Action Plan
Having noticed the delaying events which belong to the Contractor's accord, the Contractor has
been advised by the Engineer and the Executive Project Team to mobilize additional machineries
and skilled manpower to mitigate the delays ­ and requested for the Contractor's headquarters
commitment to do so to ensure timely completion of the project. The Executive Project Team has
been visiting the project site regularly and participated in progress meetings. ERA has now
called for the Contractor's senior management to discuss ways to enhance progresses. The
Executive Project Team will continue closely monitoring and evaluating the progress and will
request additional measures depending on the progress.

7.   Assosa/Sherkole-Guba Road Project Contract 1: Sherkole ­ Blue Nile

Status
Pursuant to the approved Works Programme, the Contractor planned to execute 76.73 percent
while the actual achievement is 60.0 percent. Clearing and grubbing was planned to execute 67.7
percent of the works; while the Contractor achieved only 44 percent showing a slippage of 23.7
percent. With respect to the pavement construction, the progress is 19.5 percent behind his
program. Due to shortage of natural gravel for sub base the Contractor has now started using
crushed aggregate for sub base.

The Executive Project Team identified the major causes of the delay as lack of proper planning
and incapability of the Contractor's site staffs to manage and utilize the available resource at
hand efficiently. In addition, frequent breakage of equipment, and high turnover of workforce
due to improper handling of staff contributed to the slow progress of works.

Action Plan
Based on the current progress and the lack of management capacity of the Contractor, the
Executive Project Team concluded that the Contractor cannot finish the remaining works within
the original contract completion period, of August 31, 2010 ­ which would be an event for
triggering liquidation damage. Therefore, the Executive Project Team issued a notice to the
Contractor to reinforce site management team, and to arrange proper maintenance to his
equipment and plants. Responding to the notice, the Contractor is now making necessary efforts
with the involvement of its headquarters to resolve the problems.



                                               33
8. Assosa/Sherkole-Guba Road Project Contract 2: Blue Nile ­ Guba

Status
According to the approved Works Programme, the Contractor has planned to execute 97.20
percent while the actual achievement is 48.90 percent. The execution of the pavement layer was
planned to perform 94.7 percent, however, the actual accomplishment is 73.2 percent. Despite
80.3 percent of the contract time has elapsed, the overall progress with respect to the permanent
works remains unsatisfactory.

The Executive Project Team identified the reasons for these lower progresses as low utilization
of available plant, slow mobilization of man power and its effect for late starting of permanent
works.

Action Plan
The Executive Project Team concluded that the Contractor cannot finish the remaining works
within the original contract period, September 4, 2010 ­ which would be an event for triggering
liquidation damage. In this project the completion and erection of the steel bridge is critical. The
Executive Project Team however also noted that the value of the steel bridge is 57 percent out of
the total project cost. Currently the steel bridge is manufactured and consigned for shipment on
February 15, 2010, and once it reaches site and erected, there would be a boost in the
performance of the project. Therefore, strict follow up is required on the shipment of the steel
bridge.
The Executive Project Team will continue closely monitoring and evaluating the progress of
works and will request additional measures depending on the progress.


III.     Actions Being Taken to Improve the Performance of the Sector

Regular Quality and Cost Monitoring - and Its Assurances

ERA along with the Supervision Consultants monitors the quality and cost of each road
construction. ERA has a separate Design and Technical Support Branch; giving technical
assistance to the Construction Contract Implementation Division on the Contractors request of
changing the design and/or the specification.

In order to enhance the quality of construction, the Consultants have been regularly advised to
ensure the quality of works to be in accordance with the project specification. As part of its
effort to improve quality of works and monitor construction cost in the sector, ERA has engaged
consultancy firms for (i) review of the Road Sector Development Programme, (ii) review of the
capacity building programmes; (iii) system development of Performance Monitoring and Unit
Rate Systems; and (iv) Technical Assistance for Quality Assurances to ERA.

ERA's Road Inspectorate department would also play a major role in monitoring and controlling
cost and quality of works. This department would be visiting the project sites at certain intervals


                                                34
so that the ERA would be in the level where the quality of the works are closely monitored,
controlled or checked in collaboration with the respective supervision Engineers.

In order to control the cost overrun and to settle claims timely, the Engineers have been advised
to monitor and register the contractors' progress and equipment and advise the ERA the revised
contract amount in quarterly basis. ERA will enhance his response to the contractors' claims and
would be committed to manage claims and dispute related issues timely.

Whatever measures could be devised, Price Escalation is unavoidable factor. The ERA has taken,
by way of its contract, the risk of Price Escalation. We have no control of what is happening in
other parts of the world. The situation of the world economic recession is also contributing to
high price escalation to locally produced materials.

However, the amount of price escalation that the ERA would pay through price escalation
formulae could be minimized by enhancing the progress of the projects. If contractors enhance
their performance and accomplish according to their plan, then the price escalation would be
dramatically lower. Delay of projects would have a direct implication on price escalation. ERA
has devised a short and long term plan to improve the performance of contractors and thereby
minimize the escalation costs.

Variation of the works could also be regulated through several measures. Of such measures,
ERA has now taking an action to considerably reduce the time gap between the design and
construction time. In most of the APL 2 contracts, variations of the works were resulted due to
the fact that the design and construction periods had a considerable time break. Through those
periods of delay, several factors had been found inapplicable. The rapid growth of the townships
had forced ERA to modify the urban sections. Topographical changes throughout the design
versus construction time delay has also forced in some projects to certain extent to make some
vertical/horizontal alignment changes and/or modifications. Therefore, it is unavoidably
necessary to reduce the time gap between the design and construction periods. ERA has also paid
due attention for such factors and has shown a great improvements on the recently procured
projects.

The design consultants have also been aware through various meetings and discussions that one
of the main problems that the ERA was forced to extend the contract time was the quantity
increase of various bill items and the resultant variation orders. The same has also been discussed
with the Supervision Consultants in carrying out the preliminary review of the data furnished by
the design consultants, and were advised to timely forward to ERA their findings to obtain
ERA's consent before the permanent works commencement.

Monitoring of Contractors/Consultants Performance ­ and Establishment of Project Costs
Unit Rates Estimation and Monitoring System:

The ERA signed a contract with WSP International Management Consulting (WSPimc) in
August 2009 to provide services for the "Monitoring of Contract/ Consultants Performance ­ and
Establishments of Project Costs and Unit Rate Estimation and Monitoring System". The
objective of this assignment is to provide ERA with the tools to monitor the performance of

                                                35
contractors and consultants and to develop a construction cost monitoring and unit rate
estimation system. Such system will allow ERA to maintain, in-house, any necessary and
independently measured and surveyed cost data as a basis for evaluation consultant Engineers'
cost estimates, individual unit rates and, ultimately, bid prices and moreover it would provide
valuable information of life-cycle costs.

Establishing Performance and Cost Monitoring System

In the light of the multidimensional problems discussed above, collaborative effort is mandatory
to tackle the issues so that an improved project delivery can be achieved. Documentation and
systems need to be improved, including the improvement of the RFP, accurate designs and
properly prepared tender documentation. Continued feedback mechanism is also needed.

In addition to the above, systematic evaluation of Consultants/Contractors performance,
consideration of consultants' staff experience and availability, evaluating the quality of proposed
team leaders using face-to-face interview techniques are required to be carried out. In addition to
the Quality Assurance Study, Establishment of Unit Cost and Performance Monitoring of
Contractors, supported by the World Bank, is also designed to systematically solve the existing
and/or forthcoming problems.

IV.    Capacity Building

ERA, having identified the necessity of continued capacity building programmes, has engaged
several consultants in assisting its effort in bringing improvements in the sector. Of these
consultants, BCEOM Societe Francaise d'Ingenierie, Bernard Krief Consultants and WSP are
working on the Consultancy Service for Road Sector Development Programme. These firms are
working on review of Road Sector Development Programmes, Capacity Building Programmes,
Performance Monitoring and Unit Rate Systems and Technical Assistance for Quality
Assurances.
WSP is currently working on Performance Monitoring and Unit Rate Systems and Technical
Assistance for Quality Assurances taking into consideration the Geographical and Regional
classification of the Country. This will help ERA in establishing a reasonable project specific
cost at a particular region or location at any time of the project life rather than the customary
procedures that ERA has been adopting up to now.
Trainings & Higher Education as Capacity Buildings-ERA staffs:
As a vital role in proper planning, contract management and implementation, cost monitoring,
quality control, ERA has been arranging opportunities for short-term and long-term trainings,
and higher education both in the country and abroad. Recently nine (9) staffs are expected to
complete their higher education, both inland and abroad, and join the ERA. Those highly
qualified staffs, including the already graduated ones, have been impacting the performance of
ERA, and it is believed that continued trainings and education would improve ERA's capacity in
the sector.
Capacity Building of Local Consultants and their Staffs:



                                                36
It is a common phenomenon and practice that in ICB Contracts, foreign consultants, are carrying
out the supervision services in joint venture or association with the local consultancy firms.
These local firms are responsible for employing and providing the majority of the key and
supporting staffs. Building the capacity of the local consultants would play a major role for
sustainable road development. ERA, as part of its sustainable road sector development
programme, has arranged Capacity Building programmes to the Private Sector Associations
(Consultants and Contractors Associations, and other beneficiary entities) so that the road sector
development would meet its utmost target.
A number of donors have been financing Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening
programmes.


V.     Implementation of Business Process Re-engineering, BPR, Studies
Realizing that the existing working systems and processes do not cop with the current and the
forthcoming work load of the Road Sector Development Program, ERA is working to change the
old way of doing business and aims to bring about basic changes through fundamental re-
thinking. Currently, the re-designed to-be process as well as the corresponding re-grouping and
organizing jobs and structure is already finalized and approved at different levels including the
ERA Board. In order to implement the re-designed process effectively, policy and procedure
manuals has been developed.
Hence, ERA is now on the implementation of the business processing re-engineering (BPR)
which is believed to solve the existing problems observed during the old way of doing business
and thereby improving the implementation process.

The Disbursement Forecast

Based on the above facts, the Excel tables attached herewith show the estimated disbursement
amount based on an average disbursement rate of US$2.37 million per month for works, and
US$0.047 million for supervision services for all APL2 projects.
