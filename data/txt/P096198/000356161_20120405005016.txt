7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the Multi-sector Demographic Program (PRODEM) is to
build a national response to address the demographic challenge of Niger, enable the Government to design
a nation-wide multi-sector population program, and increase general awareness on population and
reproductive health issues. The PDO will be achieved by: (i) strengthening through the Ministry of
Population and Social Action (MP/AS) the Government's capacity to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate
large multi-sector demographic interventions; (ii) launching nation-wide advocacy, information, education,
and communication (IEC), and behavior change communication (BCC) campaigns on Pop/RH issues; (iii)
enhancing female autonomy and empowerment interventions, including legal reforms; and (iv)
strengthening monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity and processes. Comprehensive baseline data on
Pop/RH have become available through the 2006 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). An interim
small-scale Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) survey will be conducted in time for the Mid-Term
Review (MTR) of the PRODEM. Finally, a follow up DHS will be conducted at the end of Project Year III
in order to provide data needed to evaluate the project. The extent to which the PDO of the PRODEM is
attained by the end of the project will be measured by five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be
evaluated over a period of 4 years and monitored with Intermediate Outcome Indicators.It should be noted
that three KPIs are dealing with the issues of birth spacing and fertility decline as the broader agenda of
reproductive health is being addressed fully under the IDA-funded Institutional Strengthening and Health
Sector Support Project.
