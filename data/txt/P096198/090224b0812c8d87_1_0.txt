project. These data will come from a new Demographic and Health survey that will be completed before December 2012. The field work for data collection started in February 2012
and preliminary results should become available in August 2012. The fiduciary dimensions of the project (procurement and financial Management) are satisfactory for the
procurement and moderately satisfactory for the Financial Management. The financial management issues which are the disbursement delays, needs to be resolve so as to
accelerate the project implementation and to increase the disbursement rate before the impending closing date (March 2013).
