The project was\n            restructured on May 12, 2011, so as to address the\n            demand-creation-dimension of Reproductive Health (RH) in\n            addition to strengthening the supply-side dimension of RH\n            services. This is the second restructuring and no changes\n            are being made to the development objectives, outcomes,\n            design, or scope of the project. The reallocation is\n            necessary because of following reasons: 1) the need to\n            increase the allocation is due to the production of\n            communication toolkits and the increase in the awareness\n            activities by Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) which\n            will use the new kits developed and produced by the project;\n            2) saving was achieved through the competitive bidding\n            process for training materiel procured by the project; and\n            3) The contracted NGOs launching the awareness campaigns in\n            villages to promote the implementation of Information,\n            Education, and Communication (IEC)/ Behavior Change\n            Communication (BCC) activities in the field. In short, this\n            explains the transfer of additional funds to this category."}, "docdt": "2012-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
