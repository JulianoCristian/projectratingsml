     1.       This paper seeks the approval of the Country Director for the reallocation of
     proceeds of the Niger Multi-Sector Demographic Project (Grant No. H309-NIR). The
     proposed reallocation of grant proceeds was requested by the Government of Niger in a
     letter from the Ministry of Planning, Land and Community Development, dated January
     26, 2012 to ensure that the important activities received enough funding to enable the
     project attain its development objectives. The reallocation request is as follows:

     2.      Project Progress. The project was approved by the Board on June 19, 2007. The
     grant of SDR 6.7 million (equivalent US$10 million) became effective on January 8,
     2008. As of February 29, 2012, SDR 4.3 million (equivalent to 64 percent of the total
     grant) has been disbursed. The current closing date is March 31, 2013.

     3.     The project development objective is to strengthen Government’s capacity to
     address its demographic challenges through: (i) enabling the Ministry of Population to
     design and implement a nationwide multi-sector population program; and (ii) increasing
     general awareness on population and reproductive health issues. The project has now
     three components as follows: (i) Advocacy, Communication, and Coordination; (ii)
     Strengthening the Supply of Reproductive Health Services; and (iii) Capacity Building
     and Monitoring and Evaluation.



                                                  3
4.      The project was restructured on May 12, 2011, so as to address the demand-
creation-dimension of reproductive health (RH) in addition to strengthening the supply-
side dimension of RH services. This is the second restructuring and no changes are being
made to the development objectives, outcomes, design, or scope of the project.

5.     The project’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The indicators have
progressed well and consistent with the Government’s 2007 Population policy. Moreover,
the objectives are achievable. Project management is also performing well, with
implementation progress rated satisfactory in all areas but financial management and
counterpart funding, which are rated moderately satisfactory. Out of three legal covenants
one has been complied, one is partially complied and one is still not yet due. There are
no outstanding audit reports.

6.     The revised Project made significant progress in two main areas: (i) the
percentage of children 0 to 5 months exclusively breastfed increased from13.5% in 2006
to 27% in 2010; and (ii) the prevalence rate of modern contraceptives increased from 4%
to 17.8% in 2010. Many activities in the areas of sanitization and/or service delivery have
been conducted by key stakeholders, namely religious leaders, NGOs, actors of the
Health and Education sectors, and academics. The project contracted out Information,
Education, and Communication (IEC) activities as well as Behavior Change
Communication (BCC) to 21 NGOs and a new batch of NGOs is being selected and will
be soon contracted to continue these IEC/BCC activities.

7.     The proposed reallocation is necessary because of following reasons:

Category 1A: The need to increase the allocation is due to the production of
communication toolkits and the increase in the awareness activities by NGOs which will
use the new kits developed and produced by the project.

Category 1B: Significant saving was achieved through the competitive bidding process
for training materiel procured by the project. Government has also received support from
UNFPA to improve the expansion of reproductive health activities at the community
level. Consequently, the amount of resources needed for this category was reduced.

Category 2: The contracted NGOs launching the awareness campaigns in villages to
promote the implementation of IEC/BCC activities in the field. In addition, the Ministry
of Population and its regional offices have intensified their supervision role to ensure
better implementation of the IEC/BCC campaigns and better monitoring of the project
results. In short, this explains the transfer of additional funds to this category.
