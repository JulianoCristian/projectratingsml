Some lessons\n            learned included: as one of Niger's top development\n            objectives and given its multi-sectoral nature, the\n            population agenda should fall under the mandate of the Prime\n            Minister who is responsible for managing all ministries\n            ensuring full exploitation of comparative advantages to\n            contribute to the country's overall development.\n            Technical assistance to address the population challenge\n            should be clearly devised at all levels of society for\n            increased country ownership.
