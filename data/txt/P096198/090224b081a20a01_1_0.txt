                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the Multi-sector Demographic Program (PRODEM) is to build a national response to address the demographic challenge of
                         Niger, enable the Government to design a nation-wide multi-sector population program, and increase general awareness on population and reproductive health issues.
                         The PDO will be achieved by: (i) strengthening through the Ministry of Population and Social Action (MP/AS) the Government's capacity to coordinate, monitor, and
                         evaluate large multi-sector demographic interventions; (ii) launching nation-wide advocacy, information, education, and communication (IEC), and behavior change
                         communication (BCC) campaigns on Pop/RH issues; (iii) enhancing female autonomy and empowerment interventions, including legal reforms; and (iv) strengthening
                         monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity and processes. Comprehensive baseline data on Pop/RH have become available through the 2006 Demographic and Health
                         Survey (DHS). An interim small-scale Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) survey will be conducted in time for the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the PRODEM. Finally,
                         a follow up DHS will be conducted at the end of Project Year III in order to provide data needed to evaluate the project. The extent to which the PDO of the PRODEM is
                         attained by the end of the project will be measured by five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be evaluated over a period of 4 years and monitored with
                         Intermediate Outcome Indicators.It should be noted that three KPIs are dealing with the issues of birth spacing and fertility decline as the broader agenda of
                         reproductive health is being addressed fully under the IDA-funded Institutional Strengthening and Health Sector Support Project.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The last implementation support mission of the project took place in February 2013. It aimed at helping the Ministry of Population to prepare for the closing of the project. The mission
                         had the opportunity to review the remaining activities to be implemented before the closing date (March 31, 2012) and to launch the preparation of the project closing workshop. The
                         workshop will discuss the outcomes of the project and also learn how the beneficiaries benefited from the project over the five (5) year period. The project completed the following: (i)
                         a beneficiaries participatory assessment; and (ii) an internal evaluation of the project. The two reports are under finalization and will be submitted to the national workshop for
                         discussion.

                         The project made good progress (reaching and surpassing target in most cases) in: (i) the number of people sensitized on population and reproductive health issues through
                         interpersonal sensitization, sermons by the religious leaders, training and focus groups discussion which has been increased from 0 to 5 million; (ii) the prevalence rate of modern
                         contraceptives increased from 5% in 2006 to 12% in 2012 and many activities at the village level have been implemented by local health workers trained by the project on community
                         based distribution of contraceptives and on family planning.
