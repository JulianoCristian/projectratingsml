                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the Multi-sector Demographic Program (PRODEM) is to build a national response to address the demographic challenge of
                         Niger, enable the Government to design a nation-wide multi-sector population program, and increase general awareness on population and reproductive health issues.
                         The PDO will be achieved by: (i) strengthening through the Ministry of Population and Social Action (MP/AS) the Government's capacity to coordinate, monitor, and
                         evaluate large multi-sector demographic interventions; (ii) launching nation-wide advocacy, information, education, and communication (IEC), and behavior change
                         communication (BCC) campaigns on Pop/RH issues; (iii) enhancing female autonomy and empowerment interventions, including legal reforms; and (iv) strengthening
                         monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity and processes. Comprehensive baseline data on Pop/RH have become available through the 2006 Demographic and Health
                         Survey (DHS). An interim small-scale Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) survey will be conducted in time for the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the PRODEM. Finally,
                         a follow up DHS will be conducted at the end of Project Year III in order to provide data needed to evaluate the project. The extent to which the PDO of the PRODEM is
                         attained by the end of the project will be measured by five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be evaluated over a period of 4 years and monitored with
                         Intermediate Outcome Indicators.It should be noted that three KPIs are dealing with the issues of birth spacing and fertility decline as the broader agenda of
                         reproductive health is being addressed fully under the IDA-funded Institutional Strengthening and Health Sector Support Project.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an update following the second restructuring of the project.

                         After the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in June 2010, the Project continue to make significant progress in (i) the number of people sensitized on population and reproductive health issues
                         through sermons, training and focus groups discussion increased from 0 to 5 million; (ii) the prevalence rate of modern contraceptives increased from 4% to 16% in 2010. Many
                         activities in the areas of sanitization and/or service delivery have been conducted by key stakeholders, namely religious leaders, NGOs, actors of the Health and Education sectors,
                         and academics. The project contracted out Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities as well as Behavior Change Communication (BCC) to 21 NGOs and a new
                         batch of NGOs is being selected and will be soon be contracted to continue these IEC/BCC activities.
