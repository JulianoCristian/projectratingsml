H. Restructuring (if any)
The project was restructured twice: the first time in May 2011 and the second time in
March 2012.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Context

1.      Following political turmoil and economic decline in the 1990s, Niger
underwent a fundamental political transition and consolidated democracy. The
transfer of power from a military junta to a civilian government in 1999 was followed by
the successful organization of legislative and presidential elections in 2004. President
Tandja was reelected with a large mandate of 65 percent. Moreover, as part of the
program of political decentralization, Niger’s first local elections were successfully
completed in July2004.

2.      With a consolidated democracy, Niger experienced revived growth
performance; yet the growth spurt did not translate into poverty reduction. Growth
enhancing reforms led to renewed confidence. Average GDP growth reached 4.6 percent
during the 2001-2006 periods (1.3 percent above the population growth rate) and in 2007,
the real GDP growth rate was 3.2 percent. However, the economy remained highly
vulnerable to climatic and terms of trade shocks in unfavorable country conditions
characterized by a limited natural and human resource base. The share of the population
living below the poverty threshold was estimated at 60.7 percent in 2006.

3.      The high rate of population growth (3.3 percent per annum) impeded Niger’s
ability to reduce poverty and to meet the MDGs. The rapid population growth was
primarily explained by fast decreasing infant and under five mortality rates, persistent
high fertility and very low contraceptive use. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated
in the 2006 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) at 7.1 children per woman, one of
the highest in the world. While infant mortality decreased from 123 deaths per 1,000 live
births in 2001 to 81 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2006, better child survival did not
seem yet to reduce the desire for large families. Given high fertility rates and short birth
intervals, moreover, high levels of malnutrition for children under 5 (40 percent
nationwide) was reported and seemed to be the main cause of child mortality. In addition,
only 2 percent of children aged less than four months were exclusively breastfed. If
demographic growth was not slowed down, Niger’s population would reach 56 million in
2050, more than four times its 2006 size (13 million inhabitants).

4.      The continued high fertility rate was the result of multiple social factors that
determine the reproductive behavior of Niger’s population. These factors included:
the very high level of desired fertility, religious beliefs gender inequality, inadequate
reproductive health (RH) and family planning services, poor levels of female literacy,
early age at marriage, and poverty. Marriage was universal and early, one in two women
is married by the age of 15 and almost 98 percent of women in the age group 15-49 were
in union. Women’s knowledge of reproductive health (RH) was poor and contraceptive
prevalence only 11 percent and 5 percent for modern methods (Source: 2006 DHS). High



                                             1
fertility rates have also contributed to a very young age structure. Close to 50 percent of
the population is under the age of 15. This in turn fuels demographic growth as many
young people enter their reproductive age.

5.     These realities, combined with persistent high demand for large families and
beliefs in women’s subordination to men, have hampered the development of
women’s participation in community life. Female primary education completion was
20 percent and female adult literacy only 9 percent. Despite a 72.9 percent female labor
force participation rate, women still have little representation in civil service and
professional employment. Discrimination in rural areas is even worse. Women’s social
empowerment and bargaining power with their sexual partners is therefore missing to
improve significantly their RH outcomes.

6.      While some social indicators improved, development conditions in Niger
were behind on most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). According to
the 2007 UN Human Development Index, the country was ranked among the lowest in
the world (174th out of 177 countries). There was indication of improved access to basic
education and better health outcomes. Gross primary enrollment rate increased from 41.7
percent in 2001/02 to 54 percent in 2005/06 while the completion rate rose from 25.6
percent to 40 percent during the same period. However, disparities between gender and
geographical areas persisted, with the gross enrolment rate (GER) in rural areas estimated
at 50 percent in 2005 compared to 52 percent for the entire country, and girls represented
only 41 percent of total primary enrolment, and quality of education remained low. The
prevalence of HIV/AIDS was at less than 1 percent, the lowest in Africa. Access to safe
drinking water increased from 51 percent in 1998 to 59 percent in 2004 with water
coverage higher in urban areas, where about 80 percent of the population had access to
safe drinking water. The lack of water and sanitation infrastructure provided a breeding
ground for water-borne diseases such as diarrhea, one of the main causes of child
mortality. Moreover, the lack of irrigation infrastructure prevented the development of
intensive agriculture, limiting agricultural production. Given the low base, the
demographic pressure and low levels of resources allocated to priority sectors in the past
decade, the trend in various social indicators suggested that Niger would not reach most
of the MDG targets by 2015.

Rationale for Bank involvement

7.      The rationale for Bank intervention was based on a particularly favorable context
to address demographic issues:
 Government ownership: The government’s responsiveness to tackling the high
    demographic growth. While reproductive health and family planning remained
    extremely difficult topics to address in the Nigerien cultural, socio-economic and
    religious context, the Bank’s sector work on population1 prompted a new, evidence-

 Niger: Providing All Nigeriens with Food, Education, and Health Care: A Demographic Perspective:
World Bank report #34219-NE, November 2005.


                                                  2
    based dialogue with Government on the multi-sectoral consequences of rapid
    population growth and high fertility.
   Enabling technical and strategic environment: The government developed in 2007 an
    appropriate action-oriented Declaration of Population Policy (Déclaration du
    Gouvernement en matière de politique de population – DGPP). A Strategic
    Framework along with an overall Work Plan was being prepared with the support of
    UNFPA, a new law on Reproductive Health (RH) was passed in May 2006, and
    legislation was adopted to provide free contraceptives in public facilities.
   Comparative advantage: the Bank had a clear comparative advantage through its
    ability to carry out multi-sectoral dialogue and experience in multi-sector approaches
    as well as in building government's capacity to plan and manage development
    programs around sectoral strategies, including strengthening the fiduciary framework.
   Country development challenges: The Bank was best placed to help link the efforts on
    population and RH to the broader framework of macro-economic reform and poverty
    alleviation efforts through its ongoing development policy lending as well as other
    investment operations that were intended to affect directly or indirectly population
    and reproductive health outcomes (including a health and an education operations).
   Past Bank experience in the population sector: The Bank could best leverage its past
    experience in Niger and in Sub-Saharan Africa and best customize lessons learned to
    the Nigerien context.
   Partnership: The main donor with the Bank in the population and reproductive health
    sector in Niger was the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Both
    organizations have worked closely to support the population agenda in Niger and
    were complementing each other in their areas of intervention. They were also best
    placed to help build consensus and leverage additional support for population and
    reproductive health activities from other donors.

8.      The FY03-05 CAS planned a sector work to help the government design policy
responses to issues of population. The Project was prepared following the finalization of
the sector work on population and approved as the new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) covering FY08-11 was being finalized since the timing of the new CAS had been
set so as to be aligned with the finalization of the Second PRSP. Specifically, addressing
the demographic issue was treated in the new CAS as a cross cutting issue with expected
outcome to increase awareness of and access to family planning.

9.      The Bank’s participation in the country’s efforts to slow the rapid rate of
population growth was consistent with Niger’s second Strategy for Accelerated
Development and Poverty Reduction (PRSP II). The Project’s interventions were to
support the PRSP II’s second strategic objective to Develop Human Capital through
Equal Access to Quality Social Services and to the pillar of Slowing Population Growth
for which the government intended to improve access to RH services, promote delayed
marriage for young girls and work toward greater social comprehension of the links
between population and economic growth. The issue of population growth was also
identified as a fundamental and cross-cutting issue.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

Project Development Objective

10.    The objective of the Project (PDO) is to strengthen the Recipient’s capacity to
address its demographic challenges through: (i) enabling the Ministry of Population to
design and implement a nationwide multi-sector population program; and (ii) increasing
general awareness on population and reproductive health issues.

11.     The Project would contribute to three main objectives of the Government’s
population policy (DGPP) to increase the age at marriage, increase the contraceptive
prevalence rate (modern methods) and promote full breastfeeding (6 months exclusive
and 24 months prolonged).

Key Indicators

12.     The extent to which the PDO of the Project was to be attained by the end of the
Project was measured by five Key Performance Indicators (or PDO indicators) monitored
through intermediate outcome indicators. The PDO indicators were:

   1. Annual work programs (AWPs) are designed, including monitoring and
      evaluation (M&E) indicators, adopted through consultations (annual reviews)
      with stakeholders and donors, and implemented under monthly supervision of the
      MOP.
   2. 85 percent of the population over age 15 has been sensitized on population and
      reproductive health issues.
   3. The median age at marriage among women aged 25-49 has increased from 15.5
      years to 16.5 years.
   4. The percentage of children 0-5 months exclusively breastfed has increased from
      14 percent to 20 percent.
   5. Prevalence of modern contraceptive use among women in union aged 20-24 has
      increased from 4.4 to 7 percent.

13.     It should be noted that three PDO indicators were dealing with issues of birth
spacing and fertility decline. The broader agenda of reproductive health was addressed
under the IDA-funded Institutional Strengthening and Health Sector Support Project.
Also, the AWPs were meant to enhance the mobilization of the stakeholders and donors.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

14.     The PDO was not revised. However, PDO indicators and intermediate outcome
indicators were modified during the May 2011 restructuring in order to align them with
the changes in Project’s components and new activities to strengthen the supply side for




                                           4
family planning and RH services. Table 1 in Annex 9 details the changes made to the
indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

15.     The intended beneficiaries of the Project were the general population, women,
traditional and religious leaders, couples and youth girls and boys, women’s groups,
research teams, the media, journalists, technical ministries (Population and Social
Affairs; Women’s Promotion and Child Protection; Public Health and Endemic Diseases;
Basic Education and Literacy; Secondary and Superior Education, Research, and
Technology; Justice; Interior and Decentralization; and Territory Administration and
Community Development), governmental entities at regional and municipal levels, the
parliament, political parties, national organizations, the National Institute for Statistics,
and the Project teams.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

16.       The US$10 million Project included the following components:

         Component 1: Advocacy and Communication (US$4.24 million): Supporting
          nationwide and culturally sensitive advocacy, information, education and
          communication (IEC) and behavior change communication (BCC) campaigns,
          including through broad mass media campaigns and other means of
          communication, dissemination of the works of researchers, decision-makers and
          other stakeholders, aiming at all components of the Recipient’s society, including
          its leadership, traditional authorities and religious leaders.

         Component 2: Women’s Autonomy and Couples’ Empowerment (US$1.22
          million): Strengthening women social status and autonomy both at central and
          regional levels, including through support to: (i) enhance women’s economic
          opportunities; (ii) trigger legal reforms, including measures aimed at raising the
          minimum age at first marriage; and (iii) reinforce efforts to improve female
          school enrollments and performance.

         Component 3: Harmonization and Coordination of Multi-sector
          Interventions (US$0.90 million): Supporting the organization of a national
          program approach to population and reproductive health issues, including
          through: (i) the implementation of the Government Declaration on Population
          Policy; (ii) the preparation of annual work programs; and (iii) the launching of a
          population program approach.

         Component 4: Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$3.64
          million): Support to: (i) institutional strengthening; (ii) capacity building in the
          Ministry of Population and its partners; and (iii) improving data collection,
          analysis, dissemination and utilization.




                                               5
1.6 Revised Components

17.     The May 2011 restructuring reduced the number of components from four to three.
Component 2 (Women’s Autonomy and Couples’ Empowerment) was discontinued
although its key activities were moved under the new Component 1 (Advocacy,
Communication, and Coordination). Specifically, the revised Project’s components were
as follows:

18.     Component 1: Advocacy, Communication, and Coordination (US$4.5
million): Supporting nationwide and culturally sensitive advocacy, information,
education and communication (IEC) and behavior change communication (BCC)
campaigns, including through broad mass media campaigns and other means of
communication, dissemination of the works of researchers, decision-makers and other
stakeholders, aiming at all components of the Recipient’s society, its leadership,
traditional authorities and religious leaders, including: (a) IEC and BCC at community
level; (b) multi-sector advocacy and communication such as advocacy directed at the
Recipient’s governmental entities at the central, regional and municipal levels, the
Recipient’s parliament, political parties operating on the Recipient’s territory, national
organizations, the media and the journalists; (c) IEC and BCC to strengthen women’s
economic opportunities; (d) promotion of girls’ schooling; and (e) support to the
Recipient’s ministry responsible for justice for the preparation of the legal framework
for woman’s and child’s protection.

19.     Changes: The Component’s activities remained essentially the same, but included
the main themes of former Component 2, as well as the harmonization and coordination
of multi-sector interventions, formerly under component 3. The Component also helped
align Project’s activities with those of other IDA-funded projects in Niger.

20.    Component 2: Strengthening the Supply of Reproductive Health Services
(US$1.8 million): Strengthening the capacity of the Recipient’s ministry responsible for
health for the provision of reproductive health services through development of
guidelines and material, provision of training material and equipment, training of nurses,
midwives and community health workers, and provision of contraceptive products.

21.     Change: The new Component was to address the supply side constraints to
reducing demographic pressure at the community level that were not sufficiently tackled
by other IDA interventions, especially the Health operation. The Component was to train
community health workers as they play an important role in complementing services
provided by health centers and posts by promoting family planning at the community
level, and distributing contraceptive products. Finally, the component was to finance
contraceptives to satisfy increased needs and smooth out distribution flows.

22.     Component 3: Capacity Building and Monitoring & Evaluation (US$3.7
million): Institutional strengthening and capacity building of the entities involved in the
implementation of the Project, including nongovernmental organizations carrying out
Project activities in the regions and districts, to support the implementation of the Project



                                             6
activities; data generation, collection, analysis, dissemination and utilization; project
management, financial management, and supervision.

23.    Changes: The Component essentially covered the same activities included in the
former component 4 (capacity building, maintenance, and data collection, analysis, and
dissemination, including US$1.2 million to contribute to the financing of a new DHS for
2011). In addition, training of NGOs in project and financial management and the
supervision of projects implemented by NGOs in the regions and districts were added.
The Component was also to support the fiduciary management of the Project which
remained under the responsibilities of the MOP.

24.    Summary of original and revised Components:

            Original Component                                  Revised Component
C1 – Advocacy and Communications (US$4.24 m)        C1- Advocacy, Communications, and
                                                    Coordination (US$4.5 m)
C2 – Women’s Autonomy and Couples                   C2 – Strengthening the Supply of RH services
Empowerment (US$1.22 m)                             (US$1.8 m)
C3 – Harmonization and Coordination of Multi-       C3 – Capacity Building and M&E (US$3.7 m)
sector Interventions (US$0.90 m)
C4 - Capacity Building and M&E (US$3.64 m)

1.7 Other significant changes:

25.      In addition to the changes in the PDO and intermediate outcomes indicators and
reduction in the number of components that led to the introduction of new activities to
strengthen the supply of and demand for family planning and RH services, the following
changes were introduced during the May 2011 restructuring: (i) a modification of the
institutional arrangements to ensure the contracting out of advocacy activities to NGOs
and other ministries and to give an increased role to the Ministry of Health (MOH) for
RH supply-side activities; and (ii) an adjustment of the flow of funds.

26. The proposed changes in Project design and implementation arrangements were
driven by three main factors: (i) the slow progress in Project implementation; (ii) the
imbalance in the design between activities to stimulate demand and those to ensure an
increased supply of RH services; and (iii) an overly centralized management of the
Project. The responsibilities for implementing the Project were clearly specified (see
table 2 of Annex 9) between the MOP, technical ministries, associations of traditional
chiefs and religious organizations and contracted NGOs as well as the disbursement
arrangements. Most of the reallocation of grant proceeds originated from committing the
unallocated category and the remaining funds from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF).

27.     The Project underwent a second restructuring in March 2012 in order to reallocate
grant proceeds. The reallocation was necessary to ensure that important activities
received enough funding to enable the Project to attain its development objectives. These
activities related to (i) the production of communication toolkits for increased awareness
activities, (ii) support to the contracted NGOs launch of awareness campaigns in villages


                                                7
to promote the implementation of IEC/BCC activities, and (iii) intensified supervision
role of the MOP and its regional offices to ensure better implementation of the IEC/BCC
campaigns and better monitoring of the Project results (see Table 3 in Annex 9).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

28.     Soundness of background analysis: The preparation team, composed of national
and international health and population experts grounded the preparation of the Project in
key population-related documents and policies prepared by the Government of Niger, in
particular the Declaration of National Population Policy and the actions recommended in
the 2005 Nigerien population projections, namely the increase of the age at marriage, the
increase of contraceptive prevalence rate (modern methods), and the promotion of full
breast-feeding. The preparation was also strongly informed by best practices in the design
of population interventions and the findings of the 2006 sector work on population,
Providing All Nigeriens with Food, Education and Health care, and the new Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM). The main findings and recommendations of the sector
work on population were that: (i) high fertility rate was the result of multiple social
factors; (ii) the demographic challenge needed to be addressed through a multi-sectoral
approach; (iii) on the demand-side, policies should focus on increasing the age of
marriage, enhancing women’s education and autonomy, and on using a multimedia
approach to disseminate messages aimed at changing traditional beliefs and behaviors
regarding childbearing and the value of children; and (iv) on the supply side, efforts
should focus on expanding access to contraceptive methods, increasing social marketing
of contraceptives, and expanding culturally sensitive family planning services. The CEM
concluded that achieving the MDGs would require decisive policy actions to decelerate
population growth to be taken both on the supply and demand sides.
	
29.     In addition, the Project’s preparation was complemented by the series of
Development Policy operations (Rural and Social Policy Reform Grant – RSRC),
specifically the preparation of RSRC-2 and key investment operations, among them the
health and education Projects. The RSRC series was to support in-country actors to
enforce existing legislation governing the age of marriage for women, with a view to
raising that age as one means of reducing infant and maternal mortality and of delaying
the onset of childbearing with the goal of supporting lower fertility rates in the medium
term. The prior action for the RSRC-2 on population was to organize and hold a national
forum to build consensus on demographic and gender issues and the African Charter on
women’s rights. The prior action was met.

30.      The preparation team incorporated key lessons learned from the closed first
population project, such as: (i) the project objective should be realistic so as to be feasible
within the established timeframe of the life of the project. To that effect, the Project was
mostly a technical assistance and capacity building operation; (ii) the design of the
project should be based on a sound knowledge of the sector context; (iii) reliable baseline
data are essential; (iv) projects implemented through various ministries require well-



                                              8
defined monitoring and supervision systems with a capacity to address and resolve
constraints in a flexible, proactive manner; (v) key stakeholders’ involvement increases
ownership and sustainability; and (vi) complementarity between investment/TA
operations and DPOs is needed to address population issues at different levels (including
the policy and legal level).

31.     Rationale for the Bank’s intervention: The rationale of the Project was very
strong since reducing the high rate of population growth was crucial to the overall
economic prosperity and development of Niger. Although, while the topics of RH and
family planning remained very difficult in the Nigerien cultural, socio-economic and
religious context, there was agreement that it was the right time to support the
government’s population policy.

32.      Assessment of Project Design: There was consensus between the Government
and the development community on the way the challenges needed to be addressed
(multi-sectorality, demand and supply side interventions, building government’s
capacity). Therefore, the design of the Project reflected such elements and included the
appropriate activities to support the government in addressing its population challenge.
The design also reflected the QER panel and Decision meeting’s recommendation that,
given the ongoing activities and the IDA financing constraint, the Project was to focus on
filling the gaps that other health and education interventions in Niger had left, therefore
concentrating mainly on family planning and population issues.

33.     However, the MOP had been recently created. An assessment of its capacity was
carried out and recommended that the ministry be supported through the provision of
technical assistance in the areas of communication, M&E, gender and project
management in order to enhance its capacity to implement the Project. As a new ministry,
the MOP also had untested authority to influence other stakeholders involved in the
population agenda. Moreover, suggestions by the QER panel to use a bottom-up approach
for the national awareness campaign and to use community health workers for
contraceptives distribution and promotion of family planning were not followed through.

34. Adequacy of government’s commitment, stakeholder involvement and
participatory process: The government had demonstrated strong commitment to better
manage the demographic challenge as evidenced by new policies and actions. It worked
proactively with the Bank and all development partners involved in the population topic
as well as the broader human development agenda. Analytical work produced on
population was disseminated to high level officials as well as to a selected wide audience.
However, some groups of society and rural populations were less (or not) engaged or
were not committed to the government’s population agenda given the sensitive nature of
the topic and its close connection with traditional and religious beliefs.

35.    Assessment of Risks: The risks identified during preparation were mostly
underestimated given the difficult country context in which the Project was to be
implemented and mitigations measures not adequate enough. In particular, resistance to
government interventions in population and RH issues remained strong. Moreover,



                                            9
human and institutional capacity was a challenge at all levels in Niger due to years of
deteriorating conditions in public sector management, political instability and brain drain.
These circumstances created little confidence from average Nigeriens, especially the ones
living in rural areas where traditional authority holds sway, in the government's ability to
deliver development programs or social services, and they were skeptical when officials
requested their participation.

36.      In February 20, 2007 a quality enhancement review (QER) was held for the multi-
sectoral demographic project (PRODEM). The Panel’s main recommendation to the
project was: (i) to clarify that the intervention is part of a more complex, multi-sector
agenda in Niger ii) the team consider Performance Based arrangements with NGOs- on
carrying the awareness campaign and monitoring results throughout Niger, iii) Make the
best of a bottom-up approach and iv) target female education as crucial determinant of
fertility.

2.2 Implementation

37.      The first few years of Project implementation were faced with several
impediments:
 Delayed recruitment of key staff to support the MOP: while the Plan for technical
    assistance for the implementation of the Project was adopted, the recruitment of some
    key technical experts took a long time. For instance, the communication expert
    financed by UNFPA was not finalized until 2010. Also, with the resignation of the
    first two procurement specialists (PS)2, a new recruitment process was initiated in
    2010 for another PS. This left the MOP without the needed technical assistance to
    implement in a timely manner the Project.
 Disagreement on implementation responsibility: despite the agreed implementation
    arrangements at negotiations, the MOP decided that it would implement all the
    Project’s activities. The Bank team held several meetings with the Minister and his
    team to clarify the implementation arrangements but the Minister remained reluctant
    to delegate to the technical ministries and to contract with NGOs to implement key
    activities. This matter was also raised with the Prime Minister.
 A tense political context: 2009 was marked by a year-long political crisis related to
    President Tandja's efforts to extend his mandate beyond the end of his second term.
    The National Assembly was dissolved in May 2009 and a new Constitutional Court
    appointed, enabling to push forward with a constitutional referendum in August 2009
    that extended President Tandja’s mandate for an additional three years. This led to the
    February 2010 Coup. Niger also faced a coup attempt in July 2011.

38.     All the above factors contributed to a tough implementation environment that led
to a slow implementation of the Project. Procurement of equipment, vehicles, Project
administration, and the preparation of several action plans took place as planned to



2
 The first two PS resigned, one due to conflict with the Minister of Population and the other because he
was ineligible due to the fact that he was still employed by another IDA funded project.


                                                    10
improve the capacity of the MOP to implement and monitor the Project. However,
advocacy activities throughout the regions and districts remained limited and the
women’s empowerment component was not implemented due to lack of strategy. At the
time of the Mid Term Review (MTR), the disbursement ratio was 37 percent.

39.      In its assessment of the Quality of Bank Supervision in March 2010, the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) panel indicated that while the implementation problems were
identified satisfactorily, they were not adequately reflected or followed up in
implementation support reports (ISRs) or aide-mémoires. QAG also considered that the
Bank team should have reacted earlier to the non-implementation of the women’s
empowerment component, implementation problems of the communications component
and the disconnect between actions promoting demand and any formal arrangements or
resources for a strategic supply plan to meet the demand. In addition, QAG noted that the
Bank’s advice was appropriate, except for the women’s empowerment component, and
that efforts to address significant risks during supervision were adequate. However, it felt
that the advice and efforts only resulted in limited impact. Therefore, QAG assessed the
quality of supervision as unsatisfactory.

40.     The June 2010 MTR concluded that, if the current trend continued, the Project
was unlikely to reach its development objectives and recommended some changes in the
Project design and its implementation arrangements. Based on the recommendations of
the MTR and the Regional management’s view that the political will of the transitional
regime to address the demographic issue was strong as well as the commitment to the
Project, the Project was restructured in May 2011. The time lapse between the MTR and
the restructuring of the Project was the result of the institutional change for the MOP.
Indeed, following the February 2010 Coup, the MOP was merged with the Ministry of
Women’s Affairs; a new minister was appointed and the replacement of key MOP staff
dragged, including the appointment of the new Secretary General in charge of
coordinating the Project.

41.     The May 2011 restructuring proved highly relevant as it put the Project back on
track and boosted implementation through:
     The resolution of implementation bottlenecks thanks to the changes in the
        implementation responsibilities3 for the revised components, the recruitment of
        NGOs 4 to implement IEC ad BCC activities at the community level, the
        delegation to other technical ministries for the implementation of specific
        activities or components (i.e. MOH for the implementation of Component 2) and
        the funding of the MOH for the supply of modern contraceptives at the


3
  The restructured Project allocated responsibilities for project implementation to four institutions, as
follows: 33 percent (of project cost) to NGOs, 26 percent to the MOH, and 19 percent to the Institute of
National Statistics, leaving 22 percent for direct execution to the MP/SR.
4
  After the initial contracting of the NGO ANIMAS SUTURA in April 2010 to conduct communication
and multimedia activities at the local level, 21 new NGOs and development associations were contracted in
December 2010 in the context of the strategy of "make-do" with the aim to ensure the sustainability of
activities after the Project’s life.


                                                   11
       community level. This reduced the burden of Project implementation for the MOP
       and fit better with the Ministry’s technical capacities.
      A more conducive management of the MOP, the addition of two advisers and the
       outsourcing of key activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

42.     M&E Design: At the time of preparation, the set of indicators for the Project was
mainly formulated based on the 2006 DHS and the Multiple Indicators Cluster Sample
Survey (MICSS). Indicators were therefore deemed appropriate to measure achievement
of the Project. A Project component was designed with an aim to focus on data collection,
analysis, dissemination and utilization as well as training of the MOP staff, a structure
within the MOP was in charge of M&E, and UNFPA helped establish the M&E standards
comprising national annual review of progress and results starting the second year of the
Project. The M&E design framework was therefore judged to be adequate. Finally, a
follow up DHS has been conducted before the end of the Project.

43.     M&E Implementation and Utilization: A national multi-sectoral M&E system
was developed with a population database centralizing M&E data and some spatial data
from sectors and regions and made operational, although with some delays. The adoption
of the M&E framework was followed by an action plan, guides for indicators, and
training tools and manuals. Data was collected from the National Institute of Statistics
and implementing ministries, analyzed and exchanged through the M&E quarterly
reviews. This was seen as a good practice by the government and donors. Population data
were also collected and reported on by the government albeit hampered at times by the
unstable political situation. In addition, the AWPs, including M&E indicators, were
prepared, endorsed by stakeholders and donors, and implemented by the MOP. The
Project contributed to carry out two surveys (2012 DHS and the General Census of the
population) and the assessment of the migration level in the country. With regard to
financial data, the MOP had reliable information going back to the beginning of the
Project and analytical tools since it began to use the accounting software TOMPRO in
2007. At the decentralized level, the Project was affected by the availability and use of
data due to the weak capacity of decentralized coordination bodies to document data on
completed activities because of lack of sufficient qualified technical staff, supplies, and
working tools and inadequate data management and use for the large amount of data
generated by the civil society.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

44.    The Project fell under environmental category C. Therefore, no safeguard policies
were triggered. In January 2009, the Bank conducted a post review of procurement
contracts. The review found some irregularities in the purchase of office supplies and
cleaning products, prompting the Bank to send a letter to the authorities in June 2009
requesting full procurement compliance from now on.




                                            12
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.     The project contributed to reinforce the capacity within the MOP and to
strengthen the policy dialogue and coordination with donors. The M&E framework put in
place by the Project led to the establishment of a donor’s coordination and M&E system
for the sector. The institutionalization of the practice of data collection, analysis and
exchanges through the M&E quarterly review conducted by the sector should not be
compromised by the Project closing. The Project also provided an overarching
framework for coordinating population-related activities with key sectors (health,
education, justice, etc.). Also, by building the capacity of decentralized levels and NGOs
and CSOs through delegated management contracts for IEC/BCC activities, the Project
helped strengthen the organizational capacity of the MOP to implement its sector
program. All of the above contribute to ensuring the sustainability of efforts to promote
RH service and family planning activities by allowing the MOP to mobilize donors to
finance activities for the implementation of the national policy. To that effect, umbrella
NGOs and CSOs have secured funds from other donors to continue their activities
allowing for the continuation of key RH and family planning activities. This is all the
more promising since long term interventions are needed to sustain the behavior changes
and to keep the momentum on the policy dialogue.

46.     The Bank will continue its support to the population challenge through the
preparation of a multi-sector operation covering demographic and RH matters. The
objective of the new project, scheduled to be approved in FY15, will be to contribute to
improve access to health services and to strengthen public service supply side capacity so
as to reduce the high fertility levels. Special emphasis will be placed on promoting
gender equality, women's empowerment and health promotion with the support of other
donors.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

47.     Relevance of Objectives: The overall strategy of the Project was aligned with the
key population policy document prepared by the Government of Niger. The Project
aimed to build a national response to address the demographic challenge of Niger, enable
the Government to design a nation-wide multi-sector population program, and increase
general awareness on population and reproductive health issues. This was consistent with
the country’s PRSP and Bank assistance strategy. Also, given Niger’s demographic and
development circumstances, the Project’s strategic relevance was highly relevant and
remained so during Project implementation due to the continued pressure put by a high
population growth on the country’s resources and government services such as health and
education and the need for adequate policy actions. Such relevance was further
demonstrated when the country was hit by a food crisis. This reinforced the importance to
tackle the demographic pressure through population and RH interventions and policies.
Therefore, the relevance is judged high.




                                           13
48.      Relevance of Design: Given the diverse factors that influenced a country’s
fertility and population growth, the multi-sectoral approach and focus on increasing
awareness and strengthening the MOP capacity were appropriate. However, the Project
team eluded the supply side dimension for RH services during Project Preparation as the
preparation team thought it would be handled by the Health operation. Additionally,
while the design of the Project was realistic, it proved difficult to implement given the
difficult and instable country context and the divergent views between the MOP and the
Bank on the implementation arrangements of the Project. Nevertheless, the 2011
restructuring rightly addressed the initial shortcomings and was deemed highly relevant.
Also, the Project was not intended to address the broader agenda of RH (which was
tackled under the IDA-funded Institutional Strengthening and Health Sector Support
Project) and therefore its PDO formulation was appropriate. Therefore the relevance of
design is judged substantial overall (and high after the restructuring).

49.     Relevance of implementation: The relevance of implementation before the 2011
restructuring is judged to be modest. Given that the MOP was newly established and its
capacity to carry out its mandate needed to be strengthened, the implementation
arrangements should have been further thought through and responsibilities for activities’
implementation clearly defined to minimize the risk for implementation issues. After
restructuring, implementation bottlenecks were resolved thanks to the changes in the
implementation responsibilities for the revised components, the recruitment of NGOs to
implement IEC ad BCC activities at the community level, and the delegation to other
sector ministries for the implementation of specific activities or components. These
measures put the project back on track. As a result, the relevance of implementation is
rated substantial after the restructuring.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

50. With the 2011 restructuring of the Project, three indicators were replaced and two
dropped. Overall, while some specific parts of the PDO are more specifically linked to
some of the PDO indicators (such as enabled design with the AWPs), the achievement of
the PDO can be measured through all the PDO indicators (i.e. enabling the
implementation of the population program should lead to higher contraceptive use). We
therefore review below all the key PDO indicators distinguishing between before and
after restructuring.

Before restructuring

51.    Overall, the achievement of the PDO before restructuring can be considered
Moderately Unsatisfactory. In part, this is due to overly ambitious indicators, in some
other part to bottlenecks in implementation and the imbalance between demand and
supply-side activities.

52.    The original outcome indicator “AWPs are designed, including M&E indicators,
adopted after annual consultation with stakeholders and donors, and implemented under
monthly supervisions of the Ministry of Population” was only modestly achieved.



                                           14
53.     The capacity of the MOP to design and implement a multi-sector program had
been improved but remained very weak. Few ministries were fully involved in the
implementation because of coordination capacities. The Project scaled back from its
original capacity strengthening objective from program wide to project specific focus
during the 2011 restructuring. Clearly, there was limited ability of the MOP to coordinate
and/or effectively influence population-related activities and programs of other relevant
ministries.

54.     Progress on related intermediate indicators was also slow with the target of 8
regional coordination units and 36 departmental coordination cells for population and RH
issues (CONAPO, COREPO) only modestly achieved. Regional coordination units were
installed, but not functional, with considerable duplication of activities with regional
health directorates.

55.     The original outcome indicator of “85 percent of the population over the age of 15
sensitized on population and reproductive health issues” (Mid-term target was 50 percent
as per related intermediate indicator) was not achieved by 2011, although it was achieved
by 2013. This was clearly a very ambitious indicator which was replaced at restructuring
by a more realistic one.

56.    The original outcome indicator “the median age at marriage among women aged
25-49 has increased from 15.5 to 16.5 years” was not achieved and was moving slowly.
As above, this was an ambitious indicator, requiring behavioral and legal change, which
was dropped at restructuring, upon the understanding that the DPO would be a better
instrument to hold the government accountable on matters of policy and legal changes
(supported by TA through the Project).

57.     The outcome was not achieved, as well as related measures to increase the legal
age at marriage by Project Year 3 and the adoption of broader legal texts envisaged in
support of government’s national population policy (one in year 3 and one in year 4) –
prepared but not adopted. This is due to the fact that there was a strong opposition and
resistance by some religious fundamentalist groups which were opposing the country's
commitment to take the appropriate measures and laws regarding girls' protection and
women empowerment in society.

58.     Nonetheless, it is worth highlighting that substantial efforts were made to reach
out to the Islamic community, including messages tailored to Islamic sensibilities on
raising age at marriage for girls and boys and girls schooling. Also, after restructuring,
with the involvement of NGOs, traditional communication channels/media (radio, theatre,
skits, song contests, comic strips were used, including interpersonal communication
strategies and traditional and religious leaders) were used to reach out to religious leaders.

59.    Additionally, the women’s autonomy and couples’ empowerment component
helped expand knowledge/improve prospects of poor and marginalized women and
support girls’ school enrollment and women’s literacy through actions at the level of the



                                             15
Ministry of Education, including targeting female education as part of national awareness
campaigns. After restructuring, NGOs supported school management committees
(COGES) in carrying out community level outreach and sensitization on the importance
of female schooling in districts where the gender gap in enrollment is greatest, while
providing to local level women’s associations (foyers féminins) in key disadvantaged
areas, equipment and materials specifically aimed at alleviating domestic task burdens.

60.     The original outcome indicator on the “percentage of children 0-5 months
exclusively breastfed increasing from 13.5 percent to 20 percent” was exceeded reaching
23 percent in 2012. Overall, breastfeeding is a quasi-universal practice in Niger, with
almost 93 percent of children who are breasted between 12-15 months. This rate falls to
23 percent when it comes to exclusive breastfeeding. It is however unclear to what extent
this indicator can be related to the PDO and project’s activities and was dropped at
restructuring.

61.     The original outcome indicator on the “prevalence of modern contraceptive use
among women in union aged 20-24 years” increasing from 4.4 percent to 7 percent was
not achieved by 2011, but surpassed its target by 2012. Adding a supply-side dimension
to the project after restructuring helped achieved this result in 2012 (see below).

After restructuring:

62.     Overall, the achievement of the PDO after restructuring can be considered
Satisfactory. This is due to the resolution of implementation bottlenecks, more realistic
indicators and a more balanced Project design.

63.    After restructuring, the revised outcome indicator “Number of annual work
programs prepared, including key indicators, adopted and implemented each year” was
achieved with five work programs prepared.

64.     New MOP staff accountant, procurement, financial management and M&E
specialists and administration assistant) were recruited. UNFPA provided an international
population communication expert for 10 months and helped the MOP to implement its
communication strategy and subsequent plans. A project Steering Committee and its
Subcommittee were created and functional. The Project also provided vehicles,
motorcycles, office equipment and supplies and equipment for women ‘groups.

65.      The Project produced a system to hold regular coordination meetings – monthly
departmental meetings, quarterly regional meetings and biannual central-level meetings
to review project progress and activities. A system for quarterly supervision missions to
the departmental level by regional personnel and biannual supervision missions to the
regional level by central level personnel was put in place. One joint field visit was
undertaken each year by the Project coordination and the development partners, and a
second supervision mission was undertaken by the World Bank, against a target of two
joint field visits per year. Project annual reviews were carried out regularly.




                                           16
66.     These outputs contributed to achieve some key intermediate outcomes, such as
putting in place an improved M&E system, and help developing the ministry’s capacity
for planning. In particular, the MOP developed its three-year national population strategy
(2012-2015) and an M&E system to measure enhanced sector performance and outcomes.
Additionally, the MOP established processes for sector coordination and interactions with
its partners (ministries, civil society and intra-sector decentralized structures).

67.     At restructuring, the original indicator on population sensitization was replaced by
“proportion of women aged 15 to 49 who know at least one contraceptive prevalence
method”. This indicator captured better the efforts made by the Project in the
sensitization of the population and was achieved reaching the target rate of 90 percent in
2012.

68.     Along the line of introducing more realism in the outcome indicators, the
intermediate outcome indicator on “85 percent of the members of religious associations at
central, regional and community level sensitized on population and RH issues” was
replaced by “300 sermons to be completed on Parenté responsable by preaching religious
leaders in 6 regions”. This indicator was achieved with about 316 sermons delivered by
March 2013.

69.     To reach those outcomes, the Project sub-contracted with national 28 NGOs for a
nationwide, culturally-sensitive IEC and BCC campaign. A communication strategy was
established in 2009, followed by the development and validation of a communication
plan. Two Islamic arguments were developed: first age at marriage for girls and
boys/girls schooling. Communication TA was achieved through collaboration with
UNFPA. The project identified communication tools, developed the communication
messages and trained 100 percent of members of networks (women’s’ associations,
parliament, journalists, researchers, local governments and religious leaders). Traditional
communication channels community and NGOs were activated in rural areas. Results
have been disseminated for effective interventions to strengthen Pop/RH policies,
programs and outcomes. Over 5 million people were reached during the life of the Project.
The Project also trained 682 health staffs (at district and community level) and 270
women in community based contraceptive promotion and distribution in 5 targeted
regions (Taoua, Maradi, Dosso, Tillabery and Zinder). Against a target of one per year
between 2007 and 2012, only three youth sensitization campaigns on population,
development and RH/FP were organized at central and decentralized level, but between
2007 and 2012 two TV debates/conferences per year were organized by the journalists’
network on population and RH issues, exceeding the target of one per year. A network of
researchers was trained, and subsequently organized one broadcasted a conference on
population, development and RH/PF issues (although this fell short of the target of five
conferences (one per year between 2007 and 2012).

70.    At restructuring, the original indicator on contraceptive prevalence was replaced
by “contraceptive prevalence rates (modern methods) for women aged 15 – 49”. Rates
increased from 4.9 to 8.2 percent for modern methods (net of breastfeeding and




                                            17
amenorrhea) for women in unions, aged 15-49 in 2012 highlighting a positive trend in
this indicator (along the original one).

71.      To increase the use of reproductive health services, the Project promoted
increased distribution and use of modern contraceptive methods which generated positive
outcomes. Contraceptive prevalence rate was influenced by multiple donors and factors:
KFW and UNFPA along with government finance the procurement of contraceptives, its
availability and free distribution in the country. MOH, with IDA’s support, was also
funding contraceptive procurement and implementing it rather successfully. UNFPA and
the Bank partnered to support the government in implementing its population policy and
in adopting a Road Map for the reduction of maternal mortality. UNFPA also assisted the
government in developing a contraceptive security plan. The Project also contributed by
(i) training health staff and community based health workers in contraceptive promotion
and distribution, and (ii) carrying out an extensive nationwide communication strategy to
reach all end users of contraceptive in the targeted five regions.

3.3 Efficiency

72.      Scope of Analysis: While an analysis was conducted on Niger’s demographic
situation for the preparation of the Project (Annex 11 in the PAD), an economic analysis
was not conducted. The March 2010 QAG review indicated that “given the Project’s
institution-building and technical assistance nature, an economic and financial analysis
was not applicable.” As such, no initial economic analysis exists with which to compare
results at the end of the Project. Nor can any analysis be replicated with the latest data.
However, to the extent possible, we used data available to conduct an analysis to
highlight the development impact of the Project and the efficiency of the completed
activities (detailed in Annex 3). In line with previous assessments of the economic impact
of this type of Project (i.e. TA for capacity building and institutional strengthening), the
scope of the economic analysis was limited to the areas where there was more measurable
information. Since we could not reasonably estimate the economic benefit of all Project
activities, the analysis of costs, benefits and efficiency was restricted to Components 1
and 25, totaling US$5.3 million (53 percent of Project costs). No specific analysis was
done in the pre-restructuring phase but the lack of supply side interventions and the many
implementation issues make for a modest efficiency before 2011.

73.    Benefits of the Project: Components 1 and 2 addressed both demand and supply
side challenges through IEC/BCC activities and the strengthening of RH service
provision. These Project investments created both direct and indirect benefits for the
population. The Project benefits comprised several measures of direct impact, which
included greater awareness of population and RH issues, greater knowledge of
contraceptive methods, higher utilization of modern contraceptive methods, increased
prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding, improved capacity of health service providers to
address issues of RH and family planning, and enhanced capacity of the MOP to design

 Component 1: IEC/BCC activities to raise awareness of population and reproductive health issues;
Component 2: supply-side activities to improve provision of reproductive health services.


                                               18
multi-sector population programs. CPR (modern methods) increased from 5 percent to
8.3 percent, knowledge of contraceptives increased from 72 percent to 90 percent, and 95
percent of the population was sensitized to population and RH issues, exceeding the
target. Since behavior change takes time to materialize, the full effect of BCC activities
may require more time than Project implementation to emerge in a measurable way.

74.    While the indirect benefits of this Project are difficult to quantify, the
development impact is potentially substantial and the benefits of family planning are
summarized in the table below.

75.     Since most of these indirect benefits are not short-term effects, the returns on
investment will take longer than the Project implementation period to emerge. For
example, smaller family size means that families can invest more in each child’s
education. Measuring this requires the children to grow to age of enrolling in school and
then attending school. While it is difficult to quantify the economic benefit of the indirect
health and non-health effects listed above, we used data from existing literature to assess
overall efficiency of the Project based on direct benefits.

76.     Efficiency of the Project: We assessed the efficiency of the Project considering
its costs and health benefits.

      Allocative efficiency of the Project is considered as substantial after the 2011
       restructuring, as increasing awareness of population and RH issues (and
       increasing use of modern contraception to reduce fertility) is a key strategic
       priority for the development of the country and was strengthened by the alignment
       with a supply-side component. The design of the Project was adequately
       allocating a large part of the funding (44 percent of the Project: US$4.4 million)
       to advocacy, communication and coordination, reaching 95 percent of people over
       15 years old.

      Productive efficiency is considered as substantial after the 2011 restructuring.
       The IEC/BCC activities were contracted to NGOs (selected through competitive


                                               19
        process) and religious leaders. They have a comparative advantage to implement
        communication activities as they were already implementing activities in the
        communities and were the most cost-effective way to achieve the desired output.
        Additionally, contracting local NGOs aimed at increasing ownership of the
        Project and activities. Expanding contracting to NGOs for demand-side activities
        and increasing investment in supply-side initiatives during the 2011 restructuring
        substantially contributed to improving efficiency for Project implementation. This
        led to a disbursement rate of 100 percent. Therefore, implementation efficiency
        is considered as substantial by the end of the Project.

       Technical efficiency is rated high after the 2011 restructuring. The
        interventions included in the Project were technically sound. Components 1 and 2
        together can be considered a packaged family planning program, addressing both
        demand- and supply-side constraints to the utilization of family planning. This
        type of family planning program has been identified as one of the most cost-
        effective development interventions to date. 6 Based on the cost-effectiveness
        estimates of family planning programs as documented in the literature, this
        analysis used the overall estimate for Sub-Saharan Africa (cost per DALY gained
        US$34) and the Project costs to calculate the DALYs gained in Niger. 7 An
        estimated 157,203 DALYs were gained from the implementation of Components
        1 and 2 of Project. Since the estimate of DALYs gained is based only on direct
        health benefits, and the calculation excludes any indirect benefits to the
        population in both the short- and long-term, the estimate can be considered an
        underestimate of benefits gained from Components 1 and 2.

77.   Given the above facts, the efficiency of the Project after restructuring is rated
substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

78.     Based on the overall substantial ratings for relevance and efficiency and overall
moderately satisfactory rating for efficacy, the overall outcome rating is Moderately
Satisfactory. This outcome is the result of a moderately unsatisfactory pre-restructuring
phase and satisfactory post-restructuring phase, each accounting for 50 percent of the
total Project disbursement.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

79.     Priorities built into the Project such as girls’ education, women’s autonomy and
empowerment, contraceptive prevalence and behavior change contributed to enhanced
awareness of general population and specially of girls and women. The project reached
its objective to increase women's use of contraceptives. The prevalence rate of modern
contraceptives increased from 5 percent in 2006 to 12 percent in 2012 and many activities
at the village level have been implemented by local health workers trained by the project
on community based distribution of contraceptives and on family planning. It also
financed services like the distribution of family planning commodities at village level, the
BCC/IEC campaigns conducted in all regions of the country, and the reinforcement of the
women economic conditions with farmer materials.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

80.    Capacity strengthening in many areas such as policy development and M&E took
place under the Project. The institutionalization of the practice of data collection, analysis
and dissemination through the M&E quarterly reviews has continued post-project. Also,
the Project contributed to the strengthening of the capacity of decentralized bodies
(regions and districts) and provided technical assistance to NGOs, community
associations and umbrella groups, thus strengthening the technical quality of their staff.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

82.    Rating: Substantial

83.      While the Project focused on the most effective interventions for IEC/BCC
activities to build an impact on people’s behaviors, a long term intervention will be
crucial to sustain the behaviors changes attained with the Project to have an impact on the
decrease of the fertility rate. The use of qualified stakeholders at the regional and
communal levels to develop an efficient implementation mechanism contributed to the
Project’s results. However, given that the Government’s contribution to the MOP budget
through the national budget decreased through the life of the Project and is limited, the
sustainability of the communications activities and implementation arrangements put in
place will greatly depend on donors’ support. Also, the IEC/BCC activities would need to
be combined with activities to support women’s groups so as to strengthen women’s
economic opportunities and would need to be better tailored to the communities’ needs
and thus coordinated at the regional and district levels. At the institutional level, the
Project lost all trained staff who implemented fiduciary and technical activities at Project
closure.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

84.      Quality at Entry: While the strategic relevance and approach of the Project was
consistent with the country’s development priorities and the design of the Project was
solidly grounded in key sector diagnostics endorsed by key stakeholders, in retrospect,
the realism of the Project’s design and risks identified was not sufficiently adequate given
the decision made to assign the coordination and implementation to the recently created
MOP. The analysis of the capacities of the public sector and NGOs financed through the
PPF should have been complemented by a more rigorous institutional and human
resources assessment of the MOP. Moreover, implementing the Project turned out to be
much more difficult than what the Bank team had thought. As a result, the technical
assistance for the MOP should have been finalized during Project preparation and started
as soon as the Project was approved. Also, while the government was committed to the
Project’s objectives, its commitment to the Project’s design quickly was challenged by
the lack of clear defined roles and responsibilities of the various governments’
institutions for the coordination and implementation of the Project’s activities.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                            22
85.     Supervision and fiduciary missions were conducted regularly to ensure continuity
in dialogue with the Borrower and stakeholders. But, during the implementation period
pre-restructuring, identified implementation problems could not be resolved. Specifically,
the dialogue with the then minister of population proved difficult and the Bank team
failed to get resolution of the implementation problems faced by the Project due to the
minister’s willingness to have the MOP implement by itself the Project activities.
Detailed reviews of the main aspects of Project financial management were carried out on
a regular basis and led to marked improvements in the MOP’s FM capacity. As for the
quality of procurement oversight, although the number of reviews was adequate, some
delays were noted in the efficacy in handling procurement issues. With the July 2009
decision to nominate a field-based TTL that was formerly a member of the preparation
team, day-to day support and just in time advice were provided. This boosted the
implementation which improved significantly and allowed disbursements to reach 99.6
percent by the end of the Project. The Project amendments and the new implementation
arrangements brought about by the 2011 restructuring have been highly adequate and
increased the relevance of the design of the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

86.    Based on the above, the Bank's performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

87.      Overall government performance has been uneven over the life of the Project. The
pace of implementation was compromised by delays in ensuring adequate staffing and the
MOP’s insistence to implement the Project until the change of minister following the
institutional change of the ministry after the 2010 Coup. The formalization of contracting
agreements with NGOs took a very long time leading to a late start of the IEC/CCC
communication campaigns on the ground and delays in the implementation of activities.
Also, inadequate involvement of decentralized technical departments in the
implementation of the activities of the NGOs for the first contracts hampered
implementation. However, despite the difficult economic, socio and political environment,
the Government translated its commitment to the population agenda by budgeting and
disbursing resources for the main activities and gradually implemented the M&E system
put in place to monitor the Project’s activities and results. The MOP also fulfilled its
coordination role for the implementation of the population policy implementation by
establishing end of 2012 a donor’s partnership framework. While the two legal texts to
increase the legal age at marriage were prepared and submitted to the Parliament, they
have not been approved yet because of the opposition of some religious leaders.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.     The MOP sub-contracted NGOs to implement the communications component
and signed an MOU with some ministries (MoH, MOE, MOJ) and the National Institute
of Statistics. The involvement of NGOs to organize outreach campaigns has proven
effective. Training planned in the second part of the Project was not completed as
expected for health personnel, "femmes relais", journalists and parliament members,
because of the high turnover of key ministers and the stakeholders.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

89.    Based on the above, the Borrower's performance was rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned:

90.   The following lessons learned relate to country ownership, project design and
implementation and sustainability of results.

   Addressing the population agenda needs to be anchored in the highest level of
    government: The population agenda cannot be the sole responsibility of MOP while
    it is the coordinating responsibility of the MOP. As one of Niger’s top development
    objectives and given its multi-sectoral nature, the population agenda should fall under
    the mandate of the Prime Minister who is responsible for managing all ministries
    ensuring their full exploitation of comparative advantages to contribute to the
    country’s overall development. Also, the Prime Ministry should be responsible for
    advocacy and oversight, holding all ministries accountable for their parts in
    addressing the population agenda.
   Technical assistance to address the population challenge should be clearly
    devised at all levels of society for increased country ownership. It is as important
    to strengthen and reinforce the need for permanent capacity building at central level
    as it is at the local level. Building capacity of members of regional and communal
    councils set up with the country’s decentralization process should bring solutions
    adapted to the specificities of the region or commune. This would in turn, ensure the
    sustainability of the interventions toward the intended goal of decelerating population
    growth.
   Ownership of design by the government is key for successful implementation
    and impact on the ground: While political will was a pre-requisite for the Bank to
    prepare the Project, it was not sufficient. Without a full appropriation of the Project
    design, we are faced with a poor integration between the Project team and the
    government officials in charge of implementing the Project. As a clear consequence,
    Project implementation is sub-optimal and impact on beneficiaries may be
    jeopardized.


                                            24
     Awareness/sensitization approach: The IEC/BCC campaigns should be linked to
      the support for women empowerment in order to impact on women’s economic
      conditions which then can reinforce the awareness messages and activities in the
      general population.
     Make the best of a decentralization system: Design and implement through a
      bottom-up approach by using decentralization and community-based system.
     Culturally sensitive interventions: There is a need for specialized IEC/BCC
      expertise and for the design and implementation of interventions to be cognizant of
      local culture, needs, and issues; it points to a need for joint design; local delivery with
      expert oversight, supervision, follow-up and M&E.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Background

Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita gross national income
(GNI) of US$360 as of 2011. Current development conditions in Niger are far from
favorable, and its ability to achieve the MDGs and PRS II goals is severely limited by the
lack of abundant natural resources, the low productivity of its traditional agricultural
systems, and its harsh climatic conditions. Fertility is still very high and is estimated at
7.6 births per woman in 2012/DHS-MICS. Persistent high fertility, combined with some
improvements in child mortality, contributes to both high population growth and a very
young age structure. Niger has the highest proportion of young people in the world, and
due in part to improvements in child mortality, the proportion has been increasing. This
implies an unfavorable effect on the dependency ratio – Niger has the highest youth
dependency ratio globally (105 people below age 15 for every 100 working age adults).

Niger’s demographics have substantial implications for economic growth and poverty
alleviation, and the Project was designed to address some of the key challenges by: (i)
enabling the Ministry of Population (and Social Reform) (MOPSA) to design and
implement a nationwide multi-sector population program; and (ii) increasing general
awareness on population and reproductive health issues.

While an analysis was conducted analyzing Niger’s demographic situation for the
preparation of the project (Annex 11 in PAD), an economic analysis was not conducted.
In March 2010, a review conducted by QAG indicated that “given the project’s
institution-building and technical assistance nature, an economic and financial analysis
was not applicable.” As such, no economic analysis exists with which to compare results
at the end of the project. Nor can we replicate the analysis with the latest data. However,
to the extent possible, we use the data available to conduct an analysis to highlight (a) the
development impact of the Project, and (b) the efficiency of the completed activities.

2. Development Impact of the Project: Costs, benefits and efficiency

The project investments created both direct and indirect benefits for the population. In
this section, we assess the project costs, the direct and indirect benefits, and Project
efficiency.

2.1. Project Costs

A wide range of economic, health and social costs and obstacles are associated with the
use of family planning: lack of knowledge; availability of family planning methods;
health concerns and side effects; objections from husbands or other family members; and
concerns about moral and social acceptability.i Compared to other settings, these issues
are particularly challenging in Niger and the Project was designed to comprehensively
address these costs and barriers on both the supply- and demand-sides to ultimately



                                             35
increase the utilization of family planning. As indicated in the table below, 44 percent of
project costs went toward implementation of Component 1, 9 percent for Component 2
and 47 percent for Component 3 (components as per the 2011 restructuring).

Table A.1 Project Costs

 Component                                                                           US$
 Component 1        Advocacy, Communication and Coordination                    4,420,314
                    Strengthening the Supply of Reproductive Health
 Component 2        Services                                                      924,601
 Component 3        Capacity Building and Monitoring & Evaluation               4,769,700
                    Total                                                      10,114,615

Component 1 supported IEC/BCC activities to raise awareness of population and
reproductive health issues, including fertility, links between family planning and
investments in children’s education, family planning methods, and exclusive
breastfeeding. Target audiences included women, traditional and religious leaders,
journalists, parliamentarians, youth and researchers.

Component 2 supported supply-side activities to improve the quality of reproductive
health service provision. Health providers at facilities as well as health workers in the
community were trained. Additionally, contraceptive supplies were financed to address
supply shortages and smooth distribution flows.

Component 3 supported capacity building; data collection, analysis and dissemination;
partial financing of the 2012 DHS; training of NGOs in project and financial
management; and supervision of sub-contracts to NGOs. This component was dropped
during the 2011 restructuring of the Project.

While we can estimate some of the impacts of Components 1 and 2 of the Project, no
direct evidence is available to corroborate the impact resulting from Component 3.
Therefore, in line with previous assessments of the economic impact of this type of
project (i.e. TA for capacity building and institutional strengthening), the scope of this
economic analysis will be limited to the areas where there is relatively more measurable
information. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the economic benefit of all project
activities, the analysis will be restricted to Components 1 and 2, totaling US$5.3 million
(53 percent of Project costs).

Thus, the following sections only reflect the costs, benefits and efficiency associated
with only Components 1 and 2.

2.2.   Development Impact: Direct Benefits

The project benefits comprised several measures of direct impact, which included greater
awareness of population and reproductive health issues, greater knowledge of
contraceptive methods, higher utilization of modern contraceptive methods, increased


                                            36
prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding, improved capacity of health service providers to
address issues of reproductive health and family planning, and enhanced capacity of the
MOP to design multi-sector population programs.

On the contraceptive prevalence rate, Component 2 of the project (reproductive health
services after restructuring) was specifically targeting 5 regions that have higher fertility
rates. Contraception prevalence rates (for women in union aged 15-49) show in some of
the targeted regions significant increase, as detailed in the table below:

On the raising awareness impact of the project, women’s knowledge of contraception
increased from 72 percent to 90 percent. Other aspects of BCC and IEC activities were
assessed in 2013 through a Beneficiaries Assessment. ii Data from this assessment
provide a sense of the knowledge gained by the population through the Project’s IEC and
BCC activities and also the thoughts of the population about changes entailed by the
communication strategies:

2.3. Development Impact: Indirect Benefits

While the indirect benefits of this project are difficult to quantify, the development
impact is potentially substantial. Evidence suggests that when childhood mortality
decline is followed by fertility decline, there is an impact on a population’s size and
structureiii:
 Population momentum: an initial increase in population growth due to improving
mortality rates.
 Population structure: the period of time between the declines in mortality and fertility
creates a population bulge as more children are born and fewer die. Age structure will be
affected because as mortality rates decline, a large cohort of infants and children will
survive to their productive working years, resulting in a lower dependency ratio.
 If accompanied by appropriate policies, countries may be able to harness this
demographic transition in the form of the demographic dividend that leads to economic
growth and poverty alleviation.

As described in the PAD, the Project intended to induce this fertility decline. In order for
fertility to decline, there needs to be knowledge about family planning methods and
utilization of these methods, both of which increased during the implementation of the


                                                       38
Project as discussed in section 2.2 on direct benefits. The established literature indicates
that family planning has numerous effects on health including preventing unintended
pregnancies, high-risk pregnancies and the number of unsafe abortions. In addition, a
number of non-health benefits of family planning have been identified at both the micro-
and macro-levels. These indirect benefits are summarized in the table belowiv:

Table A.5 Indirect benefits of family planning

                                Non-health benefits

 Better health and nutrition of More attention and parental care   Higher savings and
 mothers                        for each child                     investment

Most of these indirect benefits are not short-term effects – in other words, the returns on
investment will take longer than the Project implementation period to emerge. For
example, smaller family size means that families can invest more in each child’s
education. Measuring this requires the children to grow to age of enrollment in school
and then attend school. While it is difficult to quantify the economic benefit of the
indirect health and non-health effects listed above, we use data from existing literature to
assess overall efficiency of the Project based on direct benefits.

2.4.   Measures of Economic Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

The previous sections discussed the direct and indirect benefits of the project on health
and non-health factors. In the following paragraphs, we assess the efficiency of the
project considering its costs and health benefits. Efficiency of a project can be assessed
along several dimensions – allocative efficiency, productive efficiency, implementation
efficiency and technical efficiency (definitions provided in the table below) – and each of
these is discussed below with respect to the Project.




                                               39
Table A.6 Dimensions of Efficiency Analyzed

               Efficiency                                   Definition
    Allocative efficiency           Allocative efficiency could be defined as the use of
                                    resources to meet strategic development priorities and
                                    improve welfare of population.
    Productive efficiency           Productive efficiency is concerned with producing
                                    services with the optimal combination of inputs to
                                    produce maximum output for the minimum cost.
    Implementation efficiency       Implementation efficiency could be defined as the
                                    effectiveness of implementation arrangements to achieve
                                    project’s activities.
    Technical efficiency            Technical efficiency can be thought of as the effectiveness
                                    with which a given set of inputs is used to produce an
                                    output.

       Allocative efficiency: Allocative efficiency of the project is considered as
substantial as increasing awareness of population and RH issues (and increasing use of
modern contraception to reduce fertility) are a key strategic priority for the development
of the country. Moreover, decreasing the high fertility rate has a global positive impact on
development of the country, through decreasing the demand for social services (health
and education), pressure on natural resources and poverty rates (as detailed in the 2.3
section).

Population issues are sensitive in Niger, with important cultural and social
opposition. The design of the project was adequately allocating a large part of the
funding (44 percent of the Project: US$ 4.4 million) to advocacy, communication and
coordination. The Project sensitized 95 percent of the population, exceeding the target of
85 percent.

Cost per beneficiary of sensitization on population and reproductive health issues
(population over 15 years old) are calculated in Table A.7.

      Productive efficiency: In the Project, productive efficiency is considered as
adequate (after restructuring in 2011).

For component 1, to reach awareness on population and reproductive health issues, an
exhaustive study to develop a national communication strategy to behavioral change on


                                            40
reproductive health was conducted to assess the best strategies to implement (through a
perception study and an inventory of past communication strategies). The IEC/BCC
activities were contracted to NGOs (selected through competitive process) and religious
leaders: they have a comparative advantage to implement communication activities as
they were already implementing activities in the communities, and this was the most cost-
effective way to achieve the desired output. Additionally, contracting local NGOs also
aimed at increasing appropriation of the project and activities. Communication supports
were selected from an inventory of existing communication supports and the most
powerful communication tools were distributed to local associations for support their
local activities. Finally, mass media were used to convey RH messages which helped to
further reach a wider audience (75 community radios and 5 commercial radios).

For component 2 related to supply of health services, significant saving was achieved
through the competitive bidding process for training materials procured by the project
(for health personnel and “femmes-relais”). The support from the project was also
complemented by UNFPA which provided support to the Government to improve the
expansion of reproductive health activities at the community level.

        Implementation efficiency: Project implementation was affected by some
institutional instability with the implementing agency, the MOP being changed twice and
later on merged to become the Ministry of Population and Social Reform and Women’s
Promotion and Child Protection. After weak implementation during the first half of the
project (delays in activities implementation due partly to the weak capacity of the
implementation unit), a restructuring of the Project in May 2011 led to intensive
implementation for the 2 last years. Disbursement rate was at 100 percent by the end of
the Project.

The restructuring largely contributed to improve the implementation efficiency, which
could be considered as satisfactory by the end of the project (latest ISR rating). Indeed,
the restructuring of the project aimed at strengthening and simplifying the project design,
with intensifying the demand-creation for reproductive health services and strengthening
the supply-side of health services. Expanding contracting to NGOs for demand-side
activities and increasing the investments in supply-side initiatives substantially
contributed to improving efficiency of Project implementation.

       Technical efficiency: Evidence from both controlled and “natural” experiments
indicate that family planning programs have successfully not only increased knowledge
and use of contraceptives but also decreased fertility and improved maternal and child
health, household earnings and use of preventive health care – examples include
Bangladesh, Iran and Kenyav . A vital part of successful family planning programs is
communicating and promoting the benefits of contraception to all stakeholders to
increase awareness and acceptance of contraception. By providing factual information
and dispelling myths about family planning, these efforts can motivate individuals to
change behaviors. Of course, the supply-side also has to be able to provide quality
services to keep pace with growing demand.




                                            41
The interventions included in the Project are technically sound and consistent with a
series of articles in The Lancet which recommended priority, high-impact interventions to
reduce child and maternal mortality rates. Components 1 and 2 together can be
considered a packaged family planning program, addressing both demand- and supply-
side constraints to the utilization of family planning. This type of family planning
program has been identified as one of the most cost-effective development interventions
to date.vi

By convention, due to data availability and methodological constraints, cost-effectiveness
has been assessed based only on direct health benefits from increased birth spacing and
reduced adolescent pregnancies. These estimates do not take into account any of the
indirect health and non-health benefits discussed above. However, based on the direct
health benefits alone, Table A.3 displays regional estimates of costs of family planning
programs per benefit for the following health benefits: birth, infant death, and maternal
death averted as well as disability-adjusted life year (DALY 8 ) gained. Health
interventions that cost less than $100 per DALY are considered highly cost-effective by
international standards.vii Thus, family planning programs can be considered highly cost-
effective at $34 per DALY gained.

As discussed above, the efficiency assessment is limited to the Project Components 1 and
2 which together is a technically sound family planning program. Based on the cost-
effectiveness estimates of family planning programs documented above, this analysis
uses the overall estimate for Sub-Saharan Africa and the Project costs to calculate the
DALYs gained in Niger. (This assessment focuses on DALYs gained as it is the most
comprehensive measure of health benefit available). As indicated in Table A.4, an
estimated 157,203 DALYs were gained from implementation of Components 1 and 2 of
the Project.

 DALYs are a measure of overall burden of disease, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health,
disability or early death.


                                                    42

Project

                        Costs (US$)                                          Benefit (DALYs)
    Cost of Components 1 & 2      Cost per DALY gained                        DALYs gained
            $5,344,915                     $34                                   157,203

It is important to note that the estimate of DALYs gained is based only on direct health
benefits, and the calculation excludes any indirect benefits to the population in both the
short-and long-term (e.g. public and private expenditures for health, nutrition and
education; women’s labor force participation; higher household earnings; higher
productivity; etc.). The estimate also does not include any improvements in quality of
service provision resulting from training provided to health providers. Thus, this estimate
can be considered an underestimate of benefits gained from Components 1 and 2. In the
Project, technical efficiency is rated high.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

In February 2013, a beneficiary assessment was conducted by the Project through a
consultant service (Bureau Africain de Suivi et Evaluation « Development Consult » -
BASE/DC. The survey covered all eight regions of Niger. In each region, three zones
were selected and two villages within these zones were covered; the survey also included
a reference zone. The survey team visited a total of 48 villages/sites.

The survey results show that most people recognize the impact of population growth on
health, education and agriculture. However, the impact on the environment and
employment is not as well understood.

Changes attributable to the Project:

   Population - Development Interrelation: A general awareness of local stakeholders
    about the effects of uncontrolled population growth was observed. Respondents cited
    famine, poverty and the lack of socio-economic infrastructure as consequences of
    population explosion. This awareness is reflected on the spot through the adoption of
    family planning by communities for responsible parenthood. In general, the leaders
    expressed their commitment to the desired changes through the awareness of the
    consequences of population explosion and the adverse effects of drought, famine,
    poverty, diseases and lack of socio-economic infrastructure.

   Reproductive Health: In all regions, there is a positive attitude towards the use of
    modern contraceptive methods, even if these behavioral changes are not due solely to
    the Project activities. Indeed, women have a better understanding of the benefits of
    RH and they use the two main modern contraceptive methods that are pills and
    injections.

   Breastfeeding only: Significant progress has been made in this area. Understanding
    the importance of breastfeeding-only, many women have adopted the practice and are
    expressing their satisfaction with it. This is mainly the result of health workers’
    endeavor, as they explain to women the importance of breastfeeding during prenatal
    consultations, as planned under the Project.

   Education of girls: Survey results show that, in project areas, there is a very positive
    attitude towards girl’s education within the communities. As a result many girls are
    enrolled in schools. However, there is still some resistance by some who believe that
    girls learn bad behaviors in school.

   Women Empowerment: The Project’s support is appreciated as very significant,
    although support was minimal. However, it is considered that support to women to
    assist them materially with their domestic chores gives them opportunities to send
    their daughters to school. Others confirm that women who received wheel cart and
    motorized pumps were able to support their husbands in the buying of clothes for the



                                            46
    family. Still some say that when women have more means to live by, they are more
    difficult to “manage”.

   Family Planning: The survey highlighted the acceptance of birth spacing with the
    use of modern contraceptive methods. Women feel more comfortable about the issue
    and do visit health centers more frequently for prenatal consultations. Behavior
    change occurs gradually despite the reluctance of some religious leaders. CIP at
    health centers and programs previously carried out contributed significantly to change
    the habits of people.

   Early Marriage: Most people interviewed indicated that they learned the negative
    impact of the early marriage such as fistulas and still born babies. If this trend is
    maintained, the rate of early marriages should be reduced, thereby delaying the age of
    first marriage and allowing girls to remain in school until the end of the primary cycle.

   Literacy of women: Women leaders and religious leaders are unanimous on the
    necessity to educate women. Some people mentioned that the Project did not provide
    support to activities to create and support literacy centers. However, outreach
    financed by the Project had a positive impact on the number of women going to the
    existing centers. Other partners have financed new centers, and some new Koranic
    schools have opened.

Assessment of the Project approach: The evaluation showed generally very positive
findings regarding the results reached by the Project and changes observed in the
populations. The main strengths cited by stakeholders are: (i) increased use of health
facilities by women; this has improved the use of modern contraceptive methods, as
well as mother and child health services, the improvement of girls’ level of education;
(ii) reduction of early marriages in villages; (iii) qualitative change in civil registration;
(iv) reduction of risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth; (v) awareness of
opinion leaders on population-development link; and (vi) Improvement of geography
and biology lessons.

However, the Project shows some weaknesses regarding:

   Late start of IEC/CCC communication campaigns on the ground and the delay in the
    implementation of activities due to the slow disbursement which are essentially due to
    the time taken by the departments of the Ministry and the various stakeholders to
    master the procedures;
   Inadequate involvement of decentralized technical departments in the implementation
    of the activities of NGOs for the first contracts;
   All stakeholders underlined the insufficient monitoring of activities;
   Lack of supporting measures for women (low funding of IGA that should favor
    poverty reduction or women empowerment);
   Shortcomings in the programming of activities which in some cases overestimated the
    capacity of stakeholders;



                                             47
   The short duration of the project (which did not allow the implementation of certain
    activities); and
   Lack of financial resources, which did not allow for greater coverage in the 8 regions
    of the country.

Beneficiaries’ expectations are as follows: (i) increase of resources allocated to
stakeholders; (ii) support to the village committee in its management of the case de
santé (community health center); (iii) financing of IGA and house work relief (fattening,
mill, etc.); (iv) greater involvement of local actors in the field; (v)support activities of the
PDC; (vi) Provision of adequate resources for raising awareness; (v) better adapt
awareness of themes and tools to match the different social and cultural contexts; and (vi)
civic awareness with regards to payment of income taxes so that the municipalities can
invest in areas such as education.

Recommendations are:

   Changes that were attained during the project life could be lost if the momentum is
    not maintained. In other words, the main risk is the Project closure and no follow up
    project. The achievements as of today are too fragile to be sustained on their own.
    The sustainability of these results could only be obtained with in-depth work for their
    strengthening; this requires means, time and a good strategy.
   The evaluation team recommends the continuation of the Project interventions in all
    eight regions so as to consolidate and strengthened achievements obtained so far. The
    mission suggests that the basic principles of the project be maintained and continued,
    particularly the involvement of exiting expertise in the country (NGOs, associations,
    local leaders);
   There is a need to include capacity building for them as well as for all
    stakeholders/actors in the implementation of the project at the local level; and
   Particularly it is important to include measure for the sustainability of the Project
    achievements, so that the decentralized technical services may take over.

Particular attention should also be given to building the capacity of beneficiaries,
including women for house work relief and practice of income-generating activities, and
accompanying measures to consolidate the achievements. There is also a need to plan
measures ensuring sustainability of the achievements of the Project.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. Background

Since the first general population census in 1997, all successive governments have had to
face the problem of the country’s demographic explosion and its consequences.

The Nigerien population grew from three millions in 1960 to about 17 million in 2012.
This represents a quintupling of the population in a timeframe of 52 years. Between 1990
and 2006 the average rate of population growth was 3.1 percent. It grew to 3.9 percent
in 2012 which, coupled with the rapid degradation of the country’s limited natural
resources, contributed to worsening the gap between economic and population growth.

Project initiation and preparation evolved in the framework of structural adjustments,
implementation of the first phase of the PRSP (which third pillar was the control of the
population growth), a general population census, demographic and housing surveys,
demographic projections for 2005-2050, a Bank-financed study with a demographic
perspective on food safety, provision of health services and education for all Nigeriens,
as well as an evaluation of the existing national population policy.

Awareness of major challenges related to the rapid population growth led government to
take action and implement new initiatives including the adoption of the Déclaration du
Gouvernement en matière de Politique de Population (DGPP) in 2007 which has for
objectives to:
• increase utilization of birth spacing method from 15 to 20 percent amongst Nigerien
couples;
• reduce by one third the proportion of early marriages;
• promote the extension of the period of breastfeeding;
• reduce the number of mother/child ratio from seven to five; and
• reduce the population growth from 3.3 percent to 2.5 percent.

In order to support the implementation of the national program and attain expected results,
the Ministry of Population developed and implemented the Multi-sector Demographic
Project (PRODEM) financed through an IDA grant of US$10 million signed between the
Government of Niger and the World Bank in June 2007.

2. Implementation

The project was implemented mainly by the MOP (DEP, DAF, General Population
Department, and other technical departments of the MOP) and by the MOH which
received a substantial portion of the funding for implementation of activities for
strengthening the supply of reproductive health and family planning services through the
deployment of community-based distribution points for contraceptives.

Main activities implemented under the project and main achievements, by component:



                                           49
Advocacy and Communication:

   large awareness campaigns covering the whole territory through contracts with NGOs
    and CBOs and involving various media organizations, religious leaders and village
    local leaders.

Themes that were covered under these campaigns included (i) the relationship between
population and development, (ii) birth spacing ; (iii) early marriages ; (iv) girls education
and women literacy; and (v) breastfeeding only.

Strengthening the Supply of Reproductive Health Services:

   creation of distribution points for contraceptives
   staff training for field supervision;
   distribution of training and awareness materials and equipment;
   procurement of contraceptives was cancelled due to their availability in the country;
   training of local health center staff and femmes-relais in five regions; and
   financing of equipment for women associations to (85 motorized water pumps, 145
    wheel carts) to makes their domestic tasks easier and motivate them to support girls
    education.

These activities were implemented by all partners, including the MOP. The MOP and
other partners activities resulted in an increase of breastfeeding-only rate (from birth to 5
months) of 13.5 percent in 2006 to 23 percent in 2013, surpassing the end-of-project
target of 20 percent The gross rate of contraceptive prevalence in married women (age
20-24) increased from 4.4 percent in 2006 to 12.6 percent in 2012, also surpassing the
target of 7 percent.

Capacity Building and Monitoring & Evaluation:

   a population migration survey;
   a general population and health survey in 2012; the establishment of a socio-
    demographic database (not operational as of project closing due to lack of current
    data);
   the creation of several committees responsible for population issues at the national
    and regional levels; and
   Capacity strengthening of Parliament and Regional Representatives.

These activities contributed to the timely production of the projects monitoring and
evaluation reports as well as planning and implementation reports as listed in the
financing agreement.




                                             50
Project performance:

All key performance indicators, with the exception of the most important one related to
increase of the legal age at first marriage, have either reached or exceeded the target
value at the end of the Project.

Major decisions that have favored the Project:

   The appointment of a project manager based in Niamey greatly facilitated the
    implementation of the Project.
   During the mid-term review, the Bank’s readiness to adapt the Project to the national
    context contributed to the reorientation of the Project by further promoting a multi –
    sectoral approach and greater involvement of partners including the Ministry of
    Public Health, NGOs, religious organizations and traditional leaders for a more
    effective implementation of planned project activities.
   The agreement by the Bank to experiment accompanying actions such as the
    procurement of wheel carts and motor pumps which have led to the massive
    participation of women in various outreach activities in the villages.
   The government’s willingness to ensure that existing staff in technical departments
    involved in the implementation of the project were not only available but also
    committed, and dedicated to the achievement of project results; and
   The establishment of the Inter-ministerial Committee for monitoring indicators.

Key decisions (or lack of) having hindered the project implementation:

1. The formalization by contract with NGOs / AD took more than a year because of the
   options recommended changes by the Bank as part of the procurement; and
2. The lack of resources and the lack of management of coordinating bodies established
   at national, regional, departmental, and communal level have seriously hampered
   implementation of several decentralized activities.

Among the lessons learned, it was noted that:

   The more frequent visits to health facilities by women has improved the use of
    modern contraceptive methods, the health of mother and child, and girls’ schooling;
    and
   The involvement of NGOs to organize outreach campaigns have been effective and
    should be continued especially in rural areas targeting young people at schools and
    university level.

Assessment of Bank performance and implementing partners:

Despite difficulties and delay with regards to Bank procedures, relations between the
Bank and the MOP were cordial and respectful. Assessment of implementing agents:
Overall, the efficiency of the various project implementing partners was satisfactory.


                                           51
Perspectives beyond the Project:

The good experience of the Project deserves to be maintained and strengthened over a
relatively long period taking into account the very slow process that the mechanism of
behavioral change takes, especially in the particular context of Niger. It is therefore
critical to consolidate the achievements of the project with increased resources for a
better coverage of target areas, including support to massive awareness campaigns more
particularly with regards to rural associations and the distribution of equipment to ease
women’s domestic chores, especially in rural areas.
