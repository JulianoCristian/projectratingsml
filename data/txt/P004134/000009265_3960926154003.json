its\n            industrial structure. The project aims to further strengthen\n            the Korea Technology Development Corporation (KTDC) by\n            helping it and its newly-created venture capital subsidiary,\n            the Korea Technology Investment Corporation (KTIC), to\n            continue expanding their portfolio of riskier projects and\n            to adjust to a changing financial market and industrial\n            environment. Specifically, the project consists of: (a)\n            financing KTDC and KTIC subprojects proposed by enterprises\n            for the import, adaptation, creation and development of\n            industrial technology. The project also involves (b)\n            assistance to KTDC for staff development particularly to\n            upgrade its appraisal and supervision capabilities; and (c)\n            assistance in the development of KTIC."}, "docdt": "1988-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
