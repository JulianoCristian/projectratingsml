                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project's main development objective is to demonstrate, in the Egyptian context, the applicability of market-based financial/technical approaches
                         in order to be able to achieve significant pollution abatement in selected hot spots areas in and around the Alexandria and Greater Cairo areas. The
                         development objective outcome will be measured by the decrease in pollution loads in the selected hot spot areas. The target for this indicator will be the
                         achievement of at least 75% reduction in the quantity of pollutants emitted by the target companies in each of the targeted hot spots.
                          The proposed project will also be a vehicle for supporting the Government of Egypt to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the emerging carbon
                         market established after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A supervision mission visited Cairo between June 5-15, 2011. The total sub-projects applications have increased from US$ 206 million in January 2011 to US$ 222 million in June
                         2011, exceeding the total original loan envelope of US$ 160 million. Companies are still committed to participate in this project, in spite of the recent political events. Commitment

                         under the project has increased from US$ 141 million to US$ 156 million, which constitutes 85% of the total funds (on the basis of US$ 160 million equivalent at the time of the
                         signing of the loan agreements in 2006).

                         Disbursement of the World Bank loan of US$ 20 million has increased from US$ 6.1 million to US$ 8.5 million, totaling 43% of the WB's share. This is less than the amount
                         anticipated, however, due to the recent political events which have resulted in: (i) the closure of all national banks during certain days in the months of January and February 2011,
                         where no transactions were processed; (ii) the closure of many factories for a period of 1-2 weeks; (iii) the withdrawal of many international technical specialists from the country; and
                         (iv) the imposition of more stringent regulations upon the transfer of funds, requiring commercial banks to be more risk averse. Based on disbursement forecast, it is expected that
                         disbursement will reach 65% of World Bank funds by the end of project closing date of February 28, 2012. The co-financiers have agreed in principle to extend the closing date to
                         September 30, 2013. This extension will be formalized within the next three months.

                         The Egyptian Minister of Environment has re-iterated his interest for a follow-on project (EPAP III). Furthermore, NBE has expressed interest, in principle, to utilize some of their own
                         resources towards an EPAP III project. The mission, and the co-financiers (AFD, JICA, and EIB) have expressed renewed interest to collaborate with EEAA on a follow-up activity to
                         the project, provided an official request is made from the Government of Egypt.
