                         Project Development Objectives

                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The proposed project's main development objective is to demonstrate, in the Egyptian context, the applicability of market-based financial/technical approaches in order
                         to be able to achieve significant pollution abatement in selected hot spots areas in and around the Alexandria and Greater Cairo areas. The development objective
                         outcome will be measured by the decrease in pollution loads in the selected hot spot areas. The target for this indicator will be the achievement of at least 75% reduction
                         in the quantity of pollutants emitted by the target companies in each of the targeted hot spots. The proposed project will also be a vehicle for supporting the Government
                         of Egypt to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the emerging carbon market established after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         meets 75% according to the PDO. Since the reduction percentage is measured based on data from completed sub-projects, it will change as those sub-projects under implementation
                         reach completion. However, the reduction is expected to remain more than 80%.
