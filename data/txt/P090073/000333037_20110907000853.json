EPAP\n            II has generated significant interest as evidenced by the\n            total sub-loan applications of US$220 million, which far\n            exceeds the total available funds of US$160 million. The\n            current level of commitment totals US$136 million (85\n            percent) of available funds. It is expected that\n            disbursement will reach 65 percent of World Bank funds by\n            the end of the original project closing date of February 28,\n            2012, and 100 percent by the closing date of August 31,\n            2013. Despite the current good momentum of the project,\n            disbursement was delayed due to the long sub-project\n            implementation cycle combined with: (a) the adverse impact\n            of the global financial crisis that resulted in a 50 percent\n            reduction of the EPAP II project pipeline in early 2009; and\n            (b) impacts of the January 2011 events that resulted in\n            delays to sub-project implementation and the bidding of new\n            contracts. However, the Project Management Unit (PMU) has\n            made efforts to remove bottlenecks in disbursement and\n            invoicing at NBE and industrial companies and they continue\n            to perform at a very satisfactory level with commitment and\n            dedication. They have established a system for tracking\n            allocation, procurement and disbursement. They also have\n            prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to\n            complete the project. The audit report for the year ending\n            June 2010 was timely delivered and the next audit report is\n            due before December 31, 2011. The Bank team is confident\n            that the PDO can be achieved within the new closing date and\n            will monitor progress closely in order to make sure that all\n            remaining funds are disbursed as scheduled."}, "docdt": "2011-08-12T00:00:00Z"}
