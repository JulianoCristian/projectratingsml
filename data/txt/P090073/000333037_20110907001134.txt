7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The proposed project’s main development objective is to demonstrate, in the Egyptian context, the
applicability of market-based financial/technical approaches in order to be able to achieve significant
pollution abatement in selected hot spots areas in and around the Alexandria and Greater Cairo areas. The
development objective outcome will be measured by the decrease in pollution loads in the selected hot spot
areas. The target for this indicator will be the achievement of at least 75% reduction in the quantity of
pollutants emitted by the target companies in each of the targeted hot spots. The proposed project will also
be a vehicle for supporting the Government of Egypt to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the
emerging carbon market established after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005.
