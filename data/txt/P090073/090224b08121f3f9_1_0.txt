Project Development Objectives
Second Pollution Abatement Project (P090073)
Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The proposed project's main development objective is to demonstrate, in the Egyptian context, the applicability of market-based financialltechnical approaches in order
to be able to achieve significant pollution abatement in selected hot spots areas in and around the Alexandria and Greater Cairo areas. The development objective
outcome will be measured by the decrease in pollution loads in the selected hot spot areas. The target for this indicator will be the achievement of at least 75% reduction
in the quantity of pollutants emitted by the target companies in each of the targeted hot spots. The proposed project will also be a vehicle for supporting the Government
of Egypt to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the emerging carbon market established after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005.
Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

From June to December 2011, the project pipeline remained at 45 applications although loan requests dipped slightly from US$221 .8m to US$214.5m. The total pipeline still exceeds
the total original loan envelope of US$160 million. Companies are still committed to participate in this project in spite of the recent political events. To date, 6 sub-projects have been

completed and commitment under the project is US$133 million, representing 88% of the total funds have been disbursed or committed.
Disbursement of the World Bank loan of US$20 million has increased from US$8.5 million to US$9.4 million, totaling 47% of the WB's share. This is less than the amount anticipated,
primarily due to the delays caused by the political and economic turmoil of 2011. The co-financiers have agreed to extend the closing date to August 31, 2013 and this extension

information system (MIS)
comprising the following
modules: applications,
prioritization, procurement,
disbursement, repayment,

Amendments were made to
the financial modules, which
are now operational. Other
elements of the M&E system
include EREMIS, online
