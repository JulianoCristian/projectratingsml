F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The proposed project's main development objective is to demonstrate, in the Egyptian
context, the applicability of market-based financial/technical approaches in order to be able

                                                   vi
to achieve significant pollution abatement in selected hot spots areas in and around the
Alexandria and Greater Cairo areas. The development objective outcome will be measured
by the decrease in pollution loads in the selected hot spot areas. The target for this indicator
will be the achievement of at least 75% reduction in the quantity of pollutants emitted by
the target companies in each of the targeted hot spots.
  The proposed project will also be a vehicle for supporting the Government of Egypt to
take advantage of the opportunities offered by the emerging carbon market established after
the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005.

                                         x
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Egypt’s population increased from 36 million in 1973 to 66.4 million in 2002 and is
expected to reach 86 million by 2020. The rapid population growth coupled with ambitious
development and industrialization policies have put a heavy pressure on Egypt’s natural resources
in the form of severe air, water and soil pollution. As elaborated in the Country Environment
Analysis (2005) and conservatively estimated in the Bank’s Sector Note - Cost Assessment of
Environmental Degradation (2002), the cost of environmental degradation in Egypt has been found
to be, on average, in the order of 4.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (EGP14.5 billion)
for 1999. An Energy-Environment review undertaken by the Bank in Egypt in 2003, showed that
in terms of air pollution, the industry contributes to 21 percent of the damage costs, representing
EGP1.4 billion (1999/2000), ahead of transport contributing to 17 percent of the damage costs, and
vegetative burning contributing to 11 percent of the damage costs.

2.       On the environmental management side, significant improvements have been achieved
since the preparation of the first National Environmental Action Plan, and the establishment and
strengthening of the institutional and legal framework during 1992-1 994. An Environment
Protection Law was enacted in 1994, and a Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was
appointed in 1997. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) has gradually expanded
its functions and responsibilities in all fields of environmental management at the national, regional
and local levels.

3.      Market-based financing for pollution abatement investments in Egypt were first piloted in
the World Bank’s Egypt Pollution Abatement Project I (EPAP I) from 1998-2005, upon which this
Project builds. EPAP I was strategically important in introducing the “Four I’s Strategy”, which
was designed to move the industrial sector towards voluntary compliance, namely: (i) appropriate
Incentives included grants and a financing strategy; (ii) a strengthened Institutional framework; (iii)
targeted Investments; and (iv) Information dissemination through the Bank, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), and the establishment of an environmental database. The Project established
the technical and financial mechanisms for supporting pollution abatement investments,
strengthened the monitoring and enforcement capacity of the environmental regulatory institutions,
and overall assisted in reducing industrial pollution causing adverse health effects and ecological
degradation.

4.       Environmental and social issues were, and are, increasingly becoming business issues.
Many businesses export to the European Union, North America, and other developed regions where
compliance with environmental standards is a requirement and often constitutes an explicit non-
tariff barrier. Furthermore, there are opportunities for environmental investments that range from
remediation of existing pollution to the development of new products and services. Financial
institutions in Egypt that take into account their own as well as their clients’ environmental
compliance status, can avoid the financial and reputational liabilities of poor environmental
performance and poor business risk management. They are becoming aware that sound
environmental practices can help their clients take advantage of new opportunities while expanding
and strengthening their own portfolios.

5.      The rationale for the Bank’s involvement was predicated upon the necessity to build upon
previous efforts in assisting Government of Egypt (GOE) to further improve its environmental


                                                  1
management capabilities. The proposed Project was fully consistent with the World Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Egypt (2005), which called for supporting GOE’s
environmental strategy in order to be able to address the environmental risks that could accompany
economic growth and thereby encourage increased private sector awareness and involvement.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.      According to the Loan Agreement (LA) the objective of EPAP II is “to demonstrate the
applicability of market-based financial and technical approaches to achieve pollution abatement in
selected areas, particularly in and around the Greater Cairo and Alexandria areas.”

7.       The wording of the PDO in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) is slightly different,
yet similar in scope. However, it appears much longer as it incorporates descriptions of the key
performance indicator and of a stand-alone Carbon Finance (CF) sub-program: “To demonstrate,
in an Egyptian context, the applicability of market-based financial / technical approaches in order
to be able to achieve significant pollution abatement in selected hot spots areas in and around the
Alexandria and Greater Cairo areas. The development objective outcome will be measured by the
decrease in pollution loads in the selected hot spot areas. The target for this indicator will be the
achievement of at least 75% reduction in the quantity of pollutants emitted by the companies in
each of the targeted hot spots. The proposed Project will also be a vehicle for supporting the
Government of Egypt to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the emerging carbon market
established after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005.”

8.       Finally, in the PAD results framework the PDO is shortened: “Environmental conditions
in selected hot spots in the areas of Alexandria and Greater Cairo are improved.”

9.     Given that the text included in the LA is legally binding and therefore takes precedence,
the ICR will refer to the PDO stated in para. 6 above. Table 1 shows the original PDO-level and
intermediate outcome indicators with associated targets.

                       Indicator                                               Target

 A computerized M&E system is in place and covers at        2
 least the two areas of Alexandria and Qalubya by end

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.     The Project Development Objective was not revised.

11.      Two intermediate outcome indicators were formally revised during the second
restructuring on June 24, 2013. The indicator ” a framework agreement will be established between
the Environment Protection Fund (EPF) and at least one commercial bank” was dropped as the
planned deposits into the EPF of sustainable development premiums to be generated from the sale
of Certified Emissions Reductions (CER) in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects did
not materialize on time (adaptive restructuring).

12.     The indicator “At least 7 million tons of carbon emission reductions (as CO2 equivalent)
are purchased by the World Bank by the end of the project” was modified to track the CO2 reduced
from EPAP II sub-projects without the commitment whether the emission reductions would be
purchased and a revised indicator with a new target of “550,000 of CO2 reduction from EPAP II
projects” was included to this end.

13.     Finally, a number of indicators, which did not form part of the original results framework,
were introduced in June 2013 in a Bank-wide exercise to incorporate core indicators in on-going
projects. An additional three PDO-level indicators and two intermediate indicators were added to
the results framework one year prior to Project closing (see Table 2). The targets were identified
based on realistic expectations of what could be achieved.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project beneficiaries can be grouped in three: (1) the population working in the factories and/or
living down-stream or down-wind from industrial polluters will be less exposed to dangerous
pollutants as those industries reduce their emissions. The 2013 introduction of two core indicators
tracking the “particulate matter reduction achieved under the project“ and the mandatory sub-
indicator establishing the “number of people with exposure to PM10 in the area of the project”
together address this first group of beneficiaries; (2) the participating industries benefit from access
to concessional loans to reduce their pollution load either by transforming their production
processes or by controlling emissions end-of-pipe and by doing so to bring their emissions into
compliance with the environmental law. By improving their environmental performance, industries
gain access to markets through increased potential for export to developed markets, such as Europe,
which is a driver for economic growth; and (3) the participating intermediary banks benefit from
adding a new financial instrument to their portfolio. In addition, global environmental benefits are
derived from CO2 reductions. A revised indicator was introduced in 2013 to track the total amount
of CO2e reduction from EPAP II project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.      According to the PAD, the Project consists of two components and a stand-alone Carbon
Finance sub-program. However, it is important to note that the components referenced in the LA
differ from those in the PAD. These differences are reflected under each component below.

15.     Component I: A line of credit facility (US$20 million): A line of credit facility managed
by an Apex Bank (National Bank of Egypt) and financed by a loan from the World Bank (US$20
million), a concessional loan of about EUR40 million from the European Investment Bank, and a
concessional loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation of US$40 million equivalent.
The French Agency for Development joined shortly after Project approval with EUR40 million in
a concessional loan. This component will focus on pollution abatement in major hot spots in the
Alexandria and Greater Cairo Governorates and will target the industrial sector at large.

16.     In the LA, the component reads differently, yet is similar in nature and scope: The financing,
through the provision of Sub-loans by NBE and the Participating Banks, of specific cost-effective
pollution abatement investments by Beneficiaries to bring effluent discharges and air emissions of
said Beneficiaries’ existing facilities towards compliance with the Environmental Legislation, and
promote overall environmental performance of said Beneficiaries.

                                                   4
17.     Component II: Technical Assistance: Technical Assistance activities aimed at
strengthening the capacity of Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency and other key stakeholders,
and provide project management support. This component will be financed by the in-kind
contribution of the Government of Egypt, a contribution from the National Bank of Egypt, and a
grant from the Government of Finland (EUR900,000). Also, upon approval of the European
Investment Bank loan, the Project will be able to access an additional grant (up to EUR3 million to
EUR4 million) through the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership.

18.      In the LA, some aspects of this component is described quite differently: Provision of
technical assistance to: (i) improve the environmental planning and management capacities of
EEAA, the Beneficiaries, and other Project stakeholders; (ii) assist EEAA in the implementation
of the recommendations of the Egyptian General Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment
(EGGEIA); (iii) coordinate the overall implementation of the Project; and (iv) complete the design
of the Alexandria Integrated Coastal Zone Management proposal with a GEF grant financing in the
proposed amount of US$7.5 million.

19.     The key difference relates to the completion of a project design for a GEF grant. As per the
Aide Memoire (AM) from March/April 2007, the grant agreement for the Alexandria Integrated
Coastal Zone Management Project was stated effective, with TORs having been finalized and ready
for procurement. This constitutes evidence that this part of the technical assistance provided under
EPAP II was completed as planned.

20.      Carbon Finance Sub-program: This sub-program will assist the Government of Egypt’s
efforts to set up a sustainable pollution abatement program by using portions of the revenues from
the sale to the World Bank and other buyers of emission reductions generated under the Kyoto
Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The role of the World Bank will be to monitor
the use of the revenues generated from the sales of emission reduction and ensure that pollution
abatement activities are being implemented using the Second Pollution Abatement Project model.

21.      No funding was committed to this third component, which is not included in the LA and
treated as a standalone Carbon Finance Operation.

1.6 Revised Components

22.     The components were not formally revised.

23.      However, the carbon finance sub-program did not develop as planned. At the time of
appraisal, the carbon finance market was newly established. It presented an opportunity for
financial integration to help ensure sustainability of development outcomes. As such, carbon
finance modules became quite “à la mode”, and was often included in project documents, even
though in many cases there were no binding agreements to ensure the sale and purchase of certified
emission reduction credits. This Project was no exception and the third component was challenged
on several fronts. First, the registration with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) of the approximately 80 CDM projects in the pipeline took much longer than
anticipated at the time of appraisal. Second, the delay in registration caused a delay in the sale of
the CERs from eligible CDM projects, which by then were also challenged by the global financial
crisis. Third, most of the CDM projects had been developed by other parties than the World Bank,
and as result the Bank would not be a buyer of those CERs. Finally, the Bank’s donor funds
available to purchase CERs were quickly fully committed until the end of 2012. For those reasons,
the carbon finance sub-program did not come to fruition. While the component was never formally

                                                 5
revised, it was agreed with the client to drop the program during the mid-term review in 2009. No
funding had been committed to this component.

1.7 Other significant changes

24.      The Project was restructured twice. The first restructuring on August 12, 2011 was a level
2 restructuring to extend the closing date from February 28, 2012 to August 31, 2013 due to the
delays caused by the global financial crisis, which arose shortly after Project approval, and due to
the political events in Egypt beginning in January, 2011.

25.      The second restructuring on June 24, 2013 was also a level 2 restructuring to (a) extend the
closing date from August 31, 2013 to August 31, 2014 to properly complete Project activities, and
(b) revise two intermediate performance indicators to take into account that the CDM projects did
not move forward in a timely manner. This involved: 1) dropping the indicator “A framework
agreement is established between the EPF and at least one commercial bank during project
implementation”, and (2) modifying the indicator “At least 7 million CERs is purchased by the WB
by project end”, to instead tracking the amount of CO2 reduced from the EPAP II subprojects, the
target of which was set at 550,000 tons.

26.      The Onyx Alexandria Landfill Gas Capture and Flaring Project (P098737/TF056124) was
developed as a carbon finance sub-program attached to EPAP II. The Project was delinked from
EPAP II, and a separate ICR submitted. Therefore, the carbon finance sub-program will not be
rated as part of the present ICR for the EPAP II project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

27.      EPAP II came on the heels of EPAP Phase I, which shared the development objective of
reducing industrial pollution by establishing financial and technical mechanisms to support
pollution abatement investments. As such, EPAP II was based on a solid foundation with a highly
committed Government counterpart, an experienced Project Management Unit (PMU)
grandfathered into the Project, and with much of the institutional set-up already in place. This aided
the participatory process, which characterized the preparation of EPAP II. A well-structured Project
Steering Committee established under EPAP I had been in place since 1996 and benefitted from a
broad coalition of members. The Project also enjoyed a high degree of readiness at the appraisal
stage with a solid pipeline of potential investment projects pre-identified.

28.     Lessons learned under EPAP I called for a follow-on operation to focus more on the
enforcement function to balance the ‘carrot and stick” approach, and to be more results-oriented in
terms of environmental improvement objectives. Both lessons were duly considered in the design
of EPAP II. A stronger focus on installing monitoring equipment at various levels including both
ambient air stations, institutionally at EEAA, and end-of-stack at heavy polluting industries
complemented with capacity building, awareness raising, and benchmarking would allow for better
monitoring and evaluation, leading to improved enforcement. It would also allow for project-level
tracking of pollution abatement, and an ambitious objective was established to reduce targeted
pollutants from participating industries by 75 percent overall. The design also included the
Compliance Action Plans for further enhancement of the enforcement function.




                                                  6
29.    Project design involved a significant degree of complexity given the many stakeholders,
who formed part of the Project. Financial simulations were conducted to assess the feasibility of
the mechanism from the point of view of different stakeholders.

30.      The Project was carefully structured with a two-tier PMU in mind: A financial PMU hosted
in the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) and a technical PMU hosted in EEAA. As a Financial
Intermediary Loan, pollution abatement investments would be financed by a line of credit managed
by the PMU at NBE. Through on-lending to other commercial Banks, financing would be offered
to qualifying industrial polluters with a built-in grant element of 20 percent of the loan amount if
the agreed pollution abatement was achieved at the end of the sub-project. Loans would be provided
with five to eight years repayment period, a one to two years grace period, a 10 percent minimal
fund injection by the company, a Libor / Euribor +2 percent interest rate for foreign loans and 13
percent for loans in Egyptian Pounds; and a 20 percent grant on the loan subject to meeting agreed
environmental targets.

31.     The PMU at EEAA would assist the industries in developing the required documentation,
which would provide the foundation for establishing a baseline and identifying targets, and would
coordinate the final verification of pollution abatement in order to release the grant. To this end,
Borrowers committed to: 1) preparing environmental assessments of the sub-projects; 2) submitting
compliance action plans for the entire facility for EEAA approval; 3) preparing technical feasibility
studies; 4) undertaking the procurement following EPAP requirements (WB procurement
guidelines); and 4) entering into a EEAA Technical Agreement on environmental objectives,
monitoring and implementation.

32.      Designed to maximize pollution abatement for the given amount of available funding,
Project eligibility for funding under EPAP II was assessed on two dimensions: Financially, by
means of creditworthiness check performed by the NBE/participating banks, and technically, by
means of a cost-effectiveness criterion with a preset range of unit abatement costs. Combined, these
criteria would aim at the optimal allocation of resources and would ensure that the PDO could be
achieved while minimizing transaction costs and removing non-critical eligibility requirements,
thereby enhancing the marketability of the instrument.

33.     Parallel to the pollution abatement investments, which had been piloted in EPAP I, the
Bank sought to scale-up the approach by introducing more ambitious goals, particularly related to
building a sustainable financial architecture to ensure continuity of a market-based approach to
pollution abatement. The new opportunities presented by carbon finance became an element at the
Project design stage to generate a revenue stream for the EPF by charging a “sustainable
development premium” from the sale of certified emission reductions to the W orld Bank.
Furthermore, the Bank sought to develop a framework agreement between the EPF and the
commercial banking sector to promote pollution abatement investments. In hindsight, however,
creating such financial structures proved difficult during the implementation phase (section 2.2.).

34.      Developing a solid monitoring and evaluation system was a key Project objective in EPAP
II. Most pertinently, an advanced M&E system would allow for the precise verification of Project
results (see section 2.3 on monitoring and evaluation). Beyond this, the M&E system also allowed
to bench-marking the Egyptian industries in terms of environmental and technical performance.
This objective formed part of the overall technical assistance component, which aimed at
strengthening the capacity of the EEAA. The envisaged color-coding benchmarking system based
on environmental performance with public disclosure with the purpose of increasing public
awareness and pressure on heavy polluters was abandoned due to the changes in the political
climate.

                                                 7
35.     The Project was the first in the region to use country systems in lieu of the Bank’s
safeguards policies, thereby triggering OP/BP 4.00 on Use of Borrower System to Address
Environmental and Social Safeguards Issues in Bank-supported Projects. An Equivalence and
Acceptability Assessment (EAA) was carried out by an interdisciplinary Bank team in
collaboration with EEAA staff member. The results of the assessment indicated that the Bank’s
Environment Assessment Policy and the Egyptian environmental impact assessment (EIA) system
had many common features, and that Egypt had the basic institutional and legal infrastructure at
the national, regional, and local levels, but with a mixed track record on implementation. In
response, EEAA agreed to take a number actions to close the gaps, primarily related to (a)
disclosure requirements; (b) Environmental Management Plan (EMP) details; (c) need for
documentation of public consultations; (d) use of independent expertise and advisory panels for
complex projects; and (e) use of Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook guidelines. The
EAA was publicly disclosed and consulted in December 2005. Given the nature of the Project, no
negative social or environmental impacts were expected.

36.      At the time of appraisal, the main risk to achieving the project development objective was
identified as the lack of demand for financing from industrial companies. To diminish the risk an
aggressive marketing plan was envisioned at the planning stage complemented by better
enforcement of environmental regulation. This approach worked very well and generated demand
beyond available funds. Furthermore, diligent procurement and financial management review were
undertaken to reassess the measures needed to enhance compliance with Bank policies.

37.      Overall, the Project was well prepared and laid the foundation for a fairly smooth
implementation phase for the main Project activities. The carbon finance sub-program turned out
to be unsustainable; however, it is not clear to what extent the Bank team could have foreseen the
lack of bearing capacity of the CF sub-program. Given the Bank’s extensive experience in pollution
abatement and environmental management, the Bank was in a good position to assist the GOE in
developing a market-based instrument for improving environmental compliance of polluting
industries.

2.2 Implementation

38.      Project implementation advanced quickly in the early phase given the high degree of
Project readiness. Following Project launch, the PMU began reviewing requests for finance from
industries from the pipeline of proposals submitted prior to Project start. By June 2008, four
investment projects were under implementation, and the total value of the project pipeline had
grown to US$220 million. There was a need for a prioritization mechanism and it was determined
to limit projects thematically in Alexandria to focus on wastewater pollution and projects in Cairo
to focus on air pollution. Soon after, however, the impact of the global financial crisis was felt at
the project-level, with many applications being withdrawn and reducing the pipeline by 50 percent.
Now, there was a need for demand generation, and a number of proactive measures were agreed to
during the mid-term review (MTR).

39.      A mid-term review supervision mission was carried out in November, 2009 in Cairo, Egypt.
At the time, disbursement had been slower than planned as a result of the global economic downturn.
Meanwhile, a favorable exchange between the Euro and the Yen had increased the envelope from
US$160 million to US$192 million. To expedite Project implementation, it was decided to: (i) relax
the thematic tie to specific geographical areas; (ii) expand the eligible hotspot areas to include
industrial areas in southern Cairo as well as to contiguous governorates, whose pollutants affect the
hotspot areas in Greater Cairo and Alexandria, (iii) broaden the profile of eligible industries to

                                                 8
include the cement sector and a cluster of SME brick manufacturers as well as foundries needing
to relocate; and (iv) introduce flexibility in the financial terms and conditions for NBE’s on-lending
to participating Bank. The mid-term review included a review of the Project’s financial
management arrangements and internal controls, which were found acceptable. Key outstanding
issues related (i) to the removal of coercive clauses in NBE sub-loan agreements with industrial
beneficiaries, (ii) to the activation of agreements with participating banks, which had been delayed,
and (iii) to the fulfilment of gap-filling measures according to the EAA. Overall implementation
progress for the Project was rated moderately satisfactory.

40.     The first restructuring was approved on August 12, 2011 to extend the Project closing date
from February 28, 2012 until August 31, 2013. Disbursement had been delayed due to the global
financial crisis and the political events taking place in Egypt in 2011, affecting investment decisions,
lending terms, and supply of material. In addition, delayed invoicing at NBE and industrial
companies had created disbursement bottlenecks, which the PMU was taking steps to remove. The
extension would allow for the full commitment and disbursement of Project funds.

41.      The second restructuring was approved on June 24, 2013 to extend the Project closing date
until August 31, 2014 and to revise the key performance indicators. At the time, the Project was 63
percent disbursed with a moderately satisfactory rating for both development outcome and
implementation progress. Eight sub-projects were completed mainly for fuel switching and
wastewater treatment activities. Disbursement had moved slower than expected due to suppliers’
hesitation to submit bids, fuel and power shortages, and commercial banks’ disbursement slow-
down due to the economic down-turn.

42.      The extension was required to allow for the completion of activities and the monitoring of
the actual load reduction of other pollutants, such as Particulate Matter (PM), as most completed
sub-projects were focused on Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) reduction. Two intermediate performance
indicators were revised to realistically reflect expected achievements taking into account that the
CDM projects envisioned under the CF subprogram did not move forward in a timely manner. This
involved: 1) dropping the indicator “A framework agreement is established between the EPF and
at least one commercial bank during project implementation”, and (2) modifying the indicator “At
least 7 million CERs is purchased by the WB by project end”, to instead tracking the amount of
CO2 reduced from the EPAP II sub-projects, the target of which was set at 550,000 tons. It should
be noted that even though the establishment of a framework agreement did not happen, the
replication of the EPAP II instrument was taking place through the environmental compliance
investments funded by the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) and the German
development bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW).

43.      Project implementation was inevitably marked by two external events. The onset of the
global financial crisis in 2007/2008 lead to an economic downturn followed by a prolonged period
of stagnation. Shortly after, on January 25, 2011, a revolution against the established political
regime led to violent confrontation and a prolonged period of political instability. The excessive
capital flight during this period dried up foreign currency, threatening the survival of the Project.
This challenging country context had a significant impact on both external and internal factors
affecting the Project, leading to disbursement and implementation lag:

       Fluctuation in demand for EPAP II financing: The trickle-effect of the global financial
        crisis meant that many Egyptian industries were affected economically through
        cancellation of orders, outstanding payments, lack of supplier reliability, shortage of
        foreign currency, etc. This in turn lead to a significant number of EPAP II applications
        being withdrawn as industries felt this was not the right time to invest in pollution

                                                   9
    abatement with sometimes significant co-investment requirements due to the financing
    ceiling. This reduced the pipeline with 50 percent and delayed implementation. Creative
    measures were taken to stimulate demand, including expanding the areas and sectors
    eligible for financing and relaxing the sub-loan terms that NBE offered their clients. This,
    along with the recovery of the global economy and with aggressive marketing of the EPAP
    II financing instrument, helped ensure that demand returned and implementation improved.

   Unattractive sub-loan terms: The onset of the global financial crisis shortly after Project
    start led to a number of challenges relating to the lending and on-lending of EPAP II funds.
    The Apex bank introduced a number of coercive clauses partly in the on-lending to other
    participating banks and partly in the sub-loan agreements offered to clients. There was also
    weak involvement of participating banks given the lack of activation of their signed
    agreements with the Apex bank. The Bank and other co-financiers took an active
    involvement in the resolution of these issues to ensure accessibility and open competition
    of EPAP II funds for participating banks. By revisiting the financial simulations undertaken
    during Project preparation to analyze the attractiveness of lending terms for all parties, the
    numbers were updated in light of falling global interest rates, the global financial crisis, the
    growing interest for loans in local currency, etc. Based on this, new terms for lending and
    on-lending was drawn up and agreed to by all stakeholders. To ensure fair terms for
    industrial borrowers, the Bank eventually subjected all loan agreements to prior review
    before issuance. While some terms were easily adjusted, the issues were only fully resolved
    in early 2012.

   Lack of foreign currency for EPAP II financing: The political events in January 2011
    dried up foreign currency and restricted access to EPAP II financing. The original Project
    design emphasized that sub-project financing be passed on in foreign currency. The reason
    was that many supply and installation contracts were expected to be procured
    internationally. However, the demand for local suppliers were much higher than
    anticipated, with only two International Competitive Bidding (ICB) contracts actually
    carried out. The focus then on issuing loans in foreign currency became a limitation for the
    participation of many clients, who either did not have access to foreign currency (Egypt
    does not have a corporate credit bureau), or who could not bear the foreign exchange risk.
    The issue was resolved after revisiting the financial modelling analysis and allowing the
    Apex bank and participating banks to issue loans in local currency. This development was
    key to the survival of EPAP II during the difficult operating environment.

   Cancellation of launch of the environmental performance benchmarking system
    Program for Pollution Control Evaluation and Rating (PROPER): During Project
    preparation it was envisioned that a benchmarking system would be established to color-
    code industries based on their environmental performance to aid in the enforcement of
    environmental regulation. The idea was to make this system public with the purpose of
    increasing awareness as well as put pressure on heavy polluters to take compliance action.
    While this approach was piloted early on in EPAP II, the political events in early 2011
    changed the climate for launching such a system, and it was put on hold indefinitely. While
    the conditions following the January 2011 events were not conducive to implement an
    public disclosure scheme there were other factors involved : (i) the legal opinion at the time
    created uncertainties’ over whether the laws and decrees governing EEAA activities would
    permit them to publicly disclose what may be construed as confidential data; (ii) the ratings
    scheme had to be robust and stand up to public and legal scrutiny; (iii) the need to integrate
    the scheme within EEAA inspection and monitoring departments, that were already under-
    resourced and financial resources and costs-benefits of such scheme implementation. The

                                              10
        whole approach under EPAP II was to pilot the performance rating and disclosure scheme.
        This was done and further benchmarking on environmental performance was done through
        the monitoring of emissions and application of Best Available Techniques in the
        participating industries.

44.      The two-tier PMU structure supported the implementation period well. Throughout project
implementation the PMU at EEAA delivered technical support to participating industries. From the
initial application for funding through the final verification of results, the industries had access to
technical support for developing compliance action plans, feasibility studies, procurement
documents, monitoring systems, etc. This technical arm of the PMU helped optimize the investment
outcomes by ensuring the soundness of the approach and introducing the latest and most
appropriate and best technologies available. Meanwhile, “outsourcing” the financial management
aspects to an Apex bank helped increase transparency and accountability for management of project
funds.

45.      By Project closing date, the EPAP II model had leveraged an additional US$ 245 million
in pollution abatement investments through the preparation of 27 Compliance Action Plans (CAP)
with a combined investment need of US$ 700 million. Industry co-financing of EPAP II sub-
projects amounted to US$ 145 million, much above the required 10 percent self-financing. In
addition, the industries undertook another US$ 100 million in self-financed sub-projects to reach
compliance.

46.     Towards the end of the WB project, it became clear that the full loan amount could not be
fully disbursed based on the then current schedule. The pari passu ratio for much of the
implementation period had been was based on each co-financier’s contribution to the initial
US$160 million according to the exchange rates in 2007, which for the WB was 12.5 percent.
However, between January and August 2014, the Bank in agreement with the other co-financiers
increased its ratio from 12.5 percent to 30 percent to ensure full utilization of the loan proceeds
prior to August 31, 2014. This flexibility in design and willingness to cooperate has helped to
ensure the full disbursement of the loan by project’s end.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

47.      The design, implementation and utilization of the monitoring and evaluation systems
installed at the industry level, at the impact level, and at the institutional level were integral parts
of the EPAP II project. Table 3 below shows an overview of the various monitoring systems
installed at the three levels, all of which have been integral to the implementation of EPAP II sub-
projects and to the final verification of pollution abatement results in order to qualify for the grant
element.

                                                  11
48.      Sub-project monitoring and evaluation begins prior to approval with the preparation of
three key documents central to the later measurement and verification of results: An environmental
audit, a Compliance Action Plan; and technical specifications of the projects. Essential to these
documents are the identification of the key pollutants, the measurement of concentration and flow,
and the calculation of the average load. A three-step verification process is initiated: First, the
industry provides a sample at full operational capacity to EEAA. Second, the EEAA inspection
department pays an unannounced spot verification visit to the industry site to obtain a sample and
analyze it in-house. Finally, EEAA contracts an independent third-party to prepare a sample, which
is sent to a laboratory for verification. Finally, the EEAA verifies that there are no gaps between
the results, and the sub-project is technically approved at the level of the CEO of EEAA. This chain
of events is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

                                                                Verification
                                                                                     APPROVEL
                                                                  report
                                  EEAA laboratories

49.      Once the sub-project is under implementation, the industry provides self-monitored
quarterly reports to EEAA. Once the sub-project is commissioned, a twelve months monitoring
process begins during which, the industry continues to send quarterly monitoring reports to EEAA.
Following this period, the final verification of results is initiated and the same three-step process is
repeated. The readings presented in Figure 2 below shows the stack emissions before and after
installation of bag filters. Based on the recommendation from the PMU, the CEO of EEAA makes
the final decision to release the grant on the basis of compliance. Specifically for alternative fuel
sub-project, verification is based on the use of alternative fuel for one year and compliance with
agreed emissions.

50.     An EPAP II sub-project Management Information System (MIS) was developed through a
technical assistance (TA) grant to the PMU. The MIS is a project management system for handling
all project-related files and information, beginning with the application through to the final
pollution abatement results for the release of the grant.

51.      During EPAP II, an online monitoring system with a database was jointly financed by
EEAA (US$ 7 million) and participating industries (US$ 1 million) to upgrade the air monitoring
infrastructure. The industries financed the equipment for stack monitoring, and EEAA financed
additional air monitoring stations in the sub-project areas, and invested in advanced hardware and
software to allow for the online transmission of monitoring data collected from stacks and stations.
As of EPAP II project closing, three cement companies, a petrochemical company, an iron and steel
company and one fertilizer company currently have the online monitoring system installed. This
24-hour stream of data allows EEAA to develop compliance reports, load emission reports, and
statistical analysis.

52.     Currently, the system is only able to collect data on dust monitoring, but the plan is to
expand this system to also collect information on Sox and NOx. Under EPAP III, EURO 2 million
has been earmarked to upgrade the air monitoring system to also transmit data on SOX, NOX, and
CO (all of which are already collected at the industry site) and to expand the online monitoring to
include more companies.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

53.      As mentioned in section 2.1 above, the EPAP II project was the first in the MENA region
to use country systems in lieu of the Bank’s safeguards policies, thereby triggering OP/BP 4.00 on
Use of Borrower System to Address Environmental and Social Safeguards Issues in Bank-
supported Projects. On the basis of an Equivalence and Acceptability Assessment of the
institutional and legal infrastructure in Egypt at a national, regional, and local level against the
Bank’s safeguards policies and requirements, the EEAA agreed to undertake a number of gap-
filling measures prior to Project start. This included (i) revising the EIA procedural guidelines, (ii)
revising “Form B” to improve the screening criteria and make them more comprehensive, (iii)
updating the list of Competent Administrative Authorities, (iv) issuing detailed TORs for preparing
CAPs, and (v) revising the sectoral guidelines to reflect updated procedures. Beyond this, EEAA
would take a number of actions during implementation to sustain the acceptability of the system.
This would entail carrying annual reviews of the screening Forms A and B, training a core group
of EIA trainers, and train EEAA staff, NGOs consultants, reviewers, ministries, the media, and the
participating banks. EEAA would also establish a database to monitor the implementation of CAPs.

54.     Overall, Egypt and EEAA have benefitted greatly from using, revising, and updating its
own country systems and procedures to address environmental issues. While many of the measures
were timely implemented, other steps presented bigger challenges and led to delays in closing the
gaps. By 2009/2010 all agreed measure had been implemented. Given the nature of the Project, no
major safeguards issues arose during implementation.

55.     A Financial Management Unit (FMU) was established at NBE as the financial PMU
pendant to the technical PMU at EEAA. The FMU at NBE had overall responsibility for the
Project’s FM activities. The FMU was headed by a finance manager and supported by several
accountants seconded from NBE for the life of the Project. Overall, the FMU handled all record
keeping, financing, disbursements, planning, and reporting. Throughout Project implementation,
there have been no major issues to report on the financial management of the loan proceeds.

                                                  13
56.      Due to the programmatic nature of the Project, the PMU did not have any direct
responsibility for carrying out procurement, except for consultants’ services needed for in-house
TA. The main procurement function of the PMU was to ensure that procurement was carried out
by the beneficiary industries in a manner consistent with the requirements set forth in the Loan
Agreement. The procurement capacity acquired by the former PMU under EPAP I had, however,
been weakened by reassignment or turnover of staff and needed rebuilding. Due to the limited
availability of national procurement expertise, the Project supported a program of intensive
procurement training of selected staff from the Technical Support Section of the PMU, who in turn
were supported during the first year by an international procurement specialist (consultant) for a
total period of three months.

57.     During the early phases of implementation, a need arose to align the various loan
agreements between the donors. This included increasing the financing ceiling from US$ 12 million
to US$ 15 million, and raising the threshold for using ICB from US$ 5 million to US$ 8 million
given the broad interest from private sector industries looking to procure local supply and install
contracts. This required an amendment to the loan agreement, which was done shortly after Project
launch in 2007.

58.      At Project preparation, procurement was designed to be implemented by each participating
industry with all contracts subjected to the Bank’s prior review and no-objection using commercial
competitive practice (CCP), national competitive bidding (NCB), or ICB procurement methods.
However, during implementation differences arose over when to apply the different methods, with
the Bank requesting that more contracts be processed using NCB/ICB method rather than CCP.
However, the bulk of EPAP II sub-projects were submitted by private sector clients, and hence the
majority of contracts were using CCP. This led to long delays on approval of tender packages in
the early phase of implementation, with the result that several industries withdrew their
participation in EPAP II. The issue was resolved in 2009 when the Bank and the PMU clarified the
terms under CCP, and the Bank opened up for the application of CCP on a broader basis for private
sector industries.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

59.     The EEAA and NBE, as the anchors of the two-tier PMU, have built significant technical
capacity over the past ten years of implementing EPAP I and EPAP II. As such, they have the
necessary technical skills to replicate the EPAP model on a larger scale.

60.     During Project preparation, it was envisioned that financial sustainability could also have
been achieved during EPAP II by institutionalizing a carbon finance program. While this did not
materialize, it is notable that EEAA/NBE has secured additional financing for sustaining the EPAP
model until 2020.

61.     The EEAA/NBE has signed a new five-year loan for EUR 200 million in a third follow-on
operation (EPAP III), to which the Bank is not a party. With this, the EEAA has secured a financial
instrument for scaling-up the EPAP model, reaching more polluting industries, and further
developing their monitoring capacity. The pre-identified pipeline includes investment needs in
excess of EUR 300 million.

62.     As discussed during the ICR mission, there is a need for a new activity to address
environmental services, energy efficiency, and alternative fuel / fuel switching projects, which will
not be eligible for funding under EPAP III.

                                                 14
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

63.     Rating: High

64.      The Project is based on a proper diagnosis of development priorities, which remain highly
relevant today. Using a well-structured design and flexible implementation plan, the Project
objectives are as relevant today as they were at Project start. This is also evident from the strong
interest for an EPAP III project, which was recently signed, and which builds on the progress
achieved in EPAP I and II.

65.      The need to improve the environmental performance of heavy polluters and bring them
into compliance was a high priority for the GoE at the time of appraisal and still is today as is
evidenced by the EPAP-III. The Project came on the heels of EPAP I, which piloted the model of
using a market-based instrument to finance pollution abatement investments in an Egyptian context.
On this basis, the EPAP II project was prepared to scale-up the demonstration effect to achieve
significant environmental results while working with industries to improve their environmental
performance. This would prove the viability of the model and help change the “hearts and minds”
of both regulators and polluters to believe that better environmental enforcement and performance
was possible through close cooperation with the industries and assisting industries to implement
Best Available Techniques in pollution reduction rather than for government to focus solely on
monitoring whether emissions standards were reached or breached. This is benchmarking of Best
Available Techniques is a successful ingredient of the European Union’s industrial environmental
policy and their Best Available Techniques Reference Documents for key industrial sectors.

66.       In January 2011, Egypt erupted in large-scale anti-Government demonstrations, resulting
in the collapse of the regime that had been in power for 30 years. Although economic growth had
been strong in the previous six years and the Government had begun a process of economic
liberalization and privatization, citizens were frustrated by a lack of Government transparency and
disrespect for personal rights and dignity, and perceptions of corruption were widespread.
Following this, and given the political and economic uncertainties facing Egypt in the near term,
the Bank Group developed an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) as an indicative program of support over
an 18-month period, from June 2012 through December 2013. This program focused on the new
development priorities important to improve public economic management, job creation, and social
inclusion. While not directly targeted at the environment sector, such as the CAS preceding the ISN
did, it is important to note the potential for private sector growth and job creation arising from
opening up new export opportunities by complying with international environmental standards.
The Bank is currently engaged in a national consultation process to prepare the next Country
Partnership Framework.

67.      At an institutional level, though, the EEAA remains highly committed to the EPAP model
and to the design and implementation features introduced through the Project. Best practices on
procurement procedures and contract templates, improved safeguards requirements, and
standardized CAP forms and guidelines, are all elements which are being mainstreamed in other
EEAA donor-financed projects. The EPAP model will continue to expand and develop under the
third follow-on operation (EPAP-III), not financed by the World Bank and the model has also been
replicated in Lebanon.




                                                15
68.      In summary, the objectives, design and implementation of the EPAP II project have
remained highly relevant over time with only a few short-comings in the relevance of the original
design today. With much work remaining to be done in the areas of pollution abatement and
improving environmental compliance and performance, the EPAP model is being sustained through
committed and modernized industries who have made other environmental investments as part of
their agreed CAP not financed by EPAP-II, continued donor-financing and on-going capacity
building efforts to improve the technical capacity of EEAA, specifically in monitoring and
verification of industrial emissions and Best Available Techniques in the different industries to
abate those emissions.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

69.     Rating: Satisfactory

70.     The Project achieved the stated development objective of “demonstrating the applicability
of market-based financial and technical approaches to achieve pollution abatement in selected areas,
particularly in and around the Greater Cairo and Alexandria areas”. It did so by establishing the
Line of Credit Facility with the participating bank sector and TA support from EEAA which
allowed the industries in Greater Cairo and Alexandria to implement financial and technically
viable sub-projects in the field of pollution abatement to achieve significant pollution load
reductions. The demand and applicability for such a financing instrument has been clearly evident
in the demand generated through 130 applications from industries seeking sub-loans of US$493
million as well as the EPAP-III facility which the EEAA has been agreeing with EIB and other
donors to follow on the success of EPAP-II.

71.      In Cairo, 21 investment projects were approved for a total value US$109.5 million, or 63
percent of the portfolio. In Alexandria, 14 investment projects were approved for a total value of
US$65.5 million, or 37 percent of the portfolio. Most projects focused on reducing air pollution
through (a) upgrading dedusting systems by replacing filters with bag filters, (b) switching fuel
from mazout (heavy fuel oil) to natural gas by replacing or rehabilitating boilers, furnaces, and
kilns, (c) solvent recovery etc. Other projects focused on reducing wastewater pollution by
installing wastewater treatment plants. By sector, the manufacture of cement accounts for 39
percent of the portfolio, the fertilizer sector accounts for 17 percent, brickworks 11 percent,
petroleum ten percent, paper and print eight percent, food seven percent, and eight percent is spread
among the chemical, steel and other sectors. The overview of the achievement of the PDO
indicators is outlined below.

72.       PDO indicator 1- Pollution load expressed in terms of most significant pollutant generated
by beneficiary companies in selected hotspots decrease by at least 75%. Satisfactory. As indicated
above, the line of credit facility generated 130 sub-project applications totaling US$493.4 million
in sub-loan requests since the start of EPAP II in 2007. From this total of 130 submitted applications,
35 sub-projects have been funded with an investment value of US$320 million out of which EPAP-
II loans covered US$175 million. Industries declared that some of the investments, particularly the
ones which were financially attractive, would likely have been made by these industries but at a
later date and the project enhanced their decision to invest. At the same time, other similar industries
did not make these investments during the project period with their own financing. The financially
attractive sub-projects were primarily fuel switching, process modifications and solvent recovery.
EPAP II stopped funding fuel switching sub-projects around 2008, apart from the cluster projects,
as the financial benefits were clearly demonstrated (though there were substantial increases in
natural gas prices to energy intensive industries in recent years). The demonstrated results of the
Project also interested non-participating industries to investigate similar investments, for instance

                                                  16
in solvent recovery for companies involved in flexible printing. It will also make it easier for EEAA
to insist on similar pollution reduction investments in industries not participating in EPAP as the
early adaptor financial and technical assistance benefit has demonstrated that these investments can
ensure environmental compliance with the law.

73.     A total of 17 pollution abatement investments were completed by Closing Date of August
31, 2014 of which EPAP II loans financed US$85 million and WB financed US$10.65 million.
Another 6 sub-projects (US$10.5 million EPAP-II loan financing) have been commissioned and
are under monitoring out of which WB-finance covered US$1.6 million, and another 16 sub-
projects are still under implementation (US$79.6 million EPAP-II financing and WB-financing
covering US$7.7 million).

74.     In assessing the achievement of outcomes, Table 4 below shows the pollution load
reduction in tons per annum (tpa) for each pollutant, see for details Annex 2. It shows for air
pollutants that Total Suspended Particles (TSP) or Particulate Matter (PM) reduced 94 percent from
63,704 tpa to 3,914 tpa; SO2 emissions decreased 84 percent from 25,594 tpa to 4,066 tpa;
Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) emissions decreased from 15 tpa to 2 tpa, a reduction of 87 percent. For
wastewater reductions, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
pollution loads in wastewater discharges have both been decreased by 99 percent. The pollution
load reduction for Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) reached 82 percent. For the air pollutants, this is
a total average reduction of 91 percent. For Wastewater effluents, the total average reduction
amounts to 98 percent.

75.      For sub-projects installed and commissioned and under monitoring, table 5 shows that for
air pollution the pollution load reduction for Ethyl Acetate reduces from 3,110 tons per year to 16,
a reduction of 99 percent. For wastewater reductions the target pollutants, COD reduces from 172
tpa to 81, a reduction of 47 percent; BOD reduces from 114 tpa to 50, a reduction of 56 percent;
and HM reduces from 5.59 tpa until 0.23, a reduction of 95 percent. Average wastewater pollution
load reduction is 52 percent.

76.     Lastly, there are projects and emission reductions for sub-project under implementation.
Table 6 below presents the summary of emissions reductions for these sub-projects with air
pollution load reduction of 85 percent for TSP and 100 percent for CO and wastewater load
reduction of 100 percent for Phenol, Ammonia, Chlorine and TSS, and 75 percent for COD.

77.      Overall reduction in pollution load for the main pollutants generated by industry
facilities in the targeted hotspots exceeds 75 percent. For air emissions, the total reduction is
equal to 91 percent (from 98,498 tpa to 8,880 tpa), while for wastewater effluent the total reduction
is equal to 97 percent (from 19,276 tpa to 552 tpa). Monitoring and verification reports verified the
actual pollution load reductions achieved by the industrial abatement investments, see the
monitoring section for details.

78.     For some of the investments, particularly those environmental investments with additional
benefits for production modernization, some industries indicated that they probably would have
made these investments by themselves without EPAP-II support albeit delayed, while the
investments in end-of-pipe environmental abatement measures were not deemed to be realized
without the offered financial support. As indicated above, the Project stopped funding fuel
switching sub-projects around 2008, apart from the cluster projects, as the financial benefits were
clearly demonstrated. In all cases, the Projects provided substantial technical and procurement
support and facilitated, as indicated above, the introduction of best available techniques in pollution
abatement in the participating industries and had a wider demonstration effect to non-participating
industries.

79.      PDO indicator 2- Particulate matter reduction achieved under the project Satisfactory. As
part of the introduction of Core Sector Indicators (CSI) in the World Bank, the PDO indicator

                                                  18
particulate matter reduction was added with a target of 52,000 tons per year. For all the completed
sub-projects, the total suspended solids or particulate matter reduced amounted to 60,056 tpa, more
than achieving the established target.

80.     PDO indicator 3- Number of people with exposure to PM10 in the area of the project
Satisfactory. As part of the introduction of the CSI in the World Bank, this PDO indicator was
added with a target of 917,000 people. The target of 917,500 people (48 percent women) was set
to be equal to the population in the southern Cairo areas of Tabbin, Helwan, and Arab Abu Saad,
where the most significant pollution load reduction from EPAP II sub-projects was expected to
occur. Air pollution dispersion models were introduced in the PMU and EEAA to better assess the
cumulative impact of the EPAP-II air pollution abatement projects on the air quality in the Project
area. The maximum TSP/PM 24 hour concentration attributable to EPAP-II sub-projects before
implementation was 201 ug/m3 which reduced to 15 ug/m. after Project implementation.

81.     Data from air quality monitoring stations in Tabbin, Helwan and Arab Abu Saad show a
decrease in PM10 concentrations over the monitored period with decreasing PM10 concentrations
from 200 ug/m3 to 170 ug/m3; 235 ug/m3 to 128 ug/m3 and 215 ug/m3 to 177 ug/m3 respectively.

82.      PDO indicator 4: Volume (mass) of COD pollution load reduction achieved under the
project. Substantial. The last PDO indicator which was added referred to the reduction of Chemical
Oxygen Demand reduction with the target set at 2,100 tons per year reduction. For all the completed
sub-projects, the COD pollution load reduction which was achieved amounted to 2,938 tons per
year, more than achieving the target set.

83.      Intermediate Indicator 1: A computerized M&E benchmarking system is in place and
covers at least two areas of Alexandria and Qalubyia by end of year one of project. Satisfactory.
The Monitoring and Evaluation system for EPAP-II comprises of the following elements, presented
in the following table.

                                            Public disclosure and community complaints

84.      Source monitoring: Technical Agreements, signed with the sub-borrowers, include the
pollutants to be monitored and the frequency of reporting. Guidelines have also been developed on
how to do the monitoring and follow the monitoring protocols for cement, nitrogen fertilizer,
phosphoric fertilizer, and food and textile industries in all areas. In addition, online monitoring
exists for all cement plants with real time emission data.

85.     Compliance Action Plan monitoring was also required for every sub-borrower as all had
submitted a CAP that is approved by EEAA. The EEAA inspection departments and EPAP-II PMJ
followed up on the progress of implementation of approved CAPs. A total of 119 CAP actions had


                                                19
been targeted in the 27 companies borrowing for EPAP-II funds of which 75 percent was completed
by September 2014.

86.     Ambient monitoring and air dispersion modelling. Air pollution is monitored through
EEAA monitoring network and source attribution and air dispersion modelling is undertaken to
estimate the relative reduction in the ambient air quality concentrations due to the pollution
abatement projects near the monitoring locations.

87.     Web based Management Information System. A web based Management Information
System was developed to store, retrieve and share all project related technical and financial
information. This MIS consists of seven modules and contains information on project application
forms, case summaries, results of prioritization, loan amounts and status, procurement and
disbursement plans etc. The database management system is called EREMIS to store and retrieve
environmental and technical data for benchmarking and information management purposes.

88.    Intermediate indicator 2: Total amount of CO2 reduction from EPAP-II (metric ton).
Substantial. The revised total amount target of CO2 reduction from EPAP-II project was 550,000
tons CO2 which was more than achieved with 656,336 tons of CO2 reduced at Closing Date.

89.      In addition to the outcomes that were covered under the PDO and Intermediate indicators,
the Project achieved significant outcomes in: (i) being the first Project in the region to use country
systems in lieu of the Bank’s safeguards policies, thereby triggering OP/BP 4.00 on Use of
Borrower System to Address Environmental and Social Safeguards Issues in Bank-supported
Projects and hence strengthening the Country system on EIAs through improving EIA guidelines
and procedures; (ii) the use of the Compliance Action Plans for further enhancement of the
enforcement function which triggered more investment from private industries in pollution
abatement in addition to the sub-projects which were part of EPAP-II; (iii) the general
strengthening of the monitoring and compliance function of EEAA through the demonstration
effect that the pollution abatement investments and introduction of best available techniques in
participating industries meeting environmental compliance; and (iv) the advancement of the
industrial pollution management agenda in MNA region following the EPAP-II Project, such as the
EPAP-III project (not financed by the Bank) and the EPAP project in Lebanon.

3.3 Efficiency

90.     Rating: Satisfactory

91.     Based on the actual and expected pollution load reduction to be achieved once all EPAP II
sub-projects have been commissioned and the results verified, the ICR team calculated the unit cost
for each pollutant abated (Table 8). Unit cost of pollution abatement (UCPA) is the ratio between
the capital investment incurred and the amount of pollutant removed and is expressed in terms of
US$ of the pollutant. A summary of unit costs of pollution abatement for each sub-project is given
in Annex 2.

92.      Benchmarked against the Unit Costs of Pollution Abatement (UCPA) estimates generated
at the time of project preparation and used as eligibility criteria for EPAP II funding, Table 8 shows
that UCPA for air emissions SO2 and TSP are lower than the 75th percentile of the PAD benchmark,
whereas wastewater effluent BOD, COD and TSS discharges were so low that they were even much
less than the 25th percentile of original benchmarks.

93.      These costs are also deemed to be efficient when comparing with a number of other
international benchmarks available, such as: (i) unit costs calculation for SO2 emission reduction
in China ranging from US$ 1.0 to 10.8 per ton of SO2 reduction1; and (ii) unit costs calculations for
SO2 emission reduction in cement plants in the European Union ranging from 0.57 – 1.14 EURO/kg
of SOx abated2. And the costs are lower than the benchmarks established in the Project Appraisal
Document to represent indicative unit benefits through calculation of estimates of units of external
costs of pollution and hence the benefit (shadow price) of avoiding those external costs through
pollution abatement.

94.     The Borrower undertook a cost-benefit analysis to assess the economic viability of each
sub-project. The analyses cover capital and operating costs/benefits reflecting changes in the
throughput or productivity and changes in the water, energy, fuel and chemical consumption before
and after the sub-project implementation. Costs for site preparation, installation of utilities and
labor are also factored in. Software was developed to facilitate calculations that provided net
savings, net present value, internal rate of return, and payback period for each sub-project. A
detailed summary of the results is provided in Annex 3.

95.       From the analysis it can be noted that end-of-pipe treatment for air emission controls, such
as filters and bags, have largely no financial benefit despite some improvements in energy savings

and production. Companies view these types of sub-projects as straight compliance expenditure.
However, fuel switching and alternative fuel projects have proved financially attractive with high
internal rates of return (IRR). Wastewater treatment sub-projects showed mostly negative IRRs
despite the fact that in some projects there was recycling of treated waste water and product
recovery. In contrast, process modifications leading to improvements in wastewater showed IRRs
of 2-14 percent.

96.     Given that the investments were granted to improve environmental performance and
demonstration effect, and not on the basis of their economic attractiveness, these IRR and NPV for
individual sub-projects will not be considered in the rating of Project effectiveness.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

97.     Rating: Satisfactory

98.     Given that the Project indicators were formally revised, the ICR team undertook a split
evaluation of the achievement of Project outputs and outcomes against original and revised targets,
weighted by the actual disbursement rate before and after the second restructuring in June 2013
(see Annex 2 for a full methodology and analysis). The team found that the overall achievements
were moderately satisfactory against original targets and satisfactory against revised targets.

99.     Under the circumstances with a number of external obstacles affecting the Project,
including the global financial crisis and the onset of political instability in January 2011, it is quite
remarkable that the Project managed to disburse 100 percent and to achieve significant pollution
abatement in Egyptian industries. Perhaps most importantly, the Project changed the “minds and
hearts” of both regulators and polluters to come to a common understanding of the benefits derived
from working together towards compliance using a market-based instrument complimented with
high-quality technical assistance and the introduction of best available techniques in pollution
abatement in participating industries in Egypt.

100.    In arriving at an overall outcome rating of satisfactory, it is noted that: a) the Project
enjoyed a high degree of relevance of objectives and implementation with minor short-comings in
the design; b) the achievement of Project development outputs and outcomes was satisfactory
against original and revised targets; c) the outputs and outcomes were wider than the PDO
indicators defined under the project; and d) the unit cost of abatement for each pollutant is within
the appraisal stage benchmarks, and is therefore considered efficient.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

101.     In the literature, it is well documented that pollution abatement has significant economic,
social and environmental impacts. Pollution is an important factor in the degradation of ecosystems.
In 1999, the valuation of the cost of environmental degradation to the Egyptian national GDP was
estimated to be app. 4.8 percent. At the community level, the health impacts of reducing dangerous
pollutants from the air and wastewater are well established. The largest impacts are felt by
employees and nearby resident, who are less exposed to the pollutants on a daily basis with the
potential to improve local health and education outcomes. While these impact measures may not
form part of the Project objectives or indicators, the benefits manifest themselves over time and
have the potential to reduce poverty and engender development.


                                                   22
102.    As part of EPAP II, five sub-projects were financed to improve the work place environment.
This involved upgrading calciners to remove dust in the workspace, installing new ventilation
systems, upgrading filters in the packing and clinker transport lines, and installing zero leakage
oven doors. These changes are likely to have significant positive impacts at the local plant level.
However, without targeted social indicators or an impact assessment, it is not possible to assess the
actual impact of the Project at this level.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

103.     The EPAP II project affected institutional change and strengthening beyond the objectives
set at the Project preparation stage.

104.     A key impact of the EPAP II Project has been the change in the “hearts and minds” of those
in charge of implementing environmental regulations. Prior to EPAP I and II, there was general
skepticism that a cooperative approach with the heavy polluters would work. The prevailing culture
of environmental regulation in the EEAA was one of punishment; the idea that issuing fines for
non-compliance would bring about change. However, the approach had proved inefficient with
industries continuing to pollute unabated. With EPAP came an understanding that by working with
the industries and making available the financial and technical means to improve environmental
performance, better results could be achieved. This approach has made inroads in both EEAA, the
Ministry of Environment in general, and even beyond. The technical and financial arrangements
piloted in EPAP I and demonstrated in EPAP II are now used in many other donor-financed projects,
including similar procurement procedures and contract templates. This benchmarking approach is
also the basis of the EU industrial environmental policy which uses Best Available Techniques
Reference Documents for each sector to indicate which technologies and techniques industries in
different sectors should use to be in compliance with environmental legislation.

105.    EPAP II provided support to the Executive Regulations for Law 9.2009. In 2009, Law 9
on the environment was issued to amend parts of Law 4/1994. Some important changes include to
the law included new requirements for qualitative loads, increasing penalties, and revised
compensation schedules for environmental damages. As a result of Law 9, EEAA has prepared new
Executive Regulations and emission standards. Support was provided by EPAP II to the air
pollution committee to assist in the revision of air emission standards.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

106.    As part of the fuel switching sub-project in Arab Abu Saad, EPAP II helped formalize a
sector previously operating without licenses. The Arab Abu Saad area is situated approximately 40
km south of Cairo, where the largest cluster of brickworks in Egypt is located. The bricks
manufacturing process utilizes open furnaces where fuel is combusted and exhaust gases are drafted
using tall stacks (60-80 m). The Project converted 176 kilns to operate on natural gas.

107.     Obtaining financing for the sub-project was a challenge. The creditworthiness check was a
barrier for most of the brickworks owners, due to the lack of official ownership documentation for
the majority of brickworks, where such documents are normally utilized in taking loans. In order
to overcome these barriers, EPAP II assisted in obtaining ownership licenses for all brickworks in
the Arab Abu Saad cluster. Meanwhile, with a bit of financial engineering, it was agreed that
deposits could be employed to establish individual sub-loans between each of the involved
brickworks and the NBE; allowing the project to move forward while the formalization process
was on-going.


                                                23
108.    The project reduced air emissions from kilns stacks due to the phase-out of mazout, thereby
improving ambient air quality and protecting the health of workers and the surrounding neighbors’.
Further positive unintended outcomes are mentioned under section 3.6 below.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

109.    An ICR mission for the Second Pollution Abatement Project (EPAP II) took place in Cairo,
Egypt from December 14-18, 2014. The mission met with all relevant partners to the Project,
including the Minister of Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, the project
management unit with EEAA, Project co-financiers, participating financial institutions, and
industry beneficiaries. The full list of contacts met during the mission is included in Annex 6. The
information derived during the mission is largely incorporated into the ICR. Below is a brief
summary of the lessons learned from meeting with four industrial beneficiaries to hear of their
experience with the EPAP II project:

       Significant productivity gains: In three out of four industries, the investments financed
        with EPAP II funds led to significant productivity gains alongside environmental
        compliance. Improved process modifications led to greater raw material recovery and less
        production loss through leakage control, thereby increasing the yield per unit. It also led to
        reduced waste and costs and saved on utility through efficiency gains.

       EPAP II financing advanced the decision to invest: In those industries standing to reap
        significant productivity gains, the decision to invest in process modifications was advanced
        by the availability of EPAP II financing. Given the sharp competition and the demands
        from shareholders, the industries are expected to have eventually self-financed the
        investments given the high rate of return on the investment and positive net-present-value.

       The value-added of EPAP II financing was the technical assistance: The industries
        expressed their overall satisfaction with the technical assistance provided, particularly in
        the procurement process and determination of specifications. While sometimes
        cumbersome, the carefully planned tendering process allowed for the introduction of new
        and best available technologies in addition to offering improved protection for the
        industries during the 12 months commissioning process. The close assistance provided on
        procurement, contracting, and monitoring improved the overall implementation process.
        Several industries are applying similar guidelines to other large, non-EPAP projects.

       Online monitoring system is a win-win for both EEAA and the industries: Installation
        of required online stack emissions monitoring systems has allowed for better quality
        control of the production facilities, as the emissions reveal information about the general
        condition and daily maintenance of the facility. The technical assistance on monitoring
        system was mentioned as a value-added of the EPAP II model.

       Interest in obtaining further financing under EPAP III: All industries expressed great
        satisfaction with the EPAP II model and with the close cooperation with EEAA. Given the
        chance, the industries expressed interest in obtaining future financing under EPAP III.

       Learned about EPAP II financing through on-going communication with EEAA: The
        industries expressed that the most effective means of marketing of the EPAP II instrument
        was through close dialogue with EEAA. This confirms the need for strong enforcement as
        an incentive for industries to take action towards environmental compliance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

110.    Rating: Moderate

111.     In assessing the risks to development outcomes, it is important to keep in mind that the
overall objective of EPAP II is to demonstrate the applicability of a market-based instrument to
achieve significant pollution abatement. As such, the ICR team assesses the risks on two
dimensions: First, the risks to the EPAP model being sustained institutionally, and second, the risks
to the sustainability of achieved pollution abatement.

112.     On the first dimension, there can be little doubt that the EPAP model has proved its
applicability as a financial and technical instrument to promote voluntary compliance action by
heavy polluting industries in an Egyptian context. Going into its third phase, the model delivers
results for all participating parties: First, for the beneficiary industries, whose compliance actions
and potential productivity gains and cost savings have good business value; second, for the
participating banks, whose portfolio and client base are growing; third, for the Apex bank, who
gains from placing the funds in money markets while taking on much of the credit and currency
risks; and fourth, the EEAA, who is building their technical and monitoring capacity while reaching
more polluters. With such a positive closed loop, there are good reasons to believe that the model
will survive.

113.    The institutional risk lies primarily in obtaining continued funding for the model. Currently
dependent on donor-financing, there is still a need for designing and establishing a sustainable
financial architecture, which will provide a revenue stream for future pollution abatement activities.

114.     On the second dimension, the sustainability of the environmental gains is assessed. During
the ICR mission, a number of risk factors were identified, which could jeopardize the sustainability
of the results achieved under some EPAP II sub-projects:

            a. The rising price of natural gas: In 2014, the price of natural gas doubled. For the
               200 brickwork manufacturers in Arab Abu Saad, who operate dual-use burners,
               the price of natural gas was too high to bear and many have substituted with
               mazout. For the cement plants with large energy needs, the price for natural gas
               became prohibitive and would have incurred huge costs on the industry. Hence,
               they have also switched back to using mazout in some months of the year. While
               Egypt has large proven reserves with a five-year plan to extract enough to cover
               demand, there is a restriction on the allocation of natural gas to the industrial sector,
               which is not expected to be lifted in the near future.

            b. The planned introduction of coal-fired power plants: The GoE has announced
               its intent to cut reliance on natural gas and fuel oil for power generation from 90
               percent to 62 percent by 2020. To this end, the GoE is planning the introduction of
               numerous coal-fired power plants. In April, the Government approved the
               industrial use of coal to reduce the reliance on gas, and the country's major cement
               producers have begun retrofitting their plants to run on imported coal and seeking
               import permits.

            c. High maintenance costs: Particularly for investments focused on controlling
               pollution sources rather than eliminating them, the general lack of a “maintenance
               culture” coupled with the high maintenance needs and costs, e.g. for replacement


                                                  25
                of bag filters, could pose a long-term risk to the sustainability of achieved
                emissions reductions. Addressing this issue requires a long-term, multi-faceted
                strategy. In the industries, introducing a maintenance culture involves human
                resources (HR) aspects along with in-depth training requirements. In EEAA,
                continuous monitoring and enforcement of non-compliance is essential for
                promoting compliance action.

115.     Overall, it is the assessment of the ICR team that while the sources of pollution and the
challenges to abatement may change over time, the EPAP model has demonstrated it applicability
and enjoys a high level of commitment from all participating institutions, banks, and industries. It
is also worth noting that this model has worked well and for many years in many other countries.
The need to secure continuous funding coupled with the uncertain political landscape and complex
economic challenges facing Egypt in the foreseeable future, the rating of the risk to development
outcomes is moderate; though the demonstration effect of the pollution abatement potential in
participating industries will make it easier for EEAA to insist on similar investments to achieve
environmental compliance from industries not participating in EPAP.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

116.    Rating: Moderately satisfactory

117.    At the Project preparation stage, the Bank team employed due diligence in basing the
Project on a solid diagnostic foundation, taking into account the lessons learned from EPAP II. As
a follow-on operation to EPAP I, the Project enjoyed high-level commitment and local ownership.
While the Project itself was complex given the many stakeholders, the implementation plan was
well-structured. Project readiness was in an advanced stage with a large pre-identified pipeline of
potential investment sub-projects ready for implementation. Provisions for procurement, financial
management, and safeguards were all adequate at the design stage. As the first project in MENA
region to use country systems in lieu of the Bank safeguard policies, close attention was paid to the
Equivalence and Acceptability Assessment and the required gap-filling measures.

118.    However, short-comings at the preparation stage relate to the design of the carbon finance
sub-program, which was envisioned to provide a sustainable financial architecture for future
pollution abatement investments. At the time of appraisal, carbon finance presented a new
opportunity and quickly became “a la mode”. It is understandable that the Bank team was trying to
tap into this framework; although in hindsight, it proved more challenging to implement than
perhaps expected. While the design of the program itself seems appropriate, the Bank team did not
adequately assess the risks to completing this component and achieving its associated outcome
indicators. The Carbon Finance Project was delinked from EPAP II, and a separate ICR submitted.
While, the carbon finance sub-program outcomes is not rated as part of the present ICR for the
EPAP II project, the assessment is taken into consideration for the rating of Bank Performance in
ensuring Quality at Entry leading to an overall rating of moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

119.    Rating: Satisfactory


                                                 26
120.     The Bank project team undertook 14 implementation support missions in 8 years, or 1.75
missions per year: a rate slightly below the planned two implementation support missions per year,
which is partly explained by the tense security situation in the first half of 2011. However, given
the fairly smooth implementation phase, this appears adequate. One aspect of Bank implementation
support that is perhaps easily overlooked is the fact that the Bank team led implementation support
of the entire Project on behalf of all co-financiers. This seems natural given that the Project was
essentially designed by the Bank in collaboration with the Borrower, and built on EPAP I, which
was entirely financed by the Bank.

121.     The overall quality of Bank supervision was satisfactory, dealing effectively with the
challenges that arose regarding the introduction of coercive lending terms in the wake of the global
financial crisis, and the delayed action on the part of the PMU to complete all gap-filling measures
identified in the EAA safeguards report. The Bank team remained highly committed and focused
on achieving planned development outcomes in spite of the extraordinary external challenges posed
to the Project. While an earlier revision of key outcome indicators would have served the Project
well, especially given that the carbon finance sub-program was agreed with the PMU to be
cancelled already during the mid-term review in 2009, the candor and quality of performance
reporting throughout implementation was high. It is noticeable that progress towards PDO was
ranked moderately satisfactory in ISR 6 to 14, only to be upgraded to satisfactory in the last ISR
(15) on the grounds of full disbursement of the loan.

122.    However, one short-coming in Bank supervision worth noting was the delayed no-
objection reviews to procurement documents in the early phases of implementation. Disagreement
over the application of various procurement methods meant that several industries withdrew their
EPAP II applications and went on to finance the sub-projects otherwise. As the majority of
participants in EPAP II were private sector companies, the need for applying the CCP method was
much higher than what the Bank was used to. Adapting to working with private sector entities took
a while, but eventually the Bank and the PMU worked out acceptable arrangements and
implementation picked up again.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

123.    Rating: Moderately satisfactory

124.    The overall rating for Bank performance is moderately satisfactory. The Bank project team
demonstrated a high level of commitment and supported the PMUs in a timely manner with
overcoming implementation challenges. The continuing of the EPAP model in a third-phase is a
testament to the success of the Project. The Bank’s performance during Project preparation was
moderately satisfactory, while the Bank’s performance during Project supervision was satisfactory,
leading to an overall rating of moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

125.    Rating: Satisfactory

126.    GoE has performed satisfactorily, showing a high level of commitment to the Project with
timely ratification. The GoE has supported the Project throughout partly by appointing key staff
members and critical resources to the PMU, and partly by enabling a supportive sector environment
through the adoption of new legislation and regulation, such as Law 9.2009 and the Executive

                                                27
Regulations for Law 9.2009. Throughout implementation, the GoE has retained good relations with
all co-financiers and is building on this collaboration in signing a new EPAP III loan.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

127.    Rating: Satisfactory

128.     The PMU at EEAA performed satisfactorily. The high level of ownership, the growing
technical capacity of staff members, the dedication and professionalism of the team are all key
factors in explaining the success, and survival, of the Project in a sometimes challenging operating
environment. The two-tier PMU structure supported the implementation period well. Throughout
Project implementation the PMU at EEAA delivered technical support to participating industries.
From the initial application for funding through to the final verification of results, the industries
had access to technical support for developing compliance action plans, feasibility studies,
procurement documents, monitoring systems, etc. This technical arm of the PMU helped optimize
the investment outcomes by ensuring the soundness of the approach and introducing the latest and
most appropriate and best technologies available. Meanwhile, "outsourcing" the financial
management aspects to an Apex bank helped increase transparency and accountability for
management of Project funds.

129.     The main implementation challenge for the PMU at EEAA relates to the delayed
completion of gap-filling measures as identified in the EAA for using country systems in lieu of
Bank safeguard policies. While certain aspects of the delay may have been beyond the control of
the PMU, the responsibility for aligning the country systems with the Bank requirements still fell
on the PMU. During the ICR mission, industries and co-financiers alike expressed their utmost
satisfaction working with the PMU, which is also echoed by the Bank project team. Within EEAA,
the PMU has become a model for effective project management.

130.     The PMU at NBE performed satisfactorily. A highly qualified financial management team
has handled all aspects of their fiduciary responsibilities with careful attention and professionalism.
Throughout implementation there has been no critical mention of outstanding FMRs or audit
reports. The main implementation challenge for the PMU at NBE relates to the introduction of
coercive lending terms in the wake of the global financial crisis. The resolution of the issue required
intensive negotiations, but was eventually resolved to the benefit of other participating banks and
industrial beneficiaries. The PMU at NBE has built significant capacity for handling pollution
abatement investments, and developed a close collaboration with EEAA, which will continue under
EPAP III.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

131.    Rating: Satisfactory

132.    The overall rating for Borrower performance is satisfactory. Despite a challenging
implementation environment with a number of external factors affecting the Project, it is
noteworthy that the loan was fully disbursed and the Project achieved the PDO. This is attributable
to two dedicated and competent PMUs supported by a committed GoE and by a responsive Bank
team.




                                                  28
6. Lessons Learned

133.     As the Bank becomes increasingly involved with private sector entities, there is a need
to improve the capacity of the Bank to handle common commercial procurement practices.
At Project preparation, procurement was designed to be implemented by each participating industry
with all contracts subjected to the Bank’s prior review and no-objection using CCP, NCB, or ICB
procurement methods. However, during implementation differences arose over when to apply the
different methods, with the Bank requesting that more contracts be processed using NCB/ICB
method rather than CCP. However, the bulk of EPAP II sub-projects were submitted by private
sector clients, and hence the majority of contracts were using CCP. This led to long delays on
approval of tender packages in the early phase of implementation, with the result that several
industries withdrew their participation in EPAP II. The issue was resolved in 2009 when the Bank
and the PMU clarified the terms under CCP, and the Bank opened up for the application of CCP
on a broader basis for private sector industries. More flexibility from the side of the Bank is required
in applying suitable terms and a streamlined process in CCP, as time is of essence, particularly for
private sector clients and the foreseen growing business in Public-Private Partnerships.

134.     The value added of issuing loans in local currency should be considered at the
preparation stage. The original Project design emphasized that sub-project financing be passed
on in foreign currency. The reason was that many supply and installation contracts were expected
to be procured internationally. However, the demand for local suppliers was much higher than
anticipated, with only two ICB contracts actually carried out. The focus then on issuing loans in
foreign currency became a limitation for the participation of many clients, who either did not have
access to foreign currency (Egypt does not have a corporate credit bureau), or who could not bear
the foreign exchange risk. The issue was resolved after revisiting the financial modelling analysis
underlying the Project. Following, the Bank and co-financiers allowed NBE and participating banks
to issue loans in local currency to the benefit of both industries, many of whom may not otherwise
have benefitted from EPAP II, and banks, who were able to overcome the foreign currency shortage
following the revolution and expand their client base. In any similar type of intervention, it would
be critical to consider already at the preparation stage the value added of allowing sub-project loans
to be issued in local currency as well.

135.    Use of concessional finance has proved effective in triggering private investments in
pollution abatement and the approach should be scaled-up and replicated in other countries.
EPAP II private industrial financing accounted for 55 percent of total investment costs, far beyond
the required 10 percent in co-financing. In addition, industries financed a number of other agreed
CAP actions on their own. As such, EPAP I and II has ignited and advanced support for the brown
agenda in Egypt and raised awareness of the need to protect the environment. At the heart of the
success of the EPAP model lies the notion that support for early adopters is predicated on a
demonstration effect: It injects the industries with the best available technology and it allows the
regulating authority to benchmark environmental performance and best available techniques in
support of their enforcement role and insisting that other non-participating industries also invest in
pollution abatement as it has been demonstrated that these investments will allow compliance with
environmental law. The EPAP model is now being replicated in Lebanon, and is entering its third
phase in Egypt. It has the potential to be further scaled-up and advance the industrial pollution
management agenda more broadly and in other countries as well.

136.    IRR evaluation for pollution abatement investments could be used in the future to
develop a differential scheme. This would imply that more grant funds are given to sectors with
high pollution abatement costs and less grant funds are given to projects where the financial benefits
are significant. This lesson from EPAP II was already applied mid-way when gas conversion was

                                                  29
not financed anymore and is already being applied in the third phase, where projects with a payback
period under two years will not be eligible for a grant. The value-added for those projects will be
the technical assistance provided by EEAA. Similarly, projects with high financial returns (i.e. high
productivity gains) will be eligible for a 10 grant element, whereas project with negative financial
returns (i.e. strictly compliance costs) will be eligible for a 20 percent grant element.

137.     Installation of continuous monitoring systems should form an integral part of grant
funded sub-projects. Typically, the basis for assessing the pollution load and cost of abatement
depends on the quality of analytical data provided by each company, which can be difficult to
assess. The use of continuous online stack monitoring, as was the case in the cement sector, proved
very effective in determining the reliability of the data. While this type of system is more easily
installed for monitoring air emissions, it is equally important for monitoring wastewater discharges.
The EPAP II funding requirement for companies to acquire monitoring systems was essential to
collecting and verifying the pollution load reduction, which fulfilled both the premise of the built-
in grant element and the objective of the project.

138.     Carbon finance-linked projects require careful preparation with contractual
commitments upfront. At the time of project preparation, carbon finance represented a “golden
opportunity”. It was envisioned to bring about a steady stream of revenue to secure additional
financing, which offered hope for establishing financial sustainability in development projects.
However, the lesson from EPAP II is that careful planning, emission estimated verification and
early commitment is important. The market developed at a very different pace than the project, and
without signed contracts and funds committed prior to project approval the framework proved
inadequate. While the price of carbon has dropped, another mechanism may be introduced at some
point, and the lesson to secure firm commitments upfront will be equally important.

1 The appraisal estimate by financing source differs from the appraisal estimate by component. Both numbers were
obtained from the PAD, where the discrepancy originates.
2 Source: Borrower ICR, Annex 3 FMR Report September 2014. The account for each co-financier is held in local
currency, i.e. Euro for EIB and AFD, and Yen for JBIC. Hence, the actual, latest estimate in US$ equivalent is
calculated by the ICR team using the exchange rate on August 3, 2014, which is the date of the FMR report. Total
financing in table (a) and (b) differ due to the exchange rate at the time of the FMR and the exchange rate expected at
the time of project completion when all donor funds have been disbursed.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Line of Credit Facility

139.     This section provides a description of the output achieve under component 1 of the Project
to establish the line of credit managed by the National Bank of Egypt with the focus on financing
pollution abatement investments in participating industries.

140.    The Credit Facility was managed by the National Bank of Egypt with the participating
banks and provided loans with five to eight years repayment period, a one to two years grace period,
a 10 percent minimal fund injection by the company, a Libor / Euribor +2 percent interest rate for
foreign loans and 13 percent for loans in Egyptian Pounds; and a 20 percent grant on the loan
subject to meeting agreed environmental targets. Participating Banks were the National Bank of
Egypt themselves and in addition the Industrial Development Bank of Egypt, Egyptian Saudi
Finance Bank, Qatar National Bank and the Commercial International Bank.

141.     Borrowers were responsible to: 1) prepare environmental assessments of the sub-projects;
2) submit compliance action plans for the entire facility for EEAA approval; 3) prepare technical
feasibility studies; 4) undertake the procurement following EPAP requirements (WB procurement
guidelines); 4) enter into a EEAA Technical Agreement on environmental objectives, monitoring
and implementation.

142.    The facility was funded through the World Bank Loan of US$20 million, the European
Investment Bank (EURO40 million), Agence Française du Développement (EURO40 million) and
the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (4.72bln JPY). EPAP II invested in pollution
abatement sub-projects that followed the following criteria:

    1. The proposed sub-project is located in Greater Cairo & Alexandria areas.
    2. The enterprise is creditworthy with respect to the proposed sub-project.
    3. The sub-project will achieve a reduction of at least 50 percent in the total load of at least
       one target pollutant of priority to that enterprise,
    4. The enterprise negotiates and implements a Compliance Action Plan (CAP) with EEAA
       that will achieve broad compliance with legal environmental requirements within a period
       of time agreed between EEAA and the enterprise.
    5. The size of the loan investment to implement the sub-project is not less than US$ 100,000
       and not more than US$15 million or equivalent;
    6. The sub-project should be technically and economically feasible.

143.     EPAP II did not support maintenance or repair projects, or projects with the main purpose
to increase production capacity.

Table 9 below provides an overview of the total pollution abatement investments and the parts of
which were financed by EPAP-II. It also shows the pollution load reduction achieved and Unit
Costs of Pollution Abatement (UCPA) in US$ per kilogram of pollutant reduced. Further below,
Table 10 provide the details of the pollution abatement investments that were fully completed and
for which the full verification and compliance monitoring has been executed after one year of
emission monitoring after commissioning of the investment. Table 11 provides a lists of sub-
project commission for which the one year emission monitoring is ongoing. Finally,

144.    Table 12 shows a list of sub-projects currently under implementation and the expected
pollution load reduction. These tables also include pollution reductions of the non-key target
pollutions that were reduced as an additional benefit of the pollution abatement investments.

Component 2 Technical Assistance

145.     The Technical Assistance (TA) component aimed at strengthening the capacity of EEAA, the
industries and participating bank sector, and general project management support. It was financed through
the foreseen Finnish Trust Fund, EIB and National Bank of Egypt and EEAA. Many tools were developed
to aid the PMU in the EEAA in the marketing of the facility to the industry, ensuring receipts of properly
prepared application form, screening, prioritization, and evaluation of the received applications.

146.     The following TA activities were implemented:

    1.   Announcement, information and marketing of the program
    2.   Receipt of application form
    3.   Preparation of guidelines, screening and evaluation tools
    4.   Prioritization
    5.   Appraisal
    6.   Case summary
    7.   Technical Agreement
    8.   Monitoring and reporting

147.     The EPAP II dedicated website was developed and launched in January 2009. Information
concerning EPAP II and public disclosure of EIAs has been placed on the EEAA website
(http://www.eeaa.gov.eg/english/info/report_EPAP2.asp) together with templates and information
brochures, case studies and success stories. Twenty two marketing workshops were held with around 2,058
industry personnel attending. Workshops have been undertaken directly or in coordination with other
industrial pollution programs. In addition one workshop has been held for media to increase their awareness
of EPAP II.

148.    To ensure only quality environmental sub-projects are supported by EPAP II, guidelines were
developed to improve the quality of technical documentation submitted and a range of screening and
evaluation tools were introduced for the PMU to appraise sub-projects. Evaluation and screening of the
applications followed the steps as outlined in Figure 2 below.

149.    A screening checklist was developed to ensure that the eligibility criteria for EPAP-II were met
which was used to evaluate the application forms received from the interested industries. Projects should
fall under the one of the following areas:
     1. End-of-pipe treatment for air emissions and wastewater;
     2. In-process modifications and cleaner technologies;
     3. Work environment;
     4. Energy conservation and conversion to cleaner fuels;
     5. Hazardous waste management;
     6. Environmental Services (this was removed during Project implementation as the investment should
        be for industry to bring it into compliance and not for service industry).


150.    The following other criteria were used in the screening checklist:
       Is there a certificate of credit-worthiness provided by the designated Bank to the Factory?
       Is the factory located in the designated hot spot area?
       Is the estimated cost of the sub-project less than US$ 100,000?
       Is the estimated cost of the sub-project more than US$ 15 million?
       Is the sub-project leading to reduction of target pollutant by 50 percent on load basis for the sub-
        project?
       Will the factory achieve compliance after the implementation of the sub-project? Is there a realistic
        compliance action plan prepared and submitted to this effect?
       Is there an adequate management of residues, especially if these are released due to the proposed
        sub-project?

151.      After projects met the screening checklist, a prioritization exercise was done by PMU in EEAA
to: (i) focus on quality sub-projects and accordingly guide assessment / audit studies; (ii) optimize sub-
project preparation efforts; and (iii) enable informed decisions. The prioritization was based on the
following criteria: a) The unit costs of the abatement (tons of pollutants removed divided by sub-project
cost), which used the coefficients provided in the PAD as a guide; b) Estimated benefits of the pollution
reduction, which was more of a qualitative assessment. The neighborhood for air pollutants was considered
as 5 km radius around the industry. For water pollutants, the best designated use of the receiving water body
was considered; c) Productivity related which resulted due to change/substitution of equipment and/or
process. Phase out, substitution or improvement of existing situation was permissible, but not the
installation of a new line of production; d) Improvement towards sector benchmark due to the
implementation of the sub-project. Sector benchmarks as developed by the IFC were used; e) Innovative
projects were preferred due to the demonstration and multiplier effect; f) The financial contribution of the
industry itself; g) Presence of Management Systems like ISO 9000/14001 and OHSAH 18000; h)
Greenhouse Gas reduction potential and the possible admissibility of the project under the Clean
Development Mechanism.

152.      A scheme of weights and ratings as developed, where the weights for the criteria show its relative
importance. The ratings are for performance of the project for that criteria which then was calculated as the
total scores computed as the weight times the rating and summed over all criteria. Three classes of priorities
were developed based on total weighted scores - high, medium and low and computations of weighted score
was done a MS Excel based application. Of the 35 projects which were funded, 34 were ranked with high
priority.

153.    A Review and Reference Manual was developed to streamline the review process and explain the
various computation and review procedures with compilation of standards and references datasets and

                                                     42
conversion coefficients to ensure a consistent approach and to calculate a proper Unit Costs of Pollution
Abatement.

154.    Also, Guidelines for preparing Environmental Audits and Compliance Action Plans were
issued in the first year of implementation as the industries would take the leading role in the preparation of
these documents. The Guidelines were updated in 2009 and are now structured in three parts: Part 1
Compliance Audit (factory information, production, process description, emissions and compliance); Part
2 Sub-Project Assessment (project details, capital and operating costs, compliance and pollution impacts,
cost benefits); Part 3: Compliance Action Plan (non-compliance issues, costed time-bound actions, impacts
of each actions).

155.    After prioritization, the PMU prepared a Case Summary of the sub-project, which included
computation of the pollution loads before and after the investment, the unit costs of the pollution abatement
investment, comparison with other sector benchmarks and costs-benefit analysis. The Case Summary uses
the information from the Application Form with additional information from Environmental Audits,
Compliance Action Plan and Environmental Impact Assessment as well as site visits to the industry. The
Appraisal of the Case Summary by the Steering Committee allowed to decide on which projects would be
funded under EPAP-II.

156.     Support was provided by the PMU to the industries/sub-borrowers on the following issues: (i)
technical advice on the proposed investment including assessment of pollution load reduction and impacts;
(ii) preparation of environmental audits; (iii) preparation of compliance action plans, (iv) review of the
submitted technical information; (v) training on the preparation of the required technical documents. This
support was instrumental to ensure that the technical documentation was of sufficient quality and that the
Technical Agreement could be signed.

157.     In addition, Procurement Advice was provided to the PMU and the industries and PMU advised
all participating industries on procurement procedures, preparation and review of bidding documents,
guidance through the bid process, bid evaluation and contracting issues. 104 contracts were awarded until
September 2014, out of which 60 contracts under Competent Commercial Practice. (CCP). Procurement
templates made available by the PMU were used by industries.

158.     Monitoring requirements were the following: (i) Target pollutants, concentrations and load
reduction were set out in Technical Agreement; (ii) Self-monitoring was obligated for the industries plus
external laboratory each quarter. Results were reported quarterly to EEAA; (iii) Verification was executed
through spot verification by EEAA upon completion, online and continuous stack monitoring in the cement
industry (being developed for the fertilizer and steel sectors) as emission monitoring systems were installed
as part of the sub-project process control; (iv) for alternative fuels, monitoring was based on minimum
alternative fuel use in year one plus full compliance of emissions.

159.    An example of such online continuous emission stack monitoring in the cement industry is in the
figure below.

Split Evaluation of Achievement of Project Outputs and Outcomes

160.    A split evaluation of the Project output and outcomes against both original and revised objectives
is presented below in Table 14, as recommended for projects with formally revised indicators. To assist in
arriving at an overall outcome rating for the Project, separate outcome ratings (against original and revised
project objectives) were weighted in proportion to the share of actual credit disbursements made in the
periods before and after approval of the revision (June 24, 2013). As stipulated in the ICR Guidelines, each
objective was given equal importance in the overall weighting regardless of the cost of the component to
which it relates.

161.    Actual credit disbursements reached US$20 million by Project closing date, implying that the
achievements before the second restructuring will be weighted 60 percent (12.05 million / 20 million * 100)
and achievements after the restructuring will be weighted 40 percent (7.95 million / 20 million * 100).

162.     The original and revised results framework was used as the basis for including appropriate
indicators in the evaluation, but the ICR team made certain modifications in a conservative effort not to
bolster a positive outcome. The five core indicators introduced in June 2013 were excluded partly because
the targets were identified so close to Project closing that they were tailored to the outputs expected, and
partly because some of the indicators are repetitive. The indicator referring to the carbon emission
reductions was not included as it was not part of the Loan Agreement.

163.    The ICR team used the cutoffs presented below in Table 13 to rate the achievement of each
objective in the split evaluation.

Table 13: Split evaluation rating framework

  % Achieved             Rating
  0 – 24                 Highly Unsatisfactory
  25 – 49                Unsatisfactory
  50 – 74                Moderately Unsatisfactory
  75 – 89                Moderately Satisfactory
  90 – 109               Satisfactory
  > 110                  Highly Satisfactory

164.     Overall, the split evaluation shows that Project achievements before and after the restructuring were
moderately satisfactory. It is noticeable that the only significant improvement achieved with the
restructuring was in the modification of the indicator tracking the amount of CO2 reduction from EPAP-II
projects. Revising the indicators earlier may have improved the rating of Project outcomes.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

165.    This section presents two sets of analysis: First, the unit cost per pollutant abated against set
benchmarks at the time of appraisal and second, a cost-benefit analysis of the internal rate of return and the
net-present-value of each sub-project.

Unit cost per pollutant abated

166.     Based on the actual and expected pollution load reduction to be achieved once all EPAP II sub-projects
have been commissioned and the results verified, the ICR team calculated the unit cost for each pollutant
abated (Table 15Table 8). Unit cost of pollution abatement is the ratio between the capital investment incurred
and the amount of pollutant removed and is expressed in terms of US$ of the pollutant. A summary of unit
costs of pollution abatement for each sub-project is given in Annex 2.

167.      Benchmarked against the UCPA estimates generated at the time of Project preparation and used as
eligibility criteria for EPAP II funding, Table 8 shows that UCPA for air emissions SO2 and TSP are within
the 75th percentile of the PAD benchmark, whereas wastewater effluent BOD, COD and TSS discharges are
with the 25th percentile of original benchmarks.

Cost-benefit analysis of each sub-project

168.   The Borrower undertook a cost-benefit analysis to assess the economic viability of each sub-project.
The analyses cover capital and operating costs/benefits reflecting changes in the throughput or productivity

                                                        48
and changes in the water, energy, fuel and chemical consumption before and after the sub-project
implementation. Costs for site preparation, installation of utilities and labor are also factored in. Software was
developed to facilitate calculations that provided net savings, net present value, internal rate of return, and
payback period. A summary of the results by sub-project type is provided in Table 16 to Table 19, below.

169.     From the analysis it can be noted that end-of-pipe treatment for air emission controls, such as filters
and bags have largely no financial benefit despite some improvements in energy savings and production.
Companies view these types of sub-projects as straight compliance expenditure. However, fuel switching and
alternative fuel projects have proved financially attractive with high IRRs. Wastewater treatment sub-projects
showed mostly negative IRRs despite the fact that in some projects there was recycling of treated waste water
and product recovery. Whereas Process modifications leading to improvements in wastewater showed IRRs of
2-14 percent. The higher figure at Egyptian Starch and Glucose was largely due to restoring production to its
original design capacity.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

An ICR mission for the Second Pollution Abatement Project (EPAP II) took place in Cairo, Egypt from
December 14-18, 2014. The mission met with all relevant partners to the Project, including the Minister of
Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, the Project Management Unit with EEAA, Project
co-financiers, participating financial institutions, and industry beneficiaries. The full list of contacts met during
the mission is included in Table 20, below. The information derived during the mission is largely incorporated
into the ICR. Below is a brief summary of the lessons learned from meeting with four industrial beneficiaries
to hear of their experience with the EPAP II project:

       Significant productivity gains: In three out of four industries, the investments financed with EPAP
        II funds led to significant productivity gains alongside environmental compliance. Improved process
        modifications led to greater raw material recovery and less production loss through leakage control,
        thereby increasing the yield per unit. It also led to reduced waste and costs and saved on utility through
        efficiency gains.
       EPAP II financing advanced the decision to invest: In those industries standing to reap significant
        productivity gains, the decision to invest in process modifications was advanced by the availability of
        EPAP II financing. Given the sharp competition and the demands from shareholders, the industries are
        expected to have eventually self-financed the investments given the high rate of return on the
        investment and positive net-present-value.
       The value-added of EPAP II financing was the technical assistance: The industries expressed their
        overall satisfaction with the technical assistance provided, particularly in the procurement process.
        While sometimes cumbersome, the carefully planned tendering process allowed for the introduction
        of new and best available technologies in addition to offering improved protection for the industries
        during the 12 months commissioning process. The close assistance provided on procurement,
        contracting, and monitoring improved the overall implementation process. Several industries are
        applying similar guidelines to other large, non-EPAP projects.
       Online monitoring system is a win-win for both EEAA and the industries: Installation of required
        online stack emissions monitoring systems has allowed for better quality control of the production
        facilities, as the emissions reveal information about the general condition and daily maintenance of the
        facility. The technical assistance on monitoring system was mentioned as a value-added of the EPAP
        II model.
       Interest in obtaining further financing under EPAP III: All industries expressed great satisfaction
        with the EPAP II model and with the close cooperation with EEAA. Given the chance, the industries
        expressed interest in obtaining future financing under EPAP III.
       Learned about EPAP II financing through on-going communication with EEAA: The industries
        expressed that the most effective means of marketing of the EPAP II instrument was through close
        dialogue with EEAA. This confirms the need for strong enforcement as an incentive for industries to
        take action towards environmental compliance.

1 Executive Summary
170.     This report has been prepared for the World Bank as part of the Implementation Completion Report
of EPAP II for the IBRD Loan No. 7372-EGT. It covers background information, investment component,
progress towards project outcomes (World Bank Results Framework), institutional strengthening, capacity
building activities and lessons learnt. It should be noted that EPAP II is not yet completed and will continue to
the latter part of 2015 with funds from the EIB, AFD and JICA. The report will need updating upon overall
completion.

Background Information
171.    EPAP II has been implemented by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) together with
the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) as Apex Bank and the involvement of 4 participating banks.

172.   The investment component was financed through loans from the World Bank (IBRD - US$20m), EIB
(EUR40m), AFD (EUR40m) and JICA (Yen4.72bn). Total available funds equated to US$160m at
commencement and reached US$178m in September 2014 due to the appreciation of the Euro and Yen against
the US$. Technical Assistance was provided by EIB FEMIP (EUR 3m) and the Government of Finland
(EUR0.9m).

173.    Funding was available to creditworthy industrial facilities in Greater Cairo and Alexandria. Sub-
projects should move the company from environmental non-compliance to compliance and decrease the
pollution loan by more than 50%. Sub-loans could cover up to 90% of eligible investment costs with a
maximum of US$15m. Interest rates were 2-3% above Libor/Euribor for 6 months or 2-3% above the mid
corridor rate of Egypt’s Central Bank for local currency sub -loans. Repayment was 5-8 years with 1-2 years
grace period.

174.    Implementation period was initially 5 years but became 7 years due to various issues including the
impacts of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008/09.

Investment Component
175.     130 sub-project applications totaling US$493.4m in sub-loan requests have been generated since the
start of EPAP II in 2007. 35 sub-projects have been funded with sub-loans of US$175.17m. 6 applications
(US$531.m) are outstanding as there are insufficient funds remaining. 89 sub-project applications totalling
US$ 265.1m were withdrawn, many in the latter part of 2008 coinciding with the height of the global economic
crisis.

176.  17 sub-projects (US$84.99m) have been completed and 7 sub-projects (US$10.55m) have been
commissioned and are under monitoring. 11 sub-projects (79.63m) are still under implementation.

177.     Of the funded sub-projects, 21 (US$109.51m) are in Cairo (63% by value) and 14 (US$65.56m) are
in Alexandria (37% by value). In Cairo, sub-projects relating to reduced air pollution (dedusting systems, fuel
switching, and process modification-air) account for 78% of the total by value. In Alexandria, air pollution
related sub-projects account for 38% and wastewater 57% of total sub-projects by value.

178.      By sector, the manufacture of cement accounts for 39% of the project pipeline of US$175.17m. The
fertiliser sector accounts for 17%, brickworks 11%, petroleum 10%, paper and print 8%, food 7% and 8% is
spread among the chemical, steel and other sectors.

179.    Total disbursement to September 2014 was US$126.76m of which the WB share was US$20m.
Disbursement from the other 3 co-financiers is forecast to continue till December 2015, by which time all co-
financier loans will be fully utilised.

                                                       60
180.   Participating bank agreements have been signed with NSGB (now QNB), CIB, Egyptian Saudi
Finance Bank and IDBE. NBE accounted for 73.3% of the funded sub-projects, QNB 17.8% and CIB 8.9%.
No sub-projects were financed through the Egyptian Saudi Finance Bank and IDBE.

181.    While 22 marketing workshops have been held, it has been EEAA’s use of the carrot (concessional
finance) and stick (enforcement) approach that has generated most of the EPAP II sub-project pipeline. A
random selection of sub-borrowers, surveyed on whether concessional finance triggers investment in pollution
abatement, showed that most would eventually take the necessary compliance actions, however the availability
of concessional finance with more rigorous EEAA follow up hastened their decision to invest now.

182.     104 supplier contracts totalling US$164.11m have been awarded so far. Of this amount 2 contracts
worth US$32.7m were awarded following ICB procurement, 60 contracts worth US$94.56m were awarded
using CCP procurement, 34 contracts (US$6.93m) by shopping and 8 contracts (US$29.92m) were directly
awarded following co-financier approval. Bidders from EU Member States account for 46% of contracts by
value, followed by bidders from Egypt at 37% then India (10%), Turkey (5%) with 2% split among four other
countries.

183.    EPAP II procurement procedures on ICB (>US$8m) and CCP (US$0.5-8m) proved difficult for many
sub-borrowers. The procurement cycle for the 2 ICB contracts at Tourah Cement and National Cement took
29 months and 33 months respectively. The procurement cycle using CCP varied from 2-13 months. The
World Bank procurement specialist undertook periodic procurement reviews, which all showed compliance
with required procedures, and at the June 2014 co-financier meeting formally acknowledged the good work of
the PMU/TA.

Progress Towards Project Outcomes
184.     Of the 17 completed sub-projects (US$84.99m) particulate emissions have reduced 94% from 63,704
tpa to 3,914 tpa and SO2 emissions, mainly from fuel switching projects has decreased 84% from 25,594 tpa
to 4,066 tpa. EPAP II fuel switching sub-projects have reduced GHGs by 656,336 tons of CO2 annually. HF
emissions decreased from 15 tpa to 2 tpa at Abu Zabel, a reduction of 86%. COD and BOD pollution loads in
wastewater discharges decreased 99% by 5,092 tpa and 3,190 tpa respectively, while TDS decreased 82% from
869 tpa to 710 tpa.

185.    For the 7 commissioned sub-projects 3 wastewater treatment sub-projects will reduce heavy metals by
98% (5 tpa) while the 2 solvent recovery sub-projects at Porta and Rotografia will yield a 99% reduction in
ethyl acetate emissions (3,094 tpa).

186.    Of the 11 sub-projects under implementation significant load reductions are expected in particulates
(5,044 tpa or 85% reduction), TSS (5,169 tpa of 100%) and COD (521 tpa or 79% reduction). Phenol, furfural,
ammonia and chlorine in wastewater discharges are expected to be phased out in 4 sub-projects.

187.    Pollution abatement costs for particulate reduction in the cement sector are high varying from
US$5.61-34.72/kg, while process modifications in other sectors vary from US$30.54-50.83/kg. Fuel
switching sub-projects showed the least unit cost of pollution abatement averaging US$0.50/kg for particulates
and US$0.0.41-2.50/kg of SO2. Wastewater treatment plants showed pollution abatement costs of US$2.84-
3.84/kg of COD, US$3.59/kg of BOD and US$0.39/kg of TSS.

188.      Cost benefit analyses show the following: a) end of pipe treatment for air emission controls such as
filters, have largely no financial benefit despite some improvements in energy savings and production and
companies view these types of sub-projects as straight compliance expenditure; b) wastewater treatment sub-
projects show mostly negative IRRs despite the fact that in some sub-projects there was recycling of treated

                                                     61
waste water and product recovery; c) process modifications leading to improvements in wastewater showed
IRRs of 2-14%; and d) fuel switching from mazout to natural gas has proved financially very attractive with
IRRs varying from 59-347%.

189.     For all sub-projects the greatest impact is expected in air emissions in South Cairo where reductions
of 61,686 tpa of TSP and 18,265 tpa of SO2 are expected. Air dispersion modelling using AERMOD 7 has
been used to assess the impacts of air pollutants on surrounding communities before and after sub-project
implementation. Using the air dispersion modelling and the 2006 census it is expected around 917,500 people
in the area of Arab Abu Saad, Tabbin and Helwan would benefit from reduced pollution loads attributable to
EPAP II sub-projects however as there are numerous other sources of pollution the impact may not be that
evident. Ambient air monitoring stations in the area show some improvement over the past 3 years, although
significant trends are not that discernible.

190.    The monitoring and evaluation system for EPAP II sub-projects comprised a combination of source
monitoring, online stack monitoring, sub-project automated process monitoring, project Management
Information System, ambient air monitoring network and air dispersion modelling. Sub-project verification
inspections were also undertaken by EEAA as a double check before grant release.

191.   CAP actions were followed up by the PMU and inspection departments. A total of 119 CAP actions
had been targeted in the 27 companies borrowing EPAP II funds of which 89 (75%) have been completed by
September 2014.

192.    An industry colour coded performance rating and disclosure system had been adapted from PROPER
(used in Indonesia) and was launched in Cairo as BRAEM in 2011. The scheme had been piloted in 26
companies in the 6th October City, where most companies were rated poorly being in either red or black
categories. Unfortunately the conditions following the January 2011 revolution were not ideal for introducing
a public disclosure scheme. Furthermore, budget constraints, differences of opinion over roll out and the legal
uncertainties over whether EEAA could actually disclose such data led to implementation of the scheme being
stopped.

193.     A web based Management Information System (MIS) has been developed to store, retrieve and share
all project related technical and financial information. The MIS consists of 7 modules and contains information
on project application forms, case summaries, results of prioritization, loan amounts and status, procurement
and disbursement plans.

194.    Assistance was given to NBE on the development of an environment policy and environmental
management framework that integrates environmental considerations in its credit appraisal. The
Environmental Policy was formally endorsed by the NBE Board in 2010. A proposed plan of action would
eventually result in NBE signing the Equator Principles.

195.     An intermediate objective of EPAP II was to test an economically sound financial mechanism for
industrial pollution abatement that is adopted by GoE and replicated in other areas. The success indicator was
an EPF framework agreement with at least one commercial. The EPF signed agreements with NBE and the
Eco Office of the FEI concerning an additional LE40m from Danida and LE6m from its own resources. The
EPF also agreed with KfW to contribute EUR0.67m to SMEs supported through the PPSI project. Perhaps,
just as important is the interest of GoE and the EPAP II banks to continue funding pollution abatement using
the same sound financial mechanism established in EPAP II. A follow on phase is expected to commence in
2015 with a total value in excess of US$180m.




                                                      62
Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building
196.     To ensure only quality environmental sub-projects are supported by EPAP II, guidelines were
developed to improve the quality of technical documentation submitted and a range of screening and evaluation
tools were introduced for sub-project appraisal. Criteria used for prioritisation are: 1) type of industrial sector;
2) pollutant and location; 3) unit cost of pollution abatement; 4) neighbourhood impacts; 5) productivity
gains; 6) improvements towards sector benchmarks; 7) implementation period; 8) innovative project features;
9) factory contribution; 10) presence of environmental management systems; and 11) CDM potential.

197.    A Review and Reference Manual was developed for PMU’s use and explains how to compute /check
pollution loads (before and after), arrive at the unit cost of pollution abatement, make comparison with sector
benchmarks and carry out cost-benefit analyses.

198.    The EIB and Finnish TAs have supported sub-borrowers on required technical documents including
the preparation of 29 environmental audits and CAPs as well as another 23 audits for sub-projects withdrawn.
Significant time has been spent advising sub-borrowers on the procurement process and preparation of bidding
documents. CCP standard bidding documents have been prepared and translated into Arabic; their use is not
compulsory but were available if required.

199.   The Operations Manual was amended including the addition of prioritisation criteria, revised
procurement guidelines, updated application form and revised formats for the compliance action plan and case
summary.

200.     Strengthening of the Country Safeguard System was undertaken. New EIA guidelines that include
public consultation, updated list of Competent Authorities and public disclosure of EIAs were issued. EIAs for
29 EPAP sub-projects have been approved by EEAA and the documents placed on the EEAA website. Five
EA sector guidelines have been prepared. CEO Decree 608/2009 on the role and responsibilities of various
entities in the preparation and follow up of CAPs was issued in September 2009. Updated guidelines for the
preparation of CAPs were also released in September 2009.

201.    As part of the development of a cleaner production promotion plan a wider mix of market based tools
has been investigated. These include export driven environmental certification requirements plus energy
efficiency and CDM.

202.    Industrial policies were developed drawing on EPAP II experience. Policy issues cover: a) reduction
of GHGs; b) improved compliance with CAPs; c) engaging communities through public disclosure and
performance ratings; d) reviewing emission standards, monitoring and compliance procedures; e) promotion
of cleaner production; and f) improved management of pollution hot spots.

203.    16 guidelines have been developed to improve preparation and review of technical documents, self
monitoring requirements and procurement procedures. 46 training courses have been delivered to PMU and
EEAA staff, 2 training courses have been provided to banks on environmental due diligence and environmental
management in credit appraisal and training on audit and CAP preparation has been given in 9 workshops for
industry.

Lessons Learned
204.    Lessons learnt are summarized in Section 6. Key points cover: a) successful management structure;
b) market based financial/technical approaches generating significant interest with over US$493m in SUB-
loan requests; c) participating bank agreements that provide a more competitive environment with the Apex
bank in sub-loan offers to industry; d) slow disbursement due to project nature with scope to improve with
tranche transfers; e) procurement procedures that have been difficult for sub-borrowers to follow resulting in

                                                        63
long procurement cycles; f) difficulties of dealing with public sector companies; g) concessional finance as a
trigger for pollution abatement investment; h) difficulties posed by the exclusion of separate works contracts;
i) the carrot (concessional finance) and stick (enforcement) approach that has generated most of the EPAP II
applications; j) compliance procedures and CAPs; and kl) limited opportunities in Alexandria.

2 EPAP II Background

2.1    EPAP II Overview
205.   The Egyptian Pollution Abatement Project (EPAP II) has been a major initiative of the Ministry of
Environment (MOE) / Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) to help industry improve
performance and become compliant with environmental regulations.

206.    The investment component of EPAP II was financed through loans from the World Bank (IBRD -
US$20m), EIB (EUR40m), AFD (EUR40m) and JICA (Yen4.72bn). Total available funds approximated
US$160m in 2006 but due to exchange rate movements reached US$178m in August 2014 and even higher
during the course of implementation. The EC contributed EUR10m to subsidise EIB interest rates. The World
Bank loan was approved by the Board of Directors on 23rd March 2006 and became effective on 12th December
2006.

207.  The National Bank of Egypt was the Apex Bank responsible for co financier loan utilisation,
management and repayment. Participating bank agreements were entered into with four other banks.

208.     Technical Assistance to EEAA, banks and industry was financed through EIB FEMIP (EUR 3m) and
the Government of Finland (EUR0.9m). The commencement of the EIB TA in July 2007 is generally accepted
as the project commencement date with an initial 5 year implementation period envisaged.

2.2    Objectives
209.    As stated in the Operations Manual the objectives of EPAP II are:
         To decrease pollution in the project location, and thereby improve local and global environmental
             conditions, by enabling private and public sector industrial enterprises to invest in pollution
             abatement measures.
           To support the application of suitable enforcement approaches, inspection activities and the
            development of technical capacity in environmental institutions and participating banks.
           To improve public information, awareness and activities relating to industrial environmental
            affairs in Egypt, particularly in Alexandria and Greater Cairo.
           To strengthen the monitoring and enforcement (M & E) capabilities of the environmental
            institutions.

2.3    Components
210.    Component 1 - Investment: This component focused on sub-project investments in pollution
abatement in creditworthy public and private enterprises in the project location and targeted the industrial
sector at large within this location. Qualifying pollution abatement measures included waste minimisation,
pollution prevention, resource recovery, application of clean technology, fuel substitution and end-of-pipe
investments. A small portion of the facility was available for financing other bankable activities related to
environmental protection such as environmental services (manufacturing of equipment for environmental
monitoring or pollution abatement and hazardous waste management) but was not used.




                                                     65
211.     Component 2 – Technical Assistance: Technical Assistance (TA) activities aimed at supporting the
EPAP II EEAA PMU, industry and the banking sector and strengthening the capacity of EEAA with respect
to pollution abatement.

2.3.1   Sub-project Eligibility
212.    Funding was available for industrial facilities in Greater Cairo and Alexandria. Companies applying
must be credit worthy and the sub-projects should: a) move the company from non-compliance to compliance
with the Egyptian environmental law; b) decrease pollution loads by 50%; and c) are technically and
economically feasible.

213.     Sub-projects should fall under one of the following areas: a) end of pipe treatment for air emissions
and waste water; b) in-process modifications and cleaner technologies; c) work environment; d) energy
conservation and conversion to cleaner fuels; e) hazardous waste management; and f) environmental services.
Civil works and projects with production increases of >10% over design capacity were not eligible for EPAP
financing. During the midterm review alternative fuel sub-projects using agricultural or municipal waste could
be eligible but subject to co-financier approval on a case by case basis.




2.3.2   Loan and Grant Facility
214.    For approved projects funding could be obtained through the National Bank of Egypt or one of their
approved participating banks based on:
 Sub-loan:     Up to 90% of project investment costs with a maximum sub-loan of US$15 million and
               a minimum sub-loan of US$100,000.
 Grant:        20% of loan for projects achieving environmental objectives.
 Interest:     Foreign loans: 2-3% above Libor/Euribor for 6 months plus up to 0.15% monthly
               commission on highest debit balance
               Local currency: 2-3% above Egypt Central Bank mid corridor rate plus up to 0.15%
               monthly commission on highest debit balance
 Repayment: 5-8 years with 1-2 years grace period

2.3.3   Responsibilities of Sub-borrowers
215.     Borrowers were required to: a) prepare environmental assessment of the sub-project; b) submit
compliance action plan for the entire facility for EEAA approval; c) prepare technical feasibility; d) undertake

2.4    Operations Manual
216.     An Operations Manual had been developed at the commencement of EPAP II to harmonise the
different requirements of the various co financiers to facilitate implementation of EPAP II and the achievement
of its objectives.

217.     The manual was comprehensive and proved a good management tool and reference document.
Contents included: a) project overview; b) implementation structure; c) roles and responsibilities; d) sub-
project selection process and criteria; e) guidelines on procurement, financial and environmental management;
f) sector eligibility; and g) reporting requirements and reporting templates.

218.    Modifications were made to Operations Manual during the course of implementation including: a) the
50% reduction in target pollution load reduction should be sub-project level and not the entire facility; and b)
revisions to the procurement section particularly on use of Competent Commercial Practices.

2.5    Implementation Period
219.     The project was officially launched in December 2006 with a 5 year implementation period envisaged
from 2007-2012. All co financier agreements were signed by March 2007 and the EIB FEMIP TA commenced
in July 2007, which was more or less regarded as the start date.

220.   Actual implementation period for disbursing WB funds was 2007-August 2014. Overall, EPAP II is
expected to disburse funds from other cofinanciers up to end of 2015.

221.    The current status of the cofinancier loans is:

222.    Causes for delays in implementation were:

       2008-09 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) that resulted in sub-project applications being withdrawn
        over concerns to borrow due to major economic uncertainties while at the same time the banks became
        more risk adverse to lending, often requiring high levels of collateral and interest rate. The impact of
        the GFC is most evident in the value of the EPAP II project pipeline, which went from US$222.0m in
        June 2008 to US$106.7m in June 2009. Despite the increased marketing efforts of EEAA and NBE,
        it took nearly another year to rebuild the pipeline back to the June 2008 level.




                                                          67
   Increase in available funds, which at the start of the project were equivalent to 160 M US$. With
    increased value of the Yen and Euro against the US$ the package reached a high of US$190m dropping
    back to US$178m at August 2014. With added efforts EEAA and NBE have been able to commit
    more sub-projects for which sub-loan agreements have been signed and funds allocated.

3.1                Project pipeline

3.1.1               Applications received
223.     130 sub-project applications totalling US$493.4m in sub-loan requests have been generated since the
start of EPAP II in 2007. 35 sub-projects have been funded with sub-loans of US$175.17m. 6 applications
(US$531.m) are outstanding as there are insufficient funds remaining. 89 sub-project applications totalling
US$ 265.1m were withdrawn, many in the latter part of 2008 coinciding with the height of the global economic
crisis. The overall situation is:

224.    Trends in the value of the project pipeline since September 2007 are depicted below. The drop in
value after June 2008 was due to the global economic crisis while the decrease after March 2010 was due to
the low prioritisation of US$38.3m of sub-project applications

3.1.2               Active projects
225.     At August 2014, EPAP II available funds of US$175.17 million are fully allocated to 35 sub-projects
from 27 companies. EPAP sub-loans average 55% of the total investment costs of US$320 million. An
additional 6 applications with loan requests of US$53.1 million remain but cannot be progressed due to
insufficient funds. A summary of the sub-project pipeline at September 2014 is included as Annex 1. Sub-

3.1.4   Industry sector distribution
229.     By sector, the manufacture of cement accounts for 39% of the funded sub-projects of US$175.17m.
The fertiliser sector accounts for 17%, brickworks 11%, petroleum 10%, paper and print 8%, food 7% and 8%
is spread among the chemical, steel and other sectors.
•    Most of the cement sector sub-projects are driven by compliance requirements. One sub-project dealt
     with the use of alternative fuels as a substitute for fossil fuels.
•    In the fertiliser sector, 3 sub-projects at Abu Zabal (US$14.5m) were driven by compliance and were part
     of an overall upgrading of an old privatised public sector company. The wastewater treatment project at
     Abu Qir Fertilisers (US$16m) was compliance driven but will also result in 80% recycling of treated
     wastewater and the recovery and reuse of ammonia.
•    Economic and environmental benefits are key drivers for the brickwork cluster sub-project at Arab Abu
     Saad (US$19.86m).
•    One large project in the petroleum sector (Amreyah Petroleum) introduced new technology to phase out
     the use of phenol in the solvent extraction unit and hence remove phenol from wastewater discharges to
     Lake Maryut.
•    Two of the six projects in the paper and print sector are solvent recovery plants at Porta Egypt (US$4m)
     and Rotografia (US$6m).
•    A large project in the food sector (Egyptian Starch & Glucose) involved modernisation of old privatised
     public sector company and enabled the company to become compliant in wastewater and work
     environment.

3.2.2         Disbursement profile
239.    EPAP II commenced disbursement in 2007 and full disbursement of all co-financier funds is expected
by end of 2015. World Bank funds were fully utilised by September 2014. Disbursement is skewed to the
back part of EPAP II due to the time taken to market, identify, develop and implement sub-projects. The
disbursement profile is shown below.

241.        Key stakeholders are grouped in four quadrants that show:
             Frontline marketers that are proactive in promoting EPAP II.
                     Active marketers are organisations that could play a role in getting information to industry.
                     Reactive marketers are stakeholders that could have a role in raising awareness in industry
                      through their own activities.
                     Stakeholders that could raise public awareness on pollution abatement activities and impacts.
242.        The PMU has worked with members of the different stakeholder groups.

3.3.2       Marketing Workshops
243.    Twenty two marketing workshops were held with around 2,058 industry personnel attending.
Workshops have been undertaken directly or in coordination with other industrial pollution programmes. In
addition one workshop has been held for media to increase their awareness of EPAP II. The list of marketing
workshops is summarised below:

3.3.3   Marketing effectiveness
244.    A short survey of stakeholders on how EPAP is marketed showed the following:

              The PMU in combination with the RBOs in Alexandria and Cairo has been the most effective
               mechanism in stimulating EPAP interest and is responsible for the bulk of applications received.
               Major polluters are known to the RBOs through routine inspections and are targeted for EPAP
               follow up if they do not have available resources to take action. The carrot and stick approach of
               concessional funding and enforcement is a good approach although at times companies may join
               EPAP simply to avoid fines. It should also be noted that pollution penalties are on the rise and in
               some cases companies that dropped out of EPAP have been fined and then reapplied.
              The banks had a minor impact overall in generating applications although in the period 2011-
               2014 the banks were increasingly referring their clients for EPAP II funding. The banks generated
               their own marketing material and participated in all marketing workshops. Furthermore the banks
               sent out explanatory notes about EPAP II to their branches.
              Business organisations have been used in getting messages to industry Examples include the
               Brickwork Owners Association on Arab Abu Saad and the FEI metallurgical chamber in
               arranging workshops for foundries in Shoubra El Kheima that need support to relocate outside
               Cairo. The ECO office of the FEI only sees EPAP as an option for funding if the demand from
               enterprises exceeds the resources of the ECO revolving fund. A dialogue was entered into with
               the IMC on marketing EPAP, but nothing tangible happened. Business organisations tend to be
               more motivated if EPAP II can deliver financial and productivity benefits to members.



                                                                     79
            The PMU has held numerous meetings with the Ministry of Investment, Ministry of Trade and
             Industry and the holding companies to obtain finance for environmental improvements in public
             sector companies. ENCPC under the Ministry of Trade and Industry is proactive in promoting
             EPAP II both through the Finnish EPAP II TA contract and through their own MED-TEST
             programme that provides cleaner production audits in Alexandria but lacks implementation funds
             hence the complementary benefits of EPAP II.
            Consultants and suppliers were made aware of EPAP II funds that may help in promoting their
             own services to companies. A number of leads were generated particularly by consultants.
245.    The media coverage of EPAP has been very good. Hundreds of press articles have been released
through the EEAA communications department since commencement. A work shop for journalists was held
in 2009. Various Ministers of Environment have frequently referred to EPAP II in opening speeches at a range
of workshops and more recently official openings of EPAP II sub-projects by Ministers has attracted
substantial press interest.

246.     The media coverage is mainly published in local newspapers. Media coverage is also generated by
dissatisfied citizens living near heavily polluting industries. Several of the companies interviewed stated they
received on a daily basis complaints from citizens and authorities and very often these end up in the media,
both newspapers and TV.

3.3.4   Industry awareness of EPAP
247.    A limited review of sub-borrowers and how they became aware of EPAP showed the following:
         All companies became aware of EPAP II through the PMU/RBO. Most had attended workshops
             held by the PMU.
            The PMU/RBO pushed the process of meeting compliance and while all stated they would have
             eventually implemented the compliance actions EPAP II hastened this process.
            In general sub-borrowers found the procurement process difficult, but were very satisfied with
             the assistance received from the PMU/TA in getting the paperwork done. They all praised the
             cooperativeness of the PMU/TA.
            Companies were generally happy to deal with one of the participating banks.

3.3.5   Identified investments needs and conversion rate
248.    Investment needs analysis undertaken prior to the start of EPAP II indicated a potential demand
reaching 244 sub-projects requiring US$513m of investment. While all companies identified in the different
studies were followed up the conversion rate to actual projects has only been 5% in terms of projects and 20%
in terms of sub-loans (see comparative table below).

249.       It should be noted that:
             Only 5% of the potential projects materialised.
              20% of the possible fund requirements were realised although some project costs were much
               higher than anticipated.
              14% of companies had closed or were found to be non-creditworthy
              11% of companies had been identified for fuel switching in areas without gas supply
              7% of companies had projects that did not meet eligibility criteria.

3.3.6      Website
250.   The EPAP II dedicated website was developed and launched in January 2009. Information concerning
EPAP II and public disclosure of EIAs has been placed on the EEAA website.




3.4       Procurement

3.4.1      Procurement procedures
251.       The basic principles applied to procurement were:
          Economy - procurement costs should be the lowest that can reasonably be achieved

          Efficiency - procurement should be undertaken in the least costly and simplest way that may be
           reasonably achieved.




                                                        81
           Fairness - all bidders were subject to the same rules and treated in the same way without any receiving
            considerations or information that is not also available to all other bidders.

           Transparency - decision-making related to procurement is assessed against pre-established criteria and
            all documents and records of decisions related to procurement were available for inspection.

252.        Types of procurement included:
           Contract value >US$8m – International Competitive Bidding using World Bank Standard Bidding
            Documents and procedures. Total: 2 contracts.

           Contract value >US$0.5m - <US$8m – Competent Commercial Practice acceptable to the PMU with
            a formal bidding process. Total: 60 contracts.

           Contract value <US$0.5m – Shopping by which a minimum of 3 technically and commercially
            acceptable quotations are obtained. Total: 34 contracts.

           Direct contract was allowed where it could be technically and commercially justified and where prior
            co-financier approval was obtained. Total: 8 contracts.

3.4.2       Procurement plan and contracts
253.    The World Bank procurement specialist undertook periodic procurement reviews, which all showed
the procurement requirements were being followed. At the June 2014 cofinancier meeting the WB
procurement expert acknowledged the good work of the PMU/TA procurement team in ensuring that sub-
project procurement with all sub-borrowers has been done effectively and in compliance with EPAP II
procurement guidelines.

254.    The procurement plans is included as Annex 4. Proposed procurement methods for sub-projects in the
current active project pipeline are summarised below.

Note: No. Of projects means main procurement method; some project have multiple contracts with different procurement methods .

255.    As indicated in the table above 104 supplier contracts have been awarded. A list of sub-project
contracts is included as Annex 5. Bidders from EU Member States account for 46% of contracts by value,
followed by bidders from Egypt at 37% then India (10%), Turkey (5%) with 2% split among four other
countries. A list of contracts is given in Annex 5.




                                                                                82
256.   Within the EU, Italian contractors have secured 45% of the EU value followed by Austria (17.8%) and
then Germany (13.4%).




3.4.3   International Competitive Bidding
257.     Sub-projects proposed by Tourah Cement and National Cement were above US$8m and hence subject
to ICB procurement procedures. Total value of the 2 contracts was US$32.7m. The Tourah tender was
awarded to Thermax India for US$19.85m (loan value US$15m) and the National Cement tender was awarded
to CTP Team Italy for EUR8.762m plus EGP 33.974m. A Change Order was agreed for EUR1.3m bringing
the total contract value to approximately US$17.7m.



                                                   83
3.4.3.1   ICB Procurement Cycle
258.    Tourah Cement followed the ICB process drawing on guidance from the PMU/TA throughout the
entire procurement cycle. The company used the resources of the parent company to prepare technical
specifications and was able to mobilise a team of procurement and legal experts to prepare and understand the
ICB conditions.

259.    National Cement relied heavily on guidance and assistance from the PMU/TA and in addition
contracted Colleagues India to provide technical support during the procurement cycle and engineering
supervision during implementation.

260.    Procurement cycle for Tourah Cement was 29 months plus 18 months was planned for implementation
but took 24 months due to disruption during the 2011 revolution. For National Cement the procurement cycle
was 33 months plus 15 months planned for implementation.

                                                   Tourah Cement               National Cement
  Bid preparation                                     10 months                    13 months
  Tender process                                      5 months                 9 months (2 stage)
  Bid evaluation (up to award)                        11 months                8 months (2 stage)
  Contracting:                                        3 months                     3 months
  Subtotal procurement                                29 months                   33 months
  Implementation period (planned)                     24 months               15 months (planned)
  Total procurement plus implementation               53 months                   48 months

261.   The long cycle time could be attributed to the time taken by both companies in ensuring strict
adherence to the ICB requirements and to delays in obtaining no objection from co financiers.

262.    In addition to procurement complexities, concern was also expressed by Tourah Cement over the
following:
          The contract was awarded to Thermax India as the lowest substantially responsive bidder in
             accordance with ICB requirements. It is the first time the company has worked with this
             contractor so there was a degree of anxiety amongst managment over possible repercussions
             should anything go wrong.
                From the date bids were called to contract award, prices in the international market place fell 20-
                 25%, however under ICB rules the company is not allowed to negotiate the price. Consequently
                 the company beleives the benefit of the 20% grant was wiped out by the drop in market prices.




                                                          84
3.4.4   Competent Commercial Practice
263.  Procurement by Competent Commercial Practice accounted for more than half the project pipeline at
US$94.56m in 60 bid contracts.

264.    A lack of clarity on what constituted acceptable CCP practices at the start of EPAP II meant that sub-
borrowers used bidding documents based on the ICB bidding documents. However the sub-borrowers often
found those documents difficult to understand and apply. Following agreement at the June 08 co financier’s
mission a shortened standard bid document (derived from ICB) was developed for CCP and approved locally
by the World Bank. It was then translated into Arabic.
At the midterm review it was agreed that:
            Sub-borrowers are allowed to use their own commercial procurement procedures and bid
             documents, with the PMU ensuring that such procedures follow the basic principles of economy,
             efficiency, fairness and transparency. Sample bidding documents are not mandatory but were
             available should the company wish to use them.
            Limited competitive bidding under competent commercial practice is allowed provided it can be
             demonstrated that that there are only a limited number of suppliers with the necessary technology.
             Calling for expressions of interest ahead of bidding is an acceptable approach to supplement
             justification of the limited availability of suppliers. Limited competitive bidding based on
             branding is not acceptable.
            The use of the two envelope system is acceptable for bidding under competent commercial
             practice with public opening of the financial envelope (i.e. the attendance of bidders or bidder’s
             representative who choose to attend).
            Direct contracting is acceptable provided it can be justified, however such procedures required
             prior no objection of the World Bank irrespective of the value.

                                                      85
            Bid documents below the ICB threshold do not require prior review by the co financiers and
             therefore should not be sent to the co financiers for approval.
265.    Timetable for procurement generally varied from 2-13 months.




3.4.5   Shopping
266.    To date 34 contracts worth US$6.93m have been issued without any undue delays.

3.4.6   Direct Contracting
267.   Total value of direct contracting is US$29.92m of which the Arab Abu Saad brickworks cluster project
accounts for US$19.88m. Of the 8 direct contracts issued, 3 relate to fuel switching (including Arab Abu Saad)
where sub-borrowers can only deal with the concession holder for gas connections in their area.

3.4.7   Standard bidding documents
268.    The following standard bidding documents are available:
         World Bank ICB 1 Stage bidding document (compulsory use)
            World Bank ICE 2 Stage bidding document (compulsory use)
            CCP 1 Stage bidding document (simplified from ICB and translated into Arabic)
            CCP 2 Stage bidding document (simplified from ICB)
            Shopping RFQ format

4 Progress Towards Project Outcomes

4.1              Environmental Improvement in Hot Spots

4.1.1              Pollution load reduction
269.     Environmental audits and 12 months post monitoring data for the sub-projects provide information on
the pollution load before and after the implementation of the sub-projects. Cross checks are also made using
online stack monitoring, emission factors and continuous monitoring sensors installed as part of the sub-project,
depending on the type of pollutant.

270.   A summary of pollution load reduction for completed, commissioned and sub-projects still under
implementation is given below.

                   TSP emissions are expected to reduce by 85% on average.
                            Wastewater sub-projects at Amreyah Petroleum, Abu Qir Fertilisers and Misr Chemical are
                             expected to remove pheonol, ammonia and chlorine respectively from wastewater discharges.
                            TSS at Misr Chemicals and COD at Egyptian Petrochemicals are expected to reduce by 100%
                             and 78% accordingly.

275.        From the above numbers if can be noted:
                Air emission reduction was highest in Cairo with the greatest impact being in South Cairo around
                 the Arab Abu Saad-Tabbin-Helwan-Tourah areas.
                Reduction in wastewater pollutants was highest in Alexandria, however changes in water quality
                 in Lake Maryut, El Mexx Bay and Abu Qir Bay may not be noted because of the very high
                 drainage discharges in these areas. There will be localised exceptions to this particualry with the
                 phasing out of phenol discharges to Lake Maryut from Amreyah Petroleum, the removable of
                 ammonia in Abu Qir Fertiliser’s discharges to Abu Qir and the removable of chlorine from Misr
                 Chemical’s discharges to El Mexx Bay.

4.1.3            Unit costs of pollution abatement
276.     Unit cost of pollution abatement is the ratio between the capital investment incurred and the amount
of pollutant removed and is generally expressed in terms of US$ or LE/kg of the pollutant. A summary of unit
costs of pollution abatement for completed, commissioned and sub-projects under implementation is given
below.

279.           From the above numbers if can be noted:
                       All wastewater figures for COD, BOD and TSS are well within the UCAs provided in the WB
                        PAD.
                       All fuel switching figures with respect to PM and SO2 are well within the UCAs provided in the
                        WB PAD.
                       The high cost of filters and process modifications for air emission improvements has meant that
                        the UCAs for PM are significantly above the WB PAD figures.

4.1.4          Cost benefit analyses of sub-projects
280.     Cost-benefit analysis were undertaken to asses sub-project economically viability. The analyses cover
capital and operating costs/benefits reflecting changes in the throughput or productivity and changes in the
water, energy, fuel and chemical consumption before and after the sub-project implementation. Costs for site
preparation, installation of utilities and labour are also factored in.

281.    Software was developed to facilitate calculations that provided net savings, Net Present Value, Internal
Rate of Return and payback period. A summary of the results is provided below.

                         End of pipe treatment for air emission controls such as filters, have largely no financial benefit
                          despite some improvements in energy savings and production. Companies view these types of
                          sub-projects as straight compliance expenditure.
                         Solvent recovery plants for the recovery of ethyl acetate emmissions are mixed with Porta
                          showing negative IRR while the Rotografia sub-project shows a very positive IRR of 21%.
                         Wastewater treatment sub-projects showed mostly negative IRRs despite the fact that in some
                          projects there was recycling of treated waste water and product recovery.
                         Process modifications leading to improvements in wastewater showed IRRs of 2-14%. The
                          higher figure at Egyptian Starch and Glucose was largely due to restoring production to its original
                          design capacity.
                         Fuel switching from mazout to natural gas has proved financially very attractive with IRRs
                          varying from 59-347%. In view of this, EPAP II stopped supporting fuel switching sub-projects
                          in individual companies in 2008.
                         Fuel switching at the brickwork cluster sub-project at Arab Abu Saad provided a significant win-
                          win situation in terms of the amount of pollution reduced and the financial attractiveness of the
                          project with a 42% IRR.
                         The alternative fuels sub-project at Arabian Cement in which natural gas is replaced with prepared
                          municipal and agricultural waste is financially very attractive due to the recent sharp increases in
                          the natural gas price to energy intensive industries.

4.1.5           Application of air dispersion modelling
283.    Air pollution dispersion models were introduced to better assess the impact of EPAP II air pollution
abatement projects. Staff from the PMU and EEAA Air Quality Department were trained on the use of two
popular software models namely SCREEN 3 and AERMOD 7.



                                                                                                        96
SCREEN 3 is single point-source software developed and approved by US Environmental Protection Agency
(US EPA) that is used for the purposes of identifying worst case pollutant concentrations. SCREEN3 is soon
expected to be replaced as the regulatory model, by AERSCREEN.

284.    AERMOD 7 is the state of the art regulatory model developed by US EPA that allows simulation of
air emissions from multiple sources of all types (e.g. point, area, volume and line). A user friendly and GIS
enabled version of AERMOD (BREEZE AERMOD 7) was procured from Trinity Consultants, USA.

285.    Examples of outputs for Arab Abu Saad and Tourah Cement Company are discussed below.

286.   The figure below shows the air shed that was modeled for predicting ambient particulate
concentrations for Arab Abu Saad and a contour of isopleths for 24 hourly average concentrations of total
suspended particulates (TSP) due to the stack emissions from the Arab Abu Saad brick kilns.

287.     The maximum 24 hour concentration of particulates (TSP) contributed to the ambient air conditions is
281 ug/m3 which is well above the ambient standard of 230 ug/m3. After implementation of the EPAP II sub-
project the maximum contribution to ambient air quality will reduce from 281 ug/m3 to 16 ug/m3, a significant
reduction in air pollutants.

288.    Below are the plots of time series (over a year) of concentrations of particulates that would impact
Qibliya town, south west of Arab Abu Saed before and after implementation. Although the pattern of ambient
concentrations has remained the same throughout the year the 24h (daily average) concentrations are expected
to drop more than 90% (the maximum value decreases from 210 ug/m3 to 12 ug/m3). Note that due to
meteorological conditions the impacts are least in summer.




                                                                                         97

4.1.6    EPAP II Impact on communities
291.    In 2013 the World Bank added a Core Sector Indicator for covering the number of project beneficiaries
affected. It was noted that the indicator should apply to investment projects approved after July 2009,
notwithstanding that EPAP II had been approved in 2006. As indicated in Section 4.1.2 the most significant
pollution load reduction from EPAP II sub-projects would occur in South Cairo particularly in the area around
Tabbin, Helwan and Arab Abu Saad. The CSI therefore became that “917,500 people would benefit from
reduced exposure to PM10” in this area.

292.   Air dispersion modelling of the cumulative impacts of sub-projects at Tourah Cement, Arab Abu Saad
and National Cemen were undertaken and showed:

       The maximum TSP 24 hour concentration attributable to EPAP II sub-projects before implementation
        is 201 ug/m3 in an area just to the south west of Arab Abu Saad.
       The maximum TSP 24 hour concentration attributable to EPAP II sub-projects after implementation is
        expected to decrease to 15 ug/m3 (see figure below) representing a significant fall in TSP levels
        attributable to EPAP II sub-projects.


                                                     99
293.    The above air dispersion model suggests the population most likely to be affected by the decrease in
TSP is in the area of Helwan, Tabbin and Arab Abu Saad. Population is these areas according in the 2006
census is around 917,500 of which 649,500 in Helwan, 68,000 in Tabbin and 200,000 in Arab Abu Saad.

294.     However as the three EPAP II sub-projects are only a small part of the total pollution sources in this
area it is almost impossible to verify the actual impact. Data from air monitoring stations in Helwan and
Tabbin (see image below) show some improvements to the air quality in the period 2011-2013 which could be
attributable to the completion of Arab Abu Saad and Tourah Cement sub-projects. It should be noted that the
National Cement sub-project had not yet been completed and hence any pollution there would not yet be
factored in.

4.2     Monitoring and Evaluation System

4.2.1    Monitoring and Evaluation System Components
295.    The monitoring and evaluation system for EPAP II comprises the following elements, which are
discussed in more detail in the following sections:

 Enterprise level:             Source monitoring of target pollutants
                               EEAA online monitoring of cement stack emission
                               Management Information System
 Area impact level:            Ambient air monitoring network
                               Air dispersion modelling
 Institutional level:          Number of inspections and fines
                               CAP approval and follow up
                               EREMIS database system
                               Public disclosure and community complaints


4.2.2    Source Monitoring
296.    Technical agreements, signed with sub-borrowers on project implementation, include the pollutants to
be monitored and the frequency of reporting. Guidelines have also been developed on how to do monitoring
and follow monitoring protocols for cement, nitrogen fertilizer, phosphoric fertilizer, food and textile industries.
Signed Technical Agreements are listed in Section 5.2.2.

297.  The source monitoring of sub-projects for EPAP II comprised:
    Self-monitoring by the enterprise at weekly to monthly intervals as specified in the Technical Agreement.
     At least every 3 months readings should be taken by an external laboratory, contracted by the company.

                                                       101
       Upon completion of the 12 months monitoring EEAA would undertake verification inspection to
        confirm the results prior to releasing the grant.

       For fuel switching sub-projects, SO2 compliance is immediately achieved in moving from heavy fuel
        oil to natural gas. For the brickworks at Arab Abu Saad 12 months of monitoring was not required and
        the grant was generally released 3-6 months after start-up.

       In the cement sector online monitoring exists for all cement plants in Egypt and provides EEAA with
        real time emission data pooled at the central server and was used by EPAP II to assess compliance. The
        information has been invaluable for EPAP II in assessing pollution loads and compliance and provided
        a clear indication of the before and after impacts. Quality control procedures including calibration of
        sensors are undertaken on a regular basis to ensure good quality data is received.






298.     A summary of the quarterly monitoring data for all completed sub-projects is given in Annex 6.

299.    It should be noted that some analytical data even if measurements are taken by external laboratories is
not always reliable. Accordingly in estimating the pollution load reduction a combination of source monitoring
data, online stack monitoring and emission factors was applied as appropriate.

4.2.3    CAP Monitoring
300.     As per the requirements for loan sanctioning under EPAP-II, every sub-borrower has submitted a
Compliance Action Plan (CAP) that is approved by EEAA. The EEAA inspection departments and the EPAP
II PMU follow up the progress of implementation of approved CAPs.
A total of 119 CAP actions had been targeted in the 27 companies borrowing EPAP II funds of which 89 (75%)
have been completed by September 2014.

                                                      102
4.2.4     Public disclosure and awareness
4.2.4.1    Performance ratings and disclosure
301.    Indonesia implemented in 1995, a public disclosure and environmental rating system called PROPER
(Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating). This system assessed the environmental performance
of a company and used 5 colours (black, red, blue, green and gold) to rate environmental performance.

302.   Through PROPER the environmental performance of participating companies is disclosed to the public.
Such a disclosure brought considerable public pressure on the companies to achieve compliance. Between
2003-05, around 13% improvement in compliance was found. 10 years after the scheme had been introduced,
around 500 companies had been rated and this number was expected to grow. Later, schemes like PROPER
were adopted and tested in countries like Peoples Republic of China, Philippines, Thailand, Ghana and India.

303.   Under EPAPII, a scheme similar to Indonesia’s PROPER was developed and ultimately branded as
BRAEM. The initial work was undertaken through the Finnish TA and an additional TA was organised by the
World Bank and contracted to IRIS, a US based organisation.

304.     Piloting of BRAEM was undertaken in the 6th October City. Four introductory workshops were held
to introduce the scheme to industry and the scheme was then piloted in 26 companies. Unfortunately most
companies were rated poorly being in either red or black categories as indicated below:

                              BRAEM – piloted in 6th October City

305.    IRIS Consultants were contracted to help strengthen the Scheme and to review and to possibly upgrade
the 26 initial audits to ensure that the Scheme was robust to withstand public scrutiny. A formal launching
event of BRAEM was held in June 2011 and attended by 171 participants, split into 17 consultants, 20
academics, 85 Industrial companies' representatives, 32 EEAA representatives’ and 17 media practitioners.


                                                        103
306.    Unfortunately the conditions following the January 2011 revolution were not ideal for introducing a
public disclosure scheme. Furthermore, budget constraints, differences of opinion on roll out and the legal
uncertainties over whether EEAA could actually disclose such data led to implementation being stopped.
4.2.4.2        Community complaints
307.     EEAA has a mechanism to receive and act on the complaints made by the public. At each RBO, there
is an officer who receives and processes the complaints while complaints lodged centrally at EEAA are referred
to the relevant RBO. Complaints from public typically arise due to air pollution (mal-odours, lower visibility,
discomfort in respiration), discharge of wastewater and indiscriminate disposal of solid & hazardous waste.
EEAA’s compliant registering and response system brings in involvement of the public.

308.    Below is a summary of complaints received concerning Cairo. The drop-off in total complaints
between 2011-2013 coincides with the aftermath of the Arab Spring. Main issues for Cairo are solid waste
and air pollution. Interestingly, there is a significant change in complaints on air pollution jumping from 15-
17% from 2007-2012 to 26-29% in 2013/14.

Cairo the main source of complaints are air pollution and solid waste.

4.2.5         Computerised web based Management Information System
310.     A web based Management Information System (MIS) was developed to store, retrieve and share all
project related technical and financial information. The MIS consists of 7 modules and contains information
on project application forms, case summaries, results of prioritization, loan amounts and status, procurement
and disbursement plans etc. This information is stored on a secured server using a SQL database. The MIS is
web based and access was provided to PMU staff and NBE.




                                                                      104
311.    EEAA operates another database management system called EREMIS to store and retrieve
environmental data. This system is also web based and uses ORACLE. Unfortunately since the 2011 Arab
Spring the updating and maintenance of the system declined considerably. In 2014 EEAA has contracted an
outside firm to develop a computerised database system for all of EEAA. It is believed it should be ready for
commissioning in 2015.

4.3     Financial Mechanism for Industrial Pollution Abatement

4.3.1    NBE Environmental Policy
312.   EPAP II is categorized by the World Bank as Category FI (Financing Intermediary). Support has been
provided to NBE to help meet its obligations as an FI. An Environmental Management Framework (EMF)
was prepared to integrate environmental considerations in its credit appraisal and monitoring system for EPAP-
II.

313.    The EMF consists of Environmental Policy, Guiding and Operational Principles, Procedures and
Checklists. Central to the procedures is the appraisal process that is done jointly with PMU/EEAA. The
appraisal addresses both national regulatory requirements as well as trans-regulatory, market driven, business
related risks in the environmental domain. The latter is addressed by NBE. Compliance to national
environmental regulations alone is thus not considered as sufficient to identify and manage the lending risks.
Accordingly, a risk control or risk management strategy is evolved.

314.    A manual was developed for understanding and implementation of the EMF in consultation with NBE.
This manual is organized into two volumes. Volume I contains the description of the EMF and is sub-divided
into various parts. Volume II consists of Annexures which provide additional detail, checklists, reporting
formats, case application and other aids such as guidance on implementing the EMF (including a Glossary).
Core unit at NBE consisting of three staff members has been provided training on the use of the Manual.


                                                    105
315.     The Environmental Policy was formally endorsed by the NBE Board in 2010.

316.     During the implementation of EPAP II the requirements of the EMF has effectively be implemented
jointly by NBE and the EPAP II PMU.

317.    Beyond EPAP II, NBE has envisioned a long-term road map for “greening its entire operations” taking
cue from the global trend at the FIs. Some of the key milestones of this road map are envisaged as follows:
        Signing up with the UNEP Finance Initiative, an aspirational move
        Expanding the EMF across all NBE operations, in phases.
        Signing of Equator Principles, which will take NBE in the select club of 80+ FIs in the world

318.    The EMF initiative at NBE in EPAP II is thus a stepping stone for NBE towards sustainable banking.
When implemented as outlined in the above roadmap, the EMF experience will provide NBE a position of
leadership in Egypt and in the Middle-East region.

4.3.2    EPF and commercial bank agreement
319.     An intermediate objective of EPAP II is to test an economically sound financial mechanism for
industrial pollution abatement that is adopted by GoE and replicated in other areas. The success indicator is
that a framework agreement is established between the EPF and at least one commercial bank during project
implementation.
Progress on this objective can be best summarised as follows:
        A consultant was engaged to assess the interest of commercial banks and of EPF in funding pollution
         abatement and the potential for sustaining the EEAA EPAP II PMU.
        The EPF received a grant of LE 40 million from DANIDA as a credit line for ensuring environmental
         compliance of SME industries. The EPF has an agreement with NBE for the management of the funds
         together with the Eco Office of Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI).
        The EPF is co-financing an amount of Euros 670,000 with the KFW funded project Private Public
         Sector Industry (PPSI, 6.7 million Euros) that uses NBE for grant disbursement. The project is under
         implementation and follows in essence the EPAP II approach financial incentive in the form of 20%
         grant to non SME polluting enterprises and 30% grant to SME which is provided upon the completion
         of pollution abatement project in small and medium enterprises. The EPA funds are paid directly to
         the beneficiary.
        EPF has provided from its own budget an amount of LE 6 million to co-finance environmental
         compliance investment through NBE and the Eco Office of the FEI.

320.    Perhaps just as important is the interest of GoE and the EPAP II banks replicating EPAP II by
borrowing additional funds, even on less favourable terms, for the implementation of pollution abatement using
the same sound financial mechanism established in EPAP II. This follow on phase is expected to commence
in 2015 with a total value in excess of US$180 million.

4.4     Clean Development Mechanism

4.4.1    Purchase of CERs
321.    One of the objectives of the EPAP-II is the promotion of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in
Egypt. The CDM related activity in Egypt had been relatively low due to limited awareness and relatively scant
technical expertise. EEAA operates a CDM unit that is making efforts to raise awareness amongst companies,



                                                    106
develop a pipeline of potential CDM projects and provide technical assistance. However the significant drop
in the CER price makes CDM projects less attractive.

322.    According to the WB PAD at least 7.0 million tons of carbon emission reductions (as CO2 equivalent)
is purchased by the Bank by the end of the project. It was clear during the midterm review that this could not
be achieved as the Bank had no available funding from donors to purchase CERs.

323.     At the time of the midterm review in 2009, the World Bank had signed an Emission Reduction
Purchase Agreement (ERPA) of 370,000 Tons of CO2 equivalent, from the solid waste project implemented
by ONYX in Alexandria and of 350,000 tons of CO2 reduced from the composting plant of ECARU in south
Cairo solid waste project reaching a total of 720,000 tons which are less than the 6 million projected for the
third year of project implementation. However 73 projects are in the pipeline with four having already been
registered (which includes the solid waste project of ONYX) and the “Green Premium” proceeds have been
transferred to the EPF so far. Moreover, most of the projects have been developed with other parties than the
World Bank. As a result the World Bank will not be the buyer of Emission Reductions generated by these
projects.

324.    At the midterm review the Mission and PMU agreed this should not be a measure of the success of the
performance of the Egyptian authorities as the most important is that these projects have indeed been developed
with corresponding global and local benefits. Accordingly, it was agreed to modify the indicator to reflect the
amount of CO2 reduced from the EPAP II subprojects as follows:
•                Year 3 baseline: 10,000 t/y
•                Year 4: 220,000 t/y
•                Year 5: 550,000 t/y

4.4.2        Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in EPAP II
325.     There were six ongoing sub-projects that involved the conversion from mazout to natural gas that
resulted in a significant reduction of CO2 emissions. Estimated total emission reduction, using emission
factors, is 656,336 tpa. A sub-project breakdown is given below.

5 Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building

5.1     Support to sub-project appraisal
326.    To ensure only quality environmental sub-projects are supported by EPAP II, guidelines were
developed to improve the quality of technical documentation submitted and a range of screening and evaluation
tools were introduced (as described below) for the PMU to appraise sub-projects.

5.1.1    Screening and prioritisation
327.      A seven point screening was developed to assess if the sub-projects meets eligibility. A simple yes/no
is solicited on the following points: 1) creditworthiness; 2) located in hot spot; 3) <$100,000; 4) >$15 million;
5) 50% pollutant reduction; 6) achieve compliance after implementation (for sub-project only); and 7) residue
management. No action is taken till a credit worthiness certificate is issued. The sub-project is rejected if any
of the eligibility criteria are not met.

328.     Sub-projects are prioritised based primarily on information from the Application Form and
supplemented from the company or environmental audit when data is incomplete. Criteria used for
prioritisation are: 1) type of industrial sector; 2) pollutant and location; 3) unit cost of pollution abatement; 4)
neighbourhood impacts; 5) productivity gains; 6) improvements towards sector benchmarks; 7)
implementation period; 8) innovative project features; 9) factory contribution; 10) presence of environmental
management systems; and 11) CDM potential.

329.    A score of 1-10 is given for each criteria and when multiplied by the weighting factor gives a total
score. Based on the score sub-projects are categorised as high priority (>600), medium priority (400-600) and
low priority (<400). To September 2014, 78 sub-project applications have been screened and prioritised with
52 being rated high priority, 22 medium priority and 4 low priority. Of the 35 sub-projects being funded 34
have been ranked high priority and 2 medium priority.

330.     A number of tools used to score the prioritisation criteria including air dispersion modelling and cost
benefit analysis are discussed in more detail in Section 4.1.

331.     After prioritization the PMU prepares a Case Summary for which a new format has been developed to
include computation of pollution loads (before and after), unit cost of pollution abatement, comparison with
sector benchmarks and cost-benefit analyses. Information is derived from the Application Form and updated
as additional information is sourced from the Environmental Audit, CAP and EIA as well as site visits.

332.     Thus, screening, prioritization and preparation of case summary form three important milestones of
the review process. Staff at PMU/EEAA use various documents/reports and tools as shown in the figure below
to ensure preparation of quality Case Summaries that help in better formulation of technical agreements and
monitoring strategy.

5.1.2      Sub-project review manual
333.     In order to streamline the Review Process, a Review and Reference Manual was developed. The
Review section explains the various computation and review procedures while the Reference section provides
a compilation of standard or reference datasets and conversion coefficients to ensure that a consistent approach
is followed for the computations and checking. The Manual explains how to compute /check pollution loads
(before and after) and how to arrive at the Unit Cost of Pollution Abatement (UCPA). Steps such as
interpretation of UCPA and comparison with sector benchmarks are detailed to help assess relevance and
quality of the sub-project. Finally, procedure to carry out cost-benefit analyses is explained to help in
ascertaining the financial viability of the investments proposed at sub-project level. To facilitate the
computation of payback period (Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR)), use of P2Finance
is recommended. P2Finance is a Microsoft Excel application developed by Tellus Institute in the US for cost-
benefit analyses of pollution prevention projects. Staff at PMU/EEAA have been trained on the use of this
Manual and the software P2Finance.

5.2      Support to sub-borrowers on technical documents

5.2.1      Application and report guidelines
5.2.1.1       Application form
334.   The Application Form was simplified and explanatory notes added to facilitate completion by the sub-
borrower. It also aided extraction of key data required for sub-project appraisal.
5.2.1.2       Guidelines for technical reports
335.    Guidelines for preparing the environmental audit and compliance action plan were issued in Year 1
taking into consideration that companies would take a leading role in document preparation. Guidelines were
updated in 2009 in light of the quality of reports submitted particularly since: a) much of the information
presented covered the process; b) there was insufficient information concerning emission compliance and sub-
project details and impacts which required frequent clarifications; and c) to remove duplication of process
information between the environmental audit and CAP. The guidelines are now structured in 3 parts as follows:



                                                             109
    Part 1, Compliance Audit                            Factory information, production, process description, emissions and
                                                        compliance
    Part 2, Sub-project Assessment                      Sub-project details, capital and operating costs, compliance and
                                                        pollution impacts, cost benefits
    Part 3, Compliance Action Plan                      Non-compliance issues, costed time bound actions, impacts of each
                                                        action



5.2.2           Technical documents
336.            Support is provided through the EIB and Finnish TA to sub-borrowers on the following issues:
                Technical advice on the proposed intervention including an assessment of pollution load and impacts.

and CCP procurement, by the PMU/TA in advising all EPAP II companies on procurement procedures,
preparation and review of bid documents, guidance through the bid process, bid evaluation and contracting
issues. Assistance has also been provided on shopping although this has been relatively straight forward.

                                                                           112
To September 2014, 104 contracts have been awarded with a breakdown as follows:
       ICB – 2 contracts worth US$32.70m
        CCP – 60 contracts worth US$94.56m
        Shopping – 34 contracts worth US$6.92m
        Direct – 8 contracts worth 29.92m.

339.    In general:
         Procurement templates made available by the PMU/TA were used many of the companies.
        Public sector companies required more support than private sector companies in adhering to EPAP
         II procurement requirements.
        The ICB Standard Bidding Documents were deemed complicated by end users and indeed
         considerable support was provided to National Cement in preparing bids and in bid evaluation.
        Elements of the procurement templates have been adopted by a number of companies to strengthen
         their own procurement procedures, thereby leading to better governance.




5.3    Support on Executive Regulations for Law 9/2009
340.   Law 9 on environment was issued in 2009 to amend parts of Law 4/1994 for the environment. Some
important changes include:
         EEAA to include a requirement for qualitative loads
           Strengthening coastal zone management
           Increasing penalties to double their present values
           Increasing penalties for not properly maintaining the environmental register

                                                    113
            EIA approval:
             o   Requires competent administrative authority to present maps showing the type of industries
                 allowed in the location of the industrial establishment according to environmental loads.
             o   Covers the license period granted to start operation. If the project is delayed beyond this
                 period the environmental approval is voided.

            Compensation and environmental damages are clearly stated as: “Compensation includes
             reparation of conventional and environmental damages and the costs of the restoration of the
             environment to its original state or the rehabilitation thereof”.
            Environmental pollution definition is extended to cover “causing damage to natural habitats or
             living organisms or biodiversity”.
341.   As a result of Law 9, EEAA has prepared new Executive Regulations and emission standards. Support
was provided by EPAP II to the air pollution committee to assist in the revision of air emission standards.

5.4     Improvements to Operation Manual
342.     The following improvements have been made to the Operation Manual:
          Section 4 - Sub-project selection criteria – added screening and prioritisation criteria to aid sub-
             project appraisal as reported above.
            Section 5 - Procurement guidelines – this whole chapter was revised to reflect agreements reached
             in the February 09 co financiers mission, particularly on the use of Competent Commercial
             Practices.
            Annex C, Form 1 – Application Form – simplified to facilitate date entry by the sub-borrwer and
             data recording by the PMU.
            Annex C, Form 2 - Compliance action plan - new guidleines and reporting format produced to
             guide consultants and industry in the preparation of CAPs.
            Annex C, Form 3 - Sub-project case summary – revised to ensure relevant data required for sub-
             project appraisal is being obtained.

5.5     Strengthening of Country Safeguard System

5.5.1    EIA guidelines
343.    EEAA issued revised EIA guidelines in January 2009. Main modifications include: a) improved
Forms A and B to make them more comprehensive (particularly on environmental management plans;
requirement for public consultation for Category C projects; c) updated list of Competent Authorities; and d)
public disclosure of EIAs (piloted through EPAP II).
Regarding the type of projects in each category:
          Many of the workshops and small businesses that were on the A list were removed (such as
             bakeries, juice shops, small grain mills, refrigeration). Special environmental conditions for
             licensing were issued for this group (e.g. ventilation, type of fuel used, noise, etc).
            A number of projects that were on the B list were moved to the A list such as onion dehydration,
             pasta, gum, halva, molasses, oil extraction without refining, spinning and weaving without
             dyeing, and spray painting.

                                                     114
            Some of the rehabilitation projects that were on the B list were moved to the C list due to the
             extent of rehabilitation and environmental impacts
344.     Regarding responsibility for granting approval:
          EMUs are responsible for granting license approval to projects requiring special environmental
             conditions.
            RBOs are responsible for approving A projects
            EIA Central Department responsible for approving B and C projects

5.5.2    EA sector guidelines
345.     EIA guidelines were prepared for the following sectors:
          EIA guidelines for Textile Industry
            EIA guidelines for Petrochemical Industry
             EIA guidelines for Thermal Power Stations
            EIA guidelines for Phosphate and Nitrogenous Fertilizers
            EIA guidelines for Cement Industry

5.5.3    Public disclosure of EIAs for EPAP II sub-projects
346.    All EPAP II sub-projects have been categorised as Form B EIA. To date 29 sub-project EIAs have
been prepared and approved as per the table in Section 5.2.2. Two sub-projects for upgrading small filters to
improve work conditions at Amreyah Cement and Helwan Cement did not require EIAs. Approved EIAs have
been made public on the EEAA website.

5.5.4    Improve compliance monitoring
347.    A CAP decree was issued by EEAA CEO on September 24, 2009 (decree No 608/2009) describing
the responsibilities and tasks of the various departments and entities regarding CAP review and approval.
Guidelines for preparing CAPs were developed and updated. Process description is minimized and non-
compliance issues and their causes are described in more details. Proposed remedial actions are grouped
according to the non-compliance issue being addressed. The revised guidelines have been approved by EEAA.
Training courses on CAP were undertaken in 2009, 2010 and 2013 (see Section 5.7.2).

5.6     Policies and Use of Market Based Instruments

5.6.1    MBIs and Cleaner Production Promotion Plan
348.    As stated in the World Bank Project Appraisal Document, EPAP II is to demonstrate in the Egyptian
context the applicability of the market-based financial/technical approaches to achieve significant pollution
abatement in selected hot spot areas in Cairo and Alexandria. Financing with 20% grant has been the main
market based financial tool used to trigger investments.

349.   As part of the development of a cleaner production promotion plan a wider mix of market based tools
has been investigated. The promotion of such tools by EEAA would lead to improved pollution abatement
and benefit EEAA by reducing efforts/less frequent inspections to follow up companies that have been certified.


                                                     115

                             Industry able to generate revenue




5.6.2   Industrial policies
351.     Under the Finnish supported technical assistance, DHV were required to assess improvements to
industrial environment policies and planning capability. Unfortunately there are no formal industrial policies
within EEAA, however this assignment has provided the opportunity to formalise practices into policy
statements. Six broad policies were proposed (drawing on the industrial pollution control experience of EPAP
II) and the consultant should further evaluate their implications and cost benefits. This work is still in progress.
Proposed policies concerning industrial pollution control include:
           Promote reduction of GHGs, use of cleaner fuels and energy conservation;
             Enforce compliance and where companies require major investment to achieve compliance enter
              into negotiated agreements based on CAPs;
             Engage community action through public disclosure and performance rating schemes;
             Continually review and update emission standards, monitoring and compliance procedures to
              more effectively regulate pollutant discharges.
             Promote cleaner production and market based instruments to industry.

                                                           116
            Improve management of exisitng pollution hot spots and guide new development on an
             environmentally sustainable basis.
352.    It is recommended that implementation mechanisms for each policy are also addressed for EEAA
consideration.

5.7     Training

5.7.1    Guidelines to assist PMU and sub-borrowers
353.     A range of guidelines were developed to improve quality of technical documents submitted, sub-

6 Lessons Learned
360.    EPAP II generated significant demand from industry, was successfully implemented and achieved its
objectives. Implementation period was extended from 5 to 7 years for the World Bank funds as a result of a
number of external factors including the Global Financial Crisis of 2008/09.
Lessons learnt from EPAP II that would be useful for any follow-on project or similar project elsewhere are
summarized below.

361.     The management structure worked fine with EEAA as overall project manager and NBE as the Apex
Bank responsible for co-financier loan disbursement and repayment. Both parties coordinated successfully
and were well supported by the TA. The Steering Committee provided review and guidance although a smaller
core working group with key organisations such as the Industrial Development Authority may be considered
in the future to facilitate a good exchange of information on industrial companies.

362.    Application of market based financial/technical approaches achieved significant pollution load
reduction in hot spot areas. The need for such a financing instrument has been clearly evident in the demand
generated through 130 applications seeking sub-loans of US$493 million. The sub-loan approach was
susceptible to the global financial crisis (sub-project pipeline more than halved during the GFC of 2008/09).

363.       Participating bank agreements between the Apex Bank and participating banks should allow a fair
platform on which to compete in offering sub-loans to companies. In the early stages of EPAP II the
participating banks complained that the Apex Bank was able to offer sub-loans to industry at the same interest
rate charged to the participating banks, thereby providing no incentive for participating banks to market EPAP
II. It is therefore advisable to establish minimum and maximum interest rates that could be offered to industry
thereby allowing fairer competition between the banks but still allowing an interest rate spread depending on
the credit risk of EPAP II applicants to the bank concerned.

364.     Slow disbursement was at times a contentious issue, however it should be recognised that time is
required to market, identify, develop and implement sub-projects and hence any disbursement is therefore
invariably skewed to the back-end of the project. The process can also be affected by lengthy procurement
procedures such as ICB and other external factors as was the case in EPAP II. The tranche transfer approach,
used by EIB and AFD, proved to be quicker and more effective in transferring funds to the Apex Bank than
the replenishment system of the World Bank and JICA.

365.     Procurement process served the project well, providing transparency and accountability but at times
proved difficult for sub-borrowers requiring significant PMU/TA time to ensure bid documents and bid process
met EPAP II requirements. Areas of weakness are often in the preparation of technical specifications and
functional guarantees and in the understanding of many commercial and contractual terms. More use could
also be made of a prequalification process or limited competitive bidding to reduce the burden on sub-
borrowers in having to respond/evaluate a large number of bidders. The ICB procurement process was
considered excessive by sub-borrowers for the type of sub-projects implemented and became a deterrent to
further sub-project borrowing.

366.    Public sector companies can be an enigma for projects like EPAP II. On the one hand they are major
polluters that require assistance while on the other hand they are slow to respond, lack credit worthiness and
require additional TA to develop the necessary technical and project documents. In addition there is often the
question mark over the ability to maintain the sub-project in the short term and the long term sustainability of
the industrial establishment itself.

367.   Use of concessional finance (grant) has proved effective in triggering investment in pollution
abatement with EPAP II accounting for only 55% of total investment cost plus there was additional self-

                                                     123
financed investment on other agreed CAP actions. While some companies indicated they would eventually
implement the project the availability of grants (plus pressure from EEAA) has hastened their decision to invest
now. Unit cost of pollution abatement figures could be used in the future to develop a differential grant scheme
where more grant funds are given to sectors with high pollution abatement costs and less grant funds provided
to projects where the unit cost of pollution abatement is low and where financial benefits are significant (e.g.
payback period of less than 2 years).

368.     Exclusion of separate works contracts and the restriction on civil works expenditure for EPAP II
sub-projects became a limiting factor in supporting some industrial wastewater treatment sub-projects where
the civil works component could be up to 50% of the total cost. For future projects such civil works expenditure
should be included as eligible sub-project expenditure.

369.   Carrot (concessional finance) and stick (enforcement) approach has been the most effective form
of marketing EPAP II and responsible for nearly the entire project pipeline. Unlike cleaner production projects
where the main drivers are productivity improvements and financial savings, EPAP II is straight out
compliance. Increased enforcement is therefore critical in getting companies to apply.

370.     Compliance procedures – EEAA requirements in some ways are quite strict; any sample above
permissible limits means non-compliance. Infringements are required to be rectified within 60 days otherwise
fines may be applied. This should be a bonanza for EPF however the level of fines paid into the EPF remains
low as enforcement remains weak. Consideration should be given to improve compliance procedures and the
use of a pollution load permit system instead of concentrations that will provide a more balanced and rigorous
approach between regulator and polluter.

371.     Limited opportunities in Alexandria existed to make a marked improvement to water quality in hot
spot areas. This is in part due to the huge volume of drainage water emanating from south of Alexandria that
is discharged into Lake Maryout and subsequently pumped into El Mexx bay at the rate of 6-7 million m3 per
day at levels above permissible standards. Selected opportunities were targeted to phase out phenol discharges
into Lake Maryout, dissolved salts and chlorine into El Mexx Bay and to reduce ammonia in Abu Qir bay.
Barriers to the opportunities are companies that are not creditworthy or reluctant to borrow.

372.     The ICR mission met with the European Investment Bank and the Japan International Cooperation
Agency. Both echoed the Bank team in reporting on a smooth project implementation period with involved
project stakeholders and a high performing PMU, both in terms of technical capacity and project management
skills. There was good coordination between donors and other counterparts, and the project has built significant
capacity both at the PMUs, the industries, as well as the co-financiers. While the challenges from the external
environment were many, the project was highly successful and achieved set objectives. Yet, the largest impact
is winning the “hearts and minds” of all stakeholders, including both the regulatory agency and the polluting
industries.

373.      The ICR mission also met with two participatory Banks, including the National Bank of Egypt and the
Commercial international Bank. Both Banks agreed that EPAP II had established a new line of business for
them, and that pollution abatement loans to the industrial sector presents a huge potential, as the industrial
sector comprises roughly 40 percent of the loan portfolio. Some projects, particularly on energy efficiency,
which were not eligible under EPAP II went on to take out commercial loans. Similarly, demand from
environmental services companies was strong, such as for solid waste treatment plants, but these were not
eligible.
