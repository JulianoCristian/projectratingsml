and has these objectives: to foster economic\n            development and industrialization and facilitate policies of\n            deregulation and decentralization by upgrading the quality\n            of professional, managerial, and science and technology\n            staff in key government ministries and agencies both at\n            local and national levels and, on a limited scale, the\n            private sector. The project comprises the following two\n            components. The first component is a Fellowships and\n            Training Component which consists of three subcomponents\n            which will provide domestic and overseas degree and\n            non-degree fellowships to professional, managerial, and\n            science and technology staff of key government ministries\n            and agencies at national and local levels; overseas\n            fellowships in appropriate professional, managerial and\n            technical subjects not yet available in Indonesia; improve\n            reentry procedures for the utilization of past, present and\n            future fellowship holders; and facilitate overseas degree\n            and non-degree programs of private and public firms by\n            making available such services as testing, placement and\n            monitoring. The second component will assist the National\n            Steering Team for Overseas Training (NASTOT) in playing a\n            more effective role in formulating policy, coordinating and\n            monitoring the civil service fellowships and the pilot\n            programs for fresh graduates, and undertaking the studies to\n            lead to development of a possible new merit-based fellowship scheme."}, "docdt": "1994-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
