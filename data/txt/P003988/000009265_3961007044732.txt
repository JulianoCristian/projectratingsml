MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
A SECOND PROFESSIONAL HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$69.0 million to
help finnce a Second Professional Human Resource Development Project. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace.
2.         Country Background. Indonesia has achieved an impressive long term
GDP growth rate, averaging over 6 percent annually in the past 25 years. During the
1980s, there was substantial industral development with non-oil manufactung expanding
at an average rate of over 12 percent per year. Nearly 80 percent of the increase in
exports came from low-wage, low-technology industries, such as textfiles and footwear, and
natunal resources-based mamnfactures, such as wood or basic metal products. It is
generally agreed dtat Indonesia cannot maintain its export growth without fiuther stuctural
reform and a shift in the economy toward higher value-added manufactures.
3.         To sustain growth under the Second 25-year Long-Term Plan 1994-2018
(PJPr II) will require well educated and highly skilled professional, managerial, scientific
and technical staff throughout the economy, both in the public and private sectors. Further
structural transformation will put great demands on both govermment and industry. The
skill needs in key ministries will be greatly affected as the role of goverment continues
to change from one of regulation and control to tat of implementing policies of
deregulation and developing policies that encourage and facilitate private sector growth.
Government officials will be increasingly called upon to administer new government
policies, such as new trade regulations and changed tax laws, with an increasingly
sophisticated private sector. Decentalization of govermment planning and the move toward
provision of government services on a demand-driven basis will require increasing skills
aid knowledge by governmenm officials at the local level. Industry will face more complex
government policies and a more open internationally competitive environment. The shift
toward a more open economy and higher value-added mactures will also require an
industrial system with a strengthening technology base and a substanial base of well
educated and trained science and technology (S&T) manpower. Such persons must be
capable of keeping abreast of scientific and technological innovations world-wide and able
to, and in a position to, adapt advanced technologies for industrial development in
Indonesia in an enviromentally responsible way.
4.         Government Subsector Strategy. Regarding higher education and higher
level professional human resources the Government is following a dual strategy:
(a) supporting the growth and qwlitative improvement of domestic undergraduate and
graduate educaton in the long run and (b) meeting immediate shortages through
fellowships in the short run. The Government's fellowship policy, often assisted by Bank



-2 -
financing, has been to upgrade the current stock of manpower. in the broader huan
resource sector, major government themes to increase the quality of human resources and
a more efficient use of those resources have been laid out in all tiree major government
planning documents: (a) 1993 Guidelines of State Policies (GBHN); (b) the Sixth Five-
Year Development Plan 1994 - 1998 ,Repelita VI); and (c) PJPT II. In these plans, the
Government aims to strengthen its capacity in making and managing policies and providing
public services at national and local levels. The Govermnent has issued three Government
Decrees in April 1994 on education and training for professional development designed to
improve the quality of civil service performance through better training and career
development for staff. The Government intends to support the successful implementation
of these policies by improving the capabilities of professional, technical, and managerial
staff using overseas and domestic training programs.
5.         The Government is promoting the increase of research and development
(R&D) in both public and private sectors, and aims to increase the share of R&D financed
by the private sector considerably, from the current 20 percent, by the end of PJPT II.
The immediate objectives during Repelita VI are improving the capability to utilize,
develop, adapt and keep abreast of S&T by increasing technology transfer capability,
supported by a better quality of human resources, and encouraging participatory research
between the public and the private sectors. While the long-term goals for S&T
development have been to focus on the private sector, short-term strategies have been to
strengthen govermment S&T institutions, particu!arly the non-minsterial government
research institutes (LPNDs) by building up the stock of high level technical manpower in
those institutes, and putting an emphasis on their linkages to industry.
6.         Project Objectives. The proposed project is a follow-up of the ongoing
PHRDP I and has these objectives: to foster economic development and industrialization
and facilitate policies of deregulation and decentralization by upgrading the quality of
professional, managerial and S&T staff in key government ministres and agencies both
at local and national levels and, on a limited scale, in the private sector.
7.         Project Description. The proposed project would comprise the fo}lowing
two components: (a) the Fellowships and Training component; and (b) the National
Steering Team for Overseas Training (NASTOT) component;
(a) The Fellowships and Training Component (US$94.3 million including
contingencies) consisting of three subcomponents with a similar range of
activities but for different client groups and subject areas: (i) Overseas
Training Office (OTO); (ii) Ministry of Finance (MOF); and (iii) Science
and Technology for Industrial Development (STAID).   The three
subcomponents would: (a) provide domestic and, when suitable programs
are not available in Indonesia, overseas degree and non-degree fellowships
to professional, managerial, and S&T staff of key government ministries and
agencies at national and local levels; (b) provide overseas fellowships in
appropriate professional, managerial and technical subjects not yet available
in sufficient quality in Indonesia to fresh Sl (Bachelor's degree) graduates,
on a pilot basis; (c) improve reentry procedures for the utilization of past,
present, and future fellowship holders; and (d) faciltate overseas degree and



non-degree programs of pnvate and public firms by making available such
services as testing, placement, and monitoring; and
(b)   The National Steering Team  for Overseas Tralig  (NASTOI)
Component (US$0.7 millon incldg contingencies) would help NASTOT
play a more effective role in formulaing policy, coordinating and monitoring
the civil service fellowships and the pilot programs for fresh SI graduates,
and underking the studies to lead to development of a possible new merit-
based national fellowship scheme.
8.         To help achieve the objectives, the proposed project would finance
fellowships and training programs, consultant services, and research and studies. Total
project cost is estimated at US$95.0 million, of which US$57.4 million would be in
foreign exchange. The project includes US$14.3 million in carryover costs from PHERDP
I to support fellows now in the process of completing their degrees. The proposed Bank
loan would cover about 73 percent of the total cost, excludig taxes and dutes;
Goverment of Indonesia would finance the rest. Schedule A shows the breakdown of
project costs and the financing plan. Amounts and methods of procurement, allocation of
loan proceeds and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13537-IND dated November 3, 1994 is
being distrbuted separately.
9.         Project  pl on. At the national level, NASTOT, chaired by the
Vice Chairman of National Development Plamning Board (BAPPENAS) and established
under the on-gomg PHRDP I, would continue to facilitate the overall implemeion of
the project and would be responsible for policy formulation, coordination and monitorig.
It would also coordinate and monitor the pilot programs for fresh SI graduates. The
Felowships and Training compone  would be managed by OTO, MOF, and STAID
Project Implemenion Units (PIUs) using the strucures and many of the experienced staff
developed under PHRDP I. STAID is coordiated and managed by the Deputy Chairmar.
for Administration of BPPT to whom the PIU reports. A commte consistng of the tree
fellowship implmenttion uits plus the D ictora  General of Higher Education would
be responsible for idenfying appropriate fields of study to be supported and criteria and
procedures to implement the pilot scheme for fresh SI graduates.
10.        Project Sustainabit. Several ftures in the proposed project should
icrease the prospects that such a program would be sustained. Ffrst, the shift toward
more use of domestic universities, where appriate programs exist, and use of Link
programs are not only highly cost-effective methods of investing in grduate education, but
also would help improve existng graduate education for the next wave of students. A
second feature enhancing sustainabilt is the move toward a wider merit-based national
fellowship scheme serving the entire economy, not just the public sector. Third, the
definite changes that Se various fellowship components have made and are proposing to
make under the proposed PHRDP II toward beter utilization of returnees are all designed
to expand and sustain the economic and social impact of these expensive but potentally
very importamt investme  in human capital.

11.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. Major lessons learned
from the ongoing PHRDP I, as well as the Science and Technology Training Project (Loan
2599-IND), are the importance of: (a) a balanced strategy for high level human resource
development, which supports an increased supply of high level manpower available to the
entire economy, not just the public sector; (b) more use of appropriate domestic graduate
education, which would not only be more cost-effective, but also beneficial for the
development of such programs because it would provide them with additional funds as well
as qualified and motivated students; (c) improved utilization of recent fellowship returnees;
(d) more use of self-finan&ng among the LPNDs, which make them more operationally
flexible and responsive to the needs of private industries; and (e) improved institational
arrangements for the overall coordination of graduate degree training for a}l civil servants,
which is not being effectively addressed by the reconstituted NASTOT. The above lessons
have been incorporated into the design of the proposed project.
12.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. As highlighted in the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy for Indonesia which was presented to the Executive Directors on April
12, 1994, human resource development is a key objective. In line with this objective, the
Bank is supporting a higher education portfolio consisting of: (a) well-focused investment
projects that address areas of specific weaknesses within a long-term policy framework,
such as the recently approved University Research for Graduate Education (URGE) project
(Loan 3754-IND) which focuses on the weaknesses of university research and graduate
education; and (b) sectoral investment projects, such as the ongoing Second Higher
Education Development Project.
13.        The proposed PHRDP II focuses on specific weaknesses, namely the lack of
professional, managerial, and technical personnel necessary to staff and manage the
changig economy to sustain growth in Indonesia. PHRDP I and other earlier related
projects have focused on education and taining for civil servants. The proposed PHRDP
II would conclude the Bank's support for the special program for civil servants and
provide a basis for planning a new type of competitive national overseas fellowship
program for individuals to serve the needs of the entire economy. As such it would
complement the URGE project, which includes over 900 open merit-based fellowships for
fresh SI graduates to attend domestic graduate programs in order to improve the quality
of domestic graduate programs and to augment the flows of high level manpower to the
economy. Furthermore, the civil service fellowships in the proposed PHRDP I have been
prepared within the framework of the Bank's larger involvement in Indonesia's higher
education and traimng strategies and civil service reforms. In particular, the project would
call for utiling domestic graduate education for upgrading civil servants where
appropriate programs exist and developing realistic strategies for more efficient utilizadon
of high level manpower in the public sector.
14.        Actions Agreed.  During negotiatons, the Government provided the
following assurances that:
(a)   criteria and procedures, acceptable to the Bank, by which applicants would
be directed to a domestic or overseas graduate degree program would be
provided to the Bank by April 30, 1995;



- 5 -
(b)   procedures for the selection of candidates and placement of returnees,
acceptable to the Bank, under the fresh domestic SI graduate program would
be established by April 30, 1995;
(c)  (i) a study on the establishment of a competitive national fellowship scheme
would be completed by September 30, 1997; and (ii) the major findings and
recommendations of the study would be discussed with the Bank and the
Bank's comments and suggestions would be incorporated in the final report,
as appropriate;
(d)   consultans would be selected by April 30, 1995 under TORs acceptable to
the Bank;
(e)   administrative arrangements for overseas fellowship management, acceptable
to the Bank, would be completed by April 30, 1995;
(f)  the mid-term evaluation would be conducted by September 30, 1997, in
accordance with TORs acceptable to the Bank, and the report on the findings
and recommendations would be furnished to the Bank by December 31,
1997;
(g)  (i) impact studies would be completed not later than September 30, 1997,
March 31, 1999, and December 31, 1999; and
(h)  technical audits, would start to be carried out on April 1, 1996, and would
continue to be implemented each year thereafter, in accordance with TORs
and in a manner acceptable to the Bank, and the copies of the audit reports
would be furnished to the Bank for review and comments not later than July
I in each year.
15.        Environmental Aspects.  No negative environmental impacts of the
proposed project are expected. Fellows, particularly those studying abroad, would be
introduced to environmental studies and would study environmentally sound practices
within their fields. The net environmental impact would thus be positive.
16.        Impact on Women. The fellowships and training programs have set
separate targets for the coverage of female participants, which are 25 percent for OTO,
20 percent for MOF, and 15 percent for STAID. In each case, the fellowship target for
women is set at a higher ratio than the percentage of women in suitable positions in the
respective component agencies.
17.        Benefits. The main benefits are: (a) improved quality of professional staff
in key govermnent mimstsries and agencies at national and local levels through a variety
of fellowship and training programs (782 overseas fellows, including 425 currently
studying abroad under the ongoing PHRDP I, 160 overseas non-degree trainees, 244
domestic fellows, and 1,210 domestic non-ee trainees); (b) a substantial stock of
individuals (90 fellows), chosen on a merit basis through the pilot programs, with overseas
graduate education in subjects not yet available in sufficient quality in Indonesia;



-6-
(c) iucreased access to fellowship management services provided to the private sector by
the project; and (d) enhanced utliation of returned fellows.
18.        RItsks. The main project risks are related to: (a) the low utilization of the
retuns of fellowship programs due to the inefficient mangement of the civil service;
and (b) the capacity of NASTOT to coordinate and monitor the felowships and training
activities. Measures to alleviate these potentil risk are included in the project design.
19.        RecommendatIon. Iam satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
