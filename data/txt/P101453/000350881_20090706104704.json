"Final(revised)", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "On April 13, 2009, the Inspection Panel\n            received a request for inspection related to the\n            Yemen's Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant\n            (IRDPG) Project. The request was submitted by Mr. Abdelkader\n            Ali Abdallah and Mr. Yahya Saleh Mohsen, both residents of\n            Sana'a, Yemen, on their behalf and on behalf of the\n            Yemen observatory for human rights, a local non-governmental\n            organization (NGO). The request claims, inter alia, that the\n            Bank failed to comply with principles of transparency and\n            disclosure of information with respect to a development\n            policy operation for institutional reform in Yemen, which\n            they contend will produce negative effects on wages,\n            employment and poverty reduction. The panel registered the\n            request on April 20, 2009 and management submitted its\n            response on May 19, 2009. The panel observes that the\n            Requesters raise three main issues in relation to the\n            Bank's obligations as per requirements related to\n            consultation and participation in the relevant policies.\n            Firstly, the Bank was not forthcoming when the Requesters\n            asked for a copy of the program document (PD) in Arabic.\n            Secondly, the Requesters asserted that the preparation\n            process of the IRDPG did not give civil society\n            organizations and other non-governmental stakeholder's\n            adequate opportunities to debate and potentially influence\n            the design of the project supported by the grant. Thirdly,\n            they allege that the reforms listed in the project will not\n            be beneficial, arguing that important elements of it are\n            likely to result in increased levels of poverty, with\n            reference in particular to the removal of fuel subsidies and\n            a possible increase in taxes as a result of the proposed\n            income tax reforms. The panel recommends that the Board of\n            Executive Directors approves an investigation into the\n            matters raised in the request for inspection. Considering\n            that management has provided a translation into Arabic of\n            the program document and thus resolved that issue, the\n            investigation will not focus on this matter."}, "docdt": "2009-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
