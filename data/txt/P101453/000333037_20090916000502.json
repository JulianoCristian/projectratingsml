The DPPR was\n            developed through an intensive consultation process,\n            engaging a large group of stakeholders including in\n            provinces, from late 2004 to mid-2006. In this context, the\n            IRDPG aims to help carry forward selected priority reforms\n            emerging from the DPPR, some of which are building on\n            processes launched as early as the late 1990s. The IRDPG is\n            also building on an extensive earlier program of analytical\n            work and other Bank assistance, which has benefited from\n            extensive consultations with a variety of stakeholders. This\n            note aims to: (i) take stock of progress to date in\n            implementing the action plan outlined in the management\n            response to the inspection panel for the IRDPG; and (ii)\n            specify further actions that management aims to take in the\n            coming period in this context. This action plan is a part of\n            the broader Bank-wide effort to further strengthen the\n            effectiveness of the Bank's engagement in fragile\n            States such as Yemen. This effort aims to help accelerate\n            economic and social progress in the poorest country in the\n            Middle East and North Africa (MNA) region and in a fragile\n            state with a complex socio-political environment."}, "docdt": "2009-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
