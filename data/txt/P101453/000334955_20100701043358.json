Overall, management is satisfied that\n            significant progress has been made on all key activities\n            which were part of the action plan. These included: (a)\n            engaging a dialogue with the organization that submitted the\n            request; (b) strengthening Middle East and North Africa\n            (MNA) practices with regards to disclosure, translation, and\n            consultations in line with applicable Bank policies; (c)\n            monitoring risks associated with the implementation of the\n            IRDPG in consultation with stakeholders; and (d) further\n            strengthening relevant participation processes in support of\n            the World Bank program in Yemen.
