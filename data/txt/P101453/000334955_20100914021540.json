The request was submitted by Mr. Abdelkader Ali\n            Abdallah and Mr. Yahya Saleh Mohsen, both residents of\n            Sana'a, Yemen, on their behalf and on behalf of the\n            Yemen Observatory for Human Rights, a local Non-Governmental\n            Organization. The request claims, inter alia, that the Bank\n            failed to comply with principles of transparency and\n            disclosure of information with respect to a development\n            policy operation for institutional reform in Yemen, which\n            they contend will produce negative effects on wages,\n            employment and poverty reduction. The panel registered the\n            request on April 20, 2009. On May 19, 2009, Management\n            submitted its response to the request for inspection, which\n            includes an action plan \"to follow-up on the issues\n            raised by the requesters.\" Management stated that it\n            agrees with the Requesters on the importance of partnership\n            with stakeholders as a substantial factor to achieve\n            sustainable development and to improve transparency and\n            accountability in development. Management stated that it is\n            satisfied that the requirement under OP 8.60 which requires\n            the Bank to \"advise borrowing countries to consult with\n            and engage the participation of key stakeholders\" was\n            met. As for the social impact of measures supported under\n            the IRDPG, Management stated that the measures supported\n            under the IRDPG are expected to have a positive social and\n            poverty impact. The Requesters raised some concerns and\n            questions regarding the feedback to civil society\n            organizations on the outcome of various consultative\n            processes. They welcomed the opportunity to participate in\n            discussions pertaining to the design of a second phase of\n            the Program, especially regarding its impacts on the poorer\n            segments of society. The panel has informed Management of\n            the Requesters' concerns and questions, and after\n            receiving concurrence from the Requesters, has shared their\n            written feedback with Management. On September 8, 2010,\n            Management sent the panel its response to these concerns."}, "docdt": "2010-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
