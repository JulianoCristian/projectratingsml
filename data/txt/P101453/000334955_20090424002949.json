Mr.\n            Abdelkader Ali Abdallah and Mr. Yahya Saleh, both residents\n            of Sana'a, Yemen, submitted the request on their behalf\n            and on behalf of the Yemen observatory for human rights. The\n            request claims, inter alia, that the Bank has failed to\n            comply with principles of transparency and disclosure of\n            information with respect to a development policy operation\n            for institutional reform in Yemen, which they contend will\n            produce negative effects on wages, employment and poverty\n            reduction. The requesters state \"according to the World\n            Bank, the implementation of the Institutional Reform Program\n            in Yemen will lead to soaring prices and the increased\n            suffering of the poor in the Yemeni society. Poverty rate,\n            currently running around 45 percent will increase by 9.2\n            percent up to a total of 54.2 percent.\" They add that\n            the program will reduce wages by 1.6 percent of the gross\n            domestic product (GDP). The requesters question these\n            reforms stating that they will result in an \"increase\n            in poverty and unemployment.\" After receiving the\n            Management response, the Panel will, determine whether the\n            request meets the eligibility criteria and shall make a\n            recommendation to the Executive Directors as to whether the\n            matter should be investigated.\" The request has been\n            assigned IPN request number RQ09/05."}, "docdt": "2009-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
