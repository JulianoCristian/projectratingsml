These inputs will be complemented by\n            construction of additional classrooms required for the\n            countrywide implementation of the new six-year system, under\n            a forthcoming AFDB-assisted project.  Specifically, the\n            project involves: (1) restructuring the basic education\n            system; (2) upgrading the quality of primary school\n            teachers; and (3) increasing the availability of textbooks,\n            teaching materials and school supplies.  Further to this,\n            the project entails (4) improving education sector management."}, "docdt": "1987-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
