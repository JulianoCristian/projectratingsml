                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to advance smallholder agriculture commercialization along value chains through (a) providing resources for working capital and
                         term lending for capital investments in productive and marketing assets/activities to improve productivity, quality and efficiency of supply chains; (b) targeted
                         investments into public/collective goods, such as feeder roads and into key public service functions; and (c) building market, technical and managerial knowledge of
                         farmer groups and producer organizations through extension.
                         The project's central aim is to strengthen the smallholders' access to markets and the competitiveness of functioning and emerging agricultural commodities. The
                         project would therefore focus on high potential agricultural areas and will adopt a value chain approach to make sure that all levels of the chains are operating efficiently
                         and creating increased value added.

                         The project continues to achieve steady progress in implementation during the review period and since the last mission. Disbursement up to date totaled SDR18.862 million
                         representing 73.39% of the total project budget and an increase of 9% since the last ISR. A new withdrawal application is being processed. Project contribution to the PDO targets
                         continues to be satisfactory and on-track. Project is expected to be fully disbursed by project closing. A category reallocation of the project (second order restructuring) has been
                         drafted at the request of the government and was approved by the Bank on November 27, 2012. Project has already reached the targeted beneficiary number expected at project

                         closing and about one-fourth of whom are women beneficiaries. The small holder households growing the targeted commodities are at 975,661. The estimate for 2011/12 season for
                         the sum of target commodities produced is above the expected project target of 405,800MT. The increase in commercial export products is smaller, which can be attributed to
                         adverse policy issues such as ad-hoc export bans, over emphasize on maize products and government subsidy programs (Food Reserve Agency (FRA) - setting a high price and
                         guarantee of purchase for maize and Farmer input support program (FISP) that continues to allocate more inputs to maize than the other crops included in the revised FISP.

                         Project component level implementation progress continue to be satisfactory. The Market Improvement and Innovation Facility (MIIF) of the Support to Farmers and Agribusiness
                         Enterprises (SFAE) component's MIIF subproject portfolio of 20 subprojects in 17 districts have reached out to 33,690 direct beneficiaries in multiple value chains (fisheries, dairy,
                         poultry, cotton, tobacco, avocado, IPM, vegetable soups, irrigation, soybean, organic farming, composting, and Jatropha - bio-diesel , etc). The MIIF subprojects have a commitment
                         level of US$2,232,973 and are disbursing at the subproject level with upfront allocations of matching commitments from the subproject beneficiaries. Subgrant beneficiary
                         contributions to subprojects now stand at $618,945. Pipeline management and subproject approval process is functioning well with 5 more subprojects ready for approval.
                         Subprojects have engaged in more than 25 technologies/ innovations generated and/or adopted by sub Projects, of which several technologies have the potential for scaling-up. The
                         MIIF facility administration by the NCO-MIIF team continues to be satisfactory. MIIF continues to be engaged in selected value chain discussions and assessments to allow for for
                         future funding of potential sub-projects from the ministry either through other donor funded projects or NGOs. Under Rural Roads Improvement Facility (RRIF), using Output and
                         Performance based Road Contract (OPRC) contracting methodology, 630 km of rural roads have been rehabilitated and are in maintenance phase in Chipata, Katete and Choma
                         districts. The road network in Choma district which were rehabilitated and are ready for handover for full maintenance was expected to be formally done in November but the event
                         is now postponed to early 2013. The volume of traffic on the roads rehabilitated and maintained using OPRC contracting methodology has almost doubled and is showing impact
                         on agricultural activities. An impact survey has been conducted in OPRC districts and the data collected are now being cleaned, verified and analyzed. The impact assessment
                         report is expected to be ready by the end of the year. The institutional capacity building and strengthening /training program of the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) team under
                         the third subcomponent (Supply Chain Credit Facility (SCCF) has progressed sufficiently for the program performance to be improved and maintained. The financial management
                         software is in use and DBZ is successfully managing the Enterprise development project credit line successfully. The participation of DBZ in the project Steering Committee has
                         helped in exploring how to provide financing to some of the new MIIF subproject beneficiaries engaged in agricultural value chain activities.

                         Under the institutional development component, most activities are completed or are being completed while other activities are also showing progress. There are no significant lags in
                         implementation at the activity level. Activities in the Cotton Development Trust are almost complete (functioning of the irrigation system and weir, and equipment and storage
                         warehouse capacity) allowing for quality cotton planting seeds production. Seed Certification and Control Institute (SCCI) has completed the following activities and the Choma SCCI
                         is fully functional while the fully-equipped biotechnology laboratory also recently became active. ZARI continues to perform its activities well ((strengthening border operations with
                         agribusiness dept., carry out inspections and fumigations to meet trade standards, pest and disease surveys etc). The Agriculture Market Information Center (AMIC) radio program
                         scaled out to operations in Eastern province continue to be satisfactory where Radio Chikaya (Lundazi), Radio Breeze (Chipata) and radio PASME (Petauke) have partnered to
                         disseminate market information. The Semi-annual Technical progress report for the period January to July 2012 has been submitted although the current crop season data needs
                         updating with actuals prior to the next mission.
