                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to advance smallholder agriculture commercialization along value chains through (a) providing resources for working
                         capital and term lending for capital investments in productive and marketing assets/activities to improve productivity, quality and efficiency of supply chains;
                         (b) targeted investments into public/collective goods, such as feeder roads and into key public service functions; and (c) building market, technical and
                         managerial knowledge of farmer groups and producer organizations through extension.

                         The project's central aim is to strengthen the smallholders' access to markets and the competitiveness of functioning and emerging agricultural commodities.
                         The project would therefore focus on high potential agricultural areas and will adopt a value chain approach to make sure that all levels of the chains are
                         operating efficiently and creating increased value added.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project made steady progress towards reaching the PDO. Most key indicator targets are on track while a few activities are close to completion. More than 22 technologies and

                         innovations have been generated and or adopted by Market Improvement and Innovation Facility (MIIF) financed sub Projects with an expected outreach of about 29,180 small holder
                         farmers during this period. MIIF continues to maintain a pipeline of potential sub-projects in the key value chains for funding in the next couple of years. Implementation progress of
                         the Rural Roads Improvement Facility (RRIF) sub-component is satisfactory due to close and regular implementation support/ supervision. The quality of the completed road works
                         improved significantly due to higher quality of Client oversight (both RDA and NCO) and works supervision, as well as a continued better understanding of the monetary impact of
                         poor construction quality in an output and performance (OPRC) contract environment. More than 640 kilometers of rural feeder roads have been rehabilitated and improved (57%
                         achievement of the final target). Capacity to increase quality cotton planting seeds has been strengthened at the Cotton Development Trust (CDT). in the 2010 season, 42.6 tons of
                         pre-basic cotton planting seeds, 45.8 tons of basic cotton seeds, and 26.6 tons of certified seeds were produced at CDT, which meets the national demand (both commercial and
                         small holder cotton growers). Yields of seed cotton have also improved from 1000kg/ha in 2006/07 season to 2300 kg/ha in 2009/10 season due to ADSP supported activities related
                         to: use of better IPM practices; soil improvement with lime and green manuring as required; mechanization in land preparation and use and harvesting; and supplementary irrigation.
                         Project is expected to participate in the E-ISR plus initiative for the second year; survey questionnaire updating has commenced.
