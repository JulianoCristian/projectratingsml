                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to advance smallholder agriculture commercialization along value chains through (a) providing resources for working capital and
                         term lending for capital investments in productive and marketing assets/activities to improve productivity, quality and efficiency of supply chains; (b) targeted
                         investments into public/collective goods, such as feeder roads and into key public service functions; and (c) building market, technical and managerial knowledge of
                         farmer groups and producer organizations through extension.
                         The project's central aim is to strengthen the smallholders' access to markets and the competitiveness of functioning and emerging agricultural commodities. The
                         project would therefore focus on high potential agricultural areas and will adopt a value chain approach to make sure that all levels of the chains are operating efficiently
                         and creating increased value added.

                         The project continued to achieve steady progress during review period since last mission. Disbursement up to December ending totaled $23.8 million representing 64% of total
                         project budget. Contribution to PDO targets was satisfactory. Project reached 116,775 beneficiaries representing 51775 more than what was expected to be achieved at end of
                         project period. By the end of last year, the target commodities (sum of) produced totaled 298,692 MT representing about 73% of end of project target. However the smallholder
                         households growing the targeted commodities increased only marginally by 1.1% from 927,251 in 2005 to 937,373 in 2011. This small increase in commercial export products is

                         partly attributed to the over emphasize on maize both from the government subsidy programs (setting a high price and guarantee of purchase for maize and input allocations to maize
                         grown by such households).

                         Overall component level progress was significant during this period. The Market Improvement and Innovation Facility (MIIF) and Rural Roads Improvement Facility (RRIF), continue
                         to perform positively. The MIIF subproject portfolio of 20 subprojects have reached out to 33,690 beneficiaries in multiple value chains (fisheries, dairy, poultry, cotton, tobacco,
                         avacado, IPM, vegetable soups, irrigation, soybean, organic farming, composting, Jatropha for bio diesel , etc). The MIIF facility therefore has reached 84.2% of the end of project
                         target of 40,000 under this facility. Subprojects have engaged in more than 25 technologies/ innovations generated and/or adopted by sub Projects. MIIF continue to have a strong
                         PCN pipeline (8 potentials for financing valued at $1,116,900). PCN evaluation and approval process from MIIF Administrator, Technical Review Panel (TRP), up to project's National
                         Steering Committee (Sub committee) endorsement is happening smoothly. MIIF administrator continued sensitization activities with agribusinesses, participated in agriculture
                         commercial shows, and distributed brochures to potential clients. A video was produced on MIIF subprojects in the Eastern Province and was shared with all stakeholders at annual
                         ADSP conference in December 2011. At the end of the 4-year contract of current MIIF administrator (December 2011), the MIIF administration responsibility was transferred back to
                         the newly created MIIF unit within NCO with two additional contracted staff (Field coordinator and Agri business specialist); opportunity for sustainability of a grant office in the
                         ministry can now be explored at end of ADSP. The MIIF implementation has not been affected by this change of implementation arrangement. Subgrant beneficiary contributions to
                         subprojects now stand at $618,945. Activities included: collaboration with private sector partners, facilitating TA to applicants of PCNs and Full Business Plans (FBPs), sub-project
                         field monitoring visits and TA during implementation of MIIF. A comprehensive review of sub-project M&E framework has improved deliverables, information flow, and results
                         monitoring. MIIF continued to maintain a solid pipeline of potential sub-projects in key value chains for future funding.

                         Under RRIF, about 850 kms of rural road network has been improved, which represents 75% of end of project target of 1,133km in 5 districts in two Provinces Southern and Eastern).
                         The volume of traffic in the roads rehabilitated and maintained using Output and Performance based Road Contract (OPRC) contracting methodology almost doubled (an increase of
                         96%; last ISR reporting was that traffic scores stood at 92% increase) from 52 vehicles per day in 2007 to 103 vehicles per day in 2010 (2011 data still being cleaned). Based on
                         discussions during second annual ADSP Conference (December 2011), National Coordination Office (NCO) was tasked to initiate discussions with RDA, Rural Roads Unit, and
                         relevant provincial and district level Development Committees to prepare the road map for sustainability of rural roads maintenance under OPRC contracts at end of ADSP (by 2014);
                         ADSP exit strategy development; and inclusion of budget for year 2014 under provincial road budget. RRIF is also engaged in hiring a consultant to conduct the first follow-up impact
                         assessment survey. The TORs for this survey benefited from input from PREM gender and DEC economists teams; the latter was earlier involved in designing the baseline survey
                         of RRIF in ADSP. The third subcomponent of Support to Farmers and Agribusiness Enterprises (SFAE) continued to be positive for the Supply Chain Credit Facility (SCCF)'s training
                         activities. Study tours and targeted training to strengthen institutional capacity building has been successfully completed and the financial management software is currently used.
                         The SCCF implementer the Development Bank of Zambia continue to manage two Enterprise Development Project (EDP) credit lines (previously Bank funded) and has shared
                         financial reports with the NCO (and Bank). The subsidiary agreement to manage a ADSP line of credit has not been signed and with the reallocation of grant proceeds this activity
                         will be replaced by the existing lines of credit under EDF (see above).

                         Under the institutional development component, a few activities are almost complete while others are making good progress. For example the contract to develop web page has been

                         awarded and the page is now on-line. Several training completed for M&E unit, Agribusiness Department etc. The Agriculture Market Information Center (AMIC) radio program was
                         scaled out to Eastern province where Radio Chikaya (Lundazi), Radio Breeze (Chipata) and radio PASME (Petauke) have partnered to disseminate market information. AMIC is also
                         getting into partnerships with local businesses as radio program sponsors. Under Seed Certification and Control Institute (SCCI), the Choma regional lab has been fully
                         operationalized; about 520 kgs of seed was tested during this period. ZARI undertook number of activities (strengthening border operations with agribusiness dept., carry out
                         inspections and fumigations to meet trade standards, pest and disease surveys etc. Capacity to increase quality cotton planting seeds production is further supported at Cotton
                         Development Trust (CDT) in Magoye. The main activity is a contract to develop the Strategic Plan (2011-2015) to address issues of financial and capacity sustainability. A SWOT
                         analysis of CDT has been conducted and stakeholder workshop to review draft plan and consult the market has been completed. The Semi annual Technical progress report for the
                         period July to December 2011 has been submitted. Project is now rolling out the third year E-ISR plus initiative using an independent survey of public sector participants and
                         communities in the rural areas and agricultural communities.
