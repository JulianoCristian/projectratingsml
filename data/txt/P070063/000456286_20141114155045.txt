I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     In 2004, Zambia was one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,
with an annual per capita income of US$440. Poverty was widespread in the rural
areas; home to two-thirds of its 10.5 million population and 72 percent of the poor. The
economy had been historically dependent on copper mining, but the decrease in world
copper prices had resulted in economic decline of the relatively high standard of living
of the 1970s. Structural reforms initiated in the 1990s had slowed this decline. Real
annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, which had averaged -0.2 percent from
1991-98, recovered to average 4 percent over 1999-2003. The poverty headcount also
improved from 78 percent in 1998 to 68 percent in 2004. Yet, this progress was not
seen as sufficient to reach the poverty-related Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of
halving poverty by 2015.

2.    Agriculture had become the major driver of growth and a significant source
of export revenue following the drop in copper earnings. Agriculture and agro-
processing contributed over 40 percent of GDP and 12 percent of export earnings
respectively. The sector employed about 67 percent of the labor force and supplied raw
materials to agro-related industries, which accounted for 84 percent of manufacturing
value-added.

3.     The Government of the Republic of Zambia’s (GRZ) efforts to support
smallholder agriculture prior to the 1990s had not achieved the expected results.
Policies focused on subsidized inputs and outputs, price interventions, and support to
agricultural parastatals had biased production incentives in favor of maize. Following
reforms, GRZ reduced its role and budget in agriculture. This, however, led to a
deterioration of public service delivery and hurt most smallholder farmers who
depended on public services, and were ill-prepared to face the challenges of exploiting
market opportunities that emerged with liberalization. With a reduced Government role,
the private sector spearheaded the impressive growth in agriculture in that decade.
Annual agricultural GDP growth during 1990-2000 averaged 3.9 percent; faster than the
population growth of 2.5 percent.

4.     Production systems that had emerged in Zambia since the mid-1990s were
based on partnerships between smallholders and commercial farmers or agro-
entrepreneurs. Most of the 800,000 smallholder households, who accounted for 80
percent of the cultivated area, were organized in some form of outgrower scheme
arrangements, with the majority contracted by cotton companies. Cotton was
undoubtedly the success story in smallholder commercialization. Tobacco was also an
important smallholder crop, while other promising subsectors were emerging. Despite
the relative success of outgrower schemes, Zambia’s commodity industries were facing
many challenges in sustaining their productivity and competitiveness due to several
factors. These included a distorted policy environment of subsidized inputs and outputs,
the limited availability of term financing for capital investments, poor road access to
high potential areas, weak services from relevant public sector institutions, and


                                          1
    exchange rate appreciation. The Agriculture Development Support Project (ADSP) was
    designed to specifically address these binding constraints and improve sector
    competitiveness. Agro-processing and marketing companies were viewed as being the
    main force behind growth in agriculture, and support was needed to improve the
    efficiency of existing and new outgrower operations and their export competitiveness.

    5.     GRZ requested the Bank to prepare ADSP for smallholder
    commercialization to contribute to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) pillar of
    promoting economic growth and export diversification. The Bank had considerable
    global experience in value chain development and smallholder commercialization, and
    development partners (DPs) supporting these areas in Zambia agreed to harmonize
    within a framework to reduce possible duplication and improve the development impact
    of their interventions. In addition, the sudden appreciation of the Kwacha had revealed
    the delicate comparative advantage of smallholder systems in Zambia, and the Bank was
    needed to address broader macroeconomic shocks to ensure that gains would not be
    reversed. ADSP, a multi-sector program with International Development Association
    (IDA) funding of US$37.2 million, was approved on May 16, 2006, with a projected
    project Closing Date of June 30, 2012. During the initial project implementation period,
    ADSP was the only IDA funded project in the agricultural sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

    6.    The PDO was to support increased commercialization of smallholder agriculture
    through improved productivity, quality and efficiency of value chains where
    smallholders participate. 1

    7.     The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were: (i) value of agricultural exports of
    target value chains; (ii) volume of commodities produced by target outgrower schemes;
    and (iii) increase in participating farmers’ incomes.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

    8.     The PDO was not revised 2 during implementation. With respect to the KPIs, the
    mid-term review (MTR) noted that the National Coordination Office (NCO) faced issues
    in regularly updating the indicators due to unclear data collection methodology and
    analysis between the NCO and the project implementing agencies (IAs). The indicators
    were therefore revised to better link to the components and logically reflect the impact
    of ongoing activities specifically supported by the project. IAs were also expected to
    collect data more effectively and report on results in a timely manner, thereby providing
    intermediate evidence on attaining the PDO. The Results Framework (RF) was also
    updated to include the Bank’s mandatory core indicators on gender, roads, finance, and


1
  This is the PDO as stated in the Financing Agreement (June 13, 2006), the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD), and the Restructuring Paper (November 13, 2013). The PDO is worded differently in the PAD
Data Sheet, Implementation Status Reports (ISRs), and in the Restructuring Paper Data Sheet but with no
substantial difference.

  ADSP had three instances of Level 2 (second order) restructurings. See Section 1.7.

agricultural technology, which were not required at the time of project appraisal.
Detailed information on KPIs on measurement, contribution to segments of PDO, and
attribution are provided in ICR Annex 2 Table 1 and text immediately thereafter.

9.     The revised Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were: (i) agricultural exports for
target value chains (tons/year); (ii) targeted commodities produced by smallholder
householders (tons/year); (iii) smallholder households growing targeted crops (number);
(iv) average income per household in targeted areas; and (v) direct project beneficiaries
(number), of which females (%). Improved value chain productivity, quality and
efficiency were assessed using above KPIs in terms of increases in volumes and
numbers. See details in Annex 2 Table 1.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10. ADSP was targeted to business-oriented smallholders or smallholder households.
It was expected to directly benefit about 65,000 smallholder households who were
already participating in organized supply chains. Other beneficiary groups included
agribusinesses, large-scale estate and commercial farmers, input suppliers, processors,
traders, and financial institutions that were part of the value chains. Selected
departments in the Ministry were also to benefit institutionally through capacity
strengthening.

1.5 Original Components

11. Component 1: Support to Farmers and Agribusiness Enterprises (SFAE,
US$33.2 million), (comprised of IDA: US$30.8 million; Beneficiaries: US$2.4 million),
aimed to increase the degree of smallholder commercialization by promoting the
development of a network of well-functioning and competitive value chains. It had
three sub-components: (a) Supply Chain Credit Facility, (SCCF, US$12.2 million), to
provide a line of credit through participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) on a
demand-driven basis, to support investments to improve the supply chains of existing
and emerging contract farming systems; (b) Market Improvement and Innovation
Facility (MIIF, US$6.0 million), to offer financial resources, on a matching grant (MG)
basis, for the development of innovative business linkages between smallholders and
other actors in agricultural value chains; and (c) Rural Roads Improvement Facility
(RRIF, US$15.0 million), to support rehabilitation and maintenance of selected feeder
and district roads in areas of high agricultural potential, using Output and Performance-
based Road Contracts (OPRCs).

12. Component 2: Institutional Development (US$3.9 million), sought to improve
the public sector’s capacity to provide core public services required to enhance
smallholders’ access to markets, and their productivity and quality. It was to strengthen
selected core services of the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives (MACO) related
to data and policy analysis, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), market information, seed
certification and control, food safety and quality standards, and phytosanitary services.

13. Component 3: Project Management and Coordination (US$2.6 million). As
project management largely relied on existing MACO structures, this aimed to


                                           3
    strengthen MACO’s implementation capacity by establishing the NCO within MACO,
    comprising of a National Coordinator, Safeguard Specialist, M&E Specialist and support
    staff.

1.6 Revised Components (not applicable)

1.7 Other significant changes

    14. ADSP was restructured (Level 2) on September 30, 2008, to: extend the project
    closing date by 21 months to March 31, 2014; to accommodate implementation of the
    five-year OPRC; and to reallocate US$5.5 million of project funds from Category 3
    (subloans under SCCF) to Category 1 (goods, works, consultant services and training) to
    cover higher than expected costs of civil works and consultant services. At project
    approval, the optimum contract period for OPRCs was not known. The engineering
    assessment of September 2007 had recommended OPRC contract duration of five years.

    15. On November 26, 2012, ADSP was restructured (Level 2) to reallocate US$6.55
    million from the SCCF to other components, so as not to tie up limited resources. Also,
    the restructuring involved a change in implementation arrangements of one sub-
    component; amendment of the definition of operating and training costs; revision of the
    Results Framework (RF); and extension of the project closing date to May 15, 2014 to
    accommodate the closing out of all grant activities, especially the rural road contracts
    under RIIF as well as the matching grants under MIIF. The implementation
    arrangements were changed as the full responsibility for administering the MIIF was
    transferred from the MIIF Grant Administrator (MGA) to the NCO following the closure
    of the MGA contract. In November 2013, there was a third Level 2 restructuring to
    cover cost overruns under Category 2 (operating costs) arising out of the extension of
    the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

    16. The ADSP project was informed by an in-depth analytics at entry, which resulted
    in the Zambia Smallholder Agricultural Commercial Strategy and also extensive field
    visits and consultations with smallholders and agribusinesses 3. ADSP included a Project

Preparation Facility in 2002 and a Quality Clinic (QC) to help prepare and guide project
design. The design reflected GRZ’s desire for a greater focus on smallholder
agricultural commercialization as a means of reducing poverty and enhancing exports,
by supporting the development of entire value chain systems. At entry, following risks
were recognized as substantial: exchange rate volatility reducing competitiveness of
agricultural exports, potential fund use for unintended purposes, and smallholder to
agribusiness operators’ arrangements skewed in favor of agribusinesses. Key respective
and effective mitigation measures adopted to address the issues were: coordinated
development partners engagement with government on policy matters and an active
high level inter-sector advisory group to advice on volatility risks and related budget
support; adoption and implementation of an Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS) within MAL to improve transparency of fund use and
accountability; and capacity building and facilitation for smallholders to form groups
and access project grant funds and build effective partnerships with agribusinesses along
the value chains.

17. Project concept and design drew on Bank experience and lessons from Bank
and DP agricultural development projects in Zambia. These included: (i) the key
element of better access to credit; (ii) the need to align matching grants (MG)
investments for supply chain development with industry needs; and (iii) the necessity for
road rehabilitation design to include sufficient resources and practical arrangements for
post-rehabilitation maintenance for several years by combining them in one contract.
The DP-funded projects had also shown that funds for smallholder mobilization and
capacity building should be channeled through industry associations, agribusinesses and
farmer organizations in order to have a lasting impact. Finally, there was the need to
clearly define and understand the role of DPs from the onset. In this respect, ADSP and
African Development Bank (AfDB) agreed on a common harmonization framework to
coordinate their support, with the Bank financing investments into feeder and district
roads, value chain strengthening, and a line of credit, and AfDB focusing on capacity
building of existing and new farmer groups, support to extension, the rural seed industry
and livestock production.

18. The supply chain approach was a valid strategic entry point to address
smallholder commercialization in Zambia, and the project had all the necessary
elements to deal with the constraints facing smallholders. Project activities and the
indicators reflected the PDO. ADSP, however, overlooked two key elements: (i) that
several project concepts were new to Zambia (i.e., the OPRC and the ‘innovative’
feature of MIIF), and that both implementers and potential participants might need time
to understand these activities; and (ii) that there could be a conflict of interest in
assigning the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) to be the implementer and regulator of the SCCF.
With respect to MIIF and OPRC, they were good concepts, and had ADSP’s design
allowed for raising awareness of these innovative activities upfront, it might have been
able to avoid initial delays in getting these key efforts off the ground. Varied
implementation of sub-components contributed to lower than expected synergies and
integration across sub-components. With respect to the potential conflict of interest,
better due diligence during preparation as to the type of institution most suited to



                                           5
manage the line of credit could have prevented major implementation delays and the
cancellation of the SCCF, as described in Section 2.2.

2.2 Implementation

19. ADSP operated within the government structure and enjoyed commitment
from senior leadership. It covered multiple sectors and involved institutions from
inside and outside of the government system. The project utilized the total grant of
US$37.2 million. The project cost was US$50 million, composed of the IDA grant of
US$37.2 million (74.4 percent), Government counterpart contribution of US$7.1 million
(14.2 percent), beneficiary contribution of US$3.1 million (6.2 percent) and a currency
exchange gain of US$2.6 million (5.2 percent). The exchange gain was used to offset
increases in project costs due to inflation and the longer implementation period, and to
cover government activities designed to ensure continuity and sustainability of ADSP
activities beyond the original closing date.

20. ADSP faced several challenges in implementation which were mitigated by
project restructuring and reallocation. Project restructuring efforts positively
contributed to the satisfactory implementation and project performance related
efficiency gains by: allocating additional funds to quick disbursing activities and value
chains, which were demand driven in a timely manner; improving the public sector
institutional capacity to provide essential services related to value chain
competitiveness; strengthening of project and MAL with a robust M&E system to
monitor activities thereby improving fund use efficiency and Proactive restructurings
over the implementation period (with two closing date extensions) therefore directly
contributed to the achievement, largely of the PDO and is illustrated by satisfactory
ratings in the outer years. Some of the challenges and lessons learnt described below
helped MAL to improve its project designing and implementation capacity as reflected
in three IDA funded full size projects in implementation in the portfolio (total IDA value
of US$195 million).

21. The SCCF and restructuring. SCCF had not commenced any project-specific
activity by November 2009 while ADSP had assumed the oversight obligations (Bank’s)
with regard to previously closed Enterprise Development Project (EDP) and recovery of
its funds under Enterprise Development Fund (EDF). At the MTR, stakeholders decided
to reallocate SCCF funds to other IAs, leaving a balance of US$80,000 to help build
capacity of the Apex Unit to continue with effective management of EDF and for other
future lines of credit. On December 17, 2009, GRZ relocated the Apex Unit from BoZ
to DBZ. Since then, DBZ has utilized the funds on capacity building activities including
training staff in IT, financial planning and forecasting, project appraisal analysis and for
provision of a computerized financial management system. DBZ now provides loans to
many agricultural value chain activities (including with recovered funds of US$40
million from the EDP), and is thereby supporting commercialization of smallholder
agriculture and contributing to the achievement of ADSP development objectives.

22. Overall, collaborative activities, especially under the MIIF, have
strengthened public-private partnerships and contributed to positive outcomes.


                                            6
Bank support not only strengthened project implementation, but also strengthened the
ability of government systems in implementation. The government has witnessed the
benefits of working effectively with the private sector, and the private sector has
developed greater trust in public institutions. This has led to a desire to scale up many
activities (as noted by the RDA and MIIF beneficiaries during the ICR mission).

23. Despite the challenges and even though the project experienced initial
implementation delays, the project was successfully implemented over a period of 7.8
years, and contributed to significant achievement of the PDO, as described in Section
3.2.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

24. The project’s M&E system was built on existing country systems to minimize the
need for parallel M&E frameworks. M&E implementation faced a number of issues and
was rated moderately satisfactory in early 2008 (ISR #5, February 5, 2008). Although
significant progress had been made in building an M&E system, including a Project
Indicators Monitoring Plan (PIMP), the system was not able to effectively collect and
generate the necessary information on a timely basis (see Section 1.3).

25. The MTR focused on improving the M&E system and the RF through a workshop
that included building capacity and common understanding of the ADSP objectives, and
on M&E issues between the IAs. The RF was revised to include realistic targets and a
detailed M&E activity plan, and was adopted in the subsequent project restructuring
(MTR Aide Memoire, November 9-25, 2009). Refer to section 1.3 and Annex 2 with
further clarifications, on revised KPI at MTR. M&E of all activities improved and
remained satisfactory. Overall, by project closure it had achieved considerable results
beyond collecting information on indicators. For example, regular site-visits to MIIF
grant recipients included technical assistance based on their progress. The M&E unit
helped to disseminate program results through annual conferences where IAs and
stakeholders showcased their results and shared experiences. In collaboration with the
Road Development Agency (RDA), the M&E unit helped to design an impact
assessment of the RRIF that included establishing a baseline in 2009 and a follow up
assessment in 2012.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

26. ADSP was rated Environmental Category ‘B’ as it was expected to have limited
environmental impact. The project prepared an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) to address the requirements of OP4.01 and OP4.09, and a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to address potential land acquisition issues under
OP4.12. The project also funded a full-time Safeguard Specialist for the NCO to
support project IAs in fulfilling their safeguards responsibilities. ADSP maintained
good progress in implementing the ESMF requirements.

27. A potential involuntary resettlement issue arose in February 2009, when some
households had built their structures on roads in the Katete district, Eastern province that



                                            7
were subject to rehabilitation works under the RIIF. An action plan, including the
preparation of an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) was followed to
resolve the issue. The final mission noted its satisfaction with the continuing attention
given to address safeguards related to the RRIF and MIIF subprojects and activities
under various IAs.

28. Financial Management (FM). Overall, FM remained in the satisfactory range. At
the time of the MTR it was rated moderately satisfactory, mainly due to the incomplete
computerization of ADSP’s accounting system, and late submission of audit reports.
Audited financial statements for some years were also delayed; however, these reports
were unqualified accompanied with a clean Management Letter.

29. ADSP helped to strengthen the capacity of the FM unit (FMU) to handle the
incremental workload associated with implementation. Initially, FMU worked closely
with the NCO to develop the Integrated Financial Management Information System
(IFMIS) using Navision software. This system was expected to integrate activity-based
budgeting, procurement, and results-based M&E. However, the system was not able to
produce the reports as required. ADSP subsequently adopted an integrated FM system
that is being successfuly used for public financial management that incorporates
planning, budgeting, expenditure management and control, accounting, audit and
reporting, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability of public resources. The
project has successfully used country systems for management of donor funds in line
with GRZ policy.

30. Procurement. ADSP supported the Procurement and Supplies Unit (PSU) in the
Ministry to strengthen its capacity. Overall, the PSU followed sound procedures
acceptable both to the Bank and government. The Bank carried out annual post
procurement reviews in order to ensure that acceptable procurement standards such as
efficiency, transparency and accountability were being observed. Although there were
challenges in terms of delays, long procedures and inadequate capacity among
personnel, most procurement resulted in good value for money. A specific bottleneck,
however, was the low threshold for Director-level approval in agriculture projects in
Zambia.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31. Although there is no specific follow up operation, options have been identified for
many of ADSP’s innovative aspects, and several activities have already commenced.
The SCCF was integrated within the DBZ, DBZ’s capacity strengthened, and activities
will be sustained through private sector participation in the EDF. The matching grant
model has been adopted by other IDA funded projects within the Ministry such as the
Irrigation Development and Support Project (IDSP), Livestock Development and
Animal Health Project (LDAHP) and the Agricultural Productivity Program for
Southern Africa (APPSA). ADSP-supported agribusinesses will have access to facilities
under these projects. The OPRC will be scaled up through the rural road rehabilitation
and maintenance project being designed under the RDA, with the concept adopted to
rehabilitate and maintain some of 33,000 kilometers of rural roads in Zambia.


                                           8
32. SCCI foresees sustaining its biotechnology laboratory operations through
proceeds from providing finger printing services to clients. There is also scope for
research support from APPSA. Both labs at SCCI—Choma and biotech are
incorporated into the GRZ budget. ZARI anticipates collaboration with APPSA to
support its research and pest surveillance activities. Surveillance work done under
ADSP has also helped ZARI to present project proposals to examine the next set of
issues related to crop losses from Asian Fruit Flies (AFF). ZARI has obtained funds
from FAO under the Technical Cooperative Project (TCP) to continue this work, and is
also receiving funds from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to build
on work done under ADSP. CDT plans to sustain its activities through own support
realized from executing of its strategic business plan. CDT might also collaborate with
IDSP to support the expansion of the irrigation infrastructure.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

33. Overall relevance of the project to the sector and national economy is substantial.
ADSP’s key objectives which were set out to contribute to CAS pillar of promoting
economic growth and export diversification continue to be relevant to the Bank’s current
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 2012-2016), and the Sixth National Development
Plan (SNDP 2011-2015). The SNDP stresses investments in agriculture infrastructure
and rural finance as a means of reducing poverty. The Plan emphasizes crop
diversification, while also improving marketing systems, developing the value chain in
agriculture production, and increasing productivity in farming to ensure national food
security, employment and exports.

34. ADSP’s integrated supply chain approach, despite its design complexity given the
number of original activities, new activities and value chains, implementation delays and
issues with some of the IAs, provided a platform to overcome such weaknesses. In
addition, its proactive restructuring to address implementation bottlenecks did not
outweigh the high level of relevance. The integrated approach also included the many
elements and synergies that were necessary to achieve its PDO of enhancing smallholder
commercialization. Project implementation required working with all those agents in a
chain by facilitating strategic partnerships to address bottlenecks along potentially
profitable supply chains which at times affected smooth implementation progress as
shown by ISR rating changes at various time.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

35. This section presents level of achievement of and delivery of PDO segments by
individual KPIs. The linkages through which ADSP interventions resulted in successful
final outcomes are presented in Table 1 below. Annex 2 lists the definitions of all
project indicators, outputs by component, and the intermediate outcomes achieved. As a
sector wide project with a programmatic approach, using country systems to implement
government’s broad program in the agriculture sector and not implementing ADSP as a


                                           9
    separate project, ADSP achieved significant and substantial institutional development
    of public sector institutions, and built strong private public partnerships in targeted
    value chains. The institutional development and strengthened service delivery to
    targeted value chains contributed greatly to the project’s final successful outcomes.

    36. Given ADSP’s cohesive approach, one cannot separate which project outputs
    directly resulted in each outcome under the five KPIs. Rather, the outcomes are
    correlated and can be attributed to multiple activities and their synergies. For example,
    the key objective of rehabilitating feeder road networks was to improve access to
    markets and public facilities by rural farming communities. Average household incomes
    in these targeted catchment areas increased substantially (KPI #4). However, greater
    household production and marketable surpluses, aided by the MIIF, and key support
    services provided by the research institutes also contributed to this result.

KPI 1: Agricultural exports for target value chains (tons/year)

    37. ADSP targeted value chains/commodities with high export potential: cotton,
    paprika, chili, soya beans, groundnuts, sunflower, honey and coffee. Zambia’s total
    exports of these products reached 116,119 tons/year in 2013. The largest increases were
    in cotton, sunflower and groundnuts (see Government ICR, p. 30 for a breakdown of
    annual exports by commodity from 2005 to 2013.)

    38. Although the growth in national exports cannot be directly attributed to ADSP,
    several project outputs contributed to exports, including: MIIF sub-projects that were

  Between 2005 and 2007, the fertilizer subsidy to maize was increased substantially, in terms of the
number of beneficiaries reached and the size of the fertilizer package. As a result, maize output increased
from 866,187 tons (2005) to 1,366,158 tons (2007), and the competing crop, cotton, experienced a decline
in output from 170,000 tons (2005) to 70,000 tons (2007). The more accurate baseline for KPI #2 should
therefore be 2007, when production was 197,368 tons (see Government ICR, Annex 5b on indicators).

    able to successfully access export markets through innovation and supply chain
    strengthening (i.e., Ubuchi Capital Enterprises’ honey exports of 22,248 kgs. to Norway,
    Chankwakwa Limited’s exports of dried fruit to Denmark); plant quarantine services
    offered by ZARI, which enabled the issuance of phytosanitary certificates for export;
    and capacity strengthening of CDT that allowed CDT to increase the supply of pre-basic
    cotton seed to the industry. 5 Improved road networks also impacted this outcome, as
    they removed transport infrastructure constraints that limited expansion and efficiency
    of supply chains.

MIIF and ZARI activities/outputs and their links to export growth:

    39. The MIIF provided funds to promote innovative products and processes that
    enhanced competitiveness of agricultural production, and link smallholders to viable
    agribusinesses. The facility supported 28 enterprises along commodity value chains in
    cotton, paprika, chili, groundnuts, soybeans, dairy, poultry, aqua-culture, piggery,
    honey, cashew nuts, mushroom, local vegetables and fruits. This was also supporting
    GRZ policy on crop diversification. Overall, 39 different innovative technologies were
    introduced, either directly to smallholder farmers at the production stage, or further
    down the value chain as part of the processing chain of agricultural commodities. The
    total estimated number of beneficiaries under the sub-projects is 45,180 (in 9 provinces,
    26 districts), of which 31,630 were direct beneficiaries (see Annex 2, Table 3-6).

    40. Both direct and indirect beneficiaries ranging from farmers in outgrower schemes
    to agro-processors noted advances in production and export-related activities (during the
    ICR mission in August 2014). Beneficiaries were particularly grateful for services
    offered by ZARI. ADSP had enhanced ZARI’s capacity to comply with emerging
    Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) requirements, and help agribusinesses take advantage
    of export opportunities. ZARI’s services provided to agribusinesses, smallholder and
    commercial farms, and to individuals included: issuance of phytosanitary certificates;
    fumigation inspections, nursery inspections, and tobacco premises inspections.

 These enterprises presented export permits to the ICR team as examples of gaining access to export
markets as a result of MIIF sub-projects and phytosanitary certification from ZARI.


                                                    11
41. ZARI successfully executed several activities in line with its mandate. Key
surveys and surveillance activities to improve the quality and safety of Zambian
products have enhanced production and trade. For example, as part of research and
development, ADSP promoted production and quality improvement of the honey value
chain through testing and confirming that Zambian honey is free of American Foul
Brood (AFB) disease. This in turn has eliminated the need to irradiate the honey, and
opened doors for honey exports to regional and international markets. In addition, the
project helped to improve the plant quarantine services by enhancing staff capacity at
ZARI, which issues phytosanitary certificates for export and plant import permits for a
variety of products. ZARI also undertook surveillance activities in Fruit fly, Banana
Bunchy Top Disease, and Coffee Pest and fumigation inspections, with the objective of
controlling or suppressing the population of various predators in fruit and other
agricultural products, in order to enhance fruit production and trade (ZARI Completion
Report, 2013). ZARI regularly conducted border backstopping missions in provinces
that have border towns to enforce SPS regulations of the laws of Zambia, provide
quality assurance to traders, and to maintains a uniform working approach among
inspectors in the borders to assure consistency in services delivered by PQPS. In
addition, ZARI’s training activities benefitted staff members and smallholder farmers.
Trainings focused on enlightening plant inspectors and other beneficiaries on the
importance and application of the plant pest and diseases Acts, the application of the
international standards for phytosanitary measures (ISPMs), pest risk analysis, disease
identification and sampling methods.

42. MIIF enterprises in honey production followed innovations in rebranding and
labeling, through better packaging materials from South Africa, penetrated tourist
markets, and obtained export orders to several European countries. Outgrower schemes
have grown in numbers and in products. For example, MIIF participants are now
exporting mangoes in various processed forms (i.e., Chankwakwa’s outgrowers),
including to Denmark as Fair Trade products. Phytosanitary certification for export has
helped to improve traceability and open new markets in many fruit and vegetable
products.

43. In 2013, a survey covering 94 ZARI clients assessed ZARI’s quality of services;
utilization of services; and satisfaction with the services. The quality of issuance of SPS
certificates was rated as good, 100 percent of the respondents used these services, and
respondents of SPS certificates and fumigation inspections were satisfied with the
services received (NIRAS Zambia, 2013, and ADSP Government ICR, p. 27).

44. With respect to KPIs 2 to 5, project activities contributed to the achievement of
outcomes in multiple areas as presented below (see Annex 2 for KPI indicator
definitions/purpose).

Key Outcomes achieved under KPIs 2 to 5:

•   Zambia’s annual production of the targeted commodities increased from 351,567 tons
    in 2005 (or 197,368 tons in 2007) to 542,947 tons in 2013 (see the Government ICR,
    p. 31 for a breakdown of annual production by commodity from 2005 to 2013).


                                           12
  Groundnuts, sunflower and soya bean recorded the largest increases. Many of the
  beneficiaries under the 28 MIIF sub-projects participated in the groundnuts, honey,
  soya bean, cotton, and chili value chains and benefited from project support.
• The number of smallholder households growing targeted commodities increased from
  the original baseline of 927,251 in 2005 to 1,039,216 in 2013. This was achieved in a
  diversified farming system excluding maize monocropping.
• Annual average household income in the RRIF targeted districts (Choma, Katete and
  Chipata) increased four fold from ZMW 3,900 (2009) to ZMW 21,800 (2012).
• Overall, the project reached out to 128,265 beneficiaries, thereby surpassing the
  original target of 65,000. About 48 percent of them were female beneficiaries. 6

    45. Challenge to RRIF implementation was associated with under-pricing by the
    roads contractors due to a misunderstanding of the wording in the contract and the weak
    understanding of principles of the OPRC documents delayed implementation by the
    MTR, and placed all four roads contracts under increased implementation risk.. Funds
    were reallocated to finance contract amendments. Lags in mobilizing contractors for the
    large civil works also delayed the RRIF implementation, as contractors tended to hold
    back the start of mobilizing equipment in order to manage possible political risks (due to
    Presidential Elections in October 2009). The subsequent Government ban on advanced
    payments to contractors further slowed the mobilization process.

    46. Despite all these setbacks during implementation the OPRC contract succeeded.
    The OPRC was an efficient and cost-effective approach, as a single contract also
    included practical procedures for post-rehabilitation maintenance of the roads for five
    years. See RIIF impacts below and details in Annex 5.

Impact of improved roads on the wellbeing of rural communities:

    47. Under the RRIF, ADSP sought to improve smallholder farmers’ access to input
    and produce markets and the competitiveness of their agricultural commodities by
    improving road networks in selected districts of Choma, Chongwe, Katete, Chipata and
    Lundazi, which were selected on the basis of their agricultural potential. The project
    successfully completed a total of 1,131 kilometers in all the five districts in Eastern and
    Southern Provinces. 7

    48. Two socio-economic impact studies—a Baseline study 2009 and a Second-Phase
    study in 2012--surveyed the same sample of households to measure the impact of
    improved Agricultural Feeder Road Networks (AFRNs) on target communities in terms
    of agricultural production and commercialization, and improvements in general living
    conditions (IMCS Limited 2010 and IMCS Limited 2013).



6
 See NIRAS, Zambia, July 2013 for beneficiaries by gender under the MIIF, ZARI and AMIC.
7
 ADSP financed road works in Choma, Katete and Chipata districts. The European Union financed the
work in Chongwe and Lundazi districts through Government budget support. ADSP financed all
supervision contracts; both IDA and EU financed works contracts.



                                               13
49. Access and mobility impacts significantly eased the movement of inputs, produce
and the general public in the catchment areas. The road improvements contributed to
reduced travel time from production areas to market centers, from input centers to
production areas and in vehicle operation costs. There is evidence of increased business
activities along the roads (Tuesday and Thursday markets). Overall, the 2013 study
points to an improvement in the standard of living of households in the targeted areas.

 50. Key impacts of road improvements and overall conclusions of the 2013
 Survey:
• Areas that were impassable and inaccessible opened up for economic and social
   activities, and public transport is now able to reach these areas. The volume of traffic
   increased signifcantly, by over 270 percent from 52 vehicles per day in 2007 to 194
   vehicles per day in 2012. In Choma and Katete districts, there were major increases
   in the frequency of road usage in both Treatment (ADSP target areas) and Control
   roads, including in the rainy season in Chipata (also see Annex 2 on ADSP
   Intermediate Outcome Indicators);
• Access to public facilities by the local population residing in the catchment areas
   improved, through stimulating construction and/or upgrading such infrastructure and
   reducing travel time than users previously faced. Access and use of public facilities
   are expected to improve further. General improvement are seen in all districts. In
   Choma district, primary schools were more accessible (100 percent in Treatment
   areas versus 93 percent in Control areas, from 57 percent and 71 percent recorded at
   the Baseline study; in treatment areas the response was significant). Health centers
   and agricultural depots are more accessible to larger proportions of the population in
   the Chipata district. This was also generally the case with the Treatment areas in
   Choma and Katete districts (IMCS, p. vi);
• The use of labor-based rural roads construction and maintenance provided
   employment opportunities for the poor. Approximately 1,200 jobs were created
   during road rehabilitation and structure constructions in treatment areas;
• With respect to agricultural production and sales, a number of factors influenced the
   farmers’ decision to increase the area under various crops, including improved land
   use by way of mechanization and higher market prices. Results varied by the three
   districts and by crop, but overall, average production by household and the average
   numbert of bags sold increased both in the Treatment and Control areas, with greater
   impact in treatment areas;
• Greater proportions of households in both Control and Treatment areas surveyed in
   all three districts were linked and participated in the outgrower schemes during the
   2011-2012 farming season (Control: from 13 at baseline to 47 percent, and
   Treatment: from 18 at baselineof to 49 percent respectively, the positive difference
   however was not statistically significant);
• Crop production has increased in both Control and Treatment areas with larger impact
   in Treatment areas;
• The overall improvement in the agricultural production activities of the sample
   population since 2009 could be attributed to increasing commercial integration of the
   smallholder farmers in the treatment areas. It may also indicate that improved road
   access conditions is enhancing agricultural market linkages; and


                                            14
•     Other improvements in the standard of living of smallholder farmers include: the
      number of households accessing protected boreholes rather than wells, proportion of
      households with toilet facilities, the quality of dwellings, and greater investments in
      household assets (radios, bicycles, TV sets and solar panels etc.), and spending on
      public transport and on food items).

    51. The 2012 survey attempted to disaggregate the data by gender to establish
    conditions faced by women. This has enabled to establish a new baseline that should
    facilitate future monitoring of changes in greater detail in the ADSP target areas (IMCS,
    2013, p. 102).

Other project activities/outputs that contributed to these outcomes:

    52. The MIIF contributed to all five KPIs, including increasing the numbers in
    outgrower schemes, production of targeted commodities, and exports, as mentioned
    above. 8 Results from the NIRAS Zambia 2013 assessmentshow that beneficiaries were
    satisfied with the services delivered by the MIIF. The MIIF contribution to outcomes
    far outways the general delay in commencing core activities under the MIIF, owing to
    the need to create awareness and sufficient preliminary capacity to enable major
    activities to begin. The MIIF in particular faced some challenges, as potential
    beneficiaries took time to understand the requirements of the facility, as ‘innovative’
    practices had not been clearly defined at the time of the initial call for proposals. The
    initial call attracted 542 grant applications but only 30 were approved given the variety
    of weaknesses of the majority of such proposals. Some applicants also failed to provide
    their matching contributions. The OPRC, a new contractual approach was also not well
    understood by contractors, which affected the pace of work as described below.

    53. Seed Control and Certification Institute (SCCI). ADSP supported SCCI to
    strengthen its capacity in seed testing and certification through the construction of a
    Biotech Laboratory at Chilanga district, formerly part of Lusaka, establishing a Seed
    Testing Laboratory in Choma district, and building capacity of SCCI Staff and
    smallholder farmers. In 2013, ADSP funded SCCI to go out in the districts to collect
    seed samples for testing. In the years before, that was funded by the government. The
    laboratory in Choma is part of the Government program to decentralize seed testing to
    reduce seed costs. Since it was ccommissioned in June 2012, the lab has provided seed
    testing services to 13 districts in the Southern Province, all of which used to take their
    seed samples to Chilanga for testing before ADSP support. Small-scale farmers have
    already experienced benefits from the Choma laboratory in terms of reduced transport
    and other costs from not having to take seeds to Lusaka (see Alinabena Consultancy and
    Trading, August 2014. p. 44).

    54. A total of 11 different varieties of seed samples (maize, soya beans, beans, sun
    flower, Jatropha, cotton, okra, cowpeas, groundnuts, sorghum and pigeon peas) have
    been tested. To date the Choma lab has tested and certified for sale 1,812 tons of seed in

8
 See Alinabena Consultancy and Trading, August 2014. p. 9–29 for characteristics on 12 MIIF sub-
projects. Five of these value chains were included in the cost-benefit analysis in Section 3.3 and Annex 3.


                                                    15
2012 and 1,054 tons in 2013 in the Southern Province. The lab also carries out seed
inspections to ensure the production of quality seeds in the province. The lab has
inspected seed belonging to both seed companies such as Seed Co and smallholder seed
growers.

55. Cotton Development Trust (CDT) supports the cotton industry, which is a very
important sector in Zambia’s economy, and is the only institution in the country that is
mandated to supply foundation cotton seed to the industry. For some time, supply had
been far below demand. Support to CDT was therefore intended to strengthen the
capacity of the institute to supply an increased amount of pre-basic seed to the industry.
ADSP supported irrigation system infrastructure (wehre CDT was able to use the
irrigation water on 80 hectares of land), the establishment of the Integrated Pest
Management (IPM) Unit, and equipment, thereby increasing CDT’s pre-basic cotton
seed production from 19.2 metric tons in 2005 to 60.9 metric tons in 2013 (see Annex 2,
Figure 1). ADSP also supported training of CDT staff and smallholder producers, where
the latter received training in advanced technologies associated with value addition,
product development and quality improvement.

56. CDT’s IPM lab performed exceptionally well in collaborating with cotton ginners
to provide training to farmers participating in cotton out-grower schemes on various
sites across the country. Training sessions focused on land preparation, cotton planting,
weed control, fertilizer application and early pest management (Annex 2 Table 8 gives
the participation of smallholder farmers in training during the 2012/13 farming season,
with the data disaggregated by gender). Average yield over the past 4 years for a model
group has increased from 607 kg/ha in the 2008/09 season to 1,158 kg/ha in the 2012/13
season (Annex 2, Table 9).

57. Agricultural Market Information Centre (AMIC) and Agribusiness and Trade
(ABT). ADSP also helped to upgrade the market information system to help improve the
delivery of up-to-date and accurate market data to satisfy the needs of farmers, traders
and processors through capacity building to facilitate agricultural trade and negotiations.
AMIC carried out several programs/activities to help smallholder farmers improve their
farming business as detailed in Annex 2. One area of focus was the marketing aspect.
AMIC collects and disseminates agricultural market information using a number of
channels including radio and bulletin. There is evidence of increased private sector
participation in sponsoring the dissemination of market information, which is an
important element for long-term sustainability.

58. Supply Chain Credit Facility (SCCF): DBZ and ADSP. Although the SCCF did
not lend any of its funds to smallholders, ADSP helped DBZ by building capacity in
staff to handle value chain financing. The total loan portfolio transferred from BoZ to
DBZ amounted to over US$40 million in 2009 (see DBZ Completion Report for details
on sub-borrowers and the sectors lent to). Sub-borrowers’ financing included
agriculture projects operating in different parts of the country that were engaged in
various farming activities and agro-processing, such as mixed farming, fishing, ranching
and processing maize into mealie meal. Through the EDF, DBZ has been providing
loans to many agricultural sector value chain activities. As of 31st December 2013, the


                                           16
    performance of the revolving fund was impressive and DBZ was supporting over 6,762
    farmers with an average loan size of K1,700, thereby supporting commercialization of
    smallholder agriculture and therefore contributing to the achievement of the ADSP
    development objective.

3.3 Efficiency

    59. The financial and economic net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return
    (IRR) analysis of ADSP included five key value chains: dairy (livestock subsector), soya
    beans (crop – grain legume sub sector), mushroom (fungi food/ forest product), and non-
    foods, tobacco and pre-basic cotton seed (CDT), which benefitted from RRIF, MIIF and
    Institutional development components. 9 The study also considered the inputs and
    outputs of all institutions under the Institutional Development component, the RDA for
    rural roads and visited 13 of the 30 MIIF sub-projects under the MIIF to ensure that
    program costs and benefits were measured to the extent possible. Final analysis did not
    include a detailed assessment of relatively minor value chains such as sunflowers,
    ground nuts and paprika from export volume and contribution to national economy
    points of view. The RIIF assessment was also incomplete and is not presented here but
    the impact results presented in the section above are used as project benefits, both
    quantitative and qualitative. There were also data limitations as detailed in the report,
    e.g., data unavailability and unwillingness to release information for some MIIF agri-
    enterprises, especially on the value of sales and their operational costs. The preliminary
    findings for the case study value chains provided IRR values above 50 percent, which
    were on the high side due to several factors. 10 However using proxy data for cost
    factoring, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) ranges between 18 and 29.5 percent. The
    financial and economic NPV using a 12 percent discount factor were ZMW3.88 million
    and ZMW11.09 million respectively (see Annex 3).

    60. Agricultural exports targeted by the project were as expected vulnerable to several
    macroeconomic factors, e.g., exchange rate differential on competitiveness factored in
    by both input and output pricing, copper prices and other global market volatilities
    particularly in the cotton sector, which were moderated through product diversification
    and value addition supported by MIIF and improved export related service delivery
    offered by SCCI, ZARI, CDT, MAL’s agribusiness and trade. The latter interventions
    through institutional strengthening contributed to efficiency gains.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

    61. ADSP was relevant at the time of appraisal and continues to be relevant to date.
    Outcomes exceeded all but one target. In addition, the project has had an impact on the
    economic well-being of households, especially assessed under the RRIF, where

Trading, August 2014.
10
   This does not include data on costs of procurements that were done by NCO on behalf of the institutions
directly from Lusaka, nor some operating costs from the value chains included in the calculations.


                                                   17
previously impassable and accessible areas have opened up for economic and social
activities. There is better mobility and access not only to agricultural input and produce
markets, but also to health facilities and to schools. More importantly, ADSP has
indirectly enhanced private-public partnerships in agriculture related agri-enterprises.
Government has worked closely with the private sector and has seen the benefits of such
collaboration, while Zambia’s private sector has developed greater trust in public
institutions in the agriculture sector. The project’s NPV is positive as indicated above.
The overall satisfactory outcome rating is justified by including the impressive
institutional development gains, including capacities built, and services provided--
made under the project—at the Cotton Development Trust, the SCCI, ZARI, etc.). Also,
the impressive gains in the rural landscape through improved access to markets and
services associated with rural roads improvement (refer to impact results) argues for this
rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62. Poverty and Gender Aspects. Although poverty levels were not measured
explicitly, there is ample evidence of better standards of living, especially among the
MIIF and RRIF beneficiaries (NIRAS, Zambia, 2013, IMCS, 2013, Cost-Benefit
Analysis, 2014). ADSP has done well in terms of including women, especially within
the MIIF. About 48 percent of the MIIF sub-project beneficiaries are female. A sample
of MIIF sub-projects indicates that the mean income for female and male-headed
households among the respondents did not differ significantly (NIRAS, Zambia, p. 44).
Although there is no baseline breakdown by gender at project start-up, this same study
reports demographic and household characteristics by gender, which should provide the
basis for future analysis by gender.

63. Social Development. The project made efforts to integrate HIV/AIDs alleviation
measures into its activities as part of the implementation of ESMF. Farmers
participating in the MIIF in the high risk area of Kafue had access to mobile voluntary
counseling and testing services (VCT). In addition, the roads contractors established
facilities on their work sites to provide HIV/AIDs awareness creation sessions and
emergency medical attention to the workers and immediate family. More serious cases
were referred to the nearest Government health facilities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64. ADSP contributed to building long-term capacity in many areas. In particular, the
project’s support to research institutes (ZARI, SCCI and CDT) has been very successful,
not only in strengthening their capacity to implement mandated activities, but also in
increasing their ability to attract additional funds to enhance and sustain their activities.
Support to the Policy and Planning Department within the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock (i.e., to the Agricultural Statistics and Early Warning Unit (ASEWU), M&E
Unit and Policy Analysis Unit (PAU)) has enabled farmers to receive key information.
The ASEWU has also set up a website, which is being populated with data. The M&E


                                            18
Unit is now undertaking results-based M&E within the agricultural sector. The PAU
has, however, faced some challenges, including weak staff capacity, and fell short of
accomplishing all of the planned tasks. The Ministry has engaged Indaba Agricultural
Policy Institute (IAPRI) to further strengthen capacity at PAU to ensure that more staff
participates in the program. The AMIC program on disseminating market information
has performed well, and should continue to attract interest and funding from the private
sector particularly for the radio programs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

65. Positive: The seed control and certification lab at Choma and the associated
activities are contributing to provincial development of Choma, which is the Southern
provincial capital; and the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) lab at CDT has attracted
many international ginners. In 2013, there were a total of 7 ginners, and now there are
11 including from other countries; competition has increased in ginning; IPM
department is now equipped to continue its work, and is also attracting royalties for
CDT bred cotton varieties. By supporting better quality seed, ADSP has also played a
part in increasing the numbers of seed growers, who are seeing the benefits of using
improved seed.

66. Rural feeder road improvements have resulted in satellite agricultural depots and
collection points by the side of new roads and emergence of new village markets.
Although the RRIF targeted only high agriculture potential areas, benefits cover a much
larger area. The OPRCs were only for gravel roads, but now, through learning, OPRCs
are being considered for tarred roads. Multi-sector collaboration has encouraged the
development of links between agricultural and road investments.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

67. See Annex 5 for the results of the Second Phase of the Socio-Economic Impact
Study.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: low

68. The institutional risk to development outcome is low. As described in Section
3.5(b) and in Annex 2, ADSP built institutional capacity at many stages of agricultural
activity. This includes: strengthening MAL through the ASEWU and the M&E unit to
deliver core public services required to enhance smallholder’s access to markets, and
improve their productivity and quality; support to the Department of Agribusiness and
Marketing, channeled via the AMIC and the ABT to help smallholder farmers to
improve their farming businesses by obtaining up-to-date market information; and
support to the research institutes—ZARI, SCCI and CDT—key institutions that carry
out the critical element of research. Project beneficiaries are likely to receive additional
support as described in Section 2.5, further reinforcing these local institutional
structures. The main laboratories supported by ADSP also receive Government budget
resources. Sustainability of the outcome of OPRC contracting approach in the RDA is


                                            19
assured since the institution is planning to adopt this approach for national rural roads
network and to this end has expressed an interest to formulate a project during the
current CPS cycle.

69. The financial risk to development outcome is low. ADSP has strengthened
collaboration among all players along agricultural value chains, and benefitted
smallholders, agribusiness enterprises, large-scale estates and commercial farmers, input
suppliers, traders and financial institutions. The enterprises involved in the project have
worked towards the commercialization of smallholder farmers, and the MIIF has
enabled its participants to reap financial benefits and scale up further. The two key
financial institutions involved in ADSP--BoZ and DBZ-- have benefitted from
substantial capacity building; with stronger systems now in place at BoZ in terms of the
governance and control mechanisms; and DBZ following strict procedures to scrutinize
borrowers under the EDF, and continuing to lend about 30 percent of their portfolio to
agriculture.

70. The environmental risk to development outcome is low. The project has
strengthened the overall environmental management system. This includes the ability to
submit good Environmental Project Briefs to the Zambia Environmental Management
Authority (ZEMA), educating the public about road signage, vegetation and erosion
control, and HIV/AIDS awareness. Trainings have been successful, and substantial
efforts have been made to enhance the monitoring of matching grants projects.

71. The social risk to development outcome is low. ADSP has benefited a substantial
number of beneficiaries within a range of agricultural value chains. In addition, rural
roads have improved access to social services such as schools and healthcare centers.
Overall, increased productivity and incomes along the value chains will improve food
security and the socioeconomic status of the poor.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

72. The comprehensive supply chain approach was a rational entry point to address
smallholder commercialization in Zambia. Project targeted both the public sector
selected institutions and the private sector was engaged and fully benefitted from this
investment. The team also took into account many lessons in designing a good project,
and the design was based on sound analytics with measurable outcome indicators that
were well-linked to the PDO. Project design was innovative. Course corrections and
three restructuring during implementation do not negate the implementation readiness
issue the team overlooked (refer to Section 2.1). Therefore it can be argued that the
quality at entry is satisfactory.




                                           20
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

73. The Bank team worked closely with the client throughout implementation,
including helping overcome some of the initial delays caused by lack of awareness of
project participants, and to improve on project M&E and the RF during the MTR. In
particular, the ADSP team worked diligently to address the issues related to BoZ and the
SCCF, including taking on the responsibility of and succeeding in recuperating funds
from the EDP (with no additional Bank supervision budget). The issues were resolved
by working together with GRZ to relocate the credit facility within the DBZ, and by
providing capacity strengthening to DBZ to administer the credit line and help to
achieve the outcomes planned under ADSP.

74. Bank technical support during implementation was also commendable. During
implementation, Bank Missions visited the Program and sub-activities in various
districts and catchment areas.         The mission objectives were to review: (a)
implementation progress of all project activities; (b) financial management,
procurement, and component and sub-project safeguards compliance; (c) M&E of all
project activities and components; and (d) project coordination, management and
communication. During the Missions, Bank technical staff met and held discussions
with key stakeholders including the Ministry Administration, Implementing Agencies
and also visited field activities to verify the progress of activities on the ground. The
Mission findings and agreements were always documented in separate Aide Memoires.
The Bank facilitated the MTR restructuring and helped bring the Program back on
course.

75. The Bank carried out the necessary reviews in procurement and FM, and provided
additional help to FMU to successfully adopt the integrated FM information system, and
use country systems to manage donor funds. With respect to environmental safeguards,
the Bank was proactive when faced with potential involuntary settlement issues under
the RRIF in 2009. The team fielded a safeguards mission and worked with the client to
prepare an ARAP and follow an action plan to avoid suspending the OPRC works and
delaying road rehabilitation. The Bank team also collaborated closely with other sectors
in this multi-sector operation, and worked with the EU to make the RRIF a success.
Overall, Bank supervision was satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
 76. This rating reflects the ‘S’ rating for both Quality at Entry and Supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

77. Government ownership of the project was high. GRZ collaborated well and
supported the private sector in helping to achieve project outputs and outcomes.
Government made its counterpart contributions to ADSP annually, to supplement IDA


                                            21
resources. Government provided office accommodation to the National Coordination
Office with sufficient space for seven professional staff. During the MTR, GRZ
responded well to the implementation challenges the project had experienced and agreed
on remedial actions to bring the operation back on course and to ensure successful
completion.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

78. The NCO did an outstanding job in helping ADSP to achieve its development
objectives. In particular, the NCO made great efforts to get the initially delayed sub-
components off the ground. NCO support to MIIF sub-projects has been critical in
helping these beneficiaries become successful participants in the value chain. With
respect to M&E, the NCO/M&E Unit went beyond collecting information as detailed in
Section 2.3, and assured that several high-quality surveys were done to capture ADSP’s
impact. The RRIF implementer, RDA’s superior performance is reflected in the
fulfilment of project KPIs. Similarly when the public sector institutions, SCCI and
ZARI, other MAL departments and CDT are considered overall implementation
performances are satisfactory and is justified through the level KPI achievements as well
as qualitative outcomes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
 79. This rating reflects the ‘S’ rating for both Government and the Implementing
 Agency.

6. Lessons Learned

80.    There are six major lessons learned from the project.

81. First, innovations in project design, which the ADSP had in the MIIF and RRIF
components, should address capacity limitations upfront in order to assure
implementation success. In general, projects of this type need to take into account
country capacity in project implementation. In particular, when projects include
‘innovative’ activities, time needs to be set aside up-front for raising awareness among
all potential project participants, i.e., implementers and beneficiaries. The MIIF was
delayed, although it finally succeeded, because initially participants lacked an
understanding of ‘innovative’ practices, and the RRIF was delayed as contractors had to
learn the bidding documents and the terms of the multi-year contracting arrangement
(i.e., the OPRCs) that included incentives for high quality rehabilitation since the
contractor was also responsible for the road maintenance several years after the
rehabilitation.

82. Second, the OPRC-type contract, where road rehabilitation design includes
sufficient resources and practical arrangements for post-rehabilitation maintenance for
several years, combined in one contract proved successful. At ADSP approval, the
optimum contract period for OPRCs was not known. However, an engineering



                                           22
assessment recommended duration of five years. This was subsequently successfully
included in the OPRCs through a restructuring early in the project.

83. Third, the link between producers and markets is critical in a project that seeks
to increase commercialization in agriculture. Smallholder farmers should not be looked
at in isolation in such projects but must be viewed with integrating them to value chains
to generate win-win partnerships. Channeling funds through industry organizations,
agribusinesses and farmer organizations in viable value chains / commodities worked
well in terms of ultimately reaching smallholder farmers, mobilizing them, building their
capacity, and helping to integrate them into the value chains. Value chains get the
supply volumes they need, and smallholders acquire improved technology, raise their
productivity and quality, and improve their incomes. These winning partnerships also
increase sustainability.

84. Fourth, strengthening government core functions can build private sector trust
in government. Under the project, good collaboration between government/public
institutions and the private sector was key. In the case of ADSP, all public and private
sector entities worked closely and realized the benefits of cooperation.

85. Fifth, good continuous monitoring; periodic and regular evaluation; and quality
impact assessments played an important role in learning from the project throughout
implementation, and once it was completed. For example, the RDA Impact Study
sampled the same households in three catchment areas in 2009 (baseline) and in 2012.
The findings shed light on additional yet broader social impacts of the project, beyond
agriculture, such as its positive impact on access to health and education services in the
rural space, and also why the use of health facilities is still relatively low due to access
constraints. These findings enable further learning, inquiry and possible follow-up
(outside of the field of agriculture) to reduce rural poverty and improve the well-being of
people in Zambia.

86. Lastly, flexibility and being opportunistic in implementation was key to the
success of this project. The project adapted to the changing country environment. For
example, when it was realized that the revolving fund for the Enterprise Development
Project was robust to provide term finance to the agriculture value changes, the project
did a course correction and reallocated the funds from the SCCF to other project
priorities.

Component 1: Support to Farmers and Agribusiness Enterprises

Supply Chain Credit Facility (SCCF)

1.     The SCCF sought to provide a line of credit on a demand-driven basis to support
investments aimed at improving the supply chains of existing and emerging farming
systems. The facility targeted agro-enterprises, traders or nucleus and commercial farms
working with smallholders, under out-grower schemes or other forms of contract
farming. It was initially implemented by the Apex Unit under the BoZ through PFIs
comprising commercial banks and other non-banking financial institutions.

2.     Initially, the facility was expected to disburse US$12.2 million, representing 32.8
percent of the total project allocation. However, as described in Section 2 of the ICR, the
Apex Unit did not lend any of these funds.

3.      Significant irregularities within the BoZ’s Apex Unit led to delays in disbursing
the SCCF, and eventual cancellation of the sub-component. In late 2007, the ADSP
mission uncovered irregularities within the BoZ’s Apex Unit—a creation of a previous
IDA operation—the EDP. These issues made the Unit unfit to manage the SCCF under
the Bank’s policies (OP 8.30) that govern line of credit operations. BoZ agreed on steps
to remedy the situation and put appropriate control mechanisms in place to safeguard the
project funds. Some milestones were achieved but with no tangible outcomes.

The Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) and ADSP

4.      Apart from benefitting from the World Bank’s Fund under Enterprise
Development Project (EDP), DBZ has also benefitted from capacity building under the
ADSP SCCF component. In 2011, DBZ was allocated US$80,000 for training to build
capacity in staff to be able to handle the SCCF that was meant to contribute towards
agricultural value chain production in the country and also equip staff to handle the IT
software. The staff has been trained in IT, Value Chain Financing (conference organized
by African Rural and Agricultural Credit Association (AFRACA), Financial Modeling,
Investment Appraisal of agricultural projects and General project appraisal and Risk
Management. A group of 17 staff was trained in February 2014. DBZ spent an amount
of US$80,287. The trained project officers have greatly improved on their performance,
and are now able to work with minimal supervision. There are few errors in the loan

appraisal process, thus minimizing the risk of the Bank losing money. Some have come
up with innovative ways on how to appraise and monitor projects as a result of the
training they have received.

5.      The total loan portfolio transferred from BoZ to DBZ amounted to over US$40
million in 2009 (see DBZ Completion Report for details on sub-borrowers and the
sectors lent to). Sub-borrowers’ financing included agriculture projects operating in
different parts of the country that were engaged in various farming activities and agro-
processing, such as mixed farming, fishing, ranching and processing maize into mealie
meal.

6.     Through the EDF, DBZ has been providing loans to many agricultural sector
value chain activities. As of 31st December 2013, the performance of the revolving fund
was impressive and DBZ was supporting over 6,762 farmers with an average loan size of
K1,700, thereby supporting commercialization of smallholder agriculture and therefore
contributing to the achievement of the ADSP development objective.

Market Improvement and Innovation Facility (MIIF)

7.      The MIIF aimed to provide financial resources on a matching grant basis for the
development of innovative business linkages between smallholder producers and other
actors in selected agricultural value chains. It was to help smallholder farmers and other
smallholder producers to evolve into successful entrepreneurs by linking them to viable
agribusinesses. The aim of the facility was to commercialize smallholder agriculture in
the Zambian agricultural value chain, by: (i) providing resources for knowledge-based
services and capital investments in innovative marketing, technical and managerial
interventions that benefit smallholder farmers by increasing productivity, and improving
quality and efficiency in the agricultural value chains; and (ii) promoting innovative
business linkages, technologies and market based solutions for various actors in the
agricultural value chains, and thereby improving the growth and competitiveness of
agribusinesses and smallholder farmers.         See figure below on MIIF value chain
approach.

8.     The facility provided ‘seed’ money for promoting the introduction of new
products or processes that improved the competitiveness of agricultural production by
smallholder farmers. The grant considered three main categories or windows: extension
and technology development; studies and pilots; and capacity building for Associations,
Cooperatives and Farmer Groups.

Table 3 below shows the three funding categories with their respective minimum and
maximum amount considered in the matching grant process.

Grant Management and Selection Process



                                                               29
9.      The MIIF was designed to be administered by an independent Non-Governmental
Organization (NGO) with experience in managing grants especially involving
agricultural sector enterprises. The management contract was awarded to Africare, an
international NGO dedicated to improving the quality of life in Africa. The contract with
ADSP commenced in November 2007 and expired in December 2011 when the Ministry
took over the management of the facility. In awarding the grant, MIIF considered
proposals from legally registered agribusiness, quasi-government actors/stakeholders in
the agricultural value chains, and legitimate rural farming groups in Zambia.

10.     The grant selection process comprised of multiple screening and technical review
stages before a sub-project was selected and approved by the National Project Steering
Committee (NPSC). The NPSC was a multi-sectoral body composed of agricultural
policy makers, technical experts and representatives from the private sector. The
duration of the application and approval process ranged from 6 to 8 weeks upon receipt
of an application. Grant applicants were required to prepare a Project Concept Note
(PCN), which was reviewed by the sub-committee of the National Project Steering
Committee (SC-NPSC). Full Business Proposals (FBPs) were only prepared upon
approval of the PCN, and at this point the MIIF team conducted a field appraisal to verify
the merits of the proposal. The final approval of the FBPs and the grant award was
carried out by the NPSC based on the evaluations and recommendations submitted by an
independent Technical Review Panel (TRP).

Outputs of MIIF

11.      Assessment of the grant facility shows that MIIF funded sub-projects was
selected based on their merits as assessed by a set of criteria. As it was a demand led
facility, proposals did not have a commodity or a geographical focus. The sub-projects
were spread across Zambia, and comprised a wide range of value chains, including staple
food crops, high value cash crops, dairy, livestock and fisheries.

12.     Of the 30 applications passed, 28 sub-projects were funded under the MIIF, with
a total value of US$3.408 million in matching grants. Two of them withdrew due to
various challenges (see Government ICR, Annex 4 for MIIF information by sub-project,
value chain, catchment area etc.). The successful applicants were able to provide their
contributions. Table 5 indicates that for the 28 sub-projects, the largest funding share
was approved to the extension and technology support window (79 percent), followed by
capacity building support (12 percent) and studies and pilots (9 percent).

15.      The majority of the sub- projects are located in the central and eastern part of the country
(Government ICR, August 2014). Although the sub-projects were selected based on their merit
and geographical location did not play a role, most sub-projects are in close proximity to the
capital city Lusaka. Lusaka is the country’s main business center and companies tend to have
their headquarters close to Lusaka to minimize transaction costs. Even though some businesses
have established branches throughout the country, they tend to have their processing plants,
distribution and marketing units in the Lusaka area.

16.     Table 7 shows the number of beneficiaries classified according to the funding categories.
The total estimated number of beneficiaries under the sub-projects is approximately 45,180 of
which 31,630 are direct beneficiaries and 13,550 are indirect beneficiaries.

Results from the baseline report (NIRAS Zambia 2012) show that beneficiaries were

Rural Roads Improvement Facility (RRIF)

17.    Under the Rural Roads Improvement Facility (RRIF) sub-component, ADSP
sought to improve smallholder farmers’ access to input and produce markets and the
competitiveness of their agricultural commodities by, among other things, improving
road networks in selected districts of Choma, Chongwe, Katete, Chipata and Lundazi.
These were identified and selected on the basis of their agricultural potential. A total of
1,131 kilometers were targeted in all the five districts. ADSP worked in collaboration
with the Road Development Agency (RDA) under this facility to implement Output and
Performance based Road Contracts (OPRC) in the targeted five districts and three
provinces of Zambia. Road works in Choma, Katete and Chipata were financed through
the proceeds of the ADSP while works in Chongwe and Lundazi districts were financed
through the support of the European Union through Government budget support. All
supervision contracts were financed by ADSP.

18.    The OPRCs are medium to long-term contracts with distinct features. They are
output-based as the output is measured and payments are based on quantities of work
done. They are performance-based as the assessment is focused on service level and
payment is paid per kilometer compliant with service levels. The Consultant or
supervisor verifies service levels and instructs emergency repairs as required. For
purposes of this Program, service level indicators included accessibility, travel speed,
ride quality (potholes, deformation, corrugations, rutting) and durability (drainage,


                                                 33
vegetation, road level, road width and shoulder level). In practice, the OPRC process
involved three main steps:
   • Step 1:Rehabilitation Works - Rehabilitate/Improve to achieve required service
       levels (output based);
   • Step 2:Maintenance Works - Maintain service level over time (performance based
       or mix of output and performance based); and
   • Step 3: Hand back to client in a specific condition.

19.   The works contracts were divided into four packages, namely; Package 1: Choma
OPRC (246km), Package 2: Chongwe OPRC (185km), Package 3: Katete/Chipata OPRC
(391 km) and Package 4: Lundazi OPRC (309 km) (See Government ICR, p. 19 for
OPRC status).

Results of the Rural Road Improvement Facility

20.     ADSP has successfully implemented a rural road contracting method OPRC, an
efficient and cost-effective approach to supporting increased commercialization of
smallholder farmers. The contractors were retained on site for a period of five years to
provide access and motorable road services to the rural communities and to maintain the
network of roads to acceptable service standards.

21.     The facility successfully applied to rehabilitate and improve 1,131 kilometers of
rural roads spread in three Provinces and five Districts of Zambia representing 3.4
percent of 33,000 kilometers which represent the core gravel road network in the country.
Other structures included culverts and water drifts. Following the completion of
improvement works in the first phase, maintenance activities continued to be
implemented over the remaining life of the program. These included vegetation and
erosion control, drainage management, clearing structures and emergency works.

22.      All roads were provided with road signage to enhance road safety. This included
Kilometer Maker Posts (KMP), Culvert Maker Posts (CMP), signs for bridges and curves
and other signs deemed necessary for road safety. The public were also educated about
taking good care of the road signage for its own good. Road humps were placed along
critical settlements such as schools, rural health centers and villages. Workers on site
were provided with safety clothing to comply with safety requirements at work places.
As part of maintenance, the contractors reinstated most borrow pits in line with the
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) in the Environmental Project Briefs (EPBs).
The contractors carried out HIV/Aids awareness campaigns once every two months and
Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) once every three months during the duration of
the contract period. These campaigns were targeted at providing vital health related
information to workers in the contractor’s work force and members of the community
living along the rehabilitated roads.

OPRC Impact Assessment

23.    In May 2012, RDA, acting on behalf of ADSP, commissioned IMCS Limited to


                                           34
conduct the second phase of the socio-economic impact study (IMCS Limited, 2013).
The specific objective of this study was to collect social and economic data that could be
used to measure the impact of improved roads on the wellbeing of rural communities
following execution of OPRCs under the RRIF.

24.    The study used panel data, i.e. involved the execution of a survey on the
households previously covered by the Baseline study of 2009 (IMCS Limited, 2010).
This was in order to establish the changes that have occurred amongst the target
population in terms of agricultural production and commercialization and, improvements
in general living conditions and based on the same sample of households.

25.     Some of the immediate impacts resulting from road improvements include access
and mobility impacts, which have significantly eased the movement of inputs, produce
and the general public in the catchment areas. These road improvements have resulted in
reduction in travel time from production areas to market centers, from input centers to
production areas and reduction in vehicle operation costs. There is evidence of increased
business activities along the roads (Tuesday and Thursday markets). These changes have
resulted in the improvement of the standard of living of households in the targeted areas.

26.     The volume of traffic has increased by over 270 percent from 52 vehicles per day
in 2007 to 194 vehicles per day in 2012. Average household income has also grown by
four fold from ZMW3,900 per year in 2009 during the baseline period to ZMW21,800
per year in 2012. Approximately 1,200 jobs were created during road rehabilitation and
structure constructions.

27.    Notable challenges that were experienced include the fact that   OPRC/OPBC was
not well understood by contractors. This affected the pace of work.     In some instances
contracts were grossly underpriced, and were difficult to terminate     mid-stream. The
geographical spread of contracts also posed a challenge from the        point of view of
supervision.

Component 2: Institutional Development

28.    ADSP provided support to departments within the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock to improve the capacity of the public sector to provide core public services
required to support enhanced smallholders’ access to markets and improve their
productivity and product quality.

Research Institutes

29.    As a critical element in supporting commercialization of smallholder agriculture,
ADSP supported research activities at three research institutions. These were the Seed
Control and Certification Institute (SCCI), Zambia Agricultural Research Institute
(ZARI), and the Cotton Development Trust (CDT).

       Seed Control and Certification Institute (SCCI)

       30.     ADSP supported the establishment and operation of a (genetic) finger printing
       bio-technology laboratory at the SCCI in Chilanga and the establishment of a seed testing
       laboratory in Choma. The biotechnology laboratory aimed to build the capacity of the
       SCCI to distinguish varieties genetically, as opposed to visual methods that were being
       used prior to ADSP. The establishment of the Choma Seed Testing Laboratory sought to
       localize seed testing services to enhance seed producers’ access to such services.

       31.     Implementation of planned activities at SCCI has been on course except for the
       construction of the seed store and screen house that were delayed due to procurement
       processes. They are under construction as both of the facilities are important in
       supporting operations at the biotechnology laboratory. Both the Biotechnology
       laboratory at Chilanga and the Seed Testing laboratory in Choma have since been
       established and are operational. Following the establishment of the biotechnology
       laboratory in Chilanga, three members of staff were trained in biotechnology and
       laboratory management. The laboratory has since commenced DNA extraction and has
       to date extracted DNA for 29 genotypes and developed Standard Operating Procedures
       (SOP). SOPs are part of the quality assurance management strategies. As part of
       sustainability, SCCI has signed an MOU with CIMMYT to collaborate in
       operationalizing the biotechnology laboratory.

       32.     Both the Chilanga biotechnology laboratory and the Choma seed testing
       laboratory have a full complement of trained staff following completion of the graduate
       level training and other practical trainings undertaken in 2012. In addition, a member of
       staff recently returned from M.Sc. degree studies in the Netherlands where he pursued
       biotechnology and trained as a molecular scientist, and is strengthening further molecular
       testing at the SCCI biotechnology laboratory. SCCI members of staff have also received
       hands-on practical training at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center
       (CIMMYT) Molecular laboratory in Nairobi, Kenya.

       33.     The Seed Testing laboratory in Choma was commissioned in June 2012 and to
       date has tested over 1,416 tons of seed in Southern Province. The seed testing laboratory
       also carries out seed inspections to ensure the production of quality seeds in the province.
       Since establishment, the laboratory has inspected seed belonging to both seed companies
       such as Seed Co and smallholder seed growers, both male and female.

      Zambia Agricultural Research Institute (ZARI)

      34.     ADSP support to ZARI aimed to strengthen the capacity of the institute to comply
      with emerging Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) requirements, to help Zambian
      agribusinesses take advantage of export opportunities. Some of the ZARI services that
      benefited from ADSP support include: issuance of phytosanitary certificates; fumigation
      inspections, nursery inspections, tobacco nursery inspections, and tobacco premises
      inspections. These services are provided to agribusinesses, smallholder farmer
      organizations, commercial farms and individuals.

      35.     ZARI has implemented several activities in line with its mandate. ZARI
      undertook important surveys and surveillance activities to improve the quality and safety
      of local products in order to enhance production and trade. Surveys conducted include
      American Foulbrood (AFB) on honey, Fruit fly, Banana Bunchy Top Disease, and
      Coffee Pest and fumigation inspections. The objective of surveillance activities was to
      control or suppress the population of various predators in fruit and other agricultural
      products in order to enhance fruit production and trade (ZARI Completion Report, 2013).

         These are hybrid maize samples returned unsold by seed companies from the previous season, which
      only needs to be tested for germination.
      12
         These are maize samples from small scale farmers (SSF) which are not sold on commercial basis through
      seed companies since it is open pollinated seed but it is sold within the community on cash basis at
      K50/5kg or exchanged using a barter system with other food crops.
      13
         No quantity was disclosed by the farmer as it was not grown for sale hence only subjected to germination
      test.


                                                             37
ZARI regularly undertook border backstopping missions in provinces that had border
towns to enforce sanitary and phytosanitary regulations of the laws of Zambia, provide
quality assurance to traders through border officers training and to maintain a uniform
working approach among inspectors in the borders so that there is consistency in services
delivered by PQPS.

36.     In addition, ZARI undertook many capacity building activities in which over 150
members of staff and about 402 smallholder farmers were trained. Some beneficiaries
include Plant Health Inspectors (PHI), who are critical in providing core public services
required to enhance smallholders’ access to markets, and to improve their productivity
and quality. The main objectives of the training have been to enlighten plant inspectors
and other beneficiaries on the importance and application of the plant pest and diseases
Act Cap 233 and the noxious weeds Act 231, the application of the international
standards for phytosanitary measures (ISPMs), pest risk analysis, disease identification,
inspections and sampling methods.

37.    In 2013, a survey covering 94 clients who receive services from ZARI was
conducted by an independent consultant, NIRAS Zambia to assess the: i) quality of
services; ii) utilization of services; and iii) beneficiary satisfaction of the services
rendered by ZARI. A summary of key results (NIRAS Zambia, 2013) are indicated
below:

38.     Quality of services - Respondents rated the quality of issuance of phytosanitary
certificates and fumigation inspection services as good with an average score of 76.2
percent relating to the service delivery. Respondents rated nursery, tobacco nursery and
tobacco premises inspections as fair with average scores of 62.7 percent for all indicators
relating to these services.

39.     Utilization of services - All respondents (100 percent) of phytosanitary
certificates, tobacco nursery, tobacco premises and fumigation inspections felt that ZARI
services had met their business needs. Only 31 percent of respondents of nursery
inspections felt that ZARI services did not meet their business needs.

40.    Beneficiary satisfaction - Respondents of phytosanitary certificates and
fumigation inspections were satisfied with the services having scored an average of 76
percent, while nursery inspections, tobacco nursery and tobacco premises inspections
were rated as fair by respondents with an average score of 59.7 percent.

41.     These results demonstrate that ZARI clients represented by agribusinesses,
smallholder farmer organizations, commercial farms and individuals have been satisfied
with the services delivered by ZARI and that the services had met their business needs.
However, there is need to improve service delivery in the area of inspections. ZARI
should consider adopting the assessment framework used in this study to measure quality
of services for future assessments. In addition, ZARI should consider the results of these
surveys in their annual review and planning meetings and include suggestions from
beneficiaries in its annual work plans and budgets.

Cotton Development Trust (CDT)

42.     The cotton industry is a very important sector in Zambia’s economy. The CDT is
the only institution in the country that is mandated to supply foundation cotton seed to
the industry. For some time, supply has been far below demand. Support to CDT was
therefore intended to strengthen the capacity of the CDT to supply an increased amount
of pre-basic seed to the cotton industry. To achieve this goal, the Project supported: (i)
the construction of a weir and installation of an irrigation system; (ii) establishment of the
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Unit; (iii) procurement of farm equipment and motor
vehicles; and (iv) construction of the seed storage shed and IPM Laboratory. Following
equipping of CDT with the infrastructure, pre-basic cotton seed production has increased
by over 240 percent from a baseline of about 20 tons in 2005 to 60.9 tons in 2013
(Figure 1).

43.     CDT effectively utilized the supplementary irrigation water on 80 hectares of land
to achieve this level of performance. CDT also trained over 50 staff and over 1,000
farmers since the start of ADSP. However, the Trust experienced management and
leadership challenges that resulted in the decline of production during the 2010/11
season.

44.     The IPM laboratory was completed in December 2012 and the IPM team moved
into the new building in February 2013. Currently the laboratory is not utilized to full
capacity due to inadequate appropriate laboratory equipment. Hence it is being used for
conducting various entomological research activities in cotton, conducting IPM training
sessions for smallholder farmers and technical staff, storage of field samples in a safe and
confined environment, increasing the visibility of the research unit to its stakeholders,
testing for the resistance of cotton pests to pesticides, and for determining the effects of
climate change on cotton pests.

45.      The IPM has performed exceptionally well in collaborating with cotton ginners to
provide training to farmers participating in cotton out-grower schemes on various sites across the
country. Training sessions have focused on land preparation, cotton planting, weed control,
fertilizer application and early pest management. Other training sessions focused on proper
management of field harvest and determining the cost of production. Table 8 shows the
participation of smallholder farmers in training during the 2012/13 farming season.

season to 1,158kg/ha in the 2012/13 season. The table summarizes the performance of
the IPM model group since 2008 to the close of ADSP.

47.     ADSP also supported CDT to renovate its library to reconvert it back to its core
library function. The renovation works included fixing the roof, sockets and painting of
the walls. After the renovations all the books have been arranged properly according to
their topics. At present, CDT is still receiving collections of books that can be used to
add to the existing stock of books in the library.

Policy and Planning Department

48.   The Program supported three Units under the Policy and Planning Department
(PPD). These were the Agricultural Statistics and Early Warning Unit (ASEWU), the
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Unit, and the Policy Analysis Unit (PAU).

Agricultural Statistics and Early Warning Unit (ASEWU)

49.     The Unit’s mandate was to provide timely and early warning information on food
security and other important agricultural statistics. The mandate included maintenance of
an agricultural database, Country Stat Zambia and the Ministry Website, and



                                               40
dissemination of information through reports and publications. The ADSP supported
strengthening of ASEWU’s capacity to perform these functions.

50.    The Unit prepared an Early Warning Extension Training Manual as one of its
outputs. This is being used by extension staff in the field to provide early warning
information to the farming community such as on epidemics, weather patterns and
possible disasters. The Unit also developed 12 Gross Margin Models (Financial Models)
to equip smallholder farmers, investors and decision makers with capacity to make
evidence based investment choices. The models focus on selected crops such as Maize,
Mixed beans, Soya beans, Paprika, Tobacco (Barley & Virginia), Cotton, Sunflower,
Groundnuts, and Vegetables (Tomatoes, Rape and Cabbage). These crops are very
important to smallholder farmers both as staple food crops and cash crops.

51.     The Unit also developed models focused on selected Livestock such as Beef,
Dairy, Goats, Pigs and Poultry. The models now include honey, which is a popular
smallholder commodity in North-Western, Central and Western Provinces. Other
variables that have since been included are: input market prices surveyed at district
centers, market prices of crops and livestock products, commonly used crop and livestock
chemicals, labor costs based on household composition, household expenditure and food
consumption. The models are more user-friendly due to their focus on farm households.

52.     The Unit has, through an external consultant facilitated the development of the
Ministry Website which is operational but still being populated with data and
information. The site address is: http://www.agriculture.gov.zm. In 2012, the Unit
undertook a special crops survey to collect data on crops such as coffee, tea, sugar cane,
pineapples, and cashew nuts, which by nature of their distribution presents a challenge to
be covered during the regular Post Harvest Survey (PHS). The results have helped fill
the data gap associated with these high value crops in the results framework.

Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (M&E)

53.    Support to the M&E Unit aimed to strengthen the capacity of the Unit to
undertake results based M&E in the agricultural sector. An earlier activity that was
implemented was the development of database on agribusinesses interacting with
smallholder farmers. This activity was subsequently considered a non-core activity for
the Unit and the database was handed over to the Agribusiness and Marketing
Department of the Ministry as the appropriate department to host the database.

54.     With regard to strengthening of the Ministry M&E System, the Unit is
responsible for providing leadership to the review process. The Project supported the
training of two staff in results-based M&E as part of capacity building. The M&E review
process is currently supported by the Smallholder Agricultural Productivity Project,
while the ADSP continues to actively participate in the process as a member of the
Technical Working Group. All activities have therefore been fully implemented and
completed.




                                           41
Policy Analysis Unit (PAU)

55.     The Policy Analysis Unit (PAU) was to undertake analysis and production of
policy papers including analytical work on a range of issues concerning agricultural
sector policy. The Unit was expected to undertake seven policy studies and preparation
of the ADSP Communications Strategy by the end of the project. However, the PAU
faced several challenges including weak staff capacity and lengthy procurement
processes that resulted in delays and non-accomplishment of the planned tasks. The
PAU produced only two policy studies and policy briefs, representing 28.6 percent
achievement. The two policy studies were: (i) impact of HIV/AIDS on out-grower
schemes; and (ii) impact of informal crossborder maize trade. As part of capacity
building, three PAU staff members received training in policy analysis and research
methodology. In the final stages of ADSP, the Ministry engaged a private firm to help
further build capacity of PAU staff in policy research, methodology and analysis, and
also to ensure that more staff participated in the program. A final policy study is
expected as part of this capacity building final effort.

Agribusiness and Marketing Department

56.    Support to the Department of Agribusiness and Marketing was channeled through
the Agricultural Market Information Centre (AMIC) and Agribusiness and Trade (ABT).
AMIC sought to upgrade the market information system to help improve the delivery of
up-to-date and accurate market data to satisfy the needs of farmers, traders and
processors. ABT support was to build capacity to facilitate agricultural trade and
negotiations.

57.     AMIC carries out programs/activities that help smallholder farmers improve their
farming business. One area of focus is the marketing aspect. AMIC collects and
disseminates agricultural market information using a number of channels including radio
and bulletin. ADSP support commenced with a needs assessment that was carried out by
an international consultant. The assessment established three aspects. These were the
need for: (i) AMIC to build capacity in staff to improve information management; (ii)
AMIC to use other media such as local radio to disseminate market information to
smallholder farmers and the general public; and (iii) the need for AMIC to engage private
sector to participate in disseminating market information.

58.     In response to these recommendations, AMIC implemented a capacity building
strategy that included procurement of equipment and training of staff at Headquarters,
Provinces and Districts in market information management. Over 100 staff in Southern
and Eastern Provinces were trained in FAO-Agrimart database management. With
regard to improving the dissemination of market information, AMIC implemented a pilot
program to partner with Community Radio Stations that was successfully launched in
Southern Province in 2010, and was rolled out in 2012 to the Eastern province. A total of
six community radio stations are now working with AMIC. There is also evidence of
increased private sector participation in sponsoring the dissemination of market
information, which is an important element for long-term sustainability.



                                           42
59.      An assessment of the performance of community radio program in various
districts shows that the program has made considerable progress in disseminating market
information using local radio stations despite challenges experienced in some districts.
In 2013, a survey was conducted by an independent consultant, NIRAS Zambia, of 20
Agribusinesses, 9 Farmer Organizations and 376 individual farmers who received AMIC
radio programs to assess: (i) the quality of services; (ii) the utilization of services; and
(iii) beneficiary satisfaction of the services delivered by AMIC. A summary of key
results (NIRAS Zambia, 2013) showed that beneficiaries were satisfied with the services
delivered by AMIC although a few areas of improvement were identified (see ADSP
ICR, NCO, Lusaka, July 2014, p. 24).

60.     With regard to ABT, a collaborative effort with ZARI was arranged to construct
modern border facilities at three border posts, namely, Chanida (Eastern Province),
Chiyengi (North-Western Province) and Kasasha (Northern Province). This activity was
dropped because of inadequate funds. However, ABT has been able to establish a trade
database using an external consultant. The database will store all agricultural trade
related information and has been designed to be robust enough to be updated regularly.

Component 3: Project Management and Coordination

61.      The Project Management and Coordination structure was composed of the National
Project Steering Committee (NPSC) and the National Coordination Office (NCO). The NPSC
considered and approved Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPB), provided guidance on
project implementation and resolved any issues of policy nature. The Committee considered and
approved all sub-projects under the MIIF. The Committee was composed of eleven multi-sector
members including the implementing Ministry, Ministry of Finance and National Planning,
Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, Ministry of Transport,
Works, Supply and Communications, Road Development Agency, National Road Fund Agency,
Bank of Zambia, Development Bank of Zambia and the Zambia National Farmers Union. The
National Project Coordinator was secretariat to the Committee. The NPSC was scheduled to
meet every quarter. The Committe performed well in discharging its functions. However,
members were high profile executives and usually proved a challenge to mobilize for an event.

62.      The NCO was responsible for the day-today management and coordination of Program
activities. The core team was composed of five professional staff including the National Project
Coordinator, Project Accountant, M&E Specialist, Safeguard Specialist, and Project Assistant.
This core team was assisted by two support staff, namely Project Driver and Office Assistant.
Later, the team was beefed up by the services of an Agribusiness Specialist and the MIIF Field
Coordinator, when the Ministry took over the management of the MIIF in 2012. They were hired
by the Ministry to manage the MIIF sub-component within the NCO. The NCO promoted
project financial facilities to the members of the public through sensitization meetings,
workshops, training events, annual conferences and through the distribution of reports and
brochures. The NCO actively participated in the International Trade Fairs, and Zambia
Agricultural and Commercial Shows in order to enhance its visibility.

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

63.     Five value chains have been included in the calculation of the ADSP financial and
economic NPV and IRR. 14 These are Dairy, based on the activities at Choma District
Dairy Cooperative Union (CDDCU), Mushroom, based on the operations of Mpongwe
Bulima Organic Cooperative Society (MBOCS), Pre-basic seed cotton, based on the
activities at the Cotton Development Trust (CDT), Tobacco, based on the operations of
the Central Growers’ Association (CGA), and Soya beans, based on the processing of
soya beans into ‘Yummy soya’ by COMACO. These value chains benefitted from
project interventions through MIIF, RRIF and Institutional development components.
The study included field data collection and desk reviews of all project documents related
to ensure that ADSP program benefits were measured to the extent possible. Final
analysis also did not include a detailed assessment of relatively minor value chain crops
such as sun flower, ground nuts and paprika, given their low ranking in terms of export
volumes and relative contribution to national economy. Analysis was based on following
assumptions and therefore is limited within those restrictions. Some data challenges
were faced during this assessment and are indicated below.

Assumptions
• The calculations are done at enterprise level for CDDCU, MBOCS, CGA and
   COMACO, which were supported under the MIIF sub-component and at institutional
   level for the CDT, which was supported under institutional development sub-
   component. No farm level models have been developed since there was no support
   directly to the farmers but to their association at aggregate level.
• The “before the project intervention” scenario was assumed to be zero such that only
   the costs and benefits that took place during the project period are included in the
   calculations of the NPV and IRR.
• In the financial analysis, the following assumptions were made:
 o Since the enterprises are in business, the actual costs and benefits provided by the
   enterprises were considered to be valued at market prices such that no adjustments
   were made to the values;
 o It was assumed that each enterprise paid 15 percent income tax and 16 percent value
   addition tax to the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) such that those were factored in
   the calculations as a cost to the enterprises; i.e., the net incremental benefit after
   financing and taxes was used in the calculations of the NPV and the IRR;
 o No other direct transfer payments (direct subsidies, credit transactions including
   loans, receipts, repayments of principal and interest, accounts payable and accounts
   receivable) were included the financial accounts since they were not applicable to the
   sampled value chains;
 o The price used for labor was the price actually paid; and
 o No land cost was included in the analysis as each enterprise already had the land and
   no additional investments were made.
• 2009 constant prices and not current prices were used in the financial analysis.

                                             44
•     In the economic analysis, the direct transfer payments (taxes only in this case) were
      removed from financial accounts when coming up with economic costs, i.e., the net
      incremental benefit after financing and not the net incremental benefit after financing
      and taxes was used in the calculations of the NPV and the IRR.
•     No adjustments were made to the financial figures to get the economic figures
      because only market prices were used.

Financial Incremental Net Benefit

The detailed calculations for Financial Inflows, Financial Outflows, Financial
Incremental Net Benefits before Financing, Financial Incremental Net Benefits after
Financing, Taxes, and Financial Incremental Net Benefits after Financing and Taxes are

Summary of Financial and Economic NPV
•   At 21% cost of CDT irrigation and farm equipment, Financial NPV before financing = 8,967,879.38;
•   At 21% cost of CDT irrigation and farm equipment, Financial NPV after financing = 10,392,119.47;
•   At 21% cost of CDT irrigation and farm equipment, financial NPV after financing and taxes = 2,208,079.24;
•   At 21% cost of CDT irrigation and farm equipment, Economic NPV = 8,967,879.38.

Summary of Financial and Economic IRR
The analysis indicates that the Financial IRR calculated based on the incremental net benefit after
financing and taxes (which represents the financial return to equity after taxes) is below 50% but
above 45% i.e., it is between 45 percent and 50 percent. The analysis indicates that the
Economic IRR calculated based on the incremental net benefit before financing is above 50%.



                                                         45
See footnote below on some of the missing data. 15 However using proxy data for cost factoring,
the ERR values were changed to a range between 18 and 29.5 percent. The data included for
each of the value chain used for this analysis is indicated in the excel sheets attached to the
original analysis report 16.




15
   Other Considerations: Missing and proxy data. The IRR calculations were done without some operating
costs from the value chains included in the calculations as follows: (i) CDDCU: Production (Processing)
costs including ingredients required, labor costs, electricity costs, equipment maintenance and replacement
costs, processing loss); Selling costs including fuel costs, sales man’s costs, vehicle replacement costs,
vehicle maintenance and repairs costs, loading and off-loading costs); Administrative costs (stationery,
printing, communication); Dividends paid to members; (ii) CGA: Operational costs (motor bikes running
costs and other transport costs, etc.) and Administrative costs (salaries, stationery, printing, communication
costs, etc.).

INTRODUCTION 17

1.      In May 2012, the Roads Development Agency (RDA), acting on behalf of the World
Bank funded, Agricultural Development Support Programme (ADSP) commissioned IMCS
Limited to conduct the second phase of the socio-economic impact study. The objectives of this
study was to collect social and economic data that can be used to measure the impact of improved
Agricultural Feeder Road Networks (AFRNs) executed under the ADSP’s Rural Roads
Improvement Facility (RRIF) on the rural communities.

2.      The study used “panel” data, i.e., involved the execution of a survey on the households
previously covered by the Baseline study of 2009. This was in order to establish the changes that
have occurred amongst the target population in terms of agricultural production and
commercialisation and, improvements in general living conditions. The Impact Assessment
Framework (IAF) developed after the Baseline study covered the following:

     a. Process impacts, related to income generating opportunities resulting from road
        rehabilitation.
     b. Access impacts of providing the road infrastructure.
     c. Mobilisation input, impacts on transport service, growth in traffic volume etc.

3.       The 2012 survey instrument was refined after full consultation with the ADSP
coordination and World Bank technical team. This was intended core IAF aspects and to
facilitate gender disaggregation to provide a more structured base for wider analytical use of the
data captured by each of the key stakeholders. This also means that some of the 2012 data
variables cannot be directly compared to the 2009 Baseline study.

4.       The data collection was conducted between August and November 2012. A preliminary
report of the main findings was presented to the stakeholders, i.e., ADSP, RDA and World Bank
at a special interactive session held in December 2012. Following this initial presentation, more
detailed analysis was conducted in order to incorporate the comments received and consolidation
of data. A full draft report was presented to the RDA, ADSP and the World Bank in April 2013.

5.      Following the presentation of the draft report, each of the respective stakeholders
provided detailed comments for incorporation in the final report. This report therefore has
incorporated the comments received and consolidates all aspects of the socio-economic study
necessary to inform the IAF as defined in the Terms of Reference (TOR), reproduced at Annex A.
The remainder of this chapter provides a summary of the survey results.

KEY FINDINGS OF THE STUDY

Survey Sample Covered
6.      Due to the changes in the designation of Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs) after the
2010 National Population census, challenges were faced in being able to locate all the households
previously covered by the Baseline study. In other instances, household had either relocated or,
preferred not to participate in the data collection exercise.

(ADSP), Final Report, IMCS Limited, July 2013.


                                                49
7.     This challenge was particularly acute in Choma district of Southern province where only
52% of the Treatment sample and 74% of the Control sample were covered by the 2012 survey.
The summary breakdown of the 2012 survey sample covered compared to the Baseline is shown
below.

                                        HOUSEHOLDS COVERED
 DISTRICT                     TREATMENT                     CONTROL
                   Baseline      2012    Variance  Baseline   2012                     Variance

Choma                816          426      -390      720       531                       -189
Katete               461          386       -75      460       350                       -110
Total               1,616        1,095     -521     1,520     1,164                      -356

8.       Against a target of 3,136 households, the 2012 survey covered a total of 2,347, i.e., 75%
of the target population. Data that could however support meaningful and consistent analysis was
collected from 2,259 households. This number of households has formed the basis for the
analytical work undertaken and comparisons with the Baseline study.

Demographic Characteristics
9.       The main difference between the Baseline study and the 2012 survey is the reduced
sample population covered. The 2012 survey report is based on data covering a total of 2,259
households as against 3,136 used in the Baseline study. The factors accounting for this situation
are elaborated in the report. More significantly were the lower than anticipated outturn for
Choma district, i.e., only 74% of the target sample were covered (involving a reduction by 48%
from the Treatment sample and 26% from the Control sample). This clearly caused some
distortion in the comparability of the two study periods.

10.     Outside of the reduced sample, the 2012 survey disaggregated the population by gender,
enabling the capture of additional data on female headed households. This indicated that female
heads of households were around 22-25% in both the Treatment and Control areas of Chipata and
Katete districts as against 20-22% recorded by the Baseline study. For Choma district, female
headed households were around15% in both Treatment and Control areas as against 16%
recorded by the Baseline study. Other notable characteristics included the following:

    i.    The average household size reduced from 6.4 recorded during the Baseline to 6.2 in
          Treatment areas. Conversely, in the Control areas, the average household size increased
          from 5.9 to 6.5 as recorded by the 2012 survey. Again, the drop in the survey panel may
          account for this sharp reduction;

    ii. The majority of the heads of HHs were in the 31-40 age bracket similar to the patterns
        noted by the Baseline study. The heads of HHs in the 20-30 age bracket were around
        11% as against the Baseline of 16%. Those above 60 years old accounted for about 18%
        as against 16% recorded by the Baseline study;

    iii. Amongst the female heads of HHs, the majority (i.e. 34% of Treatment sample and 37%
         of Control sample) were over 61 years old. Those in the 41-50 age bracket accounted for
         about 23% (Control) and 19% (Treatment). Those below 30 years accounted for around
         6%;

    iv. About 59% of the female heads of HHs (in both Treatment and Control areas) were
        widowed whilst, around 22-24% were divorced or separated, less than 3% had never been
        married whilst, around 10% were in polygamous marriages.


                                                50
    v. Around 60% of both the Control and Treatment sample had only attained primary
       education. Those with secondary education accounted for about 24% of the Control
       sample and 21% of the Treatment sample.

    vi. Around 16% of the Control sample and about 18% of the Treatment sample had never
        entered school. This is slighly lower than the Baseline position where those with no
        education accounted for 21% of the Control sampe and 18% of the Treatment sample.

    vii. Amongst the male headed HHs, around 60% of the Control and 59% of the Treatment
         sample only had primary education level attainments. About 28% of the Treatment
         sample (and 13% of the Control sample) had never entered school.

11.     The Baseline study did not provide sufficient data relating to demographics of the
sampled areas to the extent covered by the 2012 survey. As a result it is not practicable to carry
out a wider variety of direct comparisons between the two study periods.

Status of Treatment and Control Roads
12.     A key objective of rehabilitating road networks under the ADSP is to improve access to
markets and public facilities by the rural farming communities. With respect to the impact of the
road rehabilitation on the communities, reliance was placed on the recording of observations
made by key informants representing the main users of the roads from within each respective
community, i.e., directly affected by access conditions. This information was further collaborated
with RDA road rehabilitation 2011 status reports and classified traffic count annual reports for
2011 covering the respective Treatment roads.

Since the Baseline study, a number of Treatment roads have undergone rehabilitation thereby
improving access conditions for the local communities. Although the RDA status reports shows
that all the rehabilitation works have now been completed, the responses from the key informant
in the SEAs covered by the study indicated that, there are some roads that are reported to be
under rehabilitation in the Treatment areas, such as: A1 (D128)– Mwami (Feni) and the A7 –
Topeka – Rukuzye roads in Chipata district; and B2 (U2) Kalomo/Dundemwezi road in Choma
district; and, the A1 (U29) Chiwengela/Chinzule road in Katete district.

13.      Whilst the RDA status reports indicate that nearly all Treatment roads had been fully
rehabilitated, the perception of the users (represented by key informant anecdotal assessments)
gave a different picture. The resulting road access conditions remained varied in some areas,
indicating that, although “work in progress” was visible, there were however still some roads that
were reported to be in poor condition. The table below shows that there about 62% of the roads
had been subject of significant rehabilitation works on the roads in both treatment and control
areas of the study.

14.     What the below summary status indicates are from key informant perspectives. This
would suggest incomplete road works or more rapid deterioration of those officially recorded as
having been fully rehabilitated.

15.     The assessment of frequency of road usage by motor vehicles also indicated mixed
results when compared to the Baseline period. In Chipata district, fewer motor vehicles were
recorded by the 2012 study as using the roads in the Treatment areas as against the Baseline
period. The RDA study for Chipata for this period reported increased volume of vehicles during




                                               51
this period. In the case of Control roads, there was a notable increase in usage by motor vehicles
in the rain season from the Baseline situation.

Choma              28               18           64           31             21             67
Katete             22               15           68           17             13             76
Total              67               42           62           62             38             61

16.     In Choma and Katete districts, there were major increases in the frequency of road usage
in both Treatment and Control roads. The volume and type of traffic was, apart from the status of
the roads also dependent on economic activities, such as maize marketing, fertilizer distribution
as well as location of the agriculture depots. (The comparative analysis between the two periods
is presented in the full table on page v of the Survey.) It should be noted that the data was
compiled from key informant estimates based on their observations, i.e., was not based on fully
fledged traffic counts and calculations of travel time.

Access to Public Facilities
17.     The assessment of access to public facilities (measured by the proximity to the
population, i.e. within walking distances) indicated a general improvement in all districts from the
position recorded during the Baseline study. In Chipata district, primary schools are more
accessible (e.g. 100% for primary schools in Treatment areas and 93% in Control areas from 57%
and 71% recorded by the Baseline study, respectively). Even health centres and agricultural
depots are more accessible to larger proportions of the population in Chipata district. This was
also generally the case with the Treatment areas in Choma and Katete districts.

18.      With respect to utilisation of public facilities by the local population, the 2012 study
captured additional segments of data than was included in the survey instruments used during the
Baseline study. For example, gender disaggregation was incorporated in the 2012 study. Overall,
access to educational facilities (especially primary schools) had increased appreciably in all the 3
districts. The proportions of local community members visiting health facilities however
remained low largely due to two main factors, namely:

 • A number of health clinics accessible to the communities tend to be located at least 2 Kms
   away. For those located outside communities, most are located at least 5 Kms away. In the
   case of hospitals, these are mostly located away from communities involving average
   distances in excess of 14 Kms for Chipata district and over 40 Kms in the cases of Choma
   and Katete districts; and,

 • Access to public health facilities involve having the money to pay for transport and medicines
   by users. This encourages local community members to use the services of traditional healers
   and to self-medicate, i.e., simply purchasing medicines from local grocery shop and chemists.

19.     The proportions reported as having visited health facilitates in the last 12 months were
very low, i.e., around 20% in the Treatment areas of Chipata and Choma that visited health
clinics. Overall, health facilities are still being used by relatively fewer proportions of the
population (i.e. less than 25%) in both Treatment and Control areas across all districts.

Social Well Being


                                                52
20.     The 2012 survey established that there have been notable improvements in the quality of
life amongst the population in all the 3 districts in both Treatment and Control areas. This was
more evident in the treatment areas.

21.     Proportionately, more households improved the quality of their dwellings, e.g., using iron
sheets for roofing instead of thatch; increased use of burnt bricks for walls; using cement build
concrete floors of houses; and, using standard doors, as shown below.

   i.    More households are drawing water from communal boreholes rather than wells (i.e.,
         boreholes tend to be less contaminated and can hold water in dry periods of the year
         better than wells which are never dug as deep). On the other hand, more households were
         drinking untreated water probably due to increased use of boreholes which are considered
         less contaminated than wells.

   ii.   The proportion of households with toilets also increased from the levels recorded during
         the Baseline study, especially in Katete district. The majority of the households are
         however still dependent on single pit latrines.

   iii. Firewood remains (by far) the main source of energy for cooking across all districts with
        little change from the Baseline period. In the case of lighting, households no longer
        depend on kerosene (around 79 – 85% during the Baseline relied on kerosene) but use
        modern Chinese made lamps (80 – 82%) for lighting.

Ownership of Non-Farming Assets
22.      There was a notable increase in the proportion of households investing in household
assets, such as: mobile phones, radios, bicycles, hammer mills, television sets and solar panels
than the case recorded during the Baseline study. The comparative analysis for the two study
periods covering selected households assets is presented in the Survey page viii).

    i.   An increased number of households are spending more money on public transport,
         toiletries, batteries, vehicle/oxcart repairs and fuel than previously recorded. Expenditure
         on education, clothing and household wares tended to dominate the items where larger
         amounts of money were concentrated.

    ii. There has been substantial increase in the amount of money expended on food items than
        the case recorded during the Baseline study. When monetised (as most basic items are
        produced by the households rather than purchased), more households were consuming an
        increased range of food items with such as: meat, poultry and fish.

23.      Improved livelihoods can be attributed to increased access to incomes used to finance
costs of food and non-food items. This is also a likely consequence of improved linkages
between settlements and sources of goods and services, i.e. both for marketing produce and better
distribution of consumption items. This also means that the sources of income become an
important factor in the improvements recorded to the quality of living standards.

Economic Well Being
24.      The 2012 survey established that there have been notable improvements in the economic
wellbeing of the study population in comparison to the Baseline situation. Households own a
greater proportion of tangible assets and mechanization of agricultural farming practices is
increasing. This is also demonstrated by the higher yields being achieved with little expansion of
field crop areas cultivated.



                                                 53
i.    Proportionately, more households were recorded as engaging in other non-farm business
      activities during the 2012 survey than the Baseline. Amongst the Control sample, the
      proportion engaging in trading and other business activities increased from 14% to 25%
      between the two study periods. In the case of the Treatment sample, the increase was
      much lower, i.e., from 20% to 22%.

ii.   Amongst the HHs engaged in non-farm business activities, the main activities were:
      market vending; local brewing and selling of alcohol; firewood/charcoal production and
      retail-trading (i.e., 14% in Treatment areas and 11-26% in Control areas).

iii. A separate analysis carried out of female heads of HHs engaged in non-farm business
     activities indicated the following:

      -   Within the Control sample, about 59% of the total female respondents were engaged
          in business activities (i.e., Chipata: 30%; Choma: 56%; and Katete: 31%). The
          female headed households engaged in business within the Treatment sample was
          19% (i.e., Chipata: 24%; Choma: 21%; and Katete: 15%).

      -   Amongst the Control population, women were mostly engaged in local brewing and
          selling of alcohol, market vending, running retail shops and tailoring. Local brewing
          and selling of alcohol had proportionately higher numbers of female participants in
          Chipata (28%) and Katete (30.8%) districts. In Choma district only 2.3% were
          engaged in brewing and selling of alcohol whilst, about 21.4% were earning incomes
          from market vending. Running retail shops also accounted for about 29% of women
          engaged in business from Chipata district.

          Within the Treatment sample, the most common business activities were brewing of
          alcohol, market vending, running retail shops and weaving. In Chipata district, the
          proportions engaged in brewing alcohol, market vending, retail trading and tailoring
          were evenly spread. For Choma district, weaving was the main activity (i.e., 23%),
          followed by running of retail shops, livestock trading and market vending (each
          accounting for about 15.4%). Notably, only in Choma district was women engaged
          in livestock trading.

iv.   Rural households tend to seek short-term wage earning opportunities between farming
      seasons to supplement cash incomes.

v.    Contractual piece work (e.g. cleaning bushes, digging trenches) was the most dominant
      source of wage income, i.e. accounting for more than 60% in Katete district, around 51%
      in Choma district and 44% in Chipata district within the Treatment population.

vi.   Outside of contractual piece work, the next dominant activities were livestock trading
      especially in Chipata and Katete districts and, short-term employment with the
      government. During the Baseline study livestock trading was not significant and
      therefore not captured separately.

vii. Engagement in construction activities, such as being field hands in road construction
     projects was not (relatively) a major source of wage incomes. During the Baseline about
     6% were engaged in such construction activities. At the time of the 2012 survey, apart
     from the population in the Control areas of Chipata district where the proportion was
     about 6%, this accounted for less than 3% of those engaged in wage employment.



                                             54
  viii. During the Baseline study, average annual earnings from construction, wholesale/retail
        trading, working in smallholder and commercial farms were between K450.00 and
        K800.00. In the 2012 survey, average earnings amongst the population engaged in wage
        employment in Chipata district was much higher than the Baseline, i.e. earnings from
        contractual piece work and construction being higher than K1 thousand.

  ix.   During the survey, respondents were asked to indicate if they had received cash gifts in
        the last 12 months only amounts in excess of K20.00 were recorded. Overall, an
        increased proportion of households received cash gifts than the situation recorded during
        the Baseline.

  x.    During the Baseline study, there were no cash gifts recorded from the government and
        NGOs. During the 2012 survey however, social cash transfer programmes had become
        more wide spread targeting vulnerable households.

  xi.   The cash gift represented relatively small amounts received which are only likely to act
        as supplementation to other sources of livelihoods for the recipients.

  xii. Generally more than 90% of the respondents across all the 3 districts rely on farming (i.e.
       are self employed) as their main occupation and source of livelihoods. The next major
       occupation was salaried/wage employment in the public sector, i.e. accounting for 3% of
       Control sample in Chipata and Choma districts and 1.3% in Katete (Control sample) and
       Choma Treatment sample. In Chipata district, about 5% of the Control sample reported
       that they were too old to work (about 2% of Treatment sample and similar propotion for
       Katete district’s total sample population).

  xiii. These trends are consistent with the situation recorded during the Baseline study where
        between 93% and 100% of the sampled population (both Treatment and Control) were
        wholly dependent on subsistence agriculture. A key difference between the two periods
        was the proportionately larger number engaged in salaried employement, i.e. around 3%.

  xiv. For the female headed HHs, around 93% were engaged in subsistence agriculture whilst,
       between 5% and 7% reported that they were disabled or too old to work. Only about
       0.5% of both the Control and Treatment sample were engaged in salaried employment
       whilst, less than 1% of the Control sample were self employed in the non-agro sector
       (e.g. trading). The situation relating to the female headed HHs would also indicate that
       those who are able to work are fully engaged in agricutlure with very limited choices of
       alternative sources of livelihoods.

Agricultural Production and Sales
  i.   Agricultural activities undertaken by smallholder farmers are in three broad main
       categories, namely:
   •           Producing their own outputs that they consume domestically (for food security)
   and the surplus that they market,
   •           Consolidating output through a cooperative society that then markets the crop
   and organises the sharing of the sales proceeds; and,
   •           Operating under Outgrower schemes.

  ii.   As against the Baseline findings, greater proportions of the households in both Control
        areas (i.e. 47% from 13%) and, Treatment areas (i.e. 49% from 18%) across the SEAs




                                               55
        surveyed in the three districts, were linked and participated in the Outgrower schemes
        during the 2011 – 2012 farming season.

        Proportion of Farmers Belonging to Outgrower Schemes (%)

                                 CONTROL                       TREATMENT
      DISTRICT
                           Baseline      2012            Baseline      2012
                 Chipata      9           39               18           48
                 Choma        1           27                1           21
                  Katete     29           82               36           78
                   Total     13           47               18           49

 iii. There was a general increase in the proportion of farmers growing major crops than the
      case reported during the Baseline. (see Charts 1 and 2 in Survey, page xii for a
      comparative analysis for Treatment and Control areas, respectively.).

 iv.    The average number of bags sold per household increased from the Baseline conditions,
        as shown in Chart 3 of the Survey (page xiii).

 v.     There were notable improvements in the average earnings of households from crops sales
        as show in Chart 4 of the Survey (page xiii).

 vi.    There was an overall improvement in the agricultural production activities of the survey
        sample population from the position recorded by the Baseline study. This could be
        attributed to increasing commercial integration of the small holder farmers. It may also
        indicate that improved road access conditions are enhancing agricultural market linkages.

OVERALL CONCLUSIONS

  i.    There were also notable improvements in the quantities of crops grown and, earnings
        generated from crop sales. The dependency on agricultural incomes also increased from
        the Baseline situation. Increasing proportions of households are relying less on wage
        employment, carrying out non-farm business activities and receiving gifts from relatives.
        There has however been a new phenomenon of social cash transfers from government
        and NGOs, especially to households in the Treatment areas which was not the case at the
        time of Baseline study.

  ii. The improvements highlighted above are more notable amongst the households in the
      Treatment areas. This would also indicate that whilst the pace of improving road access
      conditions has been slow, the impact of progress is filtering to households, i.e.
      influencing living standards, market access and level of agricultural commercialization.

  iii. The 2012 survey tried to disaggregate the data captured by gender, in order to establish
       the conditions faced by women. This approach has enabled the establishment of new
       baseline conditions which should facilitate future monitoring of changes in greater detail.
       The 2012 survey however has established that women form an important economic unit
       both in households that they head and their role in agricultural production and sales
       activities.

                  Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

The fourth edition of the ADSP Annual Conference for 2013 was held from 2nd -3rd December
2013 at Cresta View Hotel in Lusaka under the theme “Smallholder Agriculture
Commercialization: Exhibiting ADSP Achievements”. The event was attended by 56 participants
drawn from Implementing Agencies, Government Officials, Cooperating Partners, Private sector
beneficiaries, the World Bank and members from the media. The purpose of the Conference was
to share results, progress achieved, experiences and exhibit products attained from
implementation processes harnessed over the past seven years and gather stakeholder views about
the project contributions. The Conference was unique in the sense that:

    •   It was the Last Edition in the series, which started four years ago,
    •   It was aimed at discussing Results, Experiences and Lessons and
    •   Senior Dignitaries had also been invited to grace the occasion.

The Conference was officially opened by the Honourable Minister of Agriculture and Livestock,
who was represented by the Deputy Minister, Hon. Luxon Kazabu. The World Bank was
represented by Dr. Kundhavi Kadiresan, Country Director – Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe.

In her opening remarks, the Country Director stressed that the ADSP was a successful project
supported by the Bank. She mentioned that the project was rated satisfactory by the Bank and
that the project had recorded good gender balance among its beneficiaries as over 38% were
women. She was encouraged by value added products from private sector beneficiaries. She
encouraged efforts by Zambia to go beyond food security and focus on commercialization.

In his opening remarks, the Honorable Minister paid tribute to the World Bank for being a
supportive partner in financing and supporting the implementation of the Agricultural
Development Support Project, which was advancing commercialization and diversification of
smallholder agriculture and linking to sustainable markets. The Minister requested the Bank to
further consider expanding such grant facilities for more processing and value adding activities in
the sector. He also paid tribute to various agencies that had been involved in the implementation
of the project.

The Conference was characterized by excitement as ADSP implementing agencies made
presentations of their implementation results and achievements while private sector beneficiaries
exhibited their value added products and released them for sale. The conference ended with a
resolution that the ADSP-NCO should ensure that sustainable strategies were prepared for the
various sub-components before the closure of the Project in 2014 and prior to project closure.
The project NCO also agreed to share project results with all sector stakeholders using established
ministry communication channels.

Key lessons learnt include the following: i) that smallholder farmers are able to produce quality
products when there is a sustainable market with good market and pricing i.e., Mpongwe Bulima
Cooperative; ii) that well organized processing and marketing agribusiness interventions clearly
empower general ‘small-scale farmers’ to viable smallholder commercial farmers; iii) that MIIF
matching grants enabled agribusiness to also secure loans from commercial banks and this
enabled them to double their capital resource; and iv) that MIIF grants assisted the agribusiness to
develop private sector extension services that targeted specific commodities.

       Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (of BORROWER’S ICR)

1.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL), with financial support from the
International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank has since October 2006
implemented the Agricultural Development Support Program (ADSP). The IDA support was in
the form of a Sector Investment Grant amounting to US$37.2 million. The Program has been
implemented for a period of 7.8 years and was closed on 15th May 2014. The Program was a
multi-sector operation involving institutions both inside and outside of the Government system.

2.       At the end of the implementation period, it is evident that the Program has been
successfully implemented and completed activities have led to significant achievement of the
PDO and results. Total grant amounting to US$37.2 million has been fully utilized on project
activities. The total Program cost was however US$ 50 million. This was composed of IDA
grant of US$37.2 million (74.4%), Government counterpart contribution of US$7.1 million
(14.2%), beneficiary contribution of US$3.1 million (6.2%) and a currency exchange gain of
US$2.6 million (5.2%).

3.       Key performance indicators show that the program has reached out to 128,265
beneficiaries, thereby surpassing the original target of 65,000 beneficiaries. Over 48% are
female beneficiaries far more than 38% that was targeted to the end of the Program. The Program
has increased the number of smallholder households growing targeted commodities from the
original baseline of 927,251 in 2005 to 1,039,216 in 2013. This has been achieved in a
diversified farming system without maize. The Program has supported 28 innovative
agribusiness enterprises promoting smallholder commercialization along commodity value
chains. In 2013 annual average income among beneficiaries in the catchment areas was
ZMW17,905 per household.

4.      The Program has successfully completed OPRC works associated with improvement of
rural roads covering a distance of 1,131 kilometers in priority districts of Choma, Chongwe,
Chipata, Katete and Lundazi with high agricultural potential as part of smallholder agriculture
commercialization. The roads are currently under maintenance and have stimulated various
economic activities along the improved road catchment areas. In those priority districts, a
recently concluded impact assessment survey has indicated that average household income had
grown from ZMW3,900 in 2009 to ZMW21,800 in 2012 and the volume of traffic has increased
from 52 vehicles per day in 2007 to 194 vehicles per day in 2012. The facility created 1,200 jobs
during the rehabilitation phase.

5.       As part of institutional development, the Program has helped SCCI decentralize seed
testing services to the Southern Province by establishing a seed testing laboratory in Choma that
has since 2012 tested over 2,200 metric tons of seed. In addition the Program has strengthened
the capacity of the CDT to supply increased pre-basic cotton seed to the cotton industry by
providing irrigation system infrastructure and other farm equipment, thereby increasing the pre-
basic cotton seed production from 19.2 metric tons in 2005 to 60.9 metric tons in 2013.

6.       The Program, as part of capacity building, has trained a total of 12,119 people in various
skills. Of these, 241 (2%) were members of staff and 11,958 (98%) were smallholder producers.
Smallholder producers have been trained in advanced technologies associated with value addtion,
product development and quality improvement.



                                                58
7.      The ADSP has demonstrated many innovative aspects. The Program has successfully
supported Agribusiness enterises promoting agricultural commercialization along key commodity
value chains with a demonstration of beneficiary innovative technologies. The commodities
include cotton, paprika, chili, groundnuts, soyabeans, dairy, poultry, aqua-culture, piggery, honey,
cashew nuts, mushroom, local vegetables and fruits. This is also supporting Government policy
on crop diversification.

8.      The ADSP has successfully implemented a rural road contracting method using Output
and Performance Based Road Contracts (OPRC), an efficient and cost-effective approach to
supporting increased commercialization of smallholder farmers by retaining contractors on site to
maintain the network of roads to acceptable service standards. In the case of the ADSP the
contractors were on site for a period of five (5) years to provide access and motorable road
services to the rural communities.

9.      As part of Research and Development, the ADSP has promoted the honey value chain
production and quality improvement by testing and confirming that Zambia honey is free of
American Foul Brood disease, thereby eliminating the need to irradiate the honey and opening
doors for honey exports to the regional and international markets. In addition, the ADSP has
helped improve the plant quarantine services by enhancing staff capacity at ZARI which issues
phytosanitary certificates for export and plant import permits for a variety of products. The
Program has also empowered SCCI to monitor seed quality standards by establishing a
biotechnology laboratory facility at Chilanga with state of the art equipment.

10.      In project management, the ADSP has successfully been implemented using Government
systems. The Program adopted IFMIS, an integrated financial management information system
that is used for public financial management that incorporates planning, budgeting, expenditure
management and control, accounting, audit and reporting thereby enhancing trasnparency and
accountability of public resources. The Program has also successfully used country systems for
management of donor funds.
