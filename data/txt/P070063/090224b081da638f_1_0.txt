                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to advance smallholder agriculture commercialization along value chains through (a) providing resources for working capital and
                         term lending for capital investments in productive and marketing assets/activities to improve productivity, quality and efficiency of supply chains; (b) targeted
                         investments into public/collective goods, such as feeder roads and into key public service functions; and (c) building market, technical and managerial knowledge of
                         farmer groups and producer organizations through extension.
                         The project's central aim is to strengthen the smallholders' access to markets and the competitiveness of functioning and emerging agricultural commodities. The
                         project would therefore focus on high potential agricultural areas and will adopt a value chain approach to make sure that all levels of the chains are operating efficiently
                         and creating increased value added.

                         There has been continued satisfactory progress since last mission in project implementation and progress made towards meeting the Project Development Objectives (PDO). The
                         Project has now been implemented for over six (6) years and accumulated project outputs are substantial across the various components and implementing agencies. Smallholder
                         households growing targeted crops in 2012 were 975,661 (92%) of end of project target) while targeted commodities produced by smallholder households were 607,107t/ha in 2012
                         which was >2011 season target; and agricultural exports for target value chains was 90.6 or 63,385.6t/ha in 2012. Of the direct project beneficiaries 116,775 (38%) were female.

                         The three sub-components under Support to Farmers and Agribusiness Enterprises (SFAE) Component showed satisfactory progress. Under sub-component 1 (Supply Chain Credit
                         Facility, (SCCF), Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) - the Apex Unit continued capacity building activities, managed the Enterprise Development Fund (EDP) lines of credit
                         effectively. The second sub-component, MIIF is managing a portfolio of 25 sub-projects located in various parts of the country and promoting a variety of innovations and value
                         additions. Although 4 of the 25 sub-projects in the portfolio are already completed, others are at various levels of completion. Cumulative MIIF disbursements to date totaled ZMK
                         5,162,097.20 (US$992,711), representing 26.5% of projected end of Project Grant Allocation (US$3,750,000). Sub-projects have reached 45,190 beneficiaries in 26 districts in the
                         country. The third sub-component, RRIF performance is also very encouraging. Rehabilitation and re-gravelling works have been completed on the entire 1,131 kilometers of rural
                         road network targeted under the facility. The entire roads network in five districts has now been moved to maintenance. Volume of traffic on improved roads increased by over
                         60.3% from 121 vehicles per day in 2011 to 194 vehicles per day in 2012.

                         Satisfactory progress was also achieved among the MAL Departments and Units targeted within the Institutional Development Component; that includes previously lagging activities
                         in Policy and Planning Department. The SCCI-Choma decentralized seed testing laboratory became fully operational and has tested over 1,800 tons of seed during the period from
                         Southern Province. Final set up related to engineerâ€™s installation was accomplished at the bio-technology laboratory at Chilanga and Advisory service and staff training is on track.
                         The laboratory is now due for official commissioning. The CDT strategic and business plan was approved by the CDT Board and is expected to be circulated to stakeholders in the
                         first quarter of 2013. The construction of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) laboratory was completed and handed over to CDT management. CDT supported pre-basic cotton seed
                         production increased from a low of 19.2 tons in 2011 to 65.8 tons in 2012 under the new CDT management. Agricultural Market Information Centre (AMIC) rolled out the
                         dissemination of market information through community radio program to the Eastern Province of Zambia (scaling up from previous successes in Southern Province radios). The
                         Ministry website was established with project support through the National Early Warning Unit. The site is still being refined and not yet fully populated. The NCO managed and
                         coordinated the project satisfactorily during the review period. Among other things during this period, the NCO also participated in the Agricultural and Commercial Show, facilitated
                         NPSC meeting which approved the 2013 Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWPB) in line with the new budgeting cycle and hosted the Annual Conference in December 2012, which
                         was a major dissemination event to stakeholders.
