                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to advance smallholder agriculture commercialization along value chains through (a) providing resources for working
                         capital and term lending for capital investments in productive and marketing assets/activities to improve productivity, quality and efficiency of supply chains;
                         (b) targeted investments into public/collective goods, such as feeder roads and into key public service functions; and (c) building market, technical and
                         managerial knowledge of farmer groups and producer organizations through extension.
                         The project's central aim is to strengthen the smallholders' access to markets and the competitiveness of functioning and emerging agricultural commodities.
                         The project would therefore focus on high potential agricultural areas and will adopt a value chain approach to make sure that all levels of the chains are
                         operating efficiently and creating increased value added.

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                         Report No: ISR4415



                         Significant progress was made during the review period illustrating satisfactory contributions to PDO and overall IP. A number ofkey indicator targets are on track. Project's ability
                         monitor progress and contribution to PDO through setting up an effective M&E system and related capacity building for all implementing agencies. Timely submission of technical
                         progress reports is notable with up-to-date reporting (January to June 2011 Semi Annual progress Report). Support to Farmers and Agribusiness Enterprises (SFAE) Component
                         continued to be strong through Market Improvement and Innovation Facility (MIIF) and Rural Roads Improvement Facility (RRIF), and substantial contributions from the Supply Chain

                         Credit Facility (SCCF)'s training activities. MIIF progress included matching grant promotion, strengthening PCN pipeline, collaboration with private sector partners, facilitating TA to
                         applicants of PCNs and Full Business Plans (FBPs), sub-project field monitoring visits and TA during implementation. MIIF a comprehensive review of sub-project M&E framework
                         has improved deliverables, information flow, and results monitoring. More than 25 technologies/ innovations were generated and or adopted by sub Projects with 16435 expected
                         outreach beneficiaries. MIIF continued to maintain a solid pipeline of potential sub-projects in key value chains for future funding. Implementation progress of Rural Roads
                         Improvement Facility (RRIF) sub-component was satisfactory. In addition to Output and Performance based contract (OPRCs), major road works included re-graveling and fixing of
                         structures (culverts, mitre drains, and km marker posts). Total road compliance increased from 486 km in December 2010 to 565 km in June 2011. Of particular importance was the
                         resumption of works in Chongwe and Lundazi Districts following allocation of funds in RDA 2011 AWPB. Direct rural road beneficiary population is >80,000; average vehicle traffic
                         has increased from a baseline of 52 vehicles per day to 102 (92% increase).

                         Institutional Development component activities have accelerated during the review period. Capacity to increase quality cotton planting seeds has been further strengthened at
                         Cotton Development Trust (CDT) in Magoye where the dry season supplementary irrigation system made a significant contribution to productivity enhancement. In the 2010 season,
                         42.6 tons of pre-basic cotton planting seeds, 45.8 tons of basic cotton seeds, and 26.6 tons of certified seeds were produced at CDT. Yields of seed cotton have improved from
                         1000kg/ha in 2006/07 season to 2300 kg/ha in 2009/10 season due to ADSP activities: use of better IPM practices; soil improvement with lime and green manuring; mechanization in
                         land preparation and harvesting; and supplementary irrigation. ZARI completed notification of the AFB status (absence) in Zambia to WTO during the period; sent through Ministry of
                         Commence Trade and Industry (National Notification Authority for Zambia) to WTO. Since then honey imports into Zambia have been restricted and current import conditions were
                         reviewed. ZARI has engaged South Africa to review its import conditions on Zambian honey and a letter to this effect has been sent to the South African National Plant Protection
                         Organization to request them to facilitate the cessation of irradiation of Zambian honey. Project also participated in the second year E-ISR plus initiative through which an
                         independent survey of public sector participants and communities identified significant contributions by ADSP in the rural areas and agricultural communities.
