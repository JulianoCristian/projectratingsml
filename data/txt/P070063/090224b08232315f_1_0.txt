                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to advance smallholder agriculture commercialization along value chains through (a) providing resources for working capital and
                         term lending for capital investments in productive and marketing assets/activities to improve productivity, quality and efficiency of supply chains; (b) targeted
                         investments into public/collective goods, such as feeder roads and into key public service functions; and (c) building market, technical and managerial knowledge of
                         farmer groups and producer organizations through extension.
                         The project's central aim is to strengthen the smallholders' access to markets and the competitiveness of functioning and emerging agricultural commodities. The
                         project would therefore focus on high potential agricultural areas and will adopt a value chain approach to make sure that all levels of the chains are operating efficiently
                         and creating increased value added.

                         The project continues to be implemented satisfactorily and the progress made towards meeting the Project Development Objectives (PDO) also continues to be satisfactory. Among
                         the many ADSP contributions to date to Zambia's agricultural development and in relation to project specific key indicators are: (a) 130,845 beneficiaries have been reached,
                         significantly surpassing the 65,000 beneficiaries originally targeted at project closure; (b) By the end of August 2013, with the increases in smallholder households growing targeted
                         commodities, represented about 50 per cent above target; this is without including maize but other crops in diversified farming systems; (c) The rural road improvement works has

                         been completed in selected high priority district and feeder roads of economic importance in agricultural production in Choma, Chongwe, Chipata, Katete and Lundazi districts and
                         under the OPRC contracting, 1,131 kilometers of roads are continuing to be maintained. In those districts a recently concluded impact assessment indicated average household
                         income growth from K3,900 to K21,800 per household and that 1200 jobs have been created with the volume of traffic multiplying almost four fold; (d) about 47,590 beneficiaries have
                         been reached and more than 10,000 small holder farmers have been trained in advanced technologies associated with value addition, product development and quality improvement
                         while creating about 75 new jobs through the MIIF matching grant fund while over 6,700 existing and emerging farmers have benefited from the Enterprise Development Fund
                         supported activities in different agricultural value chains; and (e) more than 1,800 tons of crop seeds were tested in 2012 in the newly established Choma Seed Control and Testing
                         Laboratory supported by ADSP while the support to Cotton Development Trust (CDT) has led to a three- dimensional increase in pre-basic seed cotton production from 19.2 metric
                         tons in 2005 to 65.8 metric tons in 2012. The project successfully organized the Fourth ADSP Conference in December 2013 to share the ADSP achievements, knowledge and
                         lessons recorded through the MIIF matching grant projects, and to interact with the private and public stakeholders involved different value chains.
