MOOROCCO
INTRODUC7?ION AND SUMMARY
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
(a) Primary Energy Resources and Development
i.        Thcl main indigenous energy resources in Morocco are coal and hydro-
power. Known cil deposits are nearly exhausted but exploration efforts have
been intenslfied. Large deposits of bituminous schists are a possible source
of oil in the long-tern but their development will be expensive. A UNDP-
financed uranium exploration program is under way.
2.        Eniergy demand has growa at 7% per year on average over the  last
14 years with an upward trend in the growth rate, total consumption rising
froam 1,975 millicn tons coal equivalent (mtce) in 1961 to 4,707 mtce in 1974.
Energy use has intensified over the period and energy consumption per capita
has risen from 164 kgce in 1961 to 282 kgce in 1974; however, this still
leaves M4orocco near the lower end of the world range (10-12,000 kgce).
Morocco is highly dependent on imported oil, the share of which in total
energy consumption rose from 60% in 1961 to nearly 80% in 1974. Oil is main-
ly imported as crude, for refining in two refineries with a combined capacity
of 3 million tons per year.
3.        Moroccan forecasts of energy demand imply growth rates in the range
9-13% per year.  They also foresee increasing dependence on imported oil,
demand for which is expected to rise 3-4 times over the next 10 years from 3
million tons in 1974 to 10-13 million tons in 1985. The cost of oil imports
by 1985 is projected at 2-6 times the 1974 figure of US$260 million, depending
on the demand and cil price assumptions adopted.
4.        AUl energy prices are subject to Government control.  Except for
petrol, the prices of petrcleum products in Morocco remained unchanged from
1962 until the end of 1975. Through a compensation account, the Government
has subsidized the prices of fuel oil, gas oil and kerosene, which are typic-
ally used for industrial and for low income domestic purposes, and levied
special taxes on petrol. Until the sharp increase in petroleum prices
in 1973, the cost of subsidies was more than offset by revenue from the
special taxes; net income to the compensation account amounted to about $30
million in 1973. Following the 1973 price increases, the compensation ac-
count moved sharply into deficit, amounting to $150 million in 1974 and $115
million in 1975. At the end of 1975, the prices of petroleum products were
sharply increased, by between 12.5% (petrol) and 39.1% (fuel oil). As a
result, net payments from the compensation account are estimated to decline
to about $23 million in 1976. The Government has informed the IMF of its
intention to make supplementary adjustments to further reduce the net bud-
getary burden of petroleum produet subsidies in the course of 1976. In
addition, it has informed the Bank of its intention to progressively eli-
minate subsidies to petroleum products used by ONE during the next two to
three years.



- ii -
5.         Coal prices were held down iri the late 1960's, desDite rising costs,
and as a result the National Coal Company (CNA) made increasing losses.  How-
ever, since then the Government has authorized three price increases total-
ling 104% above the 1571 level of DH 61/ton. Electricity prices are dis-
cussed in paragraphs 27-30.
6.         Planned sector investment for 1973-77 is about DH 2,300 million
at 1974--75 prices, more than double the 1968-72 figure of some DE 1,000
million. Some 71% of this prograni is for power system expansion, but it is
al.o planned to increase petroleum-refining capacity by 3.5 million tons and
to develop a new coal mine to increase ccal productîon from its present level
of 700,000 tons per year to 1 million tons by 1981.  In addition, DH 570
millîon would be spent on intensified exploration for oil and gas.
j7.       The State owns all tche capital of the main oil refining company
(Societe Anonyme Marocaine Italienne de Raffinage - SAMIR) and has a 50%
holding in the other (Societe Cherifienne des Petroles - SCP).  A new state
agency, with a 50%G holding in the main foreign distributors in petroleum
products, has been set up. The State also owns 98% of the shares in CNA,
and fiully owns the National Electricity Office (ONE).
8.        Total employment in the energy sector, including ONE and the elec-
tricity departments of the local electricity and water distribution organiza-
tions (Regies) is about 30,000. Some problems are experienced in recruiting
technical and professional staff, partly because of the disparity between the
lower pay scales of tihe civil service compared to the private sector.
(b) The Electric Power Subsector
9.        The electric power subsector in Morocco is organized as follows:
(a) ONE, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works
and Communications (MTPC), generates 90% of the electric
power in the country, transmits it tc the load centres, and
distributes some of this energy (about 37% of total consump-
tion) outside the large cities;
(b) eleven Regies, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
the Interior (MI), purchase their power from ONE and dis-
tribute it in and around the large population centres and
account for about 50% of total consumption;
(c) Electras Marroquies, a private company under the jurisdic-
tion of MTPC, with lim.ited installed capacity and distribu-
tion area in tie extreme north of the country, accounts for
1% of total consurnption;
(d)  The Ministry of the Interior operates small systems in about
10 isolated localities, for som.e of which ONE is responsIble
for maintenance, and which accouat for 2% of consumption; and



- iii -
(e) captive plants, most of them linked to industrial enterprises,
accouat for about 10% of power generation and consumption.
Measures to improve sector organization and coordination are discussed in
paragraph 32.
10.       Historically, ONE has earned a low rate of return on assets and
has financed only about 20% of its capital expenditures through internal
cash generaticn. The Government has provided about one-third of financing
for ONE's capital expenditures through increases in capital, while the
balance has been financed by borrowing, mainly abroad. By contrast, the
Regies usually generated cash on account of electricity sales more than
sufficient funds to finance electricity distribution network expansion;
the surplus has been applied to finance water distribution network expansion.
In 1974, overall cash generation in the electricity sub-sector, including
consumers' contributions, amounted to about 45% of electricity system
investments.
11.       Electricity demand has grown at about 8.5% per year since ONE's
creation in 1963, with a tendency to accelerate in the latter part of the
period. All the major towns and cities and about 70% of the smaller towns
are electrified, but only 11% of the rural population (including residents of
small towns) has public electricity supply. Total installed capacity in ONE's
interconnected power system is 803 MW (49% hydro, 51% thermal). The share of
hydropower in total generation has been declining (1963 - 93%, 1974 - 49%)
bothi because of an increase in the share of thermal in total capacity and
because the rapid growth of irrigation, which is given precedence over hydro-
power in water use, has reduced the generation of existing hydro plants. Main
transmission is by 225, 150 and 60 kV.
12.       Through a loan of $25 million in FY74 (936-MOR), the Bank helped
finance part of ONE's 1973-77 capital expenditure programme for generation
and transmission. The loan also included financing for studies on electri-
city tariffs and on the organization of the electricity subsector in Morocco.
Technical performance by ONE under the project was good; the physical works
were completed on schedule and at cost savings of $4 million which have
since been applied to the financing of engineering studies for hydro plant
developments in various parts of the country. Financial performance of ONE
under Loan 936-MOR is discussed in paragraphs 27-28.
13        ONE's proposed expansion program up to 1980 is based on the assump-
tion that demand for power from ONE's interconnected system would grow by an
average of 11.5% per year from 1975 to 1980, a rate consistent with projected
energy demand growth (paragraph 3). The programme provides for the installa-
tion of about 650 MW of new generating capacity (about half thermal, half
hydro) and construction of 3,500 km of main transmission lines.



- iv -
14.       Under Morocco's Third Five Year Plan (1973-77) planned investment
for ONE's expansion program (including rural electrification) is about DH
1,600 million, compared with 1968-72 expenditure of about DH 600 million.
Fifty-nine percent of planned investment is for generation, 23% for trans-
mission, 4% for distribution and 9% for rural electrification. These figures
do not include distribution investment by the Regies or investments by the
Ministry of Interior or Electras Marroquies, for which information is not
available. ONE's capital expenditures during the Fourth Plan Period (1978-82)
are expected to be more than double those of the Third Plan level.                         e
15.       Responsibility for rural electrification is divided amongst the
Ministries of Public Works, the Interior and Agriculture, ONE carrying the
major responsibility for implementation. Progress in extending public elec-
tricity supply to the rural areas has been slow, but the program is acceler-
ating. Planned investment for 1973-77 amounts to DH 143 million compared with
DH 57 million in 1968-72.  The program is financed partly from the state
budget and partly from the proceeds of a special 4.5% levy on ONE's receipts
from the sale of electricity.
16.       Employment in the power subsector is some 7,500, including about
4,300 for ONE. ONE's staff has increased about 6% per year since its crea-
tion in 1963 and is now almost entirely Moroccan.

Il. THE PROJECT
Background
17.       The Oum er Rbia is the second largest river in Morocco, and flows
"rom the Middle Atlas mountains near Khenifra in a westward arc to reach the
sea one hundred kilometers south of Casablanca. The potential of the river
and its tributaries for the generation of electricity, for irrigation and for
potable water has long been recognized. Before Independence in 1956, two
major dams were constructed in the river basin - the Bin el Ouidane/Afourer
complex on the el Abid river and the Im Fout dam on the Oum er Rbia - with the
dual purposes of electricity generation and irrigation water supply. Smaller,
single purpose regulating or diversion structures were constructed on the Oum
er Rbia at Kasba Tadla (irrigation), Daourat (power) and Maachou (power) (see
Maps IBRD 11853R and 12065R attached).
18.       The remaining potential of the Oum er Rbia and its tributaries for
multipurpose development has been reviewed several times in the past thirty
years. In 1969, following suggestions made by the Bank, and in view of an
increasing need to allocate water between competing demands, the Government
commissioned preparation of a Master Plan for the Oum er Rbia basin, a pre-
liminary version of which was completed in 1971 which was reviewed jointly
by the Government and PAO/Bank Cooperative Programme Staff. Subsequently,
water available from the Oum er Rbia's main tributaries was reallocated for
upstream use; greatly increased demands for water for industrial purposes
emerged as a result of plans to construct a new port and petrochemical complex
on the coast near Casablanca, and more detailed reguXation studies for the
existing diversion structures in the river basin became available.  As a
result, the Government prepared a revised Master Plan, with the assistance of
consultants. FAO/Bank Cooperative Programme Staff visited Morocco in 1974 for
review and discussions and the study was completed in 1975. The first stage
of development under the Master Plan was the completion of irrigation develop-
ment in the Doukkala and the Tadla perimeters, which could be carried eut
using existing diversion structures, and which are being financed by loans
from the Bank (1201-MOR, for the Doukkala), USAID (Doukkala) and the Arab Fund
for Economic and Social Development (Tadla). Together with associated down-
stream developments of irrigation and water supply (see paragraph 37), the
proposed project would form the second stage of development under the Master
Plan.  An integrated feasibility study for the third stage, a multipurpose dam
at Dechra el Oued on the Oum er Rbia, is being financed under the Bank loan
for the Doukkala project.
19.       The proposed project was appraised in November, 1975.
Project Purposes and Description
20.       The project is aimed at achieving the orderly development of the
scarce water resources of the Oum er Rbia river, and at meeting (a) grow-
ing national needs for electricity (b) future requirements for potable and



- vi -
industrial water in the Atlantic coastal zone, notably as a result of the
construction of a port and petrochemical complex at Jorf el Lasfar and (c)
the water needs for completion of the development for irrigation of the
'lower service' in the Doukkala. Expansion of the potable and industrial
water transmission and distribution system, and the irrigation developments
are not part of the project but may be considered for future Bank financing.
The project also aims at strengthening managerial capacity within ONE and at,
achieving improved coordination in the development of the electric power
subsector. It consists of:
(a) construction of the Al-Massara concrete buttress-type dam at
Sidi Cheho on the Oum er Rbia river and ancillary works;
(b) construction of a 120-MW power station at the foot of the dam,
including the adjacent 225-kV substation and ancillary works;
(c) construction of about 200 km of 225-kV transmission lines and
the upgrading to 225 kV of the substations to be connected to
such lines;
(d) preparation of preliminary designs and bid documents for the
Merija compensating dam and power station downstream of Sidi
Cheho.
Project execution began in November 1975. The dam would begin filling in the
winter of 1978/79 and would begin operating toward the end of 1979.
Project Execution
21.       Execution of the project would be the responsibility of the Hydra-
ulic Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works and Communications (Hydrau-
lique) and of ONE. Hydraulique is supervising construction of the dam with
the assistance of consultants. ONE is supervising construction of the power
station, with the assistance of consultants, and would directly supervise the
substation and transmission works. Hydraulique and ONE have engaged the same
consultants to carry out the preliminary studies for the Merija dam and power
station respectively. Hydraulique and ONE, which are both under the authority
of the Minister of Public Works, coordinate their activities relating to the
project on a day-to-day basis. Similar arrangements functioned satisfactorily
for the Bank-financed Idriss I (Loan 643-MOR) and Bou Regreg water supply (Loan
850-MOR) dams.
Operation and Maintenance of the Dam
22.       Operation and maintenance of the dam and the power station will be
primarily the responsibility of ONE. Prior to the commissioning of th dam,
ONE and Hydraulique would enter into an agreement defining in detail their
respective roles in the inspection, operation and maintenance of the dam.
Operation of the dam will be based upon rule curves to be established by



- vii -
Hydraulique in agreement with the main agencies with an interest in the
release of water from the dam, notably ONE, the Ministry of Agriculture and
the National Potable Water Supply Office. These rules will reflect the
priorities for water use set out in the Master Plan, namely first priority
to potable use, second to industrial use, third to irrigation and fourth to
power generation. Economic analysis indicates that this priority ranking
would maximize economic benefits from the project.
23.       The dam is designed with adequate instrumentation to allow con-
tinuous monitoring of its soundness. Hydraulique would regularly inspect
the dam according to sound engineering practices.
Project Cost and Financing Plan
24.       Cost estimates are as follows:

25.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about $167 million, in-
cluding duties and taxes. The proposed Bank loan, for $49 million would amount
to 32% of total project cost net of duties and taxes, and 54 percent of the
project's foreign exchange cost. It would finance the foreign exchange cost
of (i) the power station and adjacent substation, (ii) transmission lines and
substation upgrading, (iii) consultants services for the final designs and
supervision of construction of the power station and dam and (iv) consultants
services for the preliminary studies for the Merija power station and dam.
That part of the Bank loan to be used to finance expenditures by ONE ($43.7
million) would be onlent by the Goverument to ONE on the same terms as the
Bank Loan, and execution of the subsidiary loan agreement would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness of the Bank foan. These monies would cover the entire



- viii -
estimated foreign exchange cost of the items to be implemented by ONE, except
for a small amount of $0.6 million for access roads and site buildings. The
balance of the Bank Loan ($5.3 million) would finance the foreign exchange
cost of consultants engaged by Hydraulique to supervise construction of the
dam and prepare preliminary designs for the Meri;a dam. The Government is at
present undertaking efforts to mobilize external financing to meet the remain-
ing foreign exchange costs of the project ($41.2 million). The Government has
confirmed that it would itself provide the substitute funds necessary for suc-
cessful completion of the Project should co-financing not materialize. The
Bank Loan and any other external loan would be linked by a cross-default
provision. The local costs relating to the dam and the preliminary studies
for the Merija dam (items to be implemented by Hydraulique), totalling $55.0
million, would be financed by the Governnent. Those relating to the power
station, transmission lines, substation upgrading and the preliminary studies
for the Merija power station (items to be implemented by ONE), totalling $21.9
million, would be financed by ONE.
Organization and Staffing of ONE
26.       ONE has achieved good technical standards in the construction and
operation of its power facilities. Measured in terms of electricity sales/
employee and customers/employee, ONE's efficiency is reasonable and continues
to improve. Through an ongoing training program, ONE has been able to expand
its technical staff, maintain staffing standards, and at the same time pursues
a phased program for replacing expatriate personnel by Moroccan staff. ONE's
main organizational and staffing weaknesses lie in the fields of accounting,
budgeting and financial planning. Under Loan 936-MOR, the Bank asked that
ONE engage independent external auditors and recruit a senior financial
officer with overall responsibility for these matters. Independent auditors
were engaged in 1973. ONE experienced difficulty in recruiting an appro-
priately qualified and experienced senior financial officer, but the post
was filled in May 1976 by an ONE staff member, following his completion of
a training programme. ONE has also had a study of its accounting procedures
carried out by consultants. As the next stage, ONE is to prepare specific
proposals for the reorganization of its financial departments under the senior
financial officer, and for the improvement of its accounting procedures. ONE
would exchange views with the Bank on these proposals before implementing them
by June 30, 1977.
ONE's Financial Position and Tariffs
27.       While ONE is well-run technically, its financial position has dete-
riorated somewhat, despite increases in ONE's tariffs of 5% in May 1973, 5%
in May 1974 and 18% in January 1976. ONE's rate of return on assets in
operation declined from 2.1% in 1973 and 2% in 1974, to zero in 1975, and
is expected to be less than 1% in 1976. The main reason for the decline in
ONE's rate of return in 1975 was a sharp increase in average fuel cost ,er
unit sold, due to extremely dry weather which reduced hydro generation. No
substantial improvement is expected in 1976, despite the major rate increase



- ix -
in January 1976, because of the sharp increase in fuel oil and gas oil prices
which took place in late 1975 and reduced the level of subsidies to petroleum
products (paragraph 4). Increases in ONE's bulk rates have been passed on in
full to final consumers through increases in the rates charged by the Regies,
whose financial position, therefore, should still be strong. Despite some
deterioration in ONE's financial position and a possible decrease in internal
financing of the Regies, the overall financial position of the power subsector
is estimated to be adequate but for the apparent imbalances in the sharing of
revenue.
28.       Under Loan 936-MOR, ONE undertook to achieve a rate of return on
assets in operation of 3% in 1974, rising to 7% by 1981. However, these tar-
gets were set before the tripling of petroleum prices in late 1973, and the
resultant need for sharp increases in electricity prices, if they were to
reflect the higher cost of fuel. As mentioned earlier (paragraph 4), the
Government introduced subsidies to petroleum products in 1973, but intends
to eliminate them over the next two to three years. Any change in fuel prices
from their January 1, 1976 level would immediately be fully reflected in ONE's
electricity tariff. Accordingly it is reasonable to accept a somewhat lower
rate of return for ONE during this adjustment period than implied by the rate
of return requirement under Loan 936-MOR, while retaining the overall objective
of a 7% rate of return by 1981, particularly in view of the overall satisfac-
tory financial position of the electricity sub-sector noted above.
29.       The Government and ONE have asked that ONE's financial objectives be
framed in terms of a cash generation requirement rather than a rate of return
target, which is reasonable in view of the rapid growth of capital expenditures
foreseen for ONE over the next few years, and the resulting growth in financing
requirements. ONE's average internal cash generation in any year and the pre-
ceding year would amount to at least 18% of average capital expenditures over
the same two years and the next following year, until 1979, and to 20% there-
after. This definition allows ONE to take into account actual performance in
the current year when formulating proposals for a tariff increase to meet the
cash generation requirement in the following year, and therefore introduces
automatic adjustment of tariffs to take account of the impact of rainfall con-
ditions on ONE's average cost of generation. Each year ONE would review the
adequacy of its tariffs to meet the cash generation requirement in the following
year, and would submit the review, satisfactory to the Government, to the Bank
by October 31. Action to meet the 1977 cash generation requirement would take
place by January 1, 1977. On the basis of present fuel prices, it is estimated
that application of the cash generation requirement would lead to the need for
a tariff increase of 16% in 1977, but no further increase in 1978. To even
out the increases, and since increases arising from changes in fuel prices are
also expected, the 1977 rate increase would be limited to 10%, over and above
any increases to reflect higher fuel prices. In this case, it is estimated
that application of the cash generation requirement would lead to a further
rate increase of about 8% at the beginning of 1978, and accordingly overall
cash generation over the 1977-78 period would not be substantially affected.
ONE's rates of return are estimated at 2.7% in 1977, 3.9% in 1978, 4.9% in
1979, and 6.8% in 1980.



- x 
30.       Under Loan 936-MOR, ONE commissioned consultants to carry out a
study of ONE's tariff structure. ONE has since updated the results of this
study to take into account the impact of the 1973 increase in fuel prices.
On this basis ONE is at present elaborating proposals for review by the Gov-
ernment for the introduction of a marginal cost based tariff whose main
features in relation to the present tariff structure would be (a) simplifi-
cation and standardization of the tariff structure (b) a reduction in the
degressivity of tariffs and (c) the modernization of tariff differentials
between peak, standard and off-peak demand periods.  The Government would
exchange views with the Bank on progress in preparation of the new tariff
structure as well as the Government's final proposal in this respect, to be
elaborated by July 31, 1977.
Organization of the Power Sub-Sector
31.       ONE's major category of customers are Government agencies and sub-
divisions, of which the most important group, accounting for 60% of ONE's sales,
is the Regies. Under loan 936-MOR, the Governnent undertook to ensure that all
payments for electricity and services provided to the Government by ONE would
be met within 90 days, starting January 1, 1975. In order to protect ONE's
cash position, rather than monitor the payment performance of individual
Government agencies, the Government would ensure in the future that bills due
ONE but unpaid by these agencies would at no time exceed one-sixth of the
value of sales to them during the previous year.
32.       With two ministries and several agencies involved in the power sub-
sector, responsibility in the sub-sector is fragmented. There is a need to
improve coordination in the Government's control over the sub-sector, to
standardise codes, standards, practices and accounts, and, in some cases, to
improve delineation of areas of supply. Under Loan 936-MOR, ONE commissioned
consultants to undertake a study of the organization of the power sub-sector.
This study was completed in March 1976, and is now being reviewed by the
Government. After consultations with the various interested agencies, the
Government is to formulate specific legal, administrative and other proposals
for improving the organization of the electricity sub-sector by July 31, 1977;
the Government would exchange views with the Bank from time to time on the
progress in developing these proposals as well as on the final proposals them-
selves.
Procurement
33.       Procurement of the main project items is already under way.  The
following contracts have been let after international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement: (a) civil works for
the dam (let in November, 1975) (b) hydro-mechanical equipment for the dam
(March 1976) and (c) equipment and civil works for the power station (. -ril
1976). Contracts for transmission lines and substation upgrading would be
let after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement; in the evaluation of bids for these contracts,
Moroccan equipment suppliers would be given a preference margin of 15%, or



- xi -
the prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower. Contracts for access roads
and site buildings (mainly workers' housing) have been let after local com-
petitive bidding in accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory.
Land required for the project is being acquired in accordance with Moroccan
law for compulsory purchase.
34.       Consultants services have been obtained in accordance with the
Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants. Under contracts signed in 1974, the
Swiss consulting firm Alpinconsult prepared preliminary designs and bidding
documents for the power station (on behalf of ONE and being financed under
Loan 936-MOR) and for the dam (on behalf of Hydraulique). Hydraulique has
extended its contract with Alpinconsult, to provide for preparation of final
designs and assistance for supervision of construction of the dam, and the
extension would be financed by the proposed loan. ONE has arranged to obtain
assistance from Electricite de France in supervising construction of the power
station. Garbe Lahmeyer International of Germany has been engaged by Hydrau-
lique for the preliminary study for the Merija dam, and by ONE for the pre-
liminary study of the Merija power station. Total consultant services (esti-
mated base foreign cost US$5 million) would amount 76 man-years, at an average
cost of US$5,500 per man-month (excluding local costs).
Disbursements
35.       Disbursements, estimated to be completed by December 31, 1980, would
be made against:
-    100% of foreign expenditures or 50% of local currency expenditures
(representing their estimated foreign exchange content) for the
power station and adjacent substation;
-    100% of foreign expenditures or, in the case of local procurement,
of ex-factory price of equipment and materials for the transmis-
sion lines and upgrading of substations;
-    20% of total expenditures for civil works and erection for the
transmission lines and substation upgrading;
-    100% of foreign expenditures for consultants services.
Retroactive Financing
36.       As mentioned in paragraph 33, procurement of all main project compo-
nents is already under way. This procedure was adopted in order to allow dam
construction to take place during the 1976 dry season, in order to avoid a
year's delay in project completion. Retroactive financing from the Bank loan
of up to $5 million of foreign expenditures between October 1975 and signature
of the loan is proposed. Of this amount, about $3.5 million relates to inital
payments for the power station, made at the time of contract signature in mid-
June, 1976.

Benefits and Justification
37.       The main benefits from the project would be the approximate doubling
of the power-associated hydro storage capacity in the country, an increase in
electric power availability, and provision of water for potable, industrial
and irrigation use. Taking into account the reduction of power generation
from existing downstream hydro plants as a resuit of the water diversions for
irrigation and industrial and potable use under the project, and future up-
streain diversions for the same purposes, effective electric power generation
from the project is estimated at 310 GWh in 1980, and would decline to 240-250
GWh by 1995, in which year these developments are scheduled for completion.
These estimates of power generation have been calculated on the basis that
the pattern of releases from the dam would be based on water demands for down-
stream use, to which priority has been given over power generation (paragraph
22). 0f the total of 3,300 Mm3/a presently flowing past the site, 450 Mm3
have been allocated to potable and industrial use and 800 Mm3 to irrigation.
The allocation to potable and industrial water is estimated to be sufficient
to meet the growth of demand in the Atlantic coastal zone up to the year 2000.
The major share of this growth in demand is accounted for by the port and
petrochemical complex at Jorf el Lasfar for which preliminary studies are
under way and which is scheduled to be completed by 1982/3. A project includ-
ing the transmission and distribution works necessary to realize the potential
of the Sidi Cheho dam for potable and industrial water supply is at present
being prepared, and is being considered for Bank financing. The allocation
to irrigation use would be sufficient to allow the completion of irrigation
development in the Lower Service of the Doukkala Perimetre through an exten-
sion of 17,000 ha. A feasibility study for this extension is available, and
the projeet is also being considered for Bank financing. Further potential
exists for the development of irrigation based on the Sidi Cheho dam, namely
in the Upper Service of the Doukkala Perimetre. However no feasibility studies
for this development have yet been prepared, and it has not been taken account
of in the economic analysis of the proposed project.
38.       Two measures have been used to assess the justification of the proj-
ect. First, the cost of the multipurpose project was compared with the sum
of costs of combinations of alternative projects which would be required to
achieve equivalent benefits. Specifically these alternatives were (a) for
power, a least cost alternative power system development program (a combina-
tion of hydro, steam and gas turbine plant), (b) for industrial and potable
water, a smaller dam at Sidi Cheho, and (c) for irrigation, completion of
irrigation development in the lower Doukkala for which an addition to the
small dam for water supply under (b) would be the least cost solution. This
analysis showed that the equalizing discount rate at which the Sidi Cheho
cost would equal the costs of the alternatives, was 12.5%. The equ1izing
discount rate is relatively insensitive to changes in the cost streanis.
Thus, the equalizing discount rate would only decline to 11% as a resu of
(a) a 28% increase in capital cost of dams (b) a 14% decline in fuel savings
resulting f rom hydro rather than thermal generation or (c) an increase in the
cost of power plants of 40%.



- xiii -
39.       A second measure of the project's economic worth was obtained by
preparing an ordinary rate of return estimate; the various benefits are valued
in accordance with conventional procedures (i.e. sales prices for power and
water, and economie prices for irrigation) and the discount rate is determined
which equalizes the multipurpose scheme's costs and benefits. Assuming that
prices paid represent the minimum value of the benefit to the consumers, such
an approach also would provide a lower limit to the economic rate of return.
The rate of return calculated in this way amounts to 9.6% and would still
amount to 8% if all costs increased by 25% or benefits declined by 20%.
Environmental Impact
40.       As a result of constructing the Sidi Cheho dam, a lake with a
maximum area of 180 km2 will be formed. The effect on the environment is
expected to be modest because soil conditions are poor in the area and
little is cultivated. About 5,500 people will have to be moved. In ac-
cordance with Moroccan legislation owners of the land and the assets will
be fully compensated.  Discussions are at present under way between Hydrau-
lique and the Ministry of Interior about the possibility of providing such
compensation in the form of a resettlement scheme in adjacent areas, rather
than through cash payments. Such an arrangement has been successfully imple-
mented for people displaced as a result of construction of other dams in
Morocco, and has made it easier to ensure that such people are provided with
alternative long-term means of livelihood.
41.       Under Loan 1201-MOR, financing is being provided for the first stage
of a programme to monitor and control vector snails and incidence of bilharzia
in the Province of El Jadida. Extension of irrigation, the main likely source
of bilharzia, which can be carried out as a result of constructing the dam, is
all Located in the El Jadida Province and would therefore be covered by this
programme. In addition, however, the Ministry of Health would monitor the in-
cidence of vector snails and bilharzia in the vicinity of the Sidi Cheho re-
servoir, and take appropriate control and curative measures.






1.  TIIE ENERGY SECTOR
(a) Primary Energy Resources and Development
1.01      The main available energy resources in Morocco are coal and hydro-
pcwer. Existing oil deposits are nearly exhausted but exploration efforts
have been intensified to discover new reserves. Large deposits of bituminous
schists are a possible source of oil in the long term but their development
will be expensive. No conventional type uranium deposits have been discovered
but a UNDP financed exploration program is underway.
1.02      Energy demand has grown at 7%/a on average (10-year doubling) over
the last 14 years with an upward trend in recent years. Total consumption
rose from 1,975 million tons coal equivalent (Mtce) in 1961 to 4,707 Mtce in
1974. The use of energy has intensified during this period and per capita
consumption rose from 0.164 tce in 1961 to 0.282 tce in 1974. This still
leaves Morocco near the lower end of the world range (0.01-12 tce).
1.03      Morocco is highly dependent on imported oil, the share of which in
total energy consumption rose from 60% in 1961 to nearly 80% in 1974. Oui is
mainly imported as crude for refining in two refineries with a combined
capacity of 3 Mton/a. Coal production is nearing the limit of the existing
capacity of about 700,000 tons/a, but is planned to increase to 1 Mton/a by
1981.
1.04      Different Moroccan forecasts of energy demand imply growth rates in
the range 9-13%/a. They also foresee increasing dependence on imported oil,
demand for which is projected to rise 3-4 times over the next 10 years to
10-13 Mton in 1985 compared with 3 Mton in 1974. The cost to the balance of
payments of oil imports by 1985 is projected at 2-6 times the 1974 figure of
MUS$260, depending on the demand and oil price assumptions adopted.
1.05.     Prices of all forms of energy are subject to Government control.
Except for gasoline, the prices for petroleum products remained unchanged from
1962 to the end of 1975, when they were sharply increased, ranging from 12.5%
for gasoline to 39.1% for fuel oil. Despite these increases, fuel oil,
kerosene and gas oil prices are still subsidised compared to international
levels. These subsidies are paid from a Caisse de Compensation, which is
partly financed by special taxes on gasoline. The net burden of subsidies on
oil products on the Moroccan Treasury increased rapidly after 1973 and was
MUS$150 in 1974 and $115 m in 1975. The net cost of oil product subsidies,
following the recent price rises, are forecast at MUS$23 for 1976. Coal
prices were held down in the late 1960's, despite rising costs and as a result
the national coal company (Charbonnages Nord-Africains; CNA) made increasing
losses.   However since then, the Government has authorised a succession of
price increases, totalling 104 percent above the 1971 base level of DH 61/ton.
Electricity prices and their recent increases coupled to the increases in oil
prices are discussed in paragraph 1.20.



- 2 -
1.06      Planned sector investment for 1973-77 (updated in April 1975) is
about MDH 2,300, more than double the 1968-72 figure of some MDH 1,000. Some
71% of the investment program is for electric power system expansion, and the
remaining would largely cover the cost of increasing the petroleum-refining
capacity by 3.5 Mton/a, modernizing existing coal mining facilities, and devel-
oping a new coal mine to reach the target output of 1 Mton/a by 1981. In
addition, MDR 570 would be spent on intensified exploration for oil and gas.
1.07      Responsibility for energy is divided amongst various ministries.
Apart from a system of cross-representation on the boards of the different
agencies, there is no permanent machinery for coordination, which tends to be
poor in consequence.
1.08      The State owns all the capital of the main oil refining company
(Societe Anonyme Marocaine Italienne de Rafinage; SAMIR) and has a 50% holding
in the other (Societe Cherifienne des Petroles; SCP). A new state agency,
with a 50% holding in the main foreign distributors in petroleum products has
been set up. The State also owns 98% of the shares in CNA.
1.09      Total employment in the sector, including the National Electricity
Office and the Regies (see 1.22) is probably about 30,000. Some problems are
experienced in recruiting technical and professional staff, partly because of
the disparity between the pay scales of the civil service and the private
sector.
1.10      Financial information on SAMIR and SCP is somewhat scanty, but
analysis of the data made available suggests that both companies have experi-
enced relatively low rates of return in recent years. Information on CNA is
not available because no approved accounts have been produced since 1971.
1.11      Following the big increases in world oil prices in 1973-74, the
Government appointed a special Interministerial Committee to review national
energy policy. The Committee's report, presented in November 1974, recom-
mended a series of specific measures designed to reduce energy consumption,
but its main recommendation was that the Governent should urgently review its
energy pricing policy with the object of aligning prices with the costs to the
economy of supplying the various forms of energy. A first step in this
direction was taken when energy prices were sharply increased in late 1975 and
early 1976 (see 1.05 and 1.20).
(b) The Power Subsector
1.12      The power sector is fragmented as a result of historic developments.
Power production was not effectively regulated until 1941 when it was brought
under the supervision of the Directorate for Electricity. Even so, however,
producers were not required, before 1956, to obtain authorization to e. ecute
their expansion plans. Many decrees together with concession contracts,



- 3 -
operational contracts and guidelines for rural electrification (1949) regulated
the sector up to nationalization in 1963, when four private companies covered
most of the power activities.
1.13      From just prior to nationalization until the present, the situation
developed as follows:
(i) Energie Electrique du Maroc (EEM) was the largest pre-nationaliza-
tion company. It produced most of the electricity and distributed
outside the main population centers.  EEM's assets were acquired
in 1963 by the Government and transferred to the newly created
Governnent Enterprise, the Office National de l'Electricite (ONE).
(ii) The main distribution company was Societe Marocaine de Distribu-
tion (SMD) which had concessions in a number of larger cities.
From 1962 onward these expired and, starting with Casablanca,
the largest cities created a Regie Autonome de Distribution
(Regie). ONE took over in smaller cities where the munic-
ipalities did not wish to create a Regie.
(iii)  The Societe Cherifienne d'Energie (SCE) managed and maintained
isolated systems owned by the Government or, in exceptional cases,
by Municipalities. These systems are now managed by the Minis-
try of the Interior, except that ONE maintains a number of diesel
stations on behalf of this Ministry.
(iv)  Electras Marroquies (EM) generated, transmitted and distributed
power in Spanish Morocco (including Tangier), which was inte-
grated into the Kingdom of Morocco in 1956. In 1967 the city of
Tangier, which was connected to ONE's system created its own Regie
and consequently EM's concession was substantially curtailed. Dis-
cussions are currently being held between the Governnent and the
Spanish owners concerning the terms on which the concession would
be transferred to the Government.
1.14      Essentially, the present situation is this:
(i)  ONE generates 90% of all electric power in the country, transmits
it to the load centers, and distributes some of this energy (about
37% of total consumption) outside the large cities;
(ii)  the eleven municipal Regies purchase their power from ONE and
distribute it in and around the large population centers and
account for 50% of total consumption;
(iii)  Electras Marroquies, still privately owned, with limited installed
capacity and a distribution area in the extreme north of the coun-
try, accounts for 1% of total consumption;



-4-
(iv) the Ministry of Interior which manages and operates small systems
in about 110 isolated localities, accounts for 2% of total con-
sumption; and
(v) autoproducers, most of them industrial plants, account for about
10% of the power produced in the country.
1.15      Because, the organization of the sector has not changed basically,
the sector's main weak points are the following:
(i) ONE and Electras Marroquies are under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Public Works, but the Regies and the small systems
are under the Ministry of Interior and little co-ordination
exists between the two ministries.
(ii) The sector is regulated by a number of decrees which are not al-
ways consistent and leave many problems unsettled, such as de-
lineation of areas of supply, duties and prerogatives of the
various agencies with responsibilities in the sector including
their mutual relationship, regulation of tariffs, and a common
system of accounts (allowing inter alia for a complete segre-
gation of municipal accounts with respect to its type of services).
(iii) The Government still subsidizes the cost of coal and fuel oil
supplied to ONE and other public companies.
(iv) While ONE earns a very low rate of return on its assets in opera-
tion and finances internally less than 20% of its development pro-
gram, the Regies, without recourse to borrowing, have financed
100% of their investment and generated a cash surplus as well
(see 1.17).
1.16      Electricite de France (EdF) completed in 1973 for ONE a study of the
impact of the cost of electricity on the cost of Moroccan products and ser-
vices and of the relationship between the existing tariffs and rates and the
actual costs of supply.  No actions were t;ken on the recommendations and,
although ONE updated this study in 1975, a further revision is required in the
light of ONE's revised development program and continuously rising costs (see
6.06) and the Government is expected to adopt by June 1977 proposals, submit-
ted to it by ONE, for a new tariff structure and for rates reflecting the cost
of supply (see 5.33).
1.17      In 1973, after discussions with the Bank, the Government also
requested EdF te study under supervision of ONE, the power sector as a whole
with particular respect to its legal and administrative structure, its -rgani-
zation, the coordination between authorities and the tariffs and rates in the
distribution sector. This study has been completed recently but comparison
with ONE's finances is difficult because the accounting methods are different.
Apparently no distinction can be made between the value of electrical and other



-5-
municipal assets. The information provided in the EdF study has been presented
on a cash basis for 1968-1974, covering 10 Regies, but the earlier years are
incomplete. It is only since 1971 that financial accounts in the sector (in-
cluding ONE) are reasonably consistent. Defining internal cash generation
as net revenue less debt service plus consumers contributions (which, for ONE
was less than 10% of investments, but for the Regies covered about 60% of the
expansion program 1968-74), the total was MDH 355 for 1968-74, or 137% of the
development cost of MDH 260.  The program coverage ratio was still 131% in
1973, but reduced to 97% in 1974, probably partly due to the rapid rise in
equipment costs in the supply countries resulting from the 1973 international
oil price increases. For 1974 (no information is available on the 1975 fi-
nancial performance of the Regies) the overall internal cash generation for
the sector as defined above was:
Internal Cash
Generation       Cost      Coverage
MDH           MDH         %_
Regies                           65            67           97
ONE                              69           238           29
Total                       134          305           44
Although a further deterioration may be expected to have occurred in 1975,
the sector as a whole may presently internally finance some 35-40% of overall
investment requirements taking into account the recent tariff increases,
which is adequate but for the apparent inequities in sharing revenues.
1.18      In discussions with the Government on sectoral organization in
general (in particular power and water) the Bank has stressed its views that
it is not possible to develop any one part of the electricity (and water)
sector without taking steps to achieve balanced development of the sector as
a whole. A single authority regulating the power sector would obviously be a
solution for improving the situation, but such an objective appears unlikely
to be achievable in the short-term because the major question of a single
Ministerial jurisdiction has significant political implications. Considerable
improvements, benefitting the economy as a whole, would be possible through
definition of a consistent Government policy applicable throughout the sector.
The obvious vehicle for this would be the preparation of an electricity law
that would codify existing law, remove inconsistencies and address aspects
not regulated by existing law. The Governnent shares the Bank's concern with
respect to the deficiencies in the organization of the sector, but is of the
opinion that a fundamental reorganization will involve not only the Central
Government but in particular local governments who will have to be closely
associated in this endeavor. The Government agreed to take such steps as
shall be necessary to formulate, by June 30, 1977, recommendations for the
organizational improvement of the electricity sector and the Government will
exchange views with the Bank on the proposals being developed for the purpose.



-6-
1.19      Electricity demand has grown at about 9% since ONE's creation, with
a tendency to accelerate in recent years. All the major towns and cities are
electrified, but only some 10% of the rural population has public electricity
supply. No rapid expansion in rural areas can be expected without consider-
able Government contributions. Total installed capacity in the country at the
end of 1975 was about 945 MW, 825 MW of which is in the public sector, hydro
capacity (396 MW) constituting about 42% of the total. Generation was about
2,840 GWh in 1975 representing a plant factor 1/ of 34%.
1.20      The cost per kWh to the consumer at the end of 1975 ranged from
9.9ctm/kWh (USe2.5/kWh) in the high and middle tension networks (mostly indus-
try; the average price charged by ONE to the Regies was 12.Octm/kWh (USJ3.0/
kWh) to about 36 ctm/kWh (USé9/kWh) in the low tension network. All rates
in ONE's networks were increased by 18% on January 1, 1976 and 13% in the
networks of the Regies.
1.21      Data from the 1969 input-output table for the Moroccan economy
indicate that electricity constituted less than 1% of total industrial cost
for 120 branches of the economy (66% of the 181 studied), between 1 and 2%
for 47 branches and more than 3% for only 14 branches (the highest is for the
manufacture of cement, at 8.4%). It appears that these figures are still
substantially the same because, although the share of electricity as a primary
source of energy in the economy may have increased, its price has not in-
creased commensurate with other prices. This is illustrated by the fact that
for 1974 the Casablanca cost of living index was 153.2 (1962:100). Electricity
cost for the same year indicated an index of 97.5 and presently would still be
less than 110 (the retail tariffs were increased by 13% in early 1976).
1.22      Employment in the power subsector is some 7,500 (ONE about 4,300
and the Regies about 3,200). Training facilities for technicians and skilled
workers are good.

2.  BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCIES
2.01      The Borrower would be the Government of Morrocco because the Project
has multipurpose aspects, in which the dam, with 60% of the cost, would be a
Government undertaking (through Hydraulique) and the power station only
constitutes an addition to this dam. The executing agencies would be the
Direction de l'Hydraulique (Hydraulique) a department of the Ministry of
Public Works and Communications (Ministere des Travaux Public et des
Communication, MTPC), for the dam, and Office National de l'Electricite
(ONE) for the power station. A portion (US$5.3 million) of the proposed loan
of US$49 million would be retained by the Government for financing consulting
services; the remainder (US$43.7 million) would be onlent by the Government to
ONE for construction of the power station, transmission facilities and for
consulting services, by means of a subsidiary loan agreement, on the same
terms and conditions, which should have been entered into as a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan. A Project Agreement would be signed with
ONE in order to continue the direct relationship between the Bank and ONE
initiated under the first power loan in view of its position as autonomous
agency of the Government. ONE would act as representative of the Government
and on its own behalf with respect to the execution of its part of the Project,
procurement matters, withdrawal from the proceeds of the loan and repayment of
its part of the loan to the Government.
(a) Hydraulique
2.02      Construction Experience:  This department of MTPC is considered ex-
perienced and competent in dam construction, including the successful com-
pletion of Idriss I dam at Arabat on the Inaouene river financed by Loan
643-MOR of 1969 and the Bou Regreg dam on the river of the same name, fi-
nanced by Loan 850-MOR of 1972 (through ONEP), and has at its disposal various
qualified consultants, such as Alpinconsult of Switzerland which is respons-
ible for preparing final designs of the Project and assisting Hydraulique in
supervising execution. The same consultants, under a separate but coordinated
contract have provided similar services to ONE for the design and bidding for
the power station.
(b) Office National de l'Electricite (ONE)
2.03      Background:  ONE was created as a Government owned enterprise by
a Dahir (Royal Decree) of August 5, 1963 under the auspices of MTPC. It is
responsible for practically all generation in the public sector and for dis-
tribution in those areas not supplied by the Regies and in a number of
isolated centers under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior.
ONE's operating functions are regulated by a "Cahier des charges" (decree
of November 29, 1973) defining its rights and responsibilities and also
those of its consumers. The Ministry of Finance exercises control over its
finances through a financial controller assigned permanently to ONE'S head
office.



- 8 -
2.04      The Bank granted one loan to ONE in 1973 (936-MOR) for financing
two 20-MW gas turbines, about 580 km of new 225-kV lines and the upgrading
to 225 kV of about 340 km of 150-kV lines, together with the construction
of a new and expansion of 6 existing substations. Except for the final
conversion to 220 kV of the Casablanca-Tangier line (pending the installa-
tion of a second gas turbine in Tangier in order to avoid interruptions of
supply), the project has been completed satisfactorily at considerable
savings (about US$4 million). These savings are being applied to develop-
menit studies fcr 4 hydro nower stations on the Oum er Rbia and Sebou rivers.
2.05      Board:  The Dahir that created ONE stipulates control by a Board
chaired by the Minister of MTPC. The five other Board members are representa-
tîves of the Ministries of Interior, Finance, Agriculture, Industry and Labor.
These members are appointed by Royal Decree for a 3 year term which may be
renewed. The Board meets twice yearly but further meetings are held if spe-
cial circumstances arise; it normally limits itself to general policy and
leaves day-to-day operations to ONE's management.
2.06      Since 1973, when ONE's General Manager became Minister of MTPC, the
objective of maintaining the dialogue with the Ministry at Board level has not
been met because the Minister also continued in his post as General Manager,
although he delegated the day-to-day business to his deputy. This situation
is not entirely satisfactory because it has effectively changed Board composi-
tion and has precluded rapid decision-making procedures.
2.07      Organization and Management:  The Deputy General Manager presently
heads the training, financial, stores and procurement divisions (which are
separated from the other departments) and the four major departments: Genera-
tion and Transmission, Distribution, Planning and Construction, and Adminis-
tration. All department heads are competent Moroccans who, to a certain
extent still, rely on foreign assistants, who are now all moved to advisory
positions as trained counterpart Moroccans became available. Consultants are
employed for specific assignments (e.g. studies and pover station design) in
which expertise weighs heavily.
2.08      ONE management is generally satisfactory, except for some weaknesses
in finance and accounting (see 5.27 through 5.29). Improvement appears neces-
sary if ONE, in view of the accelerating financial requirements for its
development -- cf which the Government would meet only one third -- would seek
international financing on an increasing scale. ONE has recently appointed a
finar.cial officer to head the single financial department it intends to create
in order to realize such improvements (see 5.27).
2.09      Personnel:  At the end of 1974, ONE had a total of 4,369 ei..ployees,
including 58 expatriates (mainly French), representing an average annual growth
of 6.3% since its creation. The number of foreign employees has stead-ly
decreased from 350 (16% of total) in 1963 to 58 (1.3%) in 1974. Moroccaniza-
tion has been progressing smoothly because Government has allowed ONE to



- 9-
replace foreign employees at a reasonably slow rate commensurate with the
intensive but time-consuming training program. By the end of the decade
ONE is expected to employ some 5,000-5,200 people.
2.10      MWh (1,000  kWh) sold per employee has been increasing reasonably
from 462 MWh in 1963 to 543 MWh in 1974.  It should be noted that because
ONE is primarily a generating company selling about 88% of its production in
bulk to the Regies and to larger industries, energy sold per employee is
relatively high (about double the figure for Algeria and Tunisia). The number
of consumers per employee has also increased in relative terms from 47 in 1963
to 57 in 1974.  However, in absolute terms, the number is low because ONE's
main interest is generation, not distribution (about half the figures for
Algeria and Tunisia). By 1980 sales may be expected to reach some 750-800
MWh/employee and consumers would number 62-65/employee.
2.11      Training:  The process of Moroccanization, coupled with the conti-
nuous expansion of ONE's system, continue to constitute a major task for
providing a sufficient number of qualified staff at all levels. ONE has an
efficient training center at Ain Sebaa (Casablanca) with about 200 places.
About 3,500 employees have been trained in various skills since 1963 (an
average of almost 300 employees/a). Plans for the next 5 years envisage the
training of some 750 technicians and skilled workers. For its professional
engineers ONE can draw on the main engineering school in Rabat (Ecole
Mohammedia d'Ingenieurs) and the Ecole des Travaux Publics in Casablanca.
Because of the much higher salaries paid in the private sector, ONE has
experienced some problems in retaining and attracting suitably qualified
staff. However, trainees at all levels are required to remain a number of
years in ONE's employment, which somewhat alleviates this problem.
2.12      In contrast with the technical training, ONE has no facilities
for training of its accounting staff, except "on the job" (see 5.28).
2.13      Facilities:  ONE's generating capacity developed as follows:.

The number of hydro stations and units is large, with an average of 10 MW per
unit; however, 220 MW - comprising 5 units - is concentrated in two stations
on the Oued el Abid river and the average unit size in the other hydro stations
is only about 5 MW. The firm hydro capacity (the minimum capacity available
during peak time in a dry year) which presently is about 65% of installed
capacity, is decreasing steadily, together with generation, at an annual rate
of some 2-3% due to increasing upstream diversions for irrigation. The total
storage capacity of reservoirs associated with power is about 2,400 x 106 m3
(45% in the Bin el Ouidane reservoir in the Oued el Abid river) and average
hydraulicity represents 1,400 GWh/a (0.58 m3/kWh) at a plant factor of 40%.
The Project will approximately double the total storage capacity associated
with power and increase hydro capacity by 120 MW (30% of the 1975 hydro cap-
acity) and 315 GWh/a (23% of the present hydro average), although generation
of existing downstream plants will reduce due to diversion of Oum er Rbia
waters for irrigation (Doukkala); Sidi Cheho's generation will further reduce
due to upstream diversions for irrigation. Effective generation would thus
decrease to some 240-250 GWh/a by the year 1995.
2.14      At the end of 1974, ONE's extensive system comprised the following
lines:
1,154 km of 225-kV, 1,660 km of 150-kV, 4,230 km of 60-kV, 130 km
of 30-kV 6,450 km of 22-kV, and about 3,600 km of lower voltage
lines. The distribution voltage is 127/220 V at 50 Hz, but new
networks are executed at 220/380V.
2.15      All of ONE's installations are technically well conceived and con-
structed and in good working condition.
2.16      Development of Facilities:  ONE's development program in generation
is summarized below:

2.17      The adequacy of this program and its costs are discussed in 3.09
through 3.11 and in 4.09 respectively. The main feature is the shift to
increased investments for hydro plant in order to maximize utilization of
indigenous resources in the light of the 1973/74 rise in oil prices. Never-
theless, Morocco's dependence on thermal plant will continue to grow be-
cause feasible future hydro developments would probably not exceed 1,300
GWh in generation (about equal to the present hydro generation). ONE has
scheduled the Dechra el Oued and the M'Dez plants for completion by 1980 in
order to meet demand and energy requirements, but the Government has not yet
authorized construction. It appears possible that both plants, aggregating
125 MW and a firm energy of 125 GWh/a, may not be completed in time.  This may
cause problems, particularly with respect to generating capability, if 1980
should be a dry year (see 3.09). For purposes of this report it has been
assumed that a decision on both hydro plants will be taken soon.
2.18      Transmission development is expected to be the following:

By the end of the decade the system would comprise approximately 2,100 km of
225 kV (an increase of almost 90% over 1974); 6,700 km of 60 kV (60%), 9,600
km of 22 kV (50%). The low voltage distribution expansion is expected to be
about 50% from 3,600 km in 1971 to some 5,400 km by 1980.
2.19      The need for a national dispatch center, although not great, is
growing.  Studies have been initiated but no overall plan is yet available
and no separate estimate of cost has been included in the development program.
It appears that a dispatch center could be justified early in the next decade
with the completion of the 250-MW Mohammedia thermal station (1981/82).
2.20      International Interconnection:  Limited local exchanges of power
between Oujda (Morocco) and Marnia (Algeria) at 22 kV have been made for
a long time.  A project is currently in execution for a 225-kV connection
between Oujda in Morocec and Ghazaout in Algeria (which completed its part up
to the border i.n 1975) following a 1972 study executed by EdF which confirmed
that the link would have technical and ecolomic benefits for both countries.
For Algeria, ît would assure continuity of supply to the industrial zones of
Tlemcen and Ghazaout (dependent on a single circuit 225-kV line) and for both
countries thermal plant operation could be optimized, spinning reserves pooled
and benefits obtained in view of the different time zones. Whether this
connection will be operational in the near future, given the present strained
relations between the countries, is uncertain.
2.21      Planning:  The outline of ONE's development program presCnLly in
execution resulted from a comprehensive study made in 1971/72 in coll?bora-
tion with EdF, using a series of computer programs to simulate ONE's gene-
rating and transmission systems. ONE's Planning Department now regularly



- 13 -
updates the study and some major changes have been made due to the reintro-
duction of hydro plant. This would also require expansion of the 225-kV
system: (a) south of Casablanca, in order to expand the network and connect
Sidi Cheho to the grid, followed by the upstream Dechra el Oued plant and the
downstream Merija plant, and (b) in the north for connecting the planned
stations on the Sebou river to the west-east tie lines.
2.22      The technical quality of ONE's planning is satisfactory and the
need for consulting services for overall planning is steadily decreasing.
However, ONE uses financial rather than economic considerations in justi-
fying its investment decisions and even this is occasionally frustrated by
outside political decisions (dam heights are usually not optimized econo-
mically with respect to the multipurpose uses but set at the highest tech-
nical level possible in order to have available optimum water resources).
It is only recently that ONE, for purpose of the Project, has made an
effort to prepare a least cost generation development study using the dis-
cour.ted cash flow method (see Section 6). Distribution planning is carried
out entirely by ONE's distribution department, except for the part of rural
electrification that is financed by Government contributions. This part
ia planned jointly by ONE and the communities involved and is approved by
a special commission of the Minîstry of Public Works. Design features,
however, are basically the same and follow ONE's Guidelines.
2.23      Operations:  ONE presently operates 17 hydro stations and 11
thermal stations (see 2.13) the latter including the coal-fired station at
Jerada (165 MW) in the east of the country and the oil-fired station Roches
Noires (152 ffl) near Casablanca on the coast. A 60-MW unit at Roches Noires
is designed to burn coal also but this has been abandoned because Jerada
requirements (about 660,000 t annually) already exceed coal production
(450,000 t in 1974). A large stock of coal, mined before Jerada was com-
missioned in 1971/72, is available to tide ONE over until production is
increased as scheduled to some 800,000 t/a in 1977/78 and 1 million t/a in
1981. ONE also maintains 11 small diesel power stations (41 units wîth an
effective capacity of about 4 MW) on behalf of the Ministry of the Interior,
in isolated systems. ONE's generation data, fuel cost and efficiencies, for
1970 (historic) 1975 (the actual figures are expected to hardly differ from
the figures presented here), 1977 (prior to commissioning of new hydro works)
and 1980 (new hydro plant operational, including Sidi Cheho) at present fuel
prices, are the following:

/2   No breakdown availabLe.
2.24      Until early 1973 when the coal price paid by ONE was increased for
the first time, ONE paid DH/55 ton compared with an average production cost
that was already estimated at DH 104/t in 1971. The coal price was increased
by 25% in 1973, 35% in 1974 and 15% in late 1975. Until the end of 1975 fuel
oil was heavily subsidized and ONE did not pay more than the 1973 price of DH
152.45/t (DH 15.40/Gcal or about US$0.89/MBtu) compared with purchase and re-
fining cost of not less than DH 400/ton (DH 40.40/Gcal or about US$2.32/MBtu).
Part of the oil price subsidies have now been removed. The present price
charged to ONE for fuel oil is DR 202.05/t or DH 20.40/Geal (US$1.17/MBtu)
and for coal DH 103.80/t, or DH 19.96/Gcal (US$1.14/MBtu).
2.25      Because no forecast can be made as to when, and by what steps, the
Government may further raise coal and oil prices to reflect production cost,
the same price has been assumed until the end of the decade and that any price
increase would be passed on to the consumers automatically (see 2.26 and 5.33).
The impact of fuel price increases, coupled with the steadily increasing re-
quirements of thermal generation, on cost per kWh sold, is considerable:

1974       12.5 /1    3.1 /2       25       1979      20.1 /1    4.9 /2    24
1980     23.5        4.6         20
/1  Rate increases:  5% both in 1973 and 1974, 18% in 1976, 10% in 1977, 6% in
1978, 9% in 1979, and 15% in 1980.
/2  Coal price increases:  25% in 1973, 35% in 1974, 15% in 1976.
/3  Fuel oil price increase:  39.1% in 1976 for fuel No. 2 and 23% for gas oil.
It can be seen from this table that the rate increases of 5% in 1973 and 1974
respectively have not kept pace with the increase in fuel prices (i.e. coal
only) and that as a consequence ONE's financial position has been eroded (see
5.03). The situation was aggravated in 1975, because of an extremely dry
year, which increased ONE's cost for fuels significantly. If fuel prices are
raised by 1980 to production cost (which may be in the order of DH 180/t for
coal -- if not more -- and about DH 400/t for fuel oil) the overall cost of
fuel would be some 8.5-9.0 ctm/kWh sold. Such measures would raise effective
rates by 15-20% by the end of the decade. (Refer to Section 6 for a discus-
sion on ONE's tariffs and rates.)
2.26       Because (a) about 65% of all generation would be thermal until the
end of the decade (and proportionally higher in the event of delays in hydro
plant completion), (b) ONE's costs depend highly on wet or dry years, and
(c) rate increases are coupled to an increase in fuel prices but appear to be
only loosely correlated, it would be necessary that all increases in the
prices of fuels above a predetermined base price are passed on automatically
to the ultimate consumers (see 5.37).
2.27      Operational Indicators:  Although ONE annually prepares statistical
data, they are not easily accessible (except for the general technical data
as published in ONE's annual Rapport d'Activite, such as capacities, demand,
generation and sales) or suitable to monitor ONE's performance. ONE will in-
clude in the first Quarterly Progress Report of each year, a set of statisti-
cal data discussed during negotiations. During supervision the subject would
be reviewed regularly with ONE in order to discuss and define appropriate
monitoring targets and evaluation methods.

3. THE MARKET AND THE MEANS TO MEET IT
3.01      Market Aspects:  Historically the market has been substantially
defined by the area of responsibility within the sector: (a) ONE generates
about 90% of all electricity produced in the country and distributes about
one-third of it to its own consumers which are largely non-residential (94%
of ONE's sales) and located outside the main population centers, (b) the
Regies do not generate but distribute about 50% of country production in
the main population centers (non-residential supply is about 75% of the
Regies' sales), (c) the Ministry of the Interior carries responsibility
for generation and distribution in all isolated systems (2% of the market),
(d) Electras Marroquies, the only privately owned company in the country has
a small concession near Tangier with 1% of the market, and (e) autoproducers,
who meet their own requirements and constitute about 10% of the market (some
of them sell small amounts of excess energy to ONE). For 1975 the sales and
share of the market on the users level is expected to be as follows:
GWh        Share of the Market
ONE                            1,050                37
Regies                         1,425                50
Ministry of the Interior          40                 2
Electras Marroquies               30                 1
Autoproducers (estimate)         295                10
2,840               100
3.02      The share of the market of each of the consumer categories in ONE's
interconnected system, i.e. including the Regies, has changed remarkably lit-
tile in the last 10 years and little change is expected until 1980 (see Table
3-1 for detailed information):

By 1980, the industrial and agricultural share of the market would only in-
crease by about 2 percentage points and residential services and public
lighting would decrease similarly.

Since 1965 industrial plants have tended to be constructed near urban centers
because of convenient access to the labour market and other facilities and
therefore ONE's non-residential share of the market dropped accordingly. How-
ever a slight improvement is expected, due to an increase in mining efforts
(predominantly phosphate) and construction of cement plants both of which, by
nature of location of natural resources, are normally outside urban areas.
The continuous relative increase in residential supplies reflects ONE's spread
into rural areas, including accelerated connection to the main system of rural
centers already electrified.

3.04      Access to Supply:  No comprehensive national figures by numbers and
proportion of the population having access to electricity are available.
However the following table shows 1971 and 1974 figures for the proportion of
rural households in ONE's supply area which are provided with electricity.

Because access to supply in the major urban centers and adjacent communities
supplied by the Regies is easier and the population density far higher, the
national figures should be appreciably higher than indicated above. ONE's
total number of consumers has increased from 116,000 in 1965 to about 248,000
in 1974, i.e. at an average growth rate of 8.8%/a. The number of bulk consum-
ers (including the 11 Regies) increased from 710 to 1,378 over the same period,
the latter representing 94% of ONE's total sales.
3.05      Forecasting:  For forecasting ONE uses statistical extrapolation,
based on past trends of sales to each class of consumer, adjusted to take
account of major expected new loads.  This has resulted in the assumption
of a steady 8% average growth rate up to 1972, although actual increases have
been rather erratic as shown in the following table providing ONE's and the
Regies combined sales for two five-year periods:

The average 1965-1975 growth rate was 8.6% compared wtth a statistical trend
of 8.8%, indicating, together with the above figures, a modest growth a.celera-
tion. It should be noted that the 1975 growth was suppressed when, due eo the
march to the then Spanish Sahara, many industries came to a virtual stand-still.

3.06      ONE, assisted by the Regies, has recently made an extensive survey
of the market which resulted in estimated retail sales of 4,840 GWh by 1980 to
both its own and the Regies consumers, representing an average annual growth
of about 14% over 1975. It was considered prudent during appraisal to reduce
the 1980 estimate by about 12% to 4,275 GWh and adjust intermediate years
accordingly, in order to take into account the possible effects of future
tariff increases, possible delays in industrial load materializing, and to
avoid, to the extent possible, overstatement of ONE's financial results. This
results in an average growth rate for 1975-1980 of 11.5% broken down as follows:
Sales         Growth Rate
GWh               %
1975                        2,475
1976                        2,810             13.5
1977                        3,155             12.3
1978                        3,580             13.5
1979                        3,930              9.8
1980                        4,275              8.8
1975-1980                                       11.5
The rather high growth rate through 1978 is attributed firstly (1976) to the
return to normal conditions in industry and secondly (1977/78) to the comple-
tion of a relatively large number of industrial plants by the end of the
current 5-year plan. It appears probable that, due to unforseen delays in
completion of industrial plant, the 1978 growth rate may be somewhat lower and
the 1979/80 growth rates correspondingly higher; this would not materially
affect the average results for the 5-year period.

market requirements in the ONE/Regies interconnected system up to 1980 are

The above table highlights the sharp decrease in the relative importance of
hydro generation from 89% in 1965 to some 43% in 1975 (assuming that 1975
has been an average hydro year; in fact it was extremely dry and hydro genera-
tion constituted only 33% of total generation). A further decline to 35% by
1980 is expected. Hydro capacity, of course, reduces accordingly, but in a
lesser degree because of its peaking plant characteristics.
3.08      Maximum Demand:  As can be observed in the above table, maximum
demand has grown somewhat less than generation (1965-1970: 7.1%/a for maximum
demand and 7.8%/a for generation; 1970-1975: 9.3%/a and 9.7%/a); indicating a
slow but steady increase in load factor reflecting the increasing share of
industry in the market. This trend is expected to continue through 1980 (955
MW), when the load factor would average 61% and demand would grow at an
average of 9.7%/a during 1975-1980 compared with 11.0%/a for generation.
3.09      Satisfaction of Requirements:  With the planned additions to the
generation plant, the capacity margin (i.e. reserves) level, which has been
steadily decreasing since 1965, is expected to increase again to about 35% by
1980. However, ONE's main problem is not capacity (para. 4.03) but rather the
possibility of a shortfall in generating capability during a dry year (one in
20), as can be observed in the following table which assumes the outage
(maintenance and forced) of one 60-MW and one 75-MW thermal unit (reducing
thermal capacity from 753 MW to 618 MW):
1980
MW          GWh
Hydro, Effective                470           950
Thermal                          618        4,080 (65% of 715 MW, year
average)
Available                      1,088        5,030
Required                        (955)      (5,105)
Margin                           133         -75
The capacity margin (with outage of 135 MW' would be about 9% of total
installed capacity (1,468 MW), which is reasonable and allows for some un-
forseen slippage in plant completion. However, energy capability would be
insufficient for 1980 (even with a prudent maintenance schedule or somewhat
better hydrology during the year); the capability would be marginal and fur-
ther plant (Mohammedia 2x125 MW) is needed by 1981/82.
3.10      Losses:  Overall Losses have historically been modest and are ex-
pected to remain so through 1980:

Generation              3,034       100.0           5,105       100.0
Although these relatively low losses reflect, on the one hand, the high design
standards of the Moroccan power facilities, some over-investment may be present.
3.11      Transmission and Distribution Facilities:  Expansion of these faci-
lities would be commensurate with the expected growth rate of about 11% for
the remainder of the decade, i.e. deducting an estimated growth in existing
systems of 3-4%, networks would be extended some 6-7% annually on the average
until 1980; that is: 60-225 kV from about 7,000 km (1974) to about 10,000
km and related transformer capacity from 2,900 MVA (1974) to about 4,400 MVA
22 kV from 6,450 km (1974) to about 9,600 km and low voltage distribution
lines from about 3,600 km to some 5,400 km. This correlates reasonably well
with ONE's expansion plan (see 2.18).

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
(a)       Construction Program 1975-1980
4.01      ONE's construction programs are part of the 5-year national develop-
ment programs. The current program terminates in 1977 and ONE, which annually
updates its forecasts and plans in order to meet the increase in demand and to
allow for adequate lead time, has already outlined required developments through
1982. The main feature of this plan, in comparison with historic development,
is the shift to increased investments for hydro plant in the light of the 1973-
1974 increases in world oil prices justifying the emphasis on maximum utiliza-
tion of indigenous energy sources. Most existing and new hydro developments,
however, include irrigation and as a consequence power generation is not only
dependent on the regulation required for downstream irrigation but will pro-
gressively decrease due to growing upstream irrigation requirements.
4.02      Generating Plant:  The forecast installed capacities have been shown
in 2.16 above and comparing these capacities with forecast demand (para. 3.07)
results in the following if the forecast is extended until the end of the
next 5-year plan:
1975  1976  1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982
Installed Capacity (MW)       803   823   934  1,158  1,353  1,468  1,754  2,079
Maximum Demand (MW)           600   660   750    830    900    955  1,030  1,100
Capacity Margin:
MW                          203   163   184    328    453    513    724    979
% of Installed Capacity    25    20    20        28      33     35      41     47
4.03      The present capacity margin of 25% is low in relation to installed
capacity (a margin 35-40% would not be unreasonable) taking into account the
sensitivity of hydro (about 50% of installed capacity) to the effects of dry
years and its dependence on irrigation water release patterns. The rather
low capacity margin will persist for several years, until in 1980 a more rea-
sonable margin of 35% is reached.
4.04      For 1981/82, the capacity margins would be rather excessive and it
appears reasonable to assume, for definition of the construction expenditure
schedule, that commissioning of several plants would be delayed by 1-2 years.
Deferral of the decision to construct the plant in the light of the excess
capacity and financial constraints may cause some delays in construction.
Also for this reason, no expenditures have been assumed up to 1981 for
generating plants additional to those included in the present program.
4.05      Transmission:  ONE's expansion targets for transmission lines and
substations have been shown above (para. 2.18). Comparing installed trans-
former capacity with maximum demand in MVA (assuming an average power factor
of 0.8 in ONE's relatively extensive system) shows the following:



- 25 -
1975            1980             1982
Maximum Demand (MVA)                        750           1,200            1,380
Transformer MVA available per
MVA of maximum demand                    3.9             3.8              3.7
The program appears reasonable; taking into account that presently some 1,000
MVA is transformed 2 times (from 225 kV and 150 kV to 60 kV and the various
intermediate tensions), the effective ratio would be in the order of 2.5 MVA/
MVA of demand.
4.06      Urban and Rural Distribution:  ONE is responsible for expanding dis-
tribution outside the main urban centers (the municipal undertakings - Regies -
purchase electricity in bulk from ONE) representing about 40% (1974: 965 GWh)
of total retail sales (1974: 2,287 GWh) in the interconnected system. At the
low voltage distribution level ONE's sales represent only about 6% (1974: 138
GWh) of retail sales. Assuming normal expansion, ONE's distribution invest-
ments can be expected to be in the order of 20% of total country investment
for distribution (see 3.03), provided allowance is made for relatively higher
costs of such networks compared with costs in more densely populated urban
areas. However, it is difficult to evaluate the adequacy of ONE's program be-
cause each Regie plans and executes its own distribution program independently
and details of these individual programs are not available. In 1974 ONE's
investment in distribution was probably about 25% of the combined investments
of the Regies and ONE, which appears reasonable.
4.07      Expansion in rural areas is limited because of shortages of funds and
organizational complexities. Responsibility for rural areas is divided among
the Ministries of Public Works, Interior, and Agriculture and Agrarian Reform,
with ONE acting as executing agency. A program is defined each year by a
committee representing the various ministries and ONE, within the limits
of approved budgetary allocations for rural electrification in each Ministry
and a contribution by ONE of 4.5% of its revenues for the sale of electricity
(set by law and representing ONE's part of the rural development plans for
the year). Therefore, financial rather than technical considerations deter-
mine the expansion program and this makes planning uncertain for more than
one year ahead.
4.08      In any event, the rural electrification program to date is of limited
scope and impact; some 11% of all households in the rural areas have access to
electricity (see 3.04). No improvement can be expected without considerably
increased Government contributions.
4.09      Construction Program Costa:  The costs of ONE's 1975-1980 development
program shown in Table 4-1 would amount to about MDH 4,200, as follows:

Total                  242      442     646      819     941   1,144    4,234
The above estimate includes a price contingency of about MDH 1,200.  This
contingency takes into account: (i) price ceiling contract conditions for
works in execution, (ii) some provisions for increased costs already included
in ONE's estimate (thermal plant), and (iii) for all remaining items, including
those for which the contractual ceiling is in excess of the percentages as-
sumed for the above table. Price increases were compounded at annual rates of
14% (1976), 12% (1977-79) and 10% (1980) for local costs, and of 10% (1976), 8%
(1977-79) and 7% (1980) for foreign cost.
4.10      The composition of the construction program and its cost have been
revised to maintain a reasonable relation between forecast maximum demand and
installed capacity (see 4.04). The major increase in construction would be in
generating plant constituting some 70% of the cost of the total program, trans-
mission and distribution physically progressing, until the end of the decade,
in approximate accordance with past development, increased annually in approxi-
mate accordance with load growth. Because preparatory work for generating
plant is generally managed by consultants and each station is, or would be,
executed under a single or a few contracts (consultants providing assistance
for supervising execution) ONE should have no undue difficulties in physically
managing this large program. The main constraint on its execution is expected
to be financial, largely dictated by the amount of Government contributions.
No forecast with respect to these constraints and possible further reduction
in the program can be made at this stage beeause: (i) the definition of the
1978-1982 national plan is still in its initial stages, (ii) direct and
indirect effects of the recent and possible future economic measures (e.g.
reduction in fuel subsidies, increase in power rates) can not be assessed
with any degree of certainty.
4.11      Economic Share of Costs of Dams:  The above program does not include
any share of the cost attributable to ONE for dams or diversion tunnelN which
will be executed by Hydraulique both for irrigation and power purposes. Since
ONE's establishment in 1963, new dams have been constructed and complet( for
irrigation purposes. ONE has only added power stations at a later date if
generation was shown to be economically feasible on the basis of the cost of
the power station alone. Most of these stations were found marginal at best



- 27 -
at pre-1974 fuel prices, and neither the Government nor ONE contemplated in-
cluding a portion of the cost of these dams in ONE's assets.
4.12      During negotiations this issue was discussed and Goverument ex-
plained that it was the policy to utilize taxes on petroleum products to
benefit the relevant sectors (e.g. taxes on petrol are used for roads). In
the case of electric power, the proceeds of a 17% tax on fuel oil used by ONE
are channelled to Hydraulique for use in constructing water resource projects.
In this manner electricity consumers pay for a share in the cost of hydro
facilities and therefore a further allocation of dam costs to ONE is not
considered to be desirable as this would result in a measure of double charges
to electricity consumers. While the policy is not unreasonable, it has not
been possible to take account of this tax in the financial and economic fore-
casts because there is no specific legal basis or separate fund allocation
(the taxes form part of Goverument's general revenues).
(b)       The Project
4.13      Description:  The Project, which will be constructed on the Oum er
Rbia river not far from the main Casablanca-Marakech road (see the Main Power
System Map at the end of this report) consists of the construction of:
(a) A concrete buttressed dam (volume about 340,000 m3) - to be called
the Al Massira dam - with a crest elevation of 290 m above sea
level, 66 m above the river bed (82 m above rock bed), crest 390 m
long and 7 m wide. Four radial gates above the middle of the river
bed, together with a ski-jump spoiler, constitute the spillway for
2,600 m3/s, backed-up by bottom outlets with 6 radial gates below it
for 1,390 m3/s. Stop-log and vertical fixed roller gates are pro-
vided for maintenance and repair. Flood protection is against a 100
year flood which is considered sufficient in view of future upstream
reservoirs.
(b)  Two dikes aggregating 1,880 m in length and about 1.2 Mm3 in
volume.
(c) A concrete power station at the foot of the dam, excavated in
the right embankment, with 2 vertical Francis turbines (95-
126 m3/s) coupled to alternators 75 MVA, 50 Hz, cos0=0.85 and
10.5 kV. The tailrace canal, also to be excavated in the
right embankment, would be 225 m long.
(d) Two transformers, 75 MVA, 10.5/225 kV, forced air cooled, which
would be unit connected to the alternators, located on a plat-
form over the tailrace canal immediately behind the power station.
(e)  A substation, located on the right embankment, about 100 m
downstream from the power station, line connected to the trans-
formers, with a single busbar system with 5 bays (2 for alter-
nators and 3 for outgoing lines).



- 28 -
(f) Three transmission lines, fitting into a newly planned 225-kV
triangle, respectively 110 km (Sidi Cheho--Tit Mellil), 50 km
(Sidi Cheho-Benguerir) and 45 km (Sidi Cheho-Sidi Bennour) long.
The end substations will be upgraded to 225 kV and incoming line
bays added.
(g) Engineering services for Sidi Cheho, including further surveys,
model testing and similar services, coordination of the final de-
sign of the Sidi Cheho dam and power station and assistance to
Hydraulique and ONE for supervision of execution of the work at a
total estimated (1975) cost of MDH 31 with a foreign component of
about MUS$3.4 equivalent.
(h) Engineering services for surveys, preliminary design, prepa-
ration and issue of bid documents and assistance in evalua-
tion of the bids, for the Merija compensating dam and power
station downstream for Sidi Cheho at a total estimated (1975)
cost of DH 8 m with a foreign component of about US$1.6 m.
4.14      The river basin above Sidi Cheho has an area of 28,500 km and the
main data for river and reservoir to be formed are the following:
River
Average annual flow:        99.1 m3/s (3,126 Mm3/a)
Minimum flow:               50 m3/s
Ten year flood:            2,030 m3/s
Hundred year flood:        3,900 m3/s
Thousand year flood:       5,850 m3/s
Reservoir
Maximum area                180 km2
Normal area                 155 km2
Maximum volume              3,250 Mm3
Normal volume               2,800 Mm3/a
Evaporation                 160 Mm3/a
Live volume                 2,160 Mm3 for power and
2,320 Mm3 for irrigation
Reservoir silting          80 years for 600 Mm3
(without upstream regulation)
Generation                  310 GWh/a (effective generation reducinR
commensurate with decrease in down-stre a
plant generation due to irrigation diver-
sion and with upstream diversions)

4.1,      Background:  Development of land and water resources of the Oum er
Rbia Basin has been studied since 1926 and some 130,000 ha are irrigated in
the basin. Studies for the Sidi Cheho dam and power station were initiated
in 1938 primarily for power purposes and continued in 1948/49 and 1953/54,
i.e. before ONE was created. The preliminary design comprised a concrete
dam with a crest (and reservoir level) 10 m below the present design. The
emphasis was shifted in the late sixties and early seventies to the design
of a dam having irrigation as its main objective. Because of the dam's con-
venient location it would also serve to provide industrial and potable water
for the coastal region, including Casablanca. The basin surveys were com-
pleted (ORSTOM-SOFRELEC of France) in 1971 and the final studies for the
dam and power station, together with the design and bid decuments (by
Alpinconsult of Switzerland) in June 1975. The crest was raised by 10 m
to allow for maximum storage and practically full river regulation upon
completion of the Dechra el Oued dam upstream of Sidi Cheho (presently in
design) in order to maximize water availability.
4.16      Scarcity of water resources prompted the Governnent to prepare a
"Water Resources Master Plan" for the basin with the objective of optimizing
the water to the three main users (water supply, irrigation, power). The
latest plan was completed in 1974/75 by SCET International of France with the
assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, setting the main design para-
meters for the Dechra el Oued dam (given Sidi Cheho crest elevation) and out-
lining optimized agricultural development on the basis of assuming priority
ranking as follows: (1) potable and industrial water, (2) agriculture, and
(3) power. The Bank has recently made a loan for the Doukkala irrigation
project (Loan 1201-MOR; first phase, not dependent on Sidi Cheho) and intends
to appraise a potable/industrial water project and a second phase Doukkala
irrigation project in the near future. Both these latter projects would use
water regulated by the Sidi Cheho dam.
4.17      Objectives:  Together with the power Project discussed here, these
Bank projects constitute a first step towards a more comprehensive multi-
purpose scheme having as the main objectives to: (a) optimize water use in
the Oum er Rbia Basin to the extent practicable, (b) further strengthen the
decision-making methods and procedures for the appropriate use of the country's
water resources, (c) increase coordination between the various ministries and
agencies (Public Works, Water Resources, Roads, Education, Public Health) for
sound overall development of natural and human resources. Additionally, the
proposed Project would have the objectives, (d) to formulate one comprehen-
sive power sector policy, and (e) strengthen ONE's managerial capabilities.
4.18      Construction and Supervision Responsibilities:  The dam (including
hydro equipment and excavation for the power station) would be executed by
Hydraulique on behalf of the Government, and the power station by ONE on its
own behalf. Both Hydraulique and ONE would supervise their respective part
of the Project. Project administration would be shared by ONE and Hydraulique.

A similar arrangement functioned satisfactorily for the construction and
supervision of two other similar projects financed by the Bank (Idriss I dam,
Loan 643-MOR; Bou Regreg dam, Loan 850-MOR) and no major problems are expected.
4.19      Project Cost:  The estimated cost of the Project is the following
(see Table 4-2 for details, including the breakdown between ONE and
Hydraulique):

4.20      The estîmates are based on:  (a) the civil works contract for the
dam already awarded to Campenon-Bernard of France, (b) the contract price
for the hydromechanical equipment contract with Bouchayer, Viallet, Scheider
of France and (c) the draft of the contract for the power station with Brown
Boveri of Germany, and (d) Hydraulique's and ONE's estimates of indirect
foreign exchange costs (about DH 120 m) for materials of which Morocco is a
net importer such as cement, construction steel, reinforcing steel and fuel,
and (e) a number of smaller contracts awarded after local bidding for roads
and housing, and contracts for surveys (seismic) and services (power connec-
tion, telephone connection, laboratory work). When preparing their respective
investment program neither Hydraulique nor ONE make consistent allowances for
future price rises, except in incidental cases, or the low 5%/a apparently
indicated by the Secretariat for the National Plan for the current Plan. Be-
cause the civil works contract and the contract for hydro machanical equipment
allow a ceiling of 14%/a on price increases which would probably exceed actual
inflationary trends, a lower price contingency was assumed for these items,
compounded at the annual rates assumed for the overall investment program,
i.e. 14% (1976), 12% (1977-79) and 10% (1980) for local costs, and of 10%
(1976), 8% (1977-79) and 7% (1980) for direct foreign expenditures under the
contracts (i.e. it has been assumed that indirect foreign cost would follow
the local inflationary trends). The contract for the power station has total
price ceilings for each of the currencies involved, which have been included.
4.21      Physical contingencies of 7% for hydro mechanical equipment, 5% for
the power station and 10% for transmission have been assumed. For civil works
and local cost a physical contingency of 15% has been assumed. A special
risks allowance of 10% of the base cost of the dam has been assumed in view of
further measures that may be required to reinforce buttresses or the dam's
base (see 4.26).
4.22      The ultimate cost of the 120 MW power station alone is estimated to
be about MDH 230 (MUS$53) or US$440/kW (US$400/kW excluding taxes and duties).
This appears reasonable for the relatively small hydro plant.
4.23      Project Financing Plan:  The Project cost is expected to be fi-
nanced as follows:
US$ Million
DH Million      Equivalent       %
Proposed Bank Loan                     215             49.0          29
Co-financing                           180             41.2          25
Budget Allocations to Hydraulique    241               55.0          33
ONE's Internal Resources and
Government Contributions              96             21.9
732            167.1        1.00
A Bank loan of MUS$49 is proposed. Of this, MUS$43.7 would be onlent to ONE
to cover 90% of the cost of the power station and 60% of the cost of the



33 -
transmission facilities (representing the estimated foreign cost of these
works), and the foreign exchange cost of consulting services. The remaining
MUS$5.3 would be allocated to Hydraulique to cover the foreign exchange cost
of consulting services. A cofinancing loan of MUS$41.2 has been assumed to
cover the remaining direct foreign exchange cost of the civil works for the
dam (MUS$7.3), the hydro mechanical equipment (MUS$6.9), and the estimated
indirect foreign exchange cost (MUS$27.0) of materials of which Morocco is
a net importer (mainly cement, steel and fuel).
4.24      Engineering and Supervision:  Alpinconsult of Switzerland will
continue to be consulting engineers for the Sidi Cheho dam under an existing
contract acceptable to the Bank. Under a recent contract, acceptable to the
Bank, it will also make available to Hydraulique special staff to assist
Hydraulique in supervising the execution of works. This firm has executed
most of the surveys and the final study, design and bid documents for all of
the Sidi Cheho facilities. ONE, on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank will obtain the services of an expert from Electricite de France (EdF)
for assistance in supervising execution of the power station and such services
as may be required for particular tasks (factory testing and similar).
4.25      Merija Hydro Plant,Study:  The proposed loan would finance the for-
eign exchange cost of consulting services, up to the award of the construction
contract, for the Merija hydro power station downstream of Sidi Cheho. Con-
sultants (Garbe Lahmeyer of Germany) have been engaged by Hydraulique and ONE
under two separate but technically coordinated contracts acceptable to the
Bank.
4.26      Dam Design and Inspection:  Although dam design is meticulous, the
Bank has expressed its concern with the design of the quartzite (metamorphosed
sandstone) abutments upon which the dam will rest, since they are proposed to
be formed as relatively high steps (up to 13 m). The rock under the dam is
expected not to be solid but to consist of a mass of close-fitting blocks
w*ith individual volume of one to several m3, and fragmented randomly, which
may be of some concern under a buttress type of dam. The designers have re-
cognized this problem and are contemplating remedial action if the foundations
are found to be unsatisfactory in certain areas. Although Hydraulique con-
templates measures to be taken for reinforcing lateral support of the abut-
ments, no estimate of these costs bas been provided. For this reason a
special contingency of about 10% of the basic cost of the dam has been in-
cluded in the estimates for special risks, equivalent to MUS$1.6, each for
local and foreign costs. This provision, however, would not be financed by
the loan which - with respect to the dam - would only finance consulting
services (see 4.23).
4.27      The dam design provides for satisfactory instrumentation for con-
tinuously monitoring its soundness and therefore no special provisions are
required in this respect, and the hydroworks will be inspected regularly by
Hydraulique in accordance with sound engineering practices.



- 34 -
4.28      Implementation:  The main contract for the dam was awarded in
October 1975 with Bank concurrence and as of May 1976 the excauvation for the
dam (except under the river) and dikes was almost completed. The contract for
hydro mechanical equipment was awarded in March 1976, and for the power sta-
tion (to be financed by the proposed loan), with Bank concurrence, in April
1976. The preliminary work schedule is shown on the next page. In order to
schedule construction phases in accordance with the seasons and to avoid a
delay of one year, contracting before loan approval was required and justi-
fied. Consequently all contract (including consulting contracts) have been
awarded with Bank approval, except for transmission, covering about 90% of the
proposed loan and retroactive financing is proposed not exceeding MUS$5 to
cover payments made under the contract for the power station and for consult-
ing services since October 1975.
4.29      Procurement:  Procurement of goods and services under the proposed
loan is being done in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. However, Bank
procedures have not been applied by Hydraulique as far as the public bid
opening is concerned for the dam (which, however, would not be financed by the
proposed Bank loan) because it followed the official procedures of MTPC where-
by all bids are opened in the presence of a statutory bid analysis commission.
This procedure provides satisfactory safeguards against post-opening changes
in the substance of the bids. However, during negotiations the Government has
indicated that it will inform its agencies to have no objection to future
public opening of bids. ONE's procurement procedures are in accordance
with the Guidelines since, including public bid opening.
4.30      The proceeds of the proposed loan would finance the estimated direct
and indirect foreign cost of construction and supply contracts (see 4.31)
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding consistent with Bank
Guidelines, and consulting services. A preference of 15% or applicable
duties, whichever is the lesser, would be granted to Moroccan manufacturers
who participate. Because Moroccan industry does not manufacture the larger
equipment required for the Project (the main contracts have been awarded to
foreign contractors), the Moroccan paticipation is expected to be modest (less
than 10% of the Project cost), mainly confined to small local contracts not
appropriate or significant enough for interaational bidding. Because material
and some equipment for transmission lines and substations are manufactured in
Morocco, local industry is expected to participate in the bidding for these
items and win part if not all of the contracts.
4.31      Disbursements:  The expected disbursements from the proposed loan
would be the following, assuming that the date of effecti,eness would be
January 1, 1977:

Funds from the loan account would be disbursed against:
(i) Power Station: 100% of foreign expenditures for equipment, civil
work and associated services and 50% of local expenditures (the
total would cover 90% of total expenditures, representing the
estimated foreign exchange content).
(ii)  Transmission:  100% of foreign expenditures or of local expendi-
tures for ex-factory price of equipment procured locally for
equipment and material, and 20% of local expenditures for civil
works and erection (the total would cover 60% of total expendi-
tures, representing the estimated foreign exchange content).
(iii) Consulting Services: 100% of foreign expenditures.
4.32       Hydraulique and ONE would separately take all actions required for
withdrawing funds from the loan account. The Project would be completed by
the end of 1979 and final payments of retention monies would be made after the
12 month guarantee period. In order to allow for some delays, the closing
date would be December 31, 1981. Should the foreign exchange cost to com-
plete the Project be less than estimated, any undisbursed amount of the pro-
posed loan would be reallocated to consultant services for the next stage of
development or, if not required for the purpose, the undisbursed amount would
be cancelled at the closing date.

4.33       Operation of the Sidi Cheho Hydro Works:  Sidi Cheho's operating
regime will mainly depend on the requirements for irrigation and potable water
which, at this stage, are not yet defined because they depend to a large extent
on the actual downstream irrigation development and, to a lesser extent, on
potable water requirements in the coastal area. In the case of a jointly
operated dam, Hydraulique and ONE enter into an agreement which assigns the
normal day-to-day operation to ONE (the hydro facilities will be operated
from the power station), inspection and maintenance of the dam facilities,
and regulates all other aspects of lesser importance. Prior to commissioning
of the works a similar agreement will be signed for the Sidi Cheho facilities
and the Government will cause its agencies interested in the use of the water
from the dam to agree with Hydraulique on the rule curves for the management
of the waters (waters belong to the public domain and are administered by this
Ministry, which may transfer its power to other agencies such as the Office
Regional de Mise en Valeur Agricole des Doukkala).
4.34      Environmental and Resettlement:  A maximum of 180 km2 of land (150
km2 under normal conditions) will be flooded of which only 1 km2 is irrigated,
29 km2 is rainfed and 150 km2 is grazing land. The net value of the crop, main-
ly wheat and barley amounting to an average of 2,900 t/a, is estimated at MDH
1.4/a. The total number of persons to be displaced would be about 5,500 most
of which are subsistence level farmers (ownership is 95% collective and 5%
private). Except for some larger houses, no assets of importance are located
in the area and no archeological sites are known. Social conditions are
generally poor. Moroccan law provides that owners of land and assets will be
fully compensated. The compensations are set by an independent commission to
be appointed shortly (the detailed survey is almost completed), comprising
members selected from various ministries and local Government agencies. Dis-
cussions are already underway between Hydraulique and the Ministry of the
Interior for providing compensations in the form of a settlement elsewhere in
the country rather than exclusive cash payments. The total amount required
for compensations is expected to be about MDH 50, or about MDH 10,000 per
capita, which appears reasonable, and no difficulties in this respect, or
project delays, are expected.
4.35       Areas on the upper Oum er Rbia River are heavily infested with
bilharzia and under the Doukkala irrigation Project (Loan 1122-MOR) an as-
surance has been obtained for continued monitoring of bilharzia in the proj-
ect area by the Ministry of Public Health. Although there appears to be only
a small possibility that bilharzia would be endemic to Sidi Cheho reservoir
(its area would annually vary by a factor of 3 and storage by a factor of 4.5
compared with the minimums), monitoring is considered essential. The Ministry
of Public Health will extend its bilharzia monitoring program to include the
Sidi Cheho reservoir and would take immediate action to control the vector or
bilharzia should they be discovered in this area.

5. FINANCE 1/
(a) Background
5.01      As with many other public utilities, ONE's financial situation
and outlook is dominated by a need for capital and operating funds that is
inereasing much faster than physical output. World-wide increases in con-
struction and material cost and the demands of a major industrial expansion
program have caused large increases in the cost of the construction program.
Recently, increases in fuel consumption due to below-average hydro generation
and local inflation have pushed up operating costs. This situation has been
further aggravated by the increase in the cost of imported oil (through re-
duction of subsidies). The additional capital funds required have been pro-
vided by Government--mostly in the form of equity--so the investment program
has co.tinued, and ONE still has a very conservative capital structure.
This has enabled ONE to generate a reasonable proportion of funds from in-
ternal sources in spite of very low rates of return. Government's response
to increasing operating costs has been less effective; rate increases have
been small and late, and this has caused low returns. As a result, ONE
has not complied with agreements reached in the first loan with respect to
rates of return. ONE's future finances depend on better financial manage-
ment, more prompt and systematic tariff adjustments to meet both financial
and economic objectives, finding large additional (over and above the pro-
posed Bank loan) sources of foreign exchange financing, and continued pro-
vision of capital from Governnent. Appropriate agreements regarding these
matters have been reached with ONE and Government.
(b) Past Performance
5.02      Operating Results:  ONE's financial position, which was stable in
1973 and 1974, deteriorated sharply in 1975, although the sales growth (GWh)
increased from 6.8% in 1973 to about 8.3% in 1975. Revenues from the sale
of electricity, which had increased by 12.5% in 1973 and 13.8% in 1974
(operating expenses, however, increased in 1974 by 20.5%) would only in-
crease by 9.5% in 1975 (against 24% for operating expenses). In 1973 and
1974 the net operating income was high enough to cover interest on debt.
In 1975 ONE's operating income was not sufficient even to cover the interest
on debt.
5.03      A long delayed salary increase (about 16%) which occurred in 1974
contributed to the deterioration of the situation, although the staff re-
mained almost the same in 1974 and 1975 (about 4,370). As a result labor
1/   The section covers only the financial performance of ONE.  Hydraulique,
the second beneficiary, is a government department which is responsible
only for administration of construction of the dam, a task which it is
competent to perform. Since it has no revenue earning function, a
financial analysis would serve no purpose.

costs increased by 26% in 1974 (about 6% in 1973 and 1975). The 1975 situation
was further worsened by the cost of fuel for thermal generation which was re-
quired to compensate for reductions in hydro generation due to an extremely
dry year.
5.04      Taxes and Duties:  ONE is liable for all regular taxes and duties
such as income tax, sales tax, tax on service charges, and import duties.
Income tax ranges from 40%-50% of net income after interest on debt and the
allocation to rural electrification of 4.5% of revenue for the sales of elec-
tricity. During negotiations the Government agreed that for income tax pur-
poses ONE's contributions to the self-insurance reserve (see 5.22) would be
charged against surplus.
5.05      ONE is liable for sales tax at 6.38% of energy sales, chargeable to
consumers, which is offset in a complicated way against the tax on construc-
tion charged to ONE by its contractors. The regulation has recently been
changed in order to reduce the amount of the construction tax. About DH 15
million of construction tax paid by ONE for 1974/75 in excess of the new
regulation will be refunded.
5.06      Tax on service charges is 7.5%.  Import duties range from 10 to 45%
for the equipment and material imported by ONE. In 1974 the company paid
about DH 10 million in duties at an average rate of about 34%.
5.07      ONE's social security plan, which has been inherited from the
previous owners, includes free medical treatment, retirement provisions, and
dependency allowances. In 1974 the total cost amounted to about DH 15 mil-
lion or about 20% of gross wages and salaries. This percentage is about the
same as for the other companies in North Africa.
5.08      In 1973 and 1974, ONE transferred to capital about 7% of its over-
head expenses. This was critized by the auditor as not sufficiently explained;
however, the charge seems in line with practices accepted in European Power
Companies and no change is proposed.
5.09      Rate of Return:  Under the covenant in Loan 936-MOR ONE was sup-
posed to attain a rate of return of 3.0% in 1974 increasing progressively to
7% in 1981. This rather low target is considered acceptable because of
pricing policies in the sector which allow the Regies to self finance 100%
of their network expansion (see 1.17).
5.10      In practice, ONE reached only about a 2% rate of return in 1973 and
1974; the return is expected to be nil in 1975.
5.11      Income Statements for 1973, 1974 and 1975, along with forecasts
until 1980, are shown in table 5-2 . A summary is in para. 5.32.
5.12      Receivables.  The receivables situation deteriorated from 1971 to
1974, but has improved somewhat since then. Total receivables increased from



- 42 -
66 days of sales at the end of 1971 to 93 days at the end of 1974. Total
receivables due ONE on account of electricity sales and services provided
by ONE amounted to DH 90 million at the end of 1974. The situation as of
December 31, 1974 was:
Equivalent Days
DH Million    Average Sales
Sales to Regies                            32                 71
Sales to Government Agencies               23                195
Sales to Other Consumers                   21                 87
Service Charges (all consumers)            18
Refundable taxes                           16
Others (mainly suspense accounts)          10
116
5.13      The situation in respect of receivables due ONE from the Government
also deteriorated from 1971 to 1974, but has improved since then. The Govern-
ment did not meet its undertaking under Loan 936-MOR to ensure that all bills
payable by its agencies for sales of electricity and connection services should
be settled within 90 days.  By March, 1976, bills from Government agencies out-
standing for more than 90 days amounted to about DH 45 million, equivalent to
70 days of sales. However these amounts were concentrated in a few Government
agencies, and some of them (in excess of DH 10 million) were the subject of
dispute with ONE and may eventually be determined as not in arrears. More-
over, the average delay in payment of electricity bills, while on the high
side, has been declining. Bills outstanding for sales of power by ONE to
Government agencies amounted to 96 days of sales at the end of 1974 and de-
clined to 69 days by March 1976.
5.14      Until 1974, payment to ONE for connection charges and expansion of
facilities had been slow because most of the Regies and some smaller municipa-
lities disputed the charge, claiming that ONE's rates already cover these
expenses. The dispute arose because ONE's Cahier des charges specifies only
that "consumers" should be liable for such expansion charges. However a
procedure to deal with this matter was agreed upon by the parties concerned
in mid-1974, generally in favor of ONE, and the situation has improved; ar-
rears due by Regies on account of connection charges are now unimportant.
5.15      Before and during appraisal and negotiations, the arrears situation
was reviewed with the Government. It was agreed that the objective of an
undertaking to limit arrears was to protect ONE's financial performance rather
than monitor the payment performance of individual Government agencies. Ac-
cordingly it was agreed that the 90-day limit on the payment of arrears in-
cluded under Loan 936-MOR should be replaced by an undertaking that payments
due to ONE by Government agencies (including the Regies) on account of elec-
tricity sales and connection charges should be kept below one-sixth of such
sales during ONE's previous fiscal year. The Government has informed the Bank
that funds have been released, and are in the process of payment to ONE to
bring arrears below the sixty day level.



- 43 -
5.16      The Government has recently taken measures which should lead to
further reductions in arrears in future. The Prime Minister has recently
issued an instruction to ministries instituting a new procedure for making
budget allocations for electricity and water purchases. Under the new proce-
dure (i) a new, separate entry has been created in the budget of all minis-
tries and Government departments for purchasing electricity and water, thus
preventing reallocation to other uses and (ii) budget allocations in any year
would be based on bills paid in the preceding year.
5.17      Inventories:  Materials in stock are high; about three years of re-
quirements. This is partly due to cumbersome procurement procedures which
leads to overstocking. Although some improvements are expected, the absolute
level of inventories is likely to remain high for several years in view of
ONE's large development program. ONE has initiated computerized procedures
to monitor and take account of stocks and this is expected to reduce over-
stocking.
5.18      Valuation of Assets:  At the end of 1974 the gross fixed assets in
operation amounted to DH 2,465 million and the depreciation reserve to DH
1,118 million, or 45% of gross assets. However, ONE has not revalued its
assets since 1971, and at the end of 1975 the undervaluation was estimated
to be about 28%. According to the Government, under Moroccan law a revalua-
tion of ONE's assets would raise fiscal problems which cannot be settled
immediately. The matter is under study and will be reviewed in connection
with the Bank's supervision of the Project. For purposes of this report, a
revaluation as of 1975 has been assumed, using indexes approximating the
present value of assets ranging from 1 in 1975 to 1.5 for 1970. In view of
the cash generation form of earnings covenant which has been agreed (para
5.28) this approach is satisfactory. Depreciation rates, for which the
straight line method is used and which are based on the expected life of
assets, are satisfactory (para 5.31).
5.19      ONE's fixed assets include the cost of hydro projects built before
independence but do not include any share of the cost of multi-purpose dams
built after independence (see 4.11). Under the circumstances this is accept-
able, but if circumstances change the matter should be reconsidered.

5.22      Insurance:  For several years, since terminating coverage with
commercial insurers, ONE's assets have not been insured against risks such
as fire, explosion, and natural calamities since ONE considers itself to be
self-insured. In respect of this, ONE will in each year take a deduction
against surplus to be allocated to an insurance reserve. The Bank has in-
formed ONE that, in accordance with sound practice such deduction should be
not less than the premium which would otherwise be paid to reputable insurers
for covering such risks.
5.23      Financial Management Problems:  Under Loan 936-MOR, ONE was to ap-
point a senior financial officer to supervise both the budgeting and the ac-
counting departments. Although there was considerable delay because ONE was
unable to locate a competent candidate who was willing to serve at the
salaries which ONE could offer under the civil service regulations, ONE has
now appointed the chief of the accounting department to head the single
financial department which will be created following completion of a study
of the reorganization of its financial departments and accounting procedures,
particularly budgeting and budget control. ONE has agreed to exchange views
with the Bank on the results of the study, and to implement the final propo-
sals by June 30, 1977.
5.24      Accounting:  ONE's accounting systems and procedures, which were
revised in 1971, are generally satisfactory. A French-style cost accounting
system which was to have been implemented in 1973 has been abandoned. This
appears a wise decision because, for some time to come, such a sophisticated
system would be beyond the skill of the average accounting staff and unneces-
sarily time consuming. ONE has no facilities for training its accounting
staff, except "on-the-job". It is expected that the reorganizational study
will address this problem with the objective of instituting suitable account-
ing and administrative training compatible with the technical training of
other staff.
5.25      Budgeting:  Budgeting procedures are elementary and because of
the lack of coordination between the budgeting division and the accounting
department, it is difficult to reconcile estimates and results. No improve-
ment can be expected, however, before a reorganization of the financial
department has been achieved.
5.26      Audit:  There are no requirements for Government audit of ONE's
accounts but some control is exercised by the Minister of Finance through
two employees of the Ministry (a "Controleur Financier" based in Rabat,
and an "Agent Comptable" working in ONE's offices in Casablanca) who are
responsible for the authorization of all of ONE's transactions. This type
of pre facto control unnecessarily restricts the speed of ONE's growing
operations and in practice materially reduces its autonomy. Under the
first power project ONE agreed to have its accounts and financial state-
ments audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and this
undertaking would be extended to the proposed loan.

(c) Future Performance
5.27      ONE's future financial situation will be dominated by its need for
capital to meet the requirements of its expansion program while maintaining
a sound financial position. The various undertakings agreed in connection
with the proposed loan are intended to assure this.
5.28      Rate of Return:  During negotiations Government and ONE requested
that the rate of return form of earnings covenant agreed under Loan 936-MOR
be replaced with a cash generation or program coverage form of covenant,
since such a covenant would be more in keeping with Moroccan financing objec-
tives and ONE's need for expansion capital in particular.  This is acceptable.
ONE therefore has agreed to take all necessary measures to produce in each
fiscal year starting with 1977 a program coverage of at least 18%, rising to
20% in 1980 and thereafter. In order to compensate partially for year-to-year
variations in operating expenses arising from changes in the availability of
hydro energy, and to measure the performance against the average of several
years' capital needs, the program coverage ratio would be calculated using the
average of the internal sources for the preceding year and the year in ques-
tion, and the average of the capital expenditure in those two years and the
next following year.
5.29      In order to monitor performance under this covenant, before October
31 of each year ONE will prepare a review, satisfactory to the Government, of
the adequacy of its tariffs for the next year and will furnish the Bank with
a copy of the review. For 1977 ONE will carry out the measures to be taken,
before January 1, 1977. Because the Governnent intends to gradually remove,
in about 2-3 years time, the remaining subsidies on petroleum products, its
concern with inflationary tendencies appears warranted and the Bank has
agreed that the rate increase required for 1977 would not exceed 10%, over
and above any requirements to cover increases in fuel prices above the January
1, 1976 level (such increases would be passed on automatically to the consumers
- para 5.33).  Because of the operation of the averaging feature, this limita-
tion would have no significant effect on ONE's financial performance over the
1976-80 period. Furthermore, the Government has agreed to formulate by June
30, 1977, recommendations, on the basis of proposals by ONE, for the adoption
of an appropriate tariff structure. It wil exchange views with the Bank of
the progress being made and on the proposals being developed.
5.30      In order to meet the program coverage ratio requirement agreed
upon during negotiations it has been assumed that rates would increase
by an average of 10% in 1977, 8% in 1978, 12% in 1979 and 15% in 1980.
5.31      The 1976 and following years' depreciation charges have been
calculated on a revalued basis.  Depreciation rates, for which the szra ght
line method is used, are based on the expected life of assets and are r -
sonable. This life is 50 years for civil works, buildings, dams and res,r-
voirs, 30 and 35 years for mechanical and electrical equipment, 25 years
for transformers, and 20 and 30 years for transmission and distribution lines.

5.32       Income Statements:  As shown in Table 5-2 sales would increase
from 2,372 GWh in 1974 to 4,430 GWh in 1980, i.e. at an average rate of
about 11%. The average sales price of DH 0.125/kWh in 1974 would rise to
DH 0.235/kWh by 1980 (average increase 11%/a). Revenues and expenses and
several performance indicators are summarized as follows:

Interest Coverage by Net
Revenues (excluding interest  1.9   0.3   0.6   3.9   4.2   4.6    7.0

Total operating revenues would grow at about 22%/a, compared with 16% for ex-
penses, including depreciation. Particularly striking is the increase in
fuel costs, which would level off only with the coming into operation of new
hydro plants, including Sidi Cheho. Depreciation would reach DH 216 million
in 1980 (compared with DH 89 million expected for 1975), i.e. about 37% of
ONE's net operating income before depreciation, reflecting ONE's large in-
vestment program.
5.33      Fuel prices are assumed to remain at the present level because ONE
would pass any increases directly to consumers through the implementation of
appropriate automatic tariff adjustments. ONE's personnel cost has been
assumed to increase by an average of 9% a year from 1974 to 1980 based on
the early 1976 salary increase of 6%, and assuming further increases in 1978,
(9%) in 1979 and 1980 (5% each year). These general salary increases would
combine with an average increase of 2% a year in number of employees, and an
average merit increase of 0.25%.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
(a)  Tariffs and Rates
6.01      General:  In common with other energy prices, electricity tariffs
and rates are subject to Government control. The country's tariff structure
is essentially the same as it was in 1958, when it was created. Although
tariffs and rates discriminate with respect to the voltage level of supply,
geographical location and type of consumers and the time of the day they
suffer from the following defects:
(a)  they still partly reflect the 1958 cost of supply and
bear little relation to present cost;
(b)  they retain special privileges for certain consumers
existing before ONE was created, and for certain communi-
ties that opted for integration in ONE's system and could
bargain hard;
(c)  the price declines in steps as consumption rises, which acts
as an incentive for higher consumption rather than reduction
(which should be encouraged in view of the subsidization of
fuel cost and the dependency on external fuel sources).
6.02      Rates remained unchanged until 1973 and the average level of revenue
per kWh remained substantially the same at 10.5-11 ctm/kWh (US$é 2.68-2.75),
although the average price for certain classes of consumers actually declined
because of the degressive principle underlying the tariff structure. Because
the rates became increasingly out of line with ONE's costs, the rate of return
on net fixed assets (which have not been revalued since 1970) steadily declined.
6.03      Rates have been raised by 5% both on May 1, 1973, and on May 1, 1974,
when coal prices were also increased (35%). On January 1, 1976 ONE's rates
were increased by 18%, the price of coal by 15%, fuel oil by 39.1%, and gasoil
by 23%.
6.04      The targets for rate of return under Loan 986-MOR (see 5.09) have not
been met because the Governnent was reluctant to allow electricity prices to
rise sufficiently on the grounds that this would be inflationary. This appears
dubious because the cost of electricity represents only a small fraction of
costs of most industries (see 1.21).
6.05      Up to 1974, the Regies have been able to internally finance (includ-
ing consumers contributions) completely their expansion program and Government
assistance was not required (see 1.18). A corollary to this is that ONE's
rates for bulk sales to the Regies is in fact subsidized and that ONE requires
Government contributions in excess of those required if rates applied to the
Regies would properly reflect costs. Although this policy is not entirely



- 56 -
satisfactory (the distinction between the actual Government required financing
for both ONE and the Regies is lost) it has no effect on the overall rate of
return for the sector as a whole which should be considerably in excess of
ONE's expected rate of return in view of the high level of internal overall
financing, which may be in the order of 35-40%.
6.06      Marginal Cost of Supply:  Under.the first power loan, EdF completed
in 1973 a study of tariffs and the impact of the cost of electricity on the
economy. In early 1975 ONE, in view of rapidly rising prices, recalculated
the marginal cost of supply, reaching only slightly higher results, i.e.,
11.1 ctm/kWh calculated in 1972 by EdF for high voltage supply and 12.3
ctm/kWh at the retail level. The calculation, however, was unrealistic be-
cause it assumed inflation of 5% annually only. On the basis of the findings
during appraisal it appears reasonable to assume that ONE's average marginal
costs (no distinction can be made, due to lack of information, between high
voltage and middle voltage level) appear to range as follows:
23-25 ctm/kWh for high voltage consumers
57-60 ctm/kWh for low tension consumers
25-27 ctm/kWh average
6.07      Financial forecasts indicate that by the end of the decade average
revenue per kWh would be some 20-21 ctm/kWh, somewhat below the marginal cost
of supply, which is caused by the implied subsidization of the Regies through
ONE's tariffs (see 6.05). It is, however, also obvious that:
(a) ONE's operations in distribution are expensive and constitute
a financial burden because it is practically all rural, i.e.
with low population and connection density and relatively poor
consumers, and
'b)  cross subsidization for distribution to be reflected in the
ultimate tariffs would be acceptable in order to maintain
viable low tension rates (presently they are already about
DH 0.36 (US$t 9,'kW), rising to DH 0.57/kWh (US$e 14/kWh) with
the flat increases as assumed for 1977 and 1979), otherwise
the only customers that would pay the marginal cost of supply
would be the low tension consumers, which is unrealistic.
(b) Justification of Project
E.08      Optimum Development:  An optimum development program is defined
as the particular program - out of a number of alternative similar programs,
reasonably selected for attaining the same objectives - that shows. -sing the
discounted cash flow method of comparison, the highest net benefits to the
economy, i.e. the 'ighest present value of benefits (or cost avoided i appro-
priate cases) less costs, at a discount rate equal to the opportunity cost of
capital, while paying due regard to economic and social considerations and
possible uncertainties in the assumptions for the ultimate decisions.



- 57 -
6.09      River Basin Study:  It is obvious that a multipurpose scheme
such as the overall development of the use of water in the Oum er Rbia river
basin is highly complicated and that even a computerized approach constitutes
an approximation. An overall study for the basin was prepared in 1973-75 by
SCET International of France for the Ministry of Agriculture. The study
seeks to optimize the size, location and timing of regulating structures
taking into account the forecast requirements for potable and industrial
water, irrigation and power. There are two sites for such structures on the
river, at Sidi Cheho and at Dechra el Oued for each of which the dam crest
could be varied. A third dam appears to be feasible at Imizdilfane (upstream
from Dechra el Oued) for power purposes only.
6.10      It appeared at the time of a joint FAO/World Bank visit (July 1974)
that a larger dam should be constructed at Dechra el Oued and a smaller dam at
Sidi Cheho because irrigation developments in the areas to be fed by the Dechra
el Oued dam would be more economic than at Sidi Cheho (Doukkala). The prepon-
derant issue, however, was the allocation of waters as defined in the Master
Plan. This allocation was repeatedly amended (and probably will be changed in
the future) because of shifting requirements (e.g. favorable market development
for phosphate cause acceleration of development plans for new plants and in-
creased water requirements for this purpose) and regional pressures for a more
favorable share of the water. To terminate the indecision and avoid conse-
quential delays, the Government decided (June 1974) to construct the Sidi
Cheho dam as soon as possible at maximum crest elevation. SCET subsequently
optimized the Dechra el Oued dam given the Sidi Cheho elevation and the then
available information on water allocation. However, once more allocations
were amended and the authorities decided to construct also Dechra el Oued at
maximum crest elevation (+ 6 m; the original optimizing curve was rather flat
and the increase appeared justified for power purposes). SCET's final cal-
culations then optimized the areas to be irrigated given the dam crest
elevation.
6.11      It should be noted that the SCET approach could not take completely
into account ONE's development in generation with and without the Sidi Cheho
and Dechra el Oued power stations because this information became available
only at the time of appraisal. Only the cost of fuel substituted by the hydro
facilities could be taken into account, not the capital cost of thermal plant
that would be replaced by hydro plant.
6.12      Basic Approach for Economic Study:
(A) In view of the difficulties of formulating the optimum development
plan for a basin so complex as the Oum er Rbia, analysis was focussed on the
Sidi Cheho facilities alone. This analysis is in three parts, and a clear
distinction between the three is essential to understand the following discus-
sion. The methodology is first to determine for each subproject (power, water,
irrigation), or combination of subprojects, the economically best alternative
development without the Sidi Cheho dam. These alternative subprojects are
then compared with the single multipurpose project. The multipurpose project
is considered to be superior to the alternatives if the equalizing discount



- 58 -
rate is more than the assumed opportunity cost of capital (10%). In the
second analysis, the rate of return for the multipurpose scheme is calculated
by valuing the various benefits in accordance with conventional procedures
(i.e. sales prices for power and water, and irrigation through economic input
end cutrut prices) and determining the discount rate which equalizes the
multipurpose scheme's costs and benefits. Appropriate present worth techniques
and econumic valuations (to the extent data are available) are used at all
stages.  Vinally, the rate of return on investment for each of the sub-projects
l§ d'.scussed in relation with the allocation of the dam cost.
(B)  The steps in the analysis are therefore the following:
(i) Select independent or combined alternative sub-projects which
could fulfill the same functions as the proposed multi-purpose
proiect. For irrigation and water supply this is deternained
to be a sma'ller dual purpose dam at Sidi Cheho; for power, it
is an alternative development program which excludes the Sidi
Cheho pro-ect. Evaluate the alternative development program
for power, first ranking other possible hydro developments
then combining these into alternative programs with various
comibinations of gas turbine and sceam plant, then compare
these alternatives with the multi-purpose project at the
assumed opportunity cost of capital.
(ii)  Calculate an economic rate of return for the multi-purpose
project using project costs (including the cost of the
irrigation development), and value o£ growth in agricultural
output and sales revenue for water and power as benefits.
(iîi) calculate the rate of return on the irrigation and water
projects, and on the incremental investment for power.
(C) Future upstream and downstream developments will affect the long-
term benefits of the multi-purpose project. In accordance with ONE's simula-
UiC>fn atudies (ecvLrring 1980-1995), the gross average Sidi Cheho generation
wouli decline fronm 3L0 GWhia initially to 240 GWh/a by 1995 due to the upstream
diversions. Eeyond 995 ger:eration of existing hydro plants (including Sidi
Chehc) would further reduce due te diversion of waters to new irrigation
drisvelcpnceIlts, depending en the speed of realizing these developments.  'he
comfarison of altertlatives assum-es that any reduction in Sidi Cheho and down-
s      See geretotian due to diversions for these future irrigation projects
would be cnarged to thcse future projects, i.e. that benefits obtained with
such future projects would exceed the loss in generation benefits.  Accordingly
the rate of return computations for the Project take into account on'ly the re-
duction irn generation of plants downstream of Sidi Cheho due to diversion of
waters reqtired for Doukkala.

Power
6.13      Ranking of Hydro Plants:  ONE investigated which hydro station
should be the first one to be completed from a power point of view, by insert-
ing alternative hydro stations (excluding the cost of the dam) in a basic all
thermal development scheme meeting the requirements for electricity until 1995
at growth rates of 10% and 12%. The following alternatives were studied taking
irnto account the hydro stations in a sufficiently advanced stage of planning to
consider them competitive with Sidi Cheho:
Alternative 1:  All thermal (with or without gas turbine as the first
plant to be completed, the "with" gas turbines showing
least cost).
Alternative 2:  Thermal, but including Sidi Cheho (120 MW, 310 GWh/a)
on the Oum er Rbia river.
Alternative 3:  Thermal, but including Dechra el Oued (75 MW, 215 GWh/a)
on the Oum er Rbia river.
Alternative 4:  Thermal, but including M'Dez (50 MW, 36 GWh) and Matmata
(37 MW, 230 GWh/a) on the Sebou river.
6.14      ONE's conclusions, which were based on mid-1974 assumptions for
costs, rank the project as follows in economic merit order: (1) Sidi Cheho,
(2) Dechra el Oued, (3) M'Dez/Matmata, and (4) all thermal development. Be-
cause during appraisal the 1975 costs of the Sidi Cheho facilities were found
to be considerably above the 1974 assumptions, (45% for the dam and 11% for
the power station), the comparison has been repeated, confirming that Sidi
Cheho would rank first up to a discount rate of 26%, Dechra el Oued second
up to 23% and M'Dez Matmata third up to 15%. This conclusion with respect
to ranking is insensitive to variations (say ± 20%) in the main parameters
(capital cost and economic cost of fuel), i.e. Sidi Cheho and Dechra el
Oued rank about equal.
6.15      Comparison of Generation Development Schemes:  Although the above
comparison provides ranking of hydro stations, a further comparison is re-
quired of a development scheme with and without Sidi Cheho but including
Dechra el Oued and M'Dez/Matmata. For this reason the following three
alternatives (all exclude costs of dam/tunnel) were considered:
Alternative A:  Development comprising Sidi Cheho (1980)
Dechra el Oued (1982) and M'Dez/Matmata (1984)
and steam-electric plant.
Alternative B1: Development without Sidi Cheho but including
Dechra el Oued (1982) and M'Dez/Matmata (1984)
and steam-electric plant.
Alternative B2: Similar to Alternative BI, except that the first
plant to be installed would be gas turbine plant.



- 60 -
Steam-electric planting-up would be in units of 125 MW (6 at the planned
Mohammedia power station) followed by 250 MW (8 in two stations, one at
Timahdite, one still unidentified) followed by 500 MW (1995, by which time
all development programs would be equal). Satisfaction of requirements has
to meet 3 criteria, investigated by ONE in simulation studies, (a) energy
requirements in a 1 in 20 dry year have to be met, (b) day-time maximum demand
should be met taking into account a 1 in 20 dry year and assuming that 10% of
installed capacity is required as reserve during those hours, and (c) peak-time
demand should be met similarly to (b) above but reserve capacity should be
taken into account equal ta the sum of the largest and next largest unit. The
economic cost of fuel was calculated on the basis of the 1974 spread of cost
of supplies from various countries, taking into account end 1975 f.o.b. and
freight prices for crude and a refinery treatment factor of 1/0.9 allowing for
#2 fuel to be supplied by Moroccan refineries. This resulted in DH 413/t
(US$94/t or US$11.55/bbl), but DH 400/t was used in the computations, sen-
sitivity considerations allowing for changes in economic cost of fuel.
6.16      A comparison of Alternatives Bi and B2, as indicated above (see
6.15), shows that Alternative B2 has the least present value for discount
rates of 4% and up which is insensitive to change in the main parameters.
Consequently, Alternative A and Alternative B2 (representing "with" and
"without" Sidi Cheho) were used for the power component in multipurpose
comparison cf schemes, where also the cost of the dam is to be included.
Waater
6.17      Comparison of Industrial and Potable Water Developments:  Although
the plan for providing additional potable and industrial water to the coastal
zone has not yet been completed, the comparison of alternative development
plans would be made similarly to power: the various alternatives should all
meet future requirements for water, and the demand curve as a function of time
(and therefore the benefits) is equal for all alternative. On the cost side
the alternatives are restricted to: (a) water supply from the Oum er Rbia
river, (b) from other rivers, and (c) desalting by thermal plant (about
250 Mm3 additional water would be required by the year 2000). For assured
river supply, a reservoir with a live volume of about 1,100 Mm3 would be
required and the relevant dam (or dams) should be completed by about 1983.
Only alternative (a) would be viable, because:
(i) The Oum er Rbia is the nearest river with adequate additional
sources of water and because the site conditions on the Oum er
Rbia are favorable, any structure in any other river would be
more expensive if the cost for the extra pipeline length is
also taken into account.
(ii)  In the late eighties incremental water requirements are expL ted
to exceed 10 Mm3 or 106 Igl/d increasing by at least 7%/a. To
achieve this by desalting would be very expensive, the more so
because the major portion of water would be required for in-
dustrial purposes (i.e. "raw" river water would be adequate).
About MDH 40 (MUS$10) would have to be invested in the first



- 61 -
year and proportionally higher sums in subsequent years. Conse-
quently, the dam (costing some MDH 220) would pay for itself in
about 4 years. The actual period would, of course, be somewhat
longer, because in case of a dam being constructed, filter plants
would be required for the portion of the water to be used for
potable water.
6.18      In 1974 the dam required for water supply alone, was estimated to
cost MDH 150 and it appears reasonable to assume that the 1975 cost would be
in the order of MDH 220 (45% over 1974 cost, similar to Sidi Cheho). In
accordance with the forecast requirements for the phosphate industry, the dam
should be completed by 1983. The possibility that development in phosphate
industry would be less rapid has also be studied; a delay of up to 5 years
(1988) was assumed.
Irrigation
6.19      Irrigation Developments.  The only feasible development in the area
would be the second phase of Doukkala (about 17,000 ha). Without taking into
account the cost of a dam for this development, or the power required for
pumping for irrigation or its effect on downstream generation, the net benefit
of this project at the opportunity cost of capital (10%) would be MDH 31, i.e.
this would be the maximum amount (expressed in present value) that could be
spent on a dam to provide about 150 Mm3 of water required for this project.
A storage volume of some 350 Mm3 would probably be required to provide a
reasonable security of supply, equivalent to a total reservoir volume at Sidi
Cheho of about 1000 Mm3. The crest elevation would be 265 m, 20 m below the
present proposed dam. The dam cost would be some 40-45% of the estimated cost
(MDH 330 at 1975 prices) of the Sidi Cheho dam, i.e. some MDH 150. Even
allowing for a considerable error in this assumption, it is obvious that the
Doukkala Phase 2 development would not be viable as an independent project
comparing its benefits (MDH 31 at 10%) with the cost of the required dam (at
least MDH 100 at 10%). The project may only be viable if combined with the
dam required for water or if included in the multi-purpose project.
6.20      In order to obtain the necessary storage for irrigation, the height
of the dam required for water would have to be increased by 2.5 m at an
estimated incremental cost of about MDH 20.
6.21      It follows from the above that the only reasonably feasible alterna-
tives to be compared are: (i) the Dcukkala Phase 2 irrigation development
using a dam jointly with the water users, combined with the least-cost power
development "without" Sidi Cheho; this alternative is called the "without Sidi
Cheho scheme" and, (ii) the multipurpose scheme combining irrigation, water
and power; this alternative is called the "with Sidi Cheho scheme." It should
be noted that in comparing the various schemes, the Doukkala Phase 2 irriga-
tion development forms part of any of the alternatives and does not change.
Consequently, when netting cost and benefit streams (subtracting net cash
streams of one alternative from the net cash stream of any other alternative)
all of Doukkala's costs and benefits become zero in the resulting net cash
stream, except the incremental cost of the required increase in the height of



- 62 -
the alternative dam for water alone. The alternative of not executing Doukkala
Phase 2 has not been taken into account because (a) although cost would be
avoided, benefits would also be foregone including unquantifiable large social
benefits, and (b) the Project is justified without even taking into account
the Doukkala irrigation development.
6.22      Comparison of the Multipurpose Scheme "with" and "without" Sidi Cheho:
The net present values (cost avoided less cost) of the main components of
the scheme, at various discount rates between 6% and 14% are shown in Table
6-1 together with the sensitivity to variations in the main costs and benefits.
Summarized the result is:
---------Discount Rate (%------------
10    il    12       13      14     15
-------Net Present Value (MDH)--------
Cost "Without"
Sidi Cheho less "with" Sidi Cheho          63    34    10      -10    -27    -41
Required variation (%) to make equal-
izing discount rate 9, 10 or 12%
Cost of dams                               +28    + 8    - 8    -22
Cost of Power Stations                     +40    +12    -13    -35
Fuel Savings                        -26   -40    - 5    + 6    +15    +26
Costs and Fuel Savings
Simultaneously:  (Costs           +17   + 8    + 2    - 3    - 7    -11
(Fuel Savings  -17   - 8    - 2    + 3    + 7    +11
6.23      The equalizing discount rate up to which the execution of the Sidi
Cheho multipurpose scheme would be more economic than not executing the scheme
would be 12.5%.  The sensitivity to the variation in the various costs and
;enefits is modest. Practically all main (individual) parameters would have
tc vary excessively to reduce the equalizing discount rate to the opportunity
cost of capital (10%). The highest sensitivity is shown for a simultaneous
increase in costs and an equal (percentage) reduction in cost avoided (fuel
savings,. To reduce, however, the equaliz_ng discount rate to 10%, all costs
would have to increase by 17% simultaneously with a decrease in fuel cost
savings of 17%. This aDpears unlikely. In the event that additional water
from the Oum er Rbia river for industrial/potable purposes would not be
required before 1988, the equalizing discount rate would reduce to 10.4%.
6.24      Economic Rate of Return.  The economic rate of return (IER) on the
project (either the Sidi Cheho scheme as a whole or its parts) is the discount
rate which equalizes the present values of the time streams of the attributa-
ble costs and benefits over the assumed economic life of 45 years. Th costs
are the capital costs including physical contingencies, but excluding taxes
and price contingeacies plus the operating cost of the additional facilicies.



- 63 -
The benefits consist of (a) the agricultural benefits (growth in agricultural
output which would increase farmers' incomes and employment opportunities),
(b) incremental sales revenue for water for industrial and potable water, (c)
incremental sales revenue for power, (d) proceeds of Government taxes on each
bill.
6.25      It would be desirable to use retail revenues adjusted for distribu-
tion costs as the measure of benefits for water and power but this has not
been possible because information on the power distribution network invest-
ments and costs for the Regies is not available, and an ONEP/OCP study of
future investment requirements for water distribution is not yet complete;
therefore, wholesale prices have been used as a measure of benefits, using
ONE's present bulk tariffs and an estimated raw water price of DH 0.38/m3 for
ONEP. In accordance with the Master Plan it has been assumed that additional
raw water would be required in the coastal area by 1983, increasing to
272Mm3/a by the year 2000.  Subsequently, water requirements would increase
at an annual rate of 8% until the maximum available of 450Mm3/a is reached
(2007). Pumping stations would be required on both banks of the river to
lift the water as well as pipe lines transporting the water by gravity to
the phosphate mines and to Casablanca. The cost of these facilities (MUS$75),
to be completed partly in 1983 and around the year 2000, have been taken
into account. Benefits of the Doukkala Phase 2 (about 17,000 ha) agricultural
development are as studied in relation to the Appraisal for the first Doukkala
Irrigation Project (Loan 1201-MOR).
6.26      For calculation of the minimum IER on the total project, the de-
crease in Sidi Cheho's generation due to future upstream irrigation devel-
opments has not been taken into account since the value of such diversions
would be at least equal to that of the power foregone. The net present values
of costs and benefits and net benefits are shown in Table 6-2 together with
the sensitivity of the IER to a change in the main parameters.  On this basis,
the IER of the Project would be 9.6%. Assuming that the prices paid by the
water and power consumers represent a minimum value of the benefits, this rate
of return would represent a lower limit. The IER is relatively insensitive to
changes in costs and benefits of the individual subprojects, all cost would
have to increase by 25% or the benefits to decrease by 20% in order to decrease
the IER to 8%. On the other hand, all costs would have to decrease by 16%, or
benefits to increase by 19% in order to increase the IER to 11%. A delay of 5
years in water requirements from the river would decrease the IER to 8.9%.
While these rates of return are of little significance as a measure of the
economic worth of the multipurpose project as a whole (unquantifiable benefits
in irrigation are estimated to be substantial, and tariffs for water and power
represent a minimum value of benefits), they indicate that both for water and
power present prices charged to the consumers do not reflect the true cost of
these services. Because present rates for water and power are estimated to be
at least 20% below cost, the IER would be 10.8% if proper rates had been set.
In view of the uncertainties, the probable minimum range for the IER appears
to be from 9% to 11%.

6.27      Return on Project Components.  The rate of return of the sub-
projects have been determined by allocating to the water supply function the
cost of the basic dam required for water (which would also provide sufficient
water for irrigation, para. 6.20), and to power the incremental cost of
raising this dam to its final elevation. In order to reasonably estimate the
rate of return of the subprojects, estimated cost increases up to 1980 have
been taken into account. By that time power rates are expected to have beer.
increased by a total of 50% (see 2.25) and it appears reasonable to assume a
similar increase for raw water supply; since water supply would not be re-
quired before 1983 this may somewhat understate revenues for water, but no
reasonable estimate can be made for the period beyond 1980. On this bases
the shares of the cost of the dam and the IER of the sub-projects (assuming
for irrigation that cost and benefits would increase commensurately) would
be:
Share of Dam Cost   Rate of Return
(%)                 (%)
Water                      67                  10.1
Power                      33                  11.9
Irrigation                  0                  11.0
Overall                   100                  10.4
The overall rate of return calculated on the basis of 1980 prices differs only
slightly from the rate of return of 9.6% calculated above (see 6.27) using
constant 1976 prices.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Sector
7.01      The Governnent will take the necessary steps to formulate, by
June 30, 1977, recommendations for the electricty sector organization and,
on the basis of proposals by ONE, the adoption of an appropriate tariff
structure. It will exchange views with Bank of the progress being made
and on the proposals being developed (1.18; 5.33).
Project
7.02      As discussed during negotiations ONE will include in its first
Project Progress Report for each year a set of statistical data which will
be reviewed regularly with ONE in order to define appropriate monitoring
targets and evaluation methods (2.27).
7.03      The dam and its hydro facilities will be regularly inspected by
Hydraulique in accordance with sound engineering practices (4.27).
7.04      Prior to commissioning of the Sidi Cheho facilities, the Govern-
ment will cause (i) ONE and Hydraulique to enter into an agreement defining
their respective role in the inspection, maintenance, and operation, and
(ii) its agencies interested in the use of the waters to agree with
Hydraulique on rule curves for the management of such waters (4.33).
7.05      The Government will ensure through its Ministry for Public Health
that the Sidi Cheho reservoir and its connecting waters will be monitored
for bilharzia and its vector and that immediate measures will be taken to
prevent any increase in the incidence of the disease in the area (4.35).
7.06      The Governnent will ensure that the average amount of bills due
to ONE for the purchase of electricity and related services by its agencies
and subdivisions, does not exceed at any time one-sixth of the total of
such sales during the previous fiscal year of ONE (5.18).
Management/Finance
7.07      ONE will improve its accounting procedures and reorganize its
financial services and exchange views with the Bank on the measures to be
taken before implementing them by June 30, 1977 (5.27).
7.08      ONE will take all measures required to produce, beginning in 1977,
an average level of funds from internal sources in the year in question and
the preceding year equal to at least 18% of the average capital expenditures
during such two years and the next following year, rising to 20% in 1980 and
subsequent years. The increase in rates in 1977 is limited to 10%, to which
will be added any requirements to cover increase in fuel prices above January
1, 1976 level. Before October 31 of each of its fiscal years ONE will pre-
pare a review, satisfactory to the Government, of the adequacy of its



- 68 -
tariffs to meet the above requirements for the next year and will furnish
the Bank with a copy of the completed review. For 1977 the measures to be
taken by ONE will be carried out before January 1, 1977 (5.32; 5.33).
Condition of Effectiveness
7.09      A subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank should have
been entered into (2.01).
Recommendation
7.10      Subject to the conditions outlined above, the project is suitable
for a Bank loan with a term of 20 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace.
