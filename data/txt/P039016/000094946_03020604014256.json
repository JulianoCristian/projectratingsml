One key\n            aspect of capacity building should be training in\n            management. Competence in management has been an important\n            lesson learned from implementation of National Pension\n            Scheme Authority reforms. A very firm vision of a private\n            sector driven economy is necessary to overcome the\n            hesitation that accompanies the decision to pursue\n            privatization. Equally important is to build support from\n            the public and consensus in the Cabinet on key decisions to\n            be taken."}, "docdt": "2002-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
