resources and 3) help\n            improve aquatic product quality. There are four components.\n            The first forms and implements programs in four provinces.\n            It establishes institutional arrangements to promote coastal\n            zone management (CZM); assesses resource use; provides\n            hardware and software for data management and analysis as\n            well as equipment and training for environmental data\n            collection and analysis; establishes fishery and\n            environmental management centers; provides surveillance\n            vessels and equipment; and establishes a coastal forest\n            protection belt. The second component supports\n            environmentally sustainable marine aquaculture in shallow\n            waters and tidal flats. It finances equipment, facilities,\n            and services to farmers in aquaculture. It raises fin fish\n            in net cages; breeds oysters, scallops, kelp, algae, clams,\n            and laver (a red algae); and uses artificial breeding\n            techniques. The third component supports trials of new\n            methods of shrimp culture. The fourth finances a number of\n            seafood handling operations, including processing and\n            wholesale markets, to improve product quality and safety.\n            Selected cold storage, packaging facilities, and wholesale\n            markets will be expanded and improved, and processing\n            facilities will be built and expanded. Training will occur\n            in hazard analysis."}, "docdt": "1998-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
