were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: fast responses are needed to\n            China's fast-changing market conditions at project\n            preparation, start-up, and restructuring. Devolution of\n            decision-making and ensuring procurement can be done as\n            simply as possible are essential, while maintaining\n            accountability. In parallel with this, the focus of\n            monitoring should be on fewer and more outcome-oriented\n            supervision/review missions, at least through the later part\n            of a project. Detailed technical supervision is highly\n            appreciated as part of the package of working with the Bank,\n            and provides an important, marketable 'quality\n            stamp' to activities. However, technical support should\n            also be increasingly entrusted in the course of the project\n            to sharing among regions and the increasing high-level\n            technical expertise within the country. Strengthening\n            sustainable development in coastal areas is a continuing\n            issue for China, with pressures on the resources likely to\n            increase further. There is still room for major funding of\n            public goods but this may need greater grant or soft loan\n            finance, also considering the learning, pioneering,\n            innovation, and adaptive management aspects of such work."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
