Negative environmental impacts\n            and their mitigations include the following:\n            Counter-measures for controlling the pollution of fisheries\n            include dividing and developing fishery areas according to\n            function; choosing suitable cultural organisms which are\n            strongly adaptable; strengthening scientific research in\n            this area; and enhancing the laws for environmental\n            management in this field. Other mitigating measures include\n            removing organic waste through pumping or pouring lime white\n            to make a surface cover or bottom protective layer to reduce\n            sediment pollution. Selecting particular species of marine\n            life that can absorb and decompose fecal matter will help\n            maintain water purity and foster aquaculture growth.\n            Disinfectants will be used to reduce pathogenic\n            microorganisms but these also kill other non-targeted\n            organisms and reduce the stability of the ecological system\n            and are harmful to humans. Inorganic nutrients in discharged\n            wastewater can be reduced by rearing shellfish. Also\n            aerators can be used and the wastewater drained from prawn\n            ponds.
