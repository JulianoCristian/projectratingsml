                The meaning of the indicator is not clear (i.e., it is not clear what "linked to" means in
Comments        practice). Qualitative anecdotal observations from project staff indicate that, at least in
                the initial project areas, strengthened environmental monitoring has been used to advise
                aquaculture farmers.
 Indicator 1.2 Coastal Zone Management: protected areas development plans completed

Comments        The values are assumed from physical targets and achievements. Protected areas have
                been established in Xiamen (for white dolphin and lancelets) and the Xiangshan islands.

                No project-specific data was reported, though observations by fishery enforcement units
Comments        in charge of new large project-procured patrolling vessels indicated that new enforcement
                activities are now possible as a result of the greater range and speed of vessels.
 Indicator 2.1 Marine Aquaculture: increase in percentage of seedlings/fingerlings from hatcheries

                No systematic percent use data specific to the project-supported hatcheries was provided.
                The total final number of hatcheries supported (13) was half that expected in the PAD

Comments        (27). The Borrower's Completion Report notes that 1.05 billion fry and fingerlings were
                produced. Project staff observations nevertheless indicate a considerable use of project
                hatchery seedlings and fry (they were generally profitable - see Annex 3), and a greater
                use in hatchery-based fry.

                Data from Borrower's ICR: based on 39,970 farmers. Aquaculture income went from
Comments        2,044 to 4,679, the share of aquaculture increasing from 44 to 63 percent, thus
                contributing considerably to income increase.

Indicator 2.3 Marine Aquaculture: results of research into carrying capacity reflected in the
              number of fish cages per site

Date                          -                Not given                     -                -
               Zoning of coastal areas under the project, as well as under a new national (2002) law,
Comments       used the "underlying carrying-capacity principle". However, it is not clear how project-
               supported research explicitly has resulted in regulations and enforcement of cage density.
Indicator 2.4 Marine Aquaculture: the proportion of project sites in poly-culture

Value           No quantified baseline         No target             No change      No explicit
                                                                                    assessment
Date                          -                Not given                     -                -
               The assumption of the indicator is that the "proportion"' would increase. Anecdotal
Comments       information indicates that poly-culture has become more popular in project areas, partly
               as a result of project training and linked advisory activities.
Indicator 2.5 Marine Aquaculture: an increase in the output of farmed fish
                No quantified baseline         No target             No change      279,197 tons of

                                                                                    from the project.
Date                          -                Not given                     -                -
               The original number of cages planned stayed more or less the same, even though the
Comments       aquaculture component as a whole was scaled back. There has also been a general
               increase in marine aquaculture in most of the project areas.
Indicator 3.1 Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation: results of shrimp available outside the project areas

Value           No quantified baseline         No target             No change      No explicit

Date                          -                Not given                     -                -

Comments       This was an output, dependent on positive trials. Trials were negative and the component
               was effectively discontinued.
Indicator 4.1 Products Quality and Safety: the number of pilot facilities conforming to HACCP

           SUSTAINABLE COASTAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

                IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT




1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.1.1   The major program of economic and institutional reforms that began in 1978 brought to
an end three decades of state "command and control" and ushered in a period of rapid and
sustained economic growth. Real Gross Domestic Product has increased by an average of more
than 9 percent per year since 1978, and in several peak years the economy has grown by more
than 13 percent. This impressive economic growth has been based on the liberalization of an
economy with surplus labor, a high savings rate, liberalized foreign trade and investment, and
large sustained increases in productivity.

1.1.2   At the time of project preparation1, the government's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000)
and Fifteen-Year Perspective Plan (which focused on policies and programs, in contrast to the
emphasis of earlier Plans on quantifiable targets) were concerned with five key areas:

    · ensuring macroeconomic stability and maintaining the momentum of reforms in
         banking, state enterprises and public finance
    · reducing infrastructural bottlenecks to growth through investment in water management,
         energy, transport and telecommunications
    · enhancing human development via poverty alleviation and giving emphasis to education,
         health and social security
    · sustaining stable growth in agriculture to raise incomes, reduce poverty and improve
         food security
    · balancing economic growth, natural resource use, urbanization and industrialization with
         environmental protection via incentives and taxes in a clear regulatory framework.

1.1.3   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)2 in effect during preparation and appraisal was
based on an agreement of priorities with the government grouped around these five major themes,
and was in effect essentially unchanged from the earlier 1995 CAS. The project was expected to
contribute to two of the higher-level objectives of the CAS by helping to sustain stable growth in
agriculture and balancing that growth with environmental protection through the adoption and
demonstration of coastal zone management.

1.1.4   In the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), reference was made to the rapid rate of
economic development that had been experienced by the densely-populated coastal provinces
during the previous fifteen years (it was, in fact, closer to twenty years). In the decade since
appraisal, that high rate of growth has been maintained. When the project was designed, the
pressure on natural resources from high growth in both the agricultural and industrial sectors

environmental protection. The emphasis given to the broadly-defined agricultural sector in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan placed it at the top of the government's agenda and ocean farming was seen
as the most important growth area. However, the need to expand production through the
exploitation of ocean resources was at odds with the clearly unsatisfactory status of coastal zone
management then in evidence, with heavy near-shore over-fishing, an increasing level of shellfish
disease, estuarine pollution and outbreaks of "red tide"3.

1.1.5     The rationale for the Bank's involvement in the project was based on three premises: (a)
its involvement from identification onwards had already provoked discussion on and raised
awareness of the importance of coastal zone management and its continued presence would help
to ensure the adoption of the most advanced planning techniques; (b) by bringing together
international experts, local agencies and production, processing and marketing enterprises, the
Bank would make a contribution to the wide adoption of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control
Point (HACCP) practices; and (c) Bank involvement would help to rationalize and optimize
aquaculture production by introducing alternative models and sustainable production practices.

1.1.6     It is of interest to note that the project has remained relevant to and consistent with the
successive CASs since the beginning of its implementation up to its completion. In the Country
Partnership Strategy 2006-2010, the second and third (of five) "pillars" of support are aimed: (a)
at reducing poverty, inequality and social exclusion; and (b) at managing resource scarcity and
environmental challenges. The objectives and components of the project are fully compatible
with both of these pillars of support.

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

1.2.1     The development objectives of the project as defined in the PAD were: (a) to support the
government's commitment to the sustainable development of China's coastal resources; (b) to
reduce pressure on coastal fisheries resources; and (c) to help improve aquatic product quality.

1.2.2     The objectives were to be achieved via actions in six major areas: (a) the design and
implementation of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) plans in selected areas of four coastal
provinces; (b) investments in advanced hatchery technology and marine aquaculture that would
promote and reinforce sound CZM practices; (c) field trials to develop methods to rehabilitate
shrimp ponds affected by disease problems; (d) the expansion and improvement in quality of
storage, processing and marketing facilities for aquatic products; (e) the training of public and
private sector personnel in quality control procedures for aquatic products, consistent with the
approach of HACCP; and (f) the application of HACCP standards to those processing plants and
markets up-graded by the project.

1.2.3     The project design defined four "project areas" selected to be representative of a broad
range of climatic, ecological and economic conditions on China's coast-line (which extends to
18,000 km). These were: Fujian Province; Nantong Municipality in Jiangsu Province; Wehai
Municipality in Shandong Province; and Yingkou Municipality in Liaoning Province.
1.2.4     The statement of the development objectives provided in the Loan Agreement (LA) was
formulated differently but was essentially the same as that in the PAD, although it made specific



3"Red tide" is the common term for a phenomenon known as a harmful algal bloom, an event in which estuarine,
marine or fresh-water algae accumulate rapidly. These algae, more specifically phytoplankton, are microscopic, single-
celled protists, plant-like organisms that can form dense, visible patches near the water's surface.

references to "selected areas" (which are assumed to be synonymous with the defined term
"Project Areas") and to the "Project Entities" (which were defined as the Borrower's participating
provinces).

1.2.5   The key performance indicators associated with the development objectives, project
outputs and project components were described broadly as measures of:

(a) increases in beneficiaries' incomes, (and) production and survival rates of mariculture species
(b) the linkage of environmental data to production decisions
(c) the replenishment of natural fish stocks
(d) the increase in the use of fish fry from hatcheries
(e) the dissemination of results of shrimp trials
(f) the increase in fish-feed conversion efficiency ratios
(g) the application of carrying-capacity research
(h) the dissemination of HACCP training and principles outside the project area
(i) conformance with HACCP guidelines.

These were elaborated on in Annex 1 of the PAD in the Project Design Summary and a set of
monitoring indicators.

1.2.6   The development objectives of the project were broad, and the use of such statements as
"to support the government's commitments to sustainable development", "to reduce pressure on
coastal fisheries resources", and "to help improve aquatic product quality" must obviously be
accompanied by an interpretation of the inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts anticipated at
appraisal if measurable objectives are to be defined for the project. In the PAD, the key
performance indicators are not consistent between the main text, the log-frame and the
monitoring indicators, and there were inconsistencies between the output indicators presented in
the log-frame (Annex 1) and the monitoring indicators (Annex 1A).

1.2.7   In Section 3.2, the PDOs and the outcome indicators have been re-stated for clarity and
brevity and to allow qualitative and quantitative assessment to be made.

1.3     Revised PDO and Key Indicators

1.3.1   Neither the project development objectives nor the outcome targets were revised during
project implementation.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1   The primary target group of people and organizations expected to benefit directly from
the project's activities was defined in very broad terms as "... the local communities along the
coastline of four provinces ...", and the benefits were defined equally broadly as "... increasing
incomes and ensuring long-term sustainable use of local resources.". The project was expected
to provide incremental employment for 85,000 people, one-third of them women. In addition,
new knowledge on sustainable production technology was expected to have a significant impact
on the mariculture industry outside the immediate project areas.

1.4.2   The causal link between the investments to be made under the project and the anticipated
benefits was a direct one. The benefits of Coastal Zone Management, a public good, were
expected to accrue through the development of knowledge about resource use, a framework of
incentives and penalties, and the physical infrastructure and equipment to enforce the regulatory


                                                  3

framework. The benefits of Marine Aquaculture and Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation were expected
to be generated directly through increased production and efficiency flowing from private sector
investment and through the improved knowledge base. The benefits of investments in Product
Quality and Safety were expected to flow directly to the entrepreneurs involved, indirectly to the
processing industry in general via a "demonstration effect", and indirectly to all producers of sea-
food as the improved quality of products allowed the processing industry to meet the demands of
sophisticated markets, particularly those in Europe and North America, and achieve higher export
prices than would otherwise be the case.

1.5      Original Components

1.5.1    The project had four components. The component costs indicated here include price and
physical contingency provisions of "about" 20 percent4 but not the apportionment of the
consultant costs and "unallocated" expenditures.

1.5.2    Component 1: Coastal Zone Management (cost estimate at appraisal US$15.6 million,
7.8 percent of the total cost). The component was designed to support the formulation and
implementation of Coastal Zone Management Programs, and activities in the four project areas
were drawn from the following: (a) establishment of the institutional arrangements to support
CZM; (b) assessment of existing resource use; (c) the preparation of CZM Plans and the
provision of information technology for data collection and analysis; (d) equipment and training
for environmental data collection and analysis; (e) the establishment of Fishery and
Environmental Management Centers; (f) the provision of fisheries surveillance vessels and
equipment for environmental monitoring and fish stocks assessment; and (g) the establishment of
a coastal forest protection belt in Nantong Municipality.

1.5.3    Component 2: Marine Aquaculture (cost estimate US$136.2 million, 68.1 percent of
the total). The component was designed to support environmentally-sustainable aquaculture in
shallow waters and tidal flats through the provision of inputs on credit terms and sub-loans to
farmers and other entrepreneurs for equipment, materials, facilities and services. Fish-raising in
net cages, the breeding and production of shell-fish, and the production of sea-weed, kelp, algae
and laver were the main production objectives. In addition, the component was expected to
support the development of 26 hatcheries for the propagation of seventeen species, applying
proven technology to raise the production of fish fry and reduce the pressure on wild fingerlings
that were then being used to supply the net cages.

1.5.4    Component 3: Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation (cost estimate US$9.9 million, 5.0 percent
of the total). Outbreaks of viral infections had severely reduced the productivity of shrimp
culture, and the component was designed to support trials of new methods of shrimp pond
management that could be profitable and sustainable on a large scale.

1.5.5    The intended causal link between the activities under the first three components and the
PDOs (a) and (b) was direct but weak. In particular, because the PDOs were defined in such a
qualitative manner, the issue of attribution of benefits to project actions is difficult.

1.5.6    Component 4: Products Quality and Safety (cost estimate US$32.2 million, 16.1
percent of the total). The component was designed to improve the quality and safety of sea-food
via the provision of loans to sea-food handling operations (including processing and marketing)
to finance investments in cold storage; processing and packaging; wholesale markets; and training

in the quality and safety control concepts of HACCP. The purpose was to enable companies to
meet the high standards of customers in North America and Europe, and all facilities receiving
support under the component were to be required to apply HACCP standards.

1.5.7    The intended causal link between the activities under the component and the PDO (c) was
both direct and strong. Investments in physical facilities (cold storage, modern processing and
handling) and in training, allied with the adoption of the internationally-recognized HACCP
standards, were expected to bring immediate benefits to the processing, handling and marketing
operations in the form of access to more demanding and higher-priced export markets.

1.5.8    In the Project Description Summary in the PAD, US$1.0 million was allocated to
"consultants for institution building" and US$5.1 million was "unallocated".

1.6      Revised Components

1.6.1    The four components of the project were maintained unchanged throughout the period of
implementation. The relative importance of the components, in practice, was very different from
that anticipated in the project's design and appraisal; this is described below in more detail
(Section 3.2).

1.7      Other Significant Changes

1.7.1    There were no changes in the project's design, and the financing arrangement remained at
the level of 50 percent each from the Bank loan and from government/beneficiaries. The
implementation period was extended from the implicit 6½ years5 anticipated at appraisal to 9½
years following two extensions of the Closing Date of the Loan. The scope of the project was
amplified by the extension of the Project Area to include additional provinces and municipalities,
but the scale of the project remained essentially unchanged.

1.7.2    The allocation of funding changed significantly from that anticipated at appraisal.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Key factors and issues on the quality at entry

2.1.1    The background analysis for the project was sound, and the long-term involvement and
depth of knowledge of key Bank staff members was crucial in guiding and coordinating with
counterpart government officials at all levels. At the time of preparation and appraisal, coastal
zone management was a new field for the Bank; no completed Bank-supported projects were
available for reference but more than 100 programs were then currently under implementation
around the world. The lessons learned from these programs pointed to a number of necessary
conditions for success: (a) strong high-level government commitment to achieving changes in
behavior; (b) visible improvements at an early stage of the program; (c) clear, unambiguous
policies and goals; (d) adequate resources for implementation, monitoring & evaluation, and
enforcement; and (e) public awareness and support. All of these conditions were considered to be
either present or achievable under the project as then proposed. Project design also benefited
from the experience gained under the Bank-supported Coastal Lands Development Project,
implemented in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces from 1988-1994, which was focused mainly on
production. The rationale for Bank involvement (see paragraph 1.1.5) was sound.

Assessment of project design

2.1.2    The project development objectives were broad and qualitative. They could usefully
have been more specific and accompanied by more (and quantitative) key performance indicators.

2.1.3    The four components were well identified, and had sufficient in-built flexibility to allow
for changed circumstances to dictate the eventual aggregate sizes of the actual investments made.
As can be seen from Annex 1, investments under Coastal Zone Management were 258 percent of
the appraisal estimate, those under Marine Aquaculture were 59 percent and those under Product
Quality and Safety were 184 percent. Almost none of the investments anticipated under Shrimp
Pond Rehabilitation were actually made.

2.1.4    The organization of the project was efficient, but the institutional capabilities of some of
the entities involved in implementation required more inputs to improve them, and over a longer
period, than had been anticipated. The project was complex, but not unnecessarily so: the number
of components and their level of complexity were necessary to achieve the numerous advances
required to meet the objectives. The project was geographically dispersed (for the reasons given
in paragraph 1.2.3) and the project area was expanded during implementation in order to
accelerate the up-take of the innovations over a larger area since the ultimate objective was to
bring those innovations to all of China's coastal provinces and municipalities.

Government commitment, stakeholder involvement and participation

2.1.5    At appraisal, it was evident that major economic losses had been experienced in most of
the project areas because of unsustainable practices and there was evidence of over-fishing in
near-shore waters. Strong support was expressed by senior leaders at various levels of
government, and the willingness of provincial authorities to borrow from the Bank for
environmental monitoring was seen as a strong indication of support for the concept of coastal
zone management. The government at all levels maintained commitment to the project; the



                                                  6

national government expanded the number of project provinces and applied the methodology
pioneered by the project to the whole of China's coast-line.

2.1.6     Provincial, municipal and county representatives found strong support among potential
beneficiaries from the early stages of preparation, and consultation with potential stakeholders led
to a number of changes in the project's contents. The scope of the CZM component was
expanded when the government and the Bank became aware of the generally-expressed need for
more effective and coordinated planning, and the eventual implementation of CZM planning
itself became a participatory process. Consultation with aquaculture farmers helped to refine the
selection of areas and species, and refocused the Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation component to a
research-oriented approach from its earlier emphasis on production.

2.1.7     Risks and mitigation measures. At appraisal, the overall risk rating of the project was
considered to be "moderate" and, in fact, under the log-frame approach then in use only two
broad risks were identified (and both had a risk rating of "moderate"). In "Outputs to
Development Objectives", the risk was considered to be from a change in the government's
policy (by which presumably was meant its policy in the broadest sense concerning coastal
resource use and environmental issues). In "Components to Outputs", the risks were considered
to be typhoon damage and localized outbreaks of aquatic diseases. The first risk was to be
mitigated by a continuing dialogue with government on policies in the sector, and the second by a
series of factors affecting site selection including carrying capacity, water quality, storm
protection, disease monitoring and control, and links between researchers, extension agents and
farmers.

2.1.8     With the benefit of hindsight, this can be seen as having been a somewhat over-simplified
conclusion. In practice, the government's commitment (at the national, provincial and municipal
levels) to a comprehensive policy framework and the investments to support it has strengthened
over the past decade. However, at appraisal there was a real risk that parts of the implementation
structure (particularly those that had no experience of working with Bank funding) would be
found wanting and that the demand for financing by the public and/or private sector participants
would be affected by a wide range of factors ranging from interest rates to market conditions for
finished products, as proved to be the case.

2.1.9     As is frequently the case in Bank project appraisal, most of what was identified as "risk"
in the PAD should more properly be categorized as "uncertainty". However, the impact of
typhoons is a true example of risk in that the probability of a typhoon striking a given area of
coast-line in a given period can be calculated with some accuracy. Whatever the probability,
three typhoons6 did affect the coast of China during the period of project implementation causing
a wide range of damage and loss of life, and not incidentally affecting some aspects of project
implementation. The most appropriate mitigation measures are (ex ante) early warning systems,
which are in place and are supported by a large international infrastructure including satellite
monitoring, and (ex post) insurance.

2.1.10 The risk (or uncertainty) concerning outbreaks of disease was well-founded in that such
outbreaks had been occurring with increasing frequency and severity before the project. The
whole panoply of measures involved in the Coastal Zone Management and Marine Aquaculture
components appears to have succeeded in reducing the incidence of disease.

2.1.11 There was no Quality Assurance Group assessment of the project's "Quality at Entry".

2.2      Implementation

2.2.1    The project was highly innovative and combined support for the provision of public
goods, in the Coastal Zone Management component, with support for the private sector to expand
seafood production and to improve the quality of processing. The original project area was
expanded in April 2004 in order to replicate the early successes of the project over a wider area.
The government's commitment to the sustainable development of China's coastal resources has
been strengthened, and the most important achievement of the project has been the radical change
achieved in convincing provincial governments of the value and importance of coastal zone
management. The Coastal Zone Management component influenced government thinking and
policy at the national and provincial levels, and thus has had a major impact on seafood
production, biodiversity and the restoration of livelihoods. The Products Quality and Safety
component was also highly innovative in achieving a catalytic "demonstration effect" by
supporting investments in the modernization of processing plants and the adoption of HACCP
standards and practices. These are now the bench-mark for the seafood processing industry,
raising standards in the domestic market and permitting continued access to the most demanding
and remunerative export markets.

2.2.2    The implementation structure of the project was relatively simple, with a Central Project
Management Office (CPMO)7 coordinating the activities of five Project Entities8 (in the original
design), each of which had a Project Management Office (PMO) and managed a separate project
account at the provincial level with the involvement of provincial Finance Bureaus. In the early
years of project implementation (late 1998-2000), a number of weaknesses were reported,
including a shortage of trained staff, a lack of familiarity with Bank procedures (especially
procurement), and poor financial management (project accounts not properly maintained or
supporting documentation filed). Project management was much weaker at the municipal and
county levels than at the provincial level.

On-lending of Loan funds

2.2.3    The Ministry of Finance (MoF), the representative of the Borrower, made available to the
Project Entities their respective allocated amounts of the Loan. For Component 2 (Marine
Aquaculture) and Component 3 (Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation), the Project Entities provided
inputs (equipment, materials, facilities and services) on credit terms or loans to aquaculture
farmers and enterprises to expand their production through "sub-projects". The repayment period
of these sub-loans was a maximum of fifteen years, with a grace period not exceeding five years,
and the interest rate payable was to be not less than the rate payable by the Project Entities to the
MoF (which was defined as US$ LIBOR9 Base Rate10 plus the Bank's LIBOR Total Spread11)
plus a 0.75 percent commitment fee on un-withdrawn balances. Repayments were to be made in
domestic currency equivalent to the US$ value of the funds disbursed.

2.2.4    In effect, this was directed credit and, when Component 4 (Products Quality and Safety)
is included, the "credit" content of the Bank's loan was 89 percent. There is very little

information in the PAD on how the credit was actually going to be provided to beneficiaries. The
Annex to Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement provides a detailed description of the legal
requirements attached to sub-loans and sub-projects, but nowhere is there a detailed description of
the procedural and administrative aspects of credit management (e.g., qualification standards for
participating financial intermediaries, subsidiary loan agreements, sub-loan agreements, credit
manuals, and credit reporting system) that would normally be found in a Bank-funded credit
project and defined prior to negotiations or effectiveness . The clear impression is that more
                                                                       12

should have been done during project preparation and appraisal to define the "mechanics" of the
flow of credit funds and the monitoring of their use. It is of interest to note that the provision of
this "line of credit' did not follow the guidelines then in effect , a characteristic that it shared
                                                                              13

with other projects in China supported by lines of credit.

2.2.5    In practice, the Finance Bureaus were used as the on-lending mechanism to sub-
borrowers. The project made funds available from the Bank's loan to the Finance Bureaus and
they were responsible for all aspects of sub-loan appraisal, making the sub-loans using their own
internal procedures and being responsible for sub-loan recovery and repayment. The Finance
Bureau review assessed the financial viability of the sub-project, its management, the repayment
capacity and the collateral to be provided by the sub-borrower. In some instances, this level of
review by the local Finance Bureaus (with their more intimate knowledge of the enterprises'
exposure and performance) resulted in investments being dropped from the project that had
already been "approved" by the Bank and provincial authorities.

2.2.6    In practice, almost no project expenditures were made for Component 3 and expenditures
for Component 2 were only 59 percent of amount anticipated at appraisal even though the project
area was expanded. The use of funds from this "credit" component was demand-driven and it is
not surprising that the actual amount invested differs significantly from the projection at
appraisal. At appraisal, it was anticipated that the Bank loan would finance 46 percent of
expenditures made in Component 2, but in practice it financed slightly less than 30 percent.
There is no clear-cut explanation as to why actual investments were lower than the appraisal
estimate or why the Bank's share in funding them was reduced. It has been argued that early in
the project's life an increase in LIBOR to 6.99 percent had the effect of pricing sub-loans at two
percentage points above loans available from domestic commercial banks; allied to the
commitment fee and the foreign exchange risk borne by potential beneficiaries, sub-loans from
the Bank's funding were reportedly relatively unattractive to the end-users.

2.2.7    Between appraisal in October 1997 and Loan Effectiveness in October 1998, LIBOR fell
from 5.8 to 5.1 percent before slowly increasing to a peak of 7.1 percent in May 2000; it then
declined steadily to a low of 1.12 percent in June 2003 and rose again so that between April 2006
and July 2007 it averaged 5.40 percent. If the rise in LIBOR in the early years of the project had
a disincentive effect on the up-take of sub-loans, the decline thereafter presumably was an
incentive. However, no systematic data set has been provided that would allow a conventional
analysis of the "credit portfolio" established by the project to track repayments, arrears, etc. The


12One effect of this apparent lack of definition was that lending for productive activities was slow to start. In June
   1999, in a Management Letter, one of the Bank's main recommendations was that "The on-lending arrangements
   between all levels (i.e., central government, province, municipalities, counties) should be finalized ...;" and in
   December 1999 (a year after the Loan was declared effective) supervision reports were stating that "... changes

foreign exchange risk was borne by the beneficiaries, although the prospect of a devaluation of
the domestic currency presumably did not cause too many sleepless nights. In practice, the Yuan
was revalued significantly during the last two years of the project's life14 to the advantage of
beneficiaries taking out sub-loans whose obligations are demarcated in terms of US$.

Mid-Term Review and Restructurings

2.2.8    The Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the project was carried out over an extended period,
and was concluded in late 2001, almost exactly three years after the Loan's effectiveness. The
Loan Agreement required each project entity to provide a mid-term report not later than June 30,
2001, to review the report with the Bank, and to take the necessary agreed measures to ensure the
completion of its respective part of the project. A Bank mission in March 2001 concluded that
not all project areas had finished preparing the requirements to determine the restructuring needs,
and the MTR was carried out in two stages, in September and November, 2001, as these
requirements were met.

2.2.9    At that point, good progress was being made with the implementation of Coastal Zone
Management plans in all project municipalities, and the government had extended the
requirement to all coastal municipalities outside the project area. Marine Aquaculture activities
were proceeding at a slower pace than anticipated because of reduced profitability (as a result of
weakening domestic and export demand) and the somewhat onerous demands place on the
(mainly private sector) participants in terms of loan and counterpart fund guarantees. Shrimp
Pond Rehabilitation activities were significantly less than anticipated; the potential benefits from
rehabilitation had been found not to justify investments under the project, and the component
appears de facto to have been abandoned for all practical purposes. By contrast, the Products
Quality and Safety component was supporting the seafood processing industry, with a steadily
increasing level of interest among the private sector actors in up-grading existing facilities and
incorporating HACCP principles in the design of new capacity financed under the project.

2.2.10 The MTR revealed that a number of project provinces and municipalities wished to
reduce the amount of the loan allocated to them and to alter the "portfolio" of activities
anticipated at appraisal, removing some activities and adding others. Management letters in
October and November 2001 conveyed the Bank's conclusions and recommendations that
resulted from the MTR, but only in August 2003 did a restructuring mission take place. The
purpose of that mission was to reallocate approximately US$26 million from "savings" (mainly
the result of a change in scope) in three of the four provinces involved in the original design and
expand the project into two additional provinces and one Autonomous Region. At that stage, it
was anticipated that Xiamen would also reduce its demands on the funds available from the Loan,
but this could not be confirmed at that time. As a result, there were to be two "restructurings" of
the project.

2.2.11 It should be emphasized that the restructuring was a very large task, carried out within the
limitations of the supervision budget (which was barely adequate, given the complexity and
geographic dispersion of the project) and limited FAO-CP assistance, and was necessarily carried
out over an extended period. The restructuring involved the addition of three new project areas
(with the establishment of new PMOs, Project Leading Groups, Special Accounts, etc.) and each


14The exchange rate revaluation began in July 2005 when the rate was 8.2865 = US$1 and by December 31, 2007
   had reached 7.3141 = US$1, a revaluation of 13.3 percent. By June 2008, when the exchange rate reached
   6.8807 = US$1, the revaluation was 20.4 percent.

of the proposed new investments was subject to environmental, economic and financial analysis
(as well as HACCP analysis in the case of processing industry projects).

2.2.12 In April 2004, an "opportunistic"15 restructuring was made. The government's formal
request stated that "... after five years of successful implementation, there is a need to adjust the
proceeds between provinces and the categories.". Eighteen new investments were proposed to
extend the more innovative and successful activities to additional coastal provinces and
municipalities; the investments were fully within the project's original components and
development objectives. The reallocated funds were destined to support new investments in an
expanded project area mainly under the Coastal Zone Management and Product Quality and
Safety components. These new investments had all been carefully analyzed with respect to
technical and economic feasibility, and fitted completely within the description of the project and
its objectives stated in the PAD. The province of Jiangsu ended its participation in the project.

2.2.13 In November 2005, a second and more limited "opportunistic" restructuring was carried
out. No increase in the project area was involved. The municipality of Xiamen took the decision
not to use the major part of the funds allocated to it, and the MoF proposed that the funds thereby
released should be used for two major investments: (a) mangrove restoration, a mangrove
research and demonstration unit, and expansion of cage fish culture in Guanngxi Zhuang AR
(Fangchenggang municipality); and (b) expansion of a sea-food processing plant in Fujian
province (Dongshan municipality). These investments were also fully in line with the project's
objectives and component descriptions.

summarized below.

 * In the conformed copy of the Loan Agreement dated July 31, 1998, the total of the five Categories that make up
    Schedule 1 exceeds the total value of the Loan (US$100 million). The discrepancy is not explained.

2.2.15 In the early years of the project's implementation, numerous problems were encountered
with procurement and several with disbursements and record-keeping; in particular, a number of
issues were identified through supervision and the audit of the 1999 accounts. For the most part,
these problems were attributable to the shortage of staff in the PMOs and their lack of experience,


15The ICR Guidelines for the preparation of ICRs (as revised in May 2007) distinguish between the different causes of
    restructuring as being "corrective", "adaptive" or "opportunistic". Both restructurings of the project were
    "opportunistic".



                                                          11

particularly in dealing with the Bank's requirements, and were remedied. However, in two
instances the problems encountered were sufficiently serious for the Bank to declare
"misprocurement". In the first instance, a total of US$2.063 million was returned to the Bank and
cancelled from the Loan Agreement in December 2003.16 A second case of misprocurement was
declared in December 2007,17 late in the project's life and only a matter of days before the Loan's
Closing Date, when a total of US$860,000 was refunded to the Bank; the cause of the second
misprocurement was the falsification of documents by two sub-borrowers, and cannot be
attributed to a lack of familiarity with the Bank's procedures.

2.2.16 A Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA7) was carried out in September 2006. The
overall quality of supervision was rated as "satisfactory".

 Focus on development effectiveness                                     Satisfactory
 Supervision of fiduciary/safeguards aspects                            Satisfactory
 Adequacy of supervision inputs and processes                           Satisfactory
 Candor and quality of ISRs                                             Moderately Satisfactory

The Overall Assessment described the project as innovative and as having received diligent
technical supervision to advance a new approach to coastal zone management in China.
However, it stated that "Despite good data being available in the field, quantitative indicators
were not provided to demonstrate implementation progress or (to) support statements that the
development objectives would be achieved.". The Assessment found that emphasis had been
placed by the supervision team on implementation support, in particular the physical components
and activities, but that policy and institutional issues had been somewhat neglected. Good aide-
memoires and management letters had been consistently produced, but ISRs had failed to capture
the innovative nature of the project and to state clearly the achievements and the issues for
management action.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring and Evaluation: Design

2.3.1    The statement of the development objectives in the PAD is accompanied by a brief
description of the project's components and a summary of the key performance indicators, which
are a mixture of the input, output, outcome and impact indicators shown in Annex 1. The project
design presented in the PAD had no quantifiable targets or indicators related to the achievement
of the PDOs (apart from the economic and financial analysis) and the input, output, outcome and
impact indicators are not consistent in the main text of the PAD, the Project Design
Summary/Log-frame (Annex 1) and the Monitoring Indicators (Annex 1A).

2.3.2    The PAD states that "A detailed monitoring system will track progress in coastal
management, physical implementation and a range of environmental and socio-economic data"18
but contains no description of a system of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to be developed
under the project or of a procedure to create one. The absence of a base-line study meant that the
initial conditions were not defined and this was a serious impediment to the efforts during the
project's life to create an M&E system.


16A larger amount, US$2.311million, had been erroneously cancelled in June 2002 and the error was corrected with a
   "value date" of December 2, 2003.

Monitoring and Evaluation: Implementation

2.3.3 The M&E systems created under the project largely used existing staffs and reporting
mechanisms, and basic reporting on the progress of implementation was adequate. There were
some difficulties with timely reporting from some areas early on in the project as they learned
about new procedures, as well as undergoing administrative changes (at MTR). There was a
significant difference between the monitoring systems created. Some of the systems can be
considered to be "state of the art"; for example, in aquaculture, Fujian Province set up a specific
tracking and mapping system that was detailed down to the level of the individual farm unit,
permitting the closest scrutiny.

2.3.4 Generally, the monitoring focused on inputs and quantifiable physical outputs, a concern
raised by supervision missions. Structured thematic assessments were not done to track important
outcomes, and outcome indicators and targets were not reviewed or changed.

Monitoring and Evaluation: Utilization

2.3.4    Tracking and reporting of inputs and outputs generally led to good responses, though
again as noted above there were initial difficulties and delays. The most important response was
the restructuring following the MTR. However, as noted above, with more comprehensive and
structured measurement of outcomes and institutional change attributable to the project, the
project could probably have drawn even more important lessons concerning knowledge outputs
for dissemination and sharing across provinces. Even though the monitoring and reporting
systems used are largely embedded within the capacity of existing administrative systems - and
are thus likely to be sustained for future project purposes ­ the Bank and government could have
supported the longer-term development of local outcome monitoring systems. These would have
provided information for reflecting on substantive changes arising from major sustainable
development interventions in coastal zones, helping the government to target resources and
efforts more accurately in the future.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1    The project was considered to be an Environmental Category B operation and a full
Environmental Impact Assessment was prepared, approved by the National Environment
Protection Agency. The primary aim of the project was to improve environmental conditions in
coastal areas, but the production-oriented activities of the project raised concerns during project
preparation and appraisal. The potential for damage to mangrove forests was obviated by the
project design that included no new shrimp ponds (and latterly the project came to include re-
planting of mangrove and mangrove research facilities). Objections to the net cage culture of fish
on the basis of its potential for contamination and water quality problems were countered by
measures to distribute cages widely in areas of ample dispersion and mixing of water and to
combine them with shell-fish and sea-weed cultivation. The PAD pre-dated the requirement for
the specification of the safeguards policies triggered by the operation. However, it was stated that
no resettlement was anticipated since all expansions of facilities was expected to be on already-
owned and unoccupied land, but that if resettlement were to be found necessary at any stage a
resettlement action plan would be required.

2.4.2    Project accounts have been audited each year, and the audit of the 1999 accounts revealed
problems with procurement and unauthorized use of funds that were eventually resolved.


                                                  13

Numerous problems have been encountered with procurement over the life of the project and
have been resolved, including four cases of misprocurement where funds were returned to the
Bank and the respective amounts cancelled from the Loan.

2.5      Post-completion Operation and Next Phase

2.5.1    The transition to post-completion operation of the investments made under the Coastal
Zone Management component has been a gradual one, since regulation and coastal zoning
pioneered under the project has become a requirement in all coastal areas since national
legislation was passed in 2002. The operation and maintenance of facilities established and
equipped under the project has been provided for in the budgets of the local governments
responsible. In practice, a change in mentality has been achieved; the long-term well-being of
coastal resources and the need for sustainable development have been made central to local
government planning.

2.5.2    More than 75 percent of expenditures under the project were incurred in the support of
private sector investments in directly-productive activities. These were very demand-driven; the
portfolio of investments made and their geographical locations were significantly different from
what had been envisaged at appraisal. It is expected that these investments will be maintained
and operated by the entrepreneurs responsible; the investments made, for the most part, are
commercially oriented and in the case of mariculture investments have the flexibility to modify
the production pattern of species in response to evolving market demands and prices.

2.5.3    The concept of a follow-on operation has been discussed with government and the
Borrower, but so far work has not begun on the detailed identification and preparation of an
operation. Six provinces have put forward outline proposals for follow-on activities, and it is of
interest that almost 80 percent of the proposed activities focused on the area of coastal zone
management.

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      The Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1    The Relevance of Objectives The development objectives of the project (to support the
government's commitment to the sustainable development of coastal resources, to reduce
pressure on natural marine resources and to improve quality in aquatic production) remain highly
relevant to China's development priorities and to two (of the five) pillars of support defined in the
current Country Partnership Strategy 2006-201019. In broad terms these were and remain highly
relevant in relation to requirements of strong coordinated planning and environmental
management of China's intensively-utilized coastal zones. This is particularly the case for
mitigating and managing the human impacts on the environment, which still are under intense
and increasing development pressure along coasts (for example, in terms of more efficient water
management systems).

3.1.2    The Relevance of Design and Implementation The design of the project, with its
balance of a public sector-led responsibility for the planning and enforcement of resource
management and a private sector-led leading role in economic development, remains highly
relevant to China's development priorities and circumstances. Both the Bank's and the
government's policies and approaches to dealing with the private sector have changed to some

degree since project inception. Encouraging the strong and sustainable growth of the private
sector is still seen as a key driver of the economy. On the sea-border, this is particularly active
and dynamic, and promoting high-quality export products is still relevant, for example to take
advantage of the new WTO conditions. However, with alternate sources of financing and
increasing internal sources of technology development and advice, less focus on direct support to
the private sector and more emphasis on regulatory and facilitative mechanisms are of growing
relevance in more recent strategies. In parallel with this is the greater focus on market demand
and equity issues, where perhaps a greater emphasis on market information needs of poorer
producers would have been of greater relevance to potential project beneficiaries.

3.2      Achievement of the Project Development Objectives

3.2.1    The first PDO was to support the government's commitment to the sustainable
development of China's coastal resources, and the most important achievement of the project has
been the radical change achieved in convincing provincial governments of the value and
importance of coastal zone management. The first component of the project has influenced
government thinking and policy at the national and provincial levels, and thus has had a major
impact on seafood production, biodiversity and restoration of livelihoods.

3.2.1    The original project design had no quantified target indicators for outcomes/benefits
(reflecting the PDOs), apart from economic and financial assessment. In the PAD, the Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) are not consistent between the main text, the log-frame (Annex 1)
and the monitoring indicators (Annex 1A). The KPIs were not formally modified during the
restructurings.

3.2.2    There was much useful and active monitoring, reporting and supervision during the
project period. While a detailed monitoring system was prepared and used for tracking individual
interventions, less emphasis was placed on quantifying and measuring outcomes - the actual
result of all the project efforts. To some extent, aquaculture interventions were the exception
with a detailed mapping system down to the level of individual farms. No base-line survey was
carried out to provide an analysis of "change of outcome" levels, and no impact or evaluation
studies were made apart from the economic and financial analysis carried out in preparation for
the ICR. Borrower and supervision reports have focused mainly on inputs and outputs (even after
this issue was raised in the Quality of Supervision assessment).

3.2.3    Without detailed assessments (ideally with comparisons to non-project controls), it is
difficult to attribute the observed changes to project interventions. Some observed "before and
after" comparisons provided were useful but limited, given the wider fast-changing economic and
social conditions in coastal China (which have been extraordinary in the last 10-15 years).
During the ICR mission, the team in part had to rely on interviews to assess project "causes-
effects" and to identify other contextual changes, though this was limited to short stays in project
areas.

3.2.4    Based on discussion and analysis of the PAD, the ICR mission has summarized the PDOs
and impacts, and their indicators, for greater clarity and brevity (an exercise that usefully could
have been done early in the project) together with target-setting.

                                         result of the project



3.2.5    Design and implementation of sound CZM plans The project provided the
intellectual environment and the infrastructure (offices, laboratory facilities) to carry out coastal
zone planning and zoning in the project provinces. Early in the project (2002), the government
established a policy and legal framework for planning and zoning in all coastal provinces, and it
can be reasonably assumed that the project influenced the national policy development. At
restructuring, additional counties set up CZM centers and thus accelerated CZM planning and
implementation. It should be noted, however, that in Nantong the CZM center was set up and
operational before the project could provide funding (even though this was one of the original
project areas), such was the urgency for local government action because of the pressure on
natural resources.

3.2.6    The project has contributed to strengthened implementation of CZM plans and
regulations in several ways, though the exact extent and project contribution was not monitored.
Thus question of whether the project has assisted in putting in place detailed regulation and
enforcement to manage aquaculture development according to carrying capacity is difficult to
assess because of the same attribution concerns as the CZM planning and zoning output. There
has been an exponential expansion of aquaculture in most of the project provinces. Nevertheless,
there has been a zoning policy of shifting aquaculture away from peri-urban areas to the more
rural eastern shores (for example, in Xiamen) partly in recognition of over-crowding and
pollution threats in the original areas. Similarly, protected areas have been zoned for Xiamen

(lancelets20) and offshore islands in Xiangshan to protect core habitats of endangered and
economically-valuable species. A network of 130 water quality measuring stations has been set
up in Fujian, which is providing considerably enhanced environmental management information.

3.2.7     In support of the implementation of fishery regulations, in three municipalities the project
has supported the acquisition of large surveillance boats; with these faster and more powerful
vessels, apprehensions can now be made of serious fishery violations that previously were
frequent. In Fuzhou and Xiangshan Counties, for example, control over the use of dynamite,
intrusions of larger fishing vessels into inshore areas, and fishing during the summer ban can now
be enforced more effectively (though infringement records are not readily available).

3.2.8     Strengthened sustainable mariculture investments, contributing to reduced pressure
on coastal fisheries resources The start of the project coincided with a period where limits
were being placed on the number of fishing vessels in most areas, enforced through a new
national fishery policy. The policy was established in recognition of over-fishing pressures and
the need for the up-grading of older boats. In several provinces it was noted during the ICR
mission that the project aquaculture component had provided a valuable opportunity for
alternative livelihoods to fishermen leaving capture fishing, thus assisting in the reduction of
pressure21.

3.2.9     A preliminary over-view of aquaculture types invested in through the project indicates a
fully consistent trend with more ecologically-friendly systems (more herbivorous and filter-
feeding species, like molluscs) and integrated/poly-culture systems. Most of project aquaculture
production investment were made in shell-fish farming (over 6,000 ha and mostly in scallops),
but there were also investments in red algae and kelp (278 ha) and cage fish farming (44,000
cages utilizing a wide and constantly-changing mixture of fish species). These are commercially
viable, judged by the results of the financial analysis (Annex 3). The overall aquaculture
contribution of the project is lower than expected in the PAD, as this was scaled down at
restructuring. The monitoring system did not assess spill-over effects of the project on non-
project beneficiaries and neighboring areas. It should be noted that, for key products, investments
by the project were matched many times over by private parallel financing. Shrimp culture,
which is generally associated with higher risk and pressures, was only implemented to 5 percent
of the original target. Hatcheries and nurseries set up under the project have been able to supply
seed and brood stock to producers and to some degree to re-stock natural areas. However, the
degree to which these have contributed to reduced overall pressure on natural resources is not
quantified.

3.2.10 There are no project-specific data on aquaculture disease trends and patterns. However,
project staff observations indicate a reduced incidence of disease, at least in some areas (for
example, through responding to disease outbreaks in Xiamen) as a result of better understanding
of management practices and extension advice. Fully-operational Disease Monitoring Centers
regularly produce bulletins and reports. Similarly, improved information on warning of red tides
and typhoons that have been produced by the 3D real-time monitoring system in Fujian and other
environmental monitoring centers are contributing to some degree to better aquaculture

21For example, in one village in Lianjiang County 80 percent of villagers, mostly fisher families, had wholly converted
to kelp farming popularized by the project in the area. Former fishing vessels had been converted into farming utility
vessels.

management. However, without further data comparing project provinces or counties to other
areas, direct attribution is difficult. Not all laboratories were fully operational as of March 2008.

3.2.11 Improving aquatic product quality A notable success of the project was its
contribution to improving the quality and safety standards of sea-food. Project-supported
facilities have consistently adopted HACCP standards and have set an example for standards in
their areas where previously these were very low. In many cases, the project-related processors
have also obtained (or are in the process of obtaining) approval to stringent standards laid down
by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and the European Union (EU),
and the benefits of this have been in most cases very profitable. China's WTO accession has also
made this effort most relevant. These efforts have, in many cases, been accompanied by the
development of waste-water treatment facilities to ensure outfall environmental quality
compliance (in line with project requirements).

3.2.12 It could be argued that improving processing is somewhat peripheral to the core
environmental project thrust of sustainable development of coastal resources, but it can assist
producers in diversifying their products, focusing on product quality rather than quantity (and so
reducing pressure on resources). While the Loan Agreement required processors to limit capture
fish to 30 percent of their total process requirements, this was not strictly adhered to in all cases;
however, seafood processors interviewed in Dongshan and Xiangshan were using between 40-60
percent of aquaculture products, and in the case of a Kelp processor in Fujian the percentage of
aquaculture products was much higher. However, with increasing markets for seafood products
the overall demand for captured fish for processing by some of the project-associated companies
is still increasing.

3.2.13 The PAD Annex 1A listed a set of indicators for sustainable coastal development impacts
encompassing improvements in natural resources, employment benefits from sustainable use, and
a demonstration effect of the improved aquatic product quality systems. In terms of attribution
and measurement, it is particularly difficult to measure natural fishery stock increases (through
replenishment and reduced catch), particularly if they are to be shown to result from project
activities. Project staff concurred that fishery resource monitoring is a complex task, with large
temporal and spatial variability, and the project has been only one of the government's
interventions in fishery management.

3.2.14 Employment was created directly and indirectly from project-supported sustainable
aquaculture and safe and high-quality processing. Up to 100,000 people were involved at some
stage in construction activities (CZM facilities, market and processing buildings, etc), close to
40,000 aquaculture farmers and their families benefited directly from the project, and over 62,000
jobs were provided for "rural surplus labor". Many of the people interviewed during the ICR
mission while working in processing factories were rural laborers from other provinces. It is not
clear how many of the total numbers were new farmers, or the ratio of permanent to part-time
employment. Together this is considerably more than the PAD estimate of expected
"employment opportunities" for 85,000 people (PAD Section C.3), though the PAD text itself is
unclear on the distribution of employment sources or whether new jobs would be created.

3.2.15 Anecdotal information was given of evidence of adoption of HACCP in non-project
facilities as a result of the project, showing a positive demonstration effect. This was primarily
by example, where model project processors (often enthusiastic executives) trained and advised
other processors in the same counties. This was mentioned particularly in Dongshan and
Xiangshan. Nevertheless, over the period of the project there has been considerable contact and



                                                   18

investment by overseas Chinese into the coastal areas, who are also bringing with them new ideas
and technologies.

3.3     Efficiency

3.3.1   The first component, Coastal Zone Management, was devoted entirely to the provision of
a complex public good. Without the project, an unsustainable use of fisheries resources was the
principal prospect with an ever-increasing threat of pollution and disease. Whatever benefits
might be derived from the other three production-oriented components could not in practice be
obtained without the necessary conditions for sustainability and rational resource use to be
provided by the first component. The costs involved in achieving the project's objectives are
considered to have been reasonable in comparison with the benefits, but it is not possible to make
any comparison with "recognized norms" since these did not exist in China. The project built on
existing institutions and structures of authority. Its procurement of civil works and goods
followed competitive procurement procedures and were an efficient use of financial resources.
Although much of the facilities and equipment have been designed and specified with an eye to
the future and are "state of the art" (especially where laboratories are concerned), they are
emphatically not grandiose or excessive in size for the functions they must perform.

3.3.2   At appraisal, the benefits anticipated from the first component were identified as a series
of avoided losses and the creation of conditions for "increased resource productivity". The PAD
made reference to two earlier avoidable instances of loss: (a) a sharp drop in laver production in
Jiangsu that had resulted from over-production and a consequent outbreak of disease; and (b) an
outbreak of red tide in Yantai caused by sewage and agricultural pollution, and went on to make
the rather heroic statement that "The losses due to such incidents far exceed the cost of facilities
and services needed to avoid them through coastal zone management and regular monitoring."
without providing any evidence for the statement. No economic analysis was made of the first
component or of the project as a whole. However, the PAD went into some detail on the financial
and economic analysis carried out for activities under the Marine Aquaculture and Shrimp Pond
Rehabilitation components that directly supported production and an improvement in efficiency
and quality. The weighted average economic rate of return for all aquaculture activities was
estimated at 23 percent, and the financial rate of return at 25 percent. The PAD stated that
financial analysis had been carried out for all hatcheries, seafood processing plants and the
expansion of the wholesale markets in Fujian, but did not present the results.

3.3.3   In the preparation of the ICR, financial analysis has been carried out for directly
productive activities promoted under the Marine Aquaculture, Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation and
Products Quality and Safety components. Detailed economic analysis has been carried out for
these activities, for each participating province and for the project as a whole. Actual project
costs were derived from PMO records, with projections made of future costs based on current
operations. Financial and economic analyses of household-based mariculture and shrimp pond
rehabilitation were carried out using one-hectare models and "with project/without project"
simulations. For investments in seafood processing and markets, enterprise models were
developed to assess incremental costs and returns.

3.3.4   The quantifiable benefits of the project are derived from: (a) the incremental income
generated by activities carried out under the Marine Aquaculture component and Shrimp Pond
Rehabilitation component; and (b) incremental income from seafood processing and value-added
from improved marketing generated by investments made under the Products Quality and Safety
component.



                                                  19

3.3.5    Other significant benefits of the project, which have not been included in the analysis
because of the imprecision involved in any attempt at quantification, are those generated from the
Coastal Zone Management component; these include: (a) the "existence" value from the
protection of endangered species; (b) the reduction in seawater intrusion and the enhancement of
productivity of marine fishery products by the mangrove forest; (c) the avoidance of production
losses attributable to the rational resource use and protection promoted and enforced by coastal
management centers and surveillance boats; and (d) the research and development benefits for
disease control and prevention. Because the costs of the Coastal Zone Management component
have been included but not the benefits, the estimates of the Economic Rates of Return (ERRs) at
the provincial and project levels should be considered as the lower bound of the actual ERRs.

3.3.6    The production activities of the project (including mariculture, shrimp rehabilitation and
agro-processing) have high financial rates of return ranging from 11 to 35 percent, which are
financially profitable and attractive to the beneficiaries and project entities. The fiscal impact of
the project is desirable with the tax revenues generated by the agro-processing units (corporate
income tax at 33 percent). There has been a good track record of the local government budget
allocations to cover the operation and maintenance costs of the CZM centers.

3.4      Justification of the Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1    The relevance of the project objectives and design is high in some but not all aspects.
Outcomes are generally positive, but in many cases they are difficult to quantify. The efficiency
of project implementation has been high. The project's overall outcome rating is considered to be
"satisfactory". This takes into account the two project restructurings (in April 2004 and
November 2005), at the time when half of the financial resources for the project had been spent,
that were designed to expand the project area whilst keeping the investments financed completely
in line with the original design. The key performance indicators were highly qualitative in nature,
and the monitoring indicators only slightly less so, and were not altered by the restructurings.

3.5      Over-arching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

3.5.1    The project had no stated poverty alleviation objectives. Nevertheless, the project has
created employment for migrant laborers/rural poor, especially in processing opportunities, and
often for women. For example, in kelp processing in Lianjiang 1,200 seasonal jobs (mostly for
women) were available in just one village. Processing plants have employed 28,000 female
employees - around half of new employment positions. In many cases, aquaculture engages
women in the household to a greater extent than fishing, as this is closer to shore and more
regular work.

3.5.2    The profitability of aquaculture has been positive for the farmers across the project but
there is little information to assess the distribution effects (such as whether larger or smaller
farmers benefited more). The national policy changes on more stringent financial requirements,
particularly on collateral needs, which resulted in the scaling-down of the Marine Aquaculture
component in 2003, may also have excluded some smaller farmers with fewer assets for
substantive collaterals.

(b) Institutional Change and Strengthening

3.5.3    Coastal zone management is, in many aspects, about putting in place institutions with the
necessary policies, systems and capacities to implement effective regulations. The project has
indeed assisted the government putting in place plans and regulations for coastal zoning and
environmental and disease management of coastal aquaculture development. Staff from existing
concerned agencies in nearly all project provinces felt that the project experience in planning and
setting-up monitoring and reporting systems has strengthened environmental management
capacity and commitment. Project activities have also built up and strengthened inter-agency
coordination (between provincial and county Ocean and Fisheries Bureaus, and with Finance and
Planning Departments), and close relations and support with the national Ministry of Agriculture.

3.5.4    In addition, the high quality project management and procurement skills and processes
gained under the project (and in dealing with the Bank) were considered valuable in a more
general sense, and were applied to other county-level development activities, according to project
related staff in some of the provinces.




                                                    21

(c) Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.5    One unintended outcome is the increased safety at sea, where larger surveillance boats
have provided important rescue service for fishermen (e.g., in Xiangshang, the lives of 25
fishermen were saved in 2007). The 3D monitoring system covering the sea areas of Fujian is
further expected to strengthen this benefit.

3.5.6    Enterprises implementing sub-projects under Component 3 (Products Quality and Safety)
were (loosely) required, at completion of the sub-project, to supply at least 30 percent of the raw
material requirement from "cultured aquatic products" for the purpose of reducing the pressure on
capture fisheries. However, the unintended consequence of expanding the capacity of individual
processing plants would be that the overall pressure of aggregate process capacity on capture
fisheries would increase.

3.5.7    The passage of the national coastal management law by the People's Congress in 2002
was not an action planned under the project but there is evidence that the "demonstration effect"
of the project had a catalytic influence on the legislation.

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1    No surveys of project beneficiaries or stakeholder workshops were carried out.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

4.1.1    The development outcomes of the project have been (a) the adoption of coastal zone
management practices; (b) profitable investments in mariculture leading to increased incomes and
reduced pressure on resources; and (c) an improvement in the quality of processed seafood. The
risk that these outcomes will not be maintained is considered to be "negligible to low". The
assessment of the individual criteria of risk is shown in detail in Annex 10.

5.       Assessment of the Performance of the Bank and the Borrower

5.1      Bank

Ensuring Quality at Entry                  Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1    It is considered that there were moderate shortcomings in preparation and appraisal of the
project, and that the Bank's performance in ensuring the project's quality at entry was
"moderately satisfactory". These are mainly related to the broad specification of the development
objectives, the lack of specificity in the key performance indicators and the absence of
consideration of monitoring & evaluation (including the necessary base-line study), and the lack
of information on the functioning of credit. A detailed assessment of the Bank's performance in
ensuring quality at entry is shown in Annex 10.

5.1.2    The project had high strategic relevance; near-shore fishing and mariculture had been
identified by government as a key source of increase in food output, but at the same time there
were worsening problems of over-fishing, pollution, disease and declining catches and yields.
The approach adopted combined appropriate roles for the public sector in providing the
framework of incentives, legislation and penalties in a scientifically-researched knowledge base
concerning resources and limits to development. The technical approach to providing the



                                                  22

broadly-defined set of public goods that make up the framework of planning and control of
resource use was excellent, drawing on experience elsewhere in the world (particularly the state-
of-the-art approach of the USA). The performance of the Task Team in identifying the precise
areas for Bank engagement and its dialogue with the government was exemplary.

5.1.3   A weak point in preparation and appraisal was the apparent lack of critical assessment
made of the lower-level implementing agencies, which led in a limited number of cases to
inappropriate use of loan funds, misprocurement and failure to keep adequate records. A
relatively simple structure for implementation was adopted, but in the early years of the project it
became clear that some of the implementing agencies at the lower levels were ill-prepared to
participate.

 Quality of Supervision                    Rating: Satisfactory

.1.4    It is considered that there were minor shortcomings in the proactive identification of
opportunities and resolution of threats, and that the Bank's performance in supervision was
"satisfactory". An assessment of the Bank's performance in ensuring quality of supervision is
shown in Annex 10.

5.1.5   Bank supervision maintained a clear focus on the development impact of the project.
Since the aim of the project was to provide a framework for rational and sustainable use of
natural resources at the same time as increasing the production of seafood, a balance was
maintained between the public and private sector roles. However, supervision does not appear to
have given sufficient emphasis to the resolution of issues that are identified as having been
"quality at entry" issues, particularly those concerning M&E.

5.1.6   The project was technically complex and dispersed over the entire coast-line of China,
making supervision expensive and demanding in terms of staff time and commitment. The
supervision process benefited from the Bank's in-house technical expertise in coastal resource
management. The process of MTR and the first restructuring was drawn out over a long period,
for reasons beyond the control of the Bank's supervision team. In later years of project
implementation, the supervision budget was insufficient to provide the full range of technical
expertise through consultants that was required.

 5.1.7 There appears to have been a tendency to be slightly more optimistic than the facts on the
ground warranted. At no point in the ISR sequence was the Development Objective (DO) rating
less than "satisfactory", and in only two reporting periods was the Implementation Progress (IP)
rating defined as "unsatisfactory" or "moderately unsatisfactory". As pointed out in QSA7, a
"moderately unsatisfactory" rating for the IP would have been more accurate in FY2004, given
the problems faced by the project and the imminent need for its restructuring, and a "moderately
satisfactory" rating would probably have been in order for FY2005, given the slow progress made
in implementing the restructuring program. QSA7 also felt that ISRs were not specifying key
actions to be taken by management, and that management comments were often rather
perfunctory.

Overall Bank Performance                   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3   On the basis of the ratings for ensuring quality at entry and for the quality of supervision,
the Bank's overall performance rating is considered to be "moderately satisfactory".




                                                 23

5.2     Borrower

Government Performance                      Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1   There were minor shortcomings in the performance of the government in the preparation
and implementation of the project. A detailed assessment of the government's performance is
shown in Annex 10.

5.2.2   The willingness of provincial and lower-tier governments to borrow IBRD funds for
environmental monitoring and control was a strong indication that coastal zone management was
seen as a high priority. Consultation in the early phases of project preparation led to a number of
changes in its scope. Coastal zone management was emphasized when the government realized
the strong need felt by all concerned for more effective planning mechanisms.

5.2.3   More could undoubtedly have been done to improve the project's readiness for
implementation, and this is a responsibility shared by the Bank and by both central and devolved
levels of government. The component parts of the implementation structure should have been
better prepared in terms of training with, for example, an operational manual, financial
management manual, procurement training, more detailed procedures for credit on-lending and a
proper monitoring and evaluation framework (including base-line studies). The monitoring and
evaluation arrangements were not properly defined at preparation. There were no base-line
studies to give an accurate picture of the initial conditions.

  Implementing Agencies Performance                         Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.4   There were significant differences in the performance of the individual implementing
agencies. Overall, there were minor shortcomings in their performance, which is considered to
have been "satisfactory". An assessment of the individual criteria underlying the implementing
agencies' performance is shown in Annex 10.

5.2.5     In terms of the level of commitment to achieving the PDOs, the willingness of
provincial and lower-tier governments to borrow IBRD funds for environmental monitoring and
control was a strong indication that coastal zone management was seen as a high priority. In
considering the project's readiness for implementation, it appears that in the earliest years of the
project, at least, there was a great deal of "learning by doing" with the inevitable mistakes that
occur when such an approach is adopted. More could undoubtedly have been done to improve
the project's readiness for implementation (a responsibility shared by the Bank and by both
central and devolved levels of government). The component parts of the implementation
structure should have been better prepared in terms of training with, for example, an operational
manual, financial management manual, procurement training, more detailed procedures for credit
on-lending and a proper monitoring and evaluation framework (including base-line studies).

5.2.6   There were numerous issues with procurement including two instances of
misprocurement, one early in the project's life and one shortly before Loan closing, that required
the return of funds and cancellations. Although the problems with procurement were more
pronounced in the early years of project implementation, and were in part the result of
unfamiliarity with the Bank's procedures, they continued intermittently throughout the project's
life.

5.2.6   The monitoring and evaluation arrangements were not defined at preparation. There
were no base-line studies to give an accurate picture of the initial conditions. The M&E systems
created under the project largely used existing staffs and reporting mechanisms; basic reporting
on the progress of implementation was adequate, though there were some difficulties with timely
reporting from some areas early on in the project as they learned about new procedures, as well as
undergoing administrative changes (at the MTR). Generally, the monitoring focused on inputs
and quantifiable physical outputs.

Overall Borrower Performance                      Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3   There were minor shortcomings in the performance of the government and the
implementing agencies, and the overall performance is considered to have been "satisfactory".

6.      Lessons Learned

6.1.1   Fast responses are needed to China's fast-changing market conditions at project
preparation, start-up and restructuring. Devolution of decision-making and ensuring procurement
can be done as simply as possible are essential, while maintaining accountability.

6.1.2   In parallel with this, the focus of monitoring should be on fewer and more outcome-
oriented supervision/review missions, at least through the later part of a project.

6.1.3   Detailed technical supervision is highly appreciated as part of the package of working
with the Bank, and provides an important, marketable "quality stamp" to activities. However,
technical support should also be increasingly entrusted in the course of the project to sharing
among regions and the increasing high-level technical expertise within the country.

6.1.4   CZM activities offer valuable direct lessons to local authorities on inter-agency
coordination. That work under such projects takes somewhat longer than single-sector projects
should therefore be adequately recognized and appreciated.

6.1.5   Strengthening sustainable development in coastal areas is a continuing issue for China,
with pressures on the resources likely to increase further. There is still room for major funding of
public goods but this may need greater grant or soft loan finance, also considering the learning,
pioneering, innovation and adaptive management aspects of such work.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.       The output indicators were inconsistently presented between the log-frame and the table
on indicators (PAD Annex 1 and 1A). A table of core outputs is provided below that draws on
these and the PAD text indicators, and summarizes quantitative data provided to ICR mission and
mission observations. Outputs and their indicators were not formally revised at any point, except
as can be deduced as arising from cost reallocations. Thus, for example, there is not a clear
indication on whether coastal zone planning, zoning, regulatory or capacity-building output
targets (in line with Annex 1A) were expected in new project areas after restructuring in 2004 and
200522.

2.       Quantitative reporting of achievements of output targets was more systematic in terms of
physical activities compared to `soft' outputs (for example, the number of CZM centers
constructed) rather than how operational they are or what useful information they produce.
Similarly, the degree to which the project has contributed directly to outputs, as opposed to other
government programs and initiatives, is not always clear. Nevertheless, the Borrower's
Completion Report and presentations during the ICR mission provided some descriptive
summaries of more qualitative achievements.

Overview

3.       The restructurings of 2004/2005 resulted in a reallocation to new Provinces (primarily
from unspent allocations in Fujian, Nantong and Xiamen) and also a shift of efforts between
components, largely from aquaculture to developing more CZM centers and seafood processing,
setting up a 3D marine monitoring system, and new public waste-water treatment plants. A
change in MOF's on-lending policies soon after Loan Effectiveness meant that more stringent
collaterals had to be met, which made it difficult for many farmers to access loans from the
aquaculture component. In the case of Nantong, the construction of facilities was completed at
the inception stages of the project and with local counterpart funds (without the need for Bank
funds).

4.       Nevertheless, as can be seen from the table of outputs below, after restructuring, in nearly
all cases, the project completed or exceeded its quantitative output targets by March 2008. While
some of the monitoring centers, waste-water treatment plants and the major new seafood
wholesale market in Xiangshan were not yet in operation at that date, based on previous records
these can be expected to become operational quickly once completed, as counterpart budget and
staffing have been allocated. In summary, the findings in relation to project outputs by
component are the following:

5.       Component 1 - Coastal Zone Management. Inter-departmental "Leading Groups" for
CZM were set up in project areas, actively involved in providing project guidance and managing
the CZM planning and regulatory development process. Regulation and coastal zoning was done
in project areas either under the project or under the 2002 national "Law on Marine Resource of
the People's Republic of China". For example the "Provisions of Fujian Province for Use and
Management of Sea Areas" and "Regulation of Hebei Province for Sea Management" have been
established in the respective Provinces.

6.       The setting-up of CZM administrative and monitoring centers (for fisheries environment
and aquaculture diseases) and related facilities was completed according to restructured targets
(with 95 percent of allocated funds according to restructured budget having been spent).
Spending on this component reached over 250 percent of the PAD target, with new centers in
new project provinces, and also individual centers up-graded, as well as the 3D monitoring
system set up in Fujian. Those centers established for some time were staffed and with operating
budget, and seeking national certification (i.e., to ensure their laboratory test results would be
legal in court). Over 1,000 staff have been trained in-country on sustainable aquaculture
technology and disease control. While the physical targets for CZM and monitoring centers and
public waste-water treatment plants have been almost completed, some are not yet fully
operational. The completion of two waste-water treatment plants in Penglai was delayed by
unforeseen problems with foundations, and these were being tested in March 2008.

7.       Three large surveillance boats have been acquired and are fully operational. They were
bought at a cost some 25 percent lower than expected in the PAD. They have been highly active-
in enforcing China's new stringent regulations on marine fisheries, where no vessels of adequate
size or speed were available before. Generally, the quality of construction and equipment,
including the 3D sea monitoring system and surveillance boats, has been to high quality
standards. Excellent public display facilities are available in Xiangshan and Penglai. The Fujian
fishery monitoring and Xiamen disease monitoring centers have been recognized nationally for
their high standards. The 3D marine real-time monitoring center is the first in China.

8.       The planting of the coastal forest belt planned for Nantong at the beginning of the project
was reallocated, as it was undertaken with local funds instead. After restructuring in 2005, pilot
mangrove forestation was included in the project in Fanchgenggang, Guanxi province, in
conjunction with a Mangrove Research and Demonstration Center.

9.       Component 2 - Marine Aquaculture Marine aquaculture sub-loans were fully
disbursed, and units operational according to the restructured output targets, and all related
budget has been used. Many fish cage farmers (over 2,000 in Fujian alone) were trained on new
culture techniques. Hatcheries have been providing seed and brood-stock to farms, and to a lesser
degree for re-stocking to the wild. Many of the technologies were new in the areas, and even
where funding was not sufficient or suitable through the project, considerable innovation and
promotion of new techniques will have contributed to the considerable up-take on a large scale of
more sustainable aquaculture systems (with more integration, lower trophic levels, fewer inputs).

10.      While it remained the largest item in the project, final spending on this component was
only 60 percent of the original target because of reduced absorption of sub-loans by farmers
(mainly shellfish and algae rather than fish cages) and hatcheries. This was largely due to a new
MOF policy implemented shortly after Loan Effectiveness with stricter collateral requirements.
Many attempts were made on the project management side to address this, without much
progress, hence the need for restructuring. Severe typhoons, a common feature in the area,
affected some production cycles, though not so severely as to impact on project efficiency.

11.      Component 3 - Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation The project met its restructured target for
shrimp-related activities for piloting more disease-resistant systems, though this was drastically
scaled back to less than 6 percent of the PAD targets, as lending from this component was
unattractive.

12.      Component 4 - Products Quality and Safety The target number of facilities was
slightly increased after the MTR but individual loans were larger and almost twice the amount


                                                  29

projected in the PAD was actually spent. The restructured targets for improving seafood
processing and marketing facilities was largely reached and 90 percent of allocated funds were
spent. Not all the specified companies identified in the PAD opted for project loans, as other
financing arrangements were becoming more attractive during the project period, but other
private processors in new provinces did join. Further expansion of the facilities by early starting
companies also took place. Waste-water treatment facilities were included on the premises
where necessitated by construction and up-grading. Extensive technical training, technical
support and supervision were provided throughout the project.

13.      The market facility in Xiangshan was under construction in March 2008, but close to
completion. It will be one of Asia's largest seafood wholesale markets and serve one of China's
major fishing fleets.

14.      Consultants and overseas tours The consultant, study tour and training support
activities to other components, forming only a small part of the project, were slightly under-spent
and targets under-met in terms of restructuring and PAD targets (70-80 percent). While no
specific report with an overview of training and capacity-building activities was provided, the
activities were generally considered by project staff as having been effective and useful. Over
200 staff received international exposure on overseas study tours (for example, to the US, Japan,
France and Germany) and many more staff, aquaculturists and processors were given domestic
training.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A.      Introduction

1.      This annex re-analyzes the financial and economic rates of return (FRRs and ERRs)
calculated at appraisal using actual and/or up-dated prices, actual project costs and the latest
projections of future benefits. The methodology adopted follows, by and large, that used at
appraisal. The accuracy of estimates has been improved by using actual data and better
projections of benefits compared to those at appraisal. In the analysis, actual project costs were
derived from PMO records while future projections were based on the performance of current
operations. The data for the analysis were collected by the consultant recruited by the CPMO,
who travelled to all the project provinces during June 2007 - February 2008. Those data were
further verified during the ICR mission and the ICR workshop in March - April 2008.

B.      Project Benefits

2.      The major quantifiable benefits of the project (on an incremental basis) are derived from:
(a) the aquacultural products generated under the Sustainable Marine Aquaculture component; (b)
shrimp production from the Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation component; (c) outputs from aqua-
cultural product processing and the value-added from improved marketing from the Products
Quality and Safety component.

3.      Other significant benefits not included in the analysis because of the difficulties in
quantification are those generated from the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) component, which
among others include: (a) the existence value from the protection of endangered species; (b) the
reduction in sea water intrusion and the enhancement of productivity of marine fishery products
by the mangrove forests; (c) the avoidance of losses due to rational resource use and protection
from coastal management centers and surveillance boats; and (d) research and development
benefits from disease control and prevention.

C.      Financial Analysis

3.      Financial analysis for household-based mariculture and shrimp pond rehabilitation was
undertaken using one-hectare models under "with project" and "without project" situations, while
for processing units the enterprise model was developed to assess incremental returns.
Investment costs for technical and institutional strengthening were not included as these were
provided to farmers at no cost to them as public goods. Investment and operating costs are valued
at 2007 market prices, while the prices for various aquacultural products, given their varieties and
fluctuations between seasons and years, were "weighted average" based on the farmer interviews
field surveys.

4.      The Marine Aquaculture Component covers a large scope of aquaculture production
including fish, shell fish, shrimp, seaweeds and hatcheries. The fish cage culture was introduced
using fingerings produced from artificial breeding and hatching. The production of shellfish uses
the shallow waters and is highly productive as it needs very little inputs such as feed or fertilizer.
Sea weed production includes kelp, red hair algae and laver. The hatcheries financed by the
project produced seeds and fries not only for the productive component under the project but also
for much wider areas not covered by the project. Shrimp rehabilitation covered mostly those
unused ponds that had suffered from the shrimp disease. Various production alternatives have
been be tested, including the so-called "Thai-Model", to select new cultivation technologies. For
the above-mentioned aquacultural production, individual area models on a one-hectare basis were


                                                 33

developed. It should be noted that most of these activities have been in operation for over eight
years, close to the economic life assumed in the PAD. As a result of the large varieties of the
products and the poly-culture techniques adopted by the project, both the inputs and output prices
were based on the "averages" obtained from farm interviews/field surveys, supported by local
statistics.

6.       Based on above, the financial analysis shows that most productive models (including
hatcheries) have achieved FRRs ranging from 11 to 35 percent, which are in general financially
attractive to the beneficiaries.

5.       Aquaculture product processing and improved marketing facilities: Enterprise
models were developed to gauge the financial viability of the processing units and wholesale
markets. Investment costs include civil works (land preparation and buildings), equipment and
vehicles. Operating costs include variable costs for raw materials, packing, utilities, and workers
salaries and social security; fixed costs for office overheads, insurance, and maintenance of
buildings, equipment and vehicles; and marketing costs. Financial analyses were undertaken for
all the enterprises individually on the basis of present and projected production, investments and
operating costs. The major assumptions for financial analysis were: (a) in line with the prevailing
practice for agro-processing enterprises, project life was assumed to be 20 years; (b) investment
costs used in the analysis were based on actual costs incurred, including procurement and
installation of equipment and training; (c) the residual value of fixed assets is estimated at 5
percent of book value and considered as a cash in-flow at the end of project life; (d) revenues
were derived from sales generated from operating at the capacity levels achieved in past years
and projected values for future sales; (e) the operating costs were derived from the costs of raw
materials, labor, utilities, marketing and administrative expenses; (f) Incremental working capital
was included in the cash flow analysis and calculated on the basis of capacity utilization and
current assets and liabilities as projected by managers; (g) agro-processing is VAT-exempt, whilst
corporate income tax is 33 percent of taxable income: depreciation (as an income tax relief) was
calculated using the straight line method; and (h) capacity utilization for years in operation is that
actually achieved, whilst future projections were provided by factory managers. Although an
attempt was made to derive financial models for wholesale markets along similar lines to
processing units, the data available were less detailed.

6.       Based on the approach and assumptions above, the FRRs calculated from the net cash
flows after tax for processing units and wholesale market are estimated at between 11-25 percent,
which are in general considered to be financially successful.

D.       Economic Analysis

7.       As stated above, the analysis does not include the benefits generated by the Coastal Zone
Management component, which are difficult to quantify. However, all the project costs,
including those for the Coastal Zone Management component (accounting for 22 percent of the
total project costs) are included in the economic analysis. The project costs used in the analysis
were based on actual costs incurred by the component and by province, with both cost and benefit
flows in 2007 constant prices. No adjustments were made between financial and economic prices
as (a) a large number of aquacultural products have been mainly for domestic markets and no
published comparable international prices available to calculate "parity prices"; (b) the economy
of China during the period of project implementation, particularly since its accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, has been increasingly integrated into the world economy and
it is generally acknowledged that the economy has achieved "market status". Therefore, the input
and output market prices basically reflect actual export and import parity prices for traded


                                                   34

products of identical varieties and quality. As such, the financial prices are used as "proxies" for
economic prices. Similarly, no further adjustments are made to the prices of non-tradable farm
inputs and outputs, as the Chinese currency has been under pressure to appreciate; the foreign
exchange premium is therefore not relevant in China now.

8.       For processing units and enterprise-based farming activities, the FIRR before tax and
financing, which measures the return on the total resources engaged, has been treated as the ERR.
No further adjustments are made to the cash flows of household-based fish farming, which is
exempted from taxes.

9.       Most of the hatcheries financed under the project have produced seed for the production
components. As seeds and fries are an intermediate output, which have no direct economic
benefit, the economic benefits arise from the production of the final product and are therefore
incorporated in the benefit calculations of the mariculture/aquaculture components. However, for
the provinces which have only hatcheries but no production activities, the benefits from hatchery
were included in the analysis.

10.      Economic analysis has been carried out for each province and for the project as a whole.
The ERR calculation takes into account all incremental benefits and costs (including investment
costs for project management and agricultural services and extension) in an aggregated economic
cash flow, in line with the physical achievements for each component by province. The overall
ERR for the project as a whole is calculated by aggregating the net cash flows of individual
components by province (see table below).

Note: Figures in parenthesis are the ERRs estimated at appraisal. Economic analysis was not applicable in the case of
Xiamen because it only invested in CZM under the project for which the benefits were not estimated.

11.      The notable difference in ERRs between provinces is largely caused by the different
proportions between CZM costs and the productive components costs. Both Hebei and Guangxi
provinces have made relatively large investments in CZM, for which the benefits were not


                                                         35

quantified; while Jiangsu province tops the ERR list, as it has made no investment from the
project for CZM. The ERRs indicate the economic viability of the project by province and as a
whole.

12.     No sensitivity analysis was conducted for the following reasons: (a) on the costs side, the
analysis included the total project costs, of which CZM accounted for 22 percent; while on
benefits side the analysis only included the quantifiable benefits for productive components
(accounting for 78 percent of the total costs); (b) all the data for mariculture and shrimp
production components (accounting for about 60 percent of total costs for all productive
components) were mostly actual as those two components have been in operation for more than
eight years out of the assumed 10 years economic life; and (c) the future benefits of processing
units were based on very conservative estimates made by the management.

13.     On fiscal aspect, the O&M costs of CZM centers including the surveillance boats have
been adequately covered by local government budget allocations; and the government has
collected tax revenues (corporate income tax rate at 33 percent) from processing units and
enterprise-based fish farming.

14. Detailed calculations for financial and economic analysis (by product and by province) are
contained in the Excel file "Financial and Economic Analysis". (See Annex 9: List of Supporting
Documents).

Re: the Draft Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for China Sustainable Coastal
Resources Development Project (SCRDP)


This is to acknowledge that we have been in receipt of the draft Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) for China Sustainable Coastal Resources Development Project
(SCRDP) prepared by the ICR preparation mission, and we have following comments.

The draft ICR has been carefully reviewed by all major stakeholders, i.e. the relevant
central administrations, project provinces and the Central PMO. We believe the Bank's
ICR preparation mission has, in full cooperation with our party, taken careful and
successful evaluation to project implementation, and the draft ICR has adequately and
fairly assessed the project implementation process and the overall project
accomplishments.

We will continue to draw project experiences for further extension and demonstration to
promote scientific utilization and sustainable development of Chinese coastal resources.

Best regards

      Implementation Completion Report (ICR) On China Sustainable Coastal Resource
              Development Project (SCRDP) of People's Republic of China (PRC)


            Prepared by Foreign Economic Cooperation Center (FECC) of MOA, PRC
                                            March, 2008



I. Project Background, Development Objective and Design

1. Project context
Since the reform & opening-up drive, rapidly increased economic scale and improved standard of
living of the people in the coastal areas had put heavy pressure on the limited coastal resources
while coastal zone management (CZM) got increasingly deteriorating. The Government faced a
severe challenge, i.e. how to secure consistency of achieving ambitious objective of economic
growth and realizing long-term sustainable development & environmental protection. Thus, the
Chinese Government asked, in mid-1990's, the World Bank to finance a sustainable coastal
resource development project in a number of coastal provinces so as to establish marine & fishery
resource & environmental monitoring network, to enhance coastal zone management, to
strengthening healthy hatchering/breeding and to undertake research of disease prevention &
control technology, extend healthy cultivation technology and improve sea-food quality & safety
and to promote sustainable development of marine & fishery economy.

2. Project objectives
Project objectives are i) supporting the commitment of the Chinese Government to sustainable
coastal resource development in China; ii) reducing the pressure on coastal fishery resources; and
iii) helping improve sea-food quality.

3. Project components
The Project covers 4 components, including i) CZM; ii) marine aquaculture; iii) shrimp-pond
rehabilitation and iv) sea-food quality and safety. For details, see PAD.

4. Project contents after mid-term review (MTR) (adjustment)
MTR was carried out in August, 2003. Nantong city, Jiangsu Province, and some of the sub-
projects in Fujian Province were canceled due to major change in the economic climate at home
while 3 new project areas (Fangchengang city, Guangxi Zhuangzu Autonomous Region,
Xiangshan country, Ningbo city, and Tangshan city, Hebei Province) were added. For details, see
WB restructuring/supervision mission AM of August, 2003.

5Project beneficiaries
This project (SCRDP) has directly benefited farmers and fish men in the project areas of 7 coastal
provinces in China through increased income and ensuring sustainable utilization of local coastal
resources. According to preliminary statistics, there have been 39970 farmers and fish men that
have directly benefited from the Project with provision of 62186 job opportunities.

II. Key Factors Affecting Implementation & Results

1. Project quality at the time of project preparation, design and establishment
Project preparation, design and establishment coincided with the period when China's marine &
fishery economy was growing rapidly. However, there were weak links existing in the fields of
marine & fishery environmental monitory, aquatic biological disease control network,
development of healthy hachering system, and sea food quality & safety, which posed a pressing
need for improvement & upgrading. It was on the basis of the then status of China coastal
resource development and the pressing requirements that this Project was designed; it was in
keeping with the Government's decision on the industrial policy for agriculture foundation and on
sustainable development & use of resources, so was it in line with China's planning for marine &
fishery economic development. The Government committed that the project organizational
structure and fiscal support in particular tallied with the reality while the project risk assessment
took into full consideration possible changes in the state's industrial policy, and international &
domestic economic climate; good anticipation of natural disasters was made, thus providing a
solid foundation for smooth implementation of the Project

2 Major changes in the stage of project implementation
Given the reasons in many aspects, an overall adjustment of the project areas and project
components and design were carried out in August, 2003. Project regions and components upon
adjustment being made even more met the need for China's coastal resource conservation,
development & use under the new situation, and reinforced conservation & use efficiency of
coastal resources, resulting in providing demonstration for development & use of coastal
resources in other non-project areas.

3. Project performance
Through almost ten years of project construction, various components as determined in PAD have
been basically completed, achieving the intended objectives.

(1) Main policies and institutional reform
A. Establishment of CZM system. Firstly, organizational structure for CZM has got enhanced
while leading groups for and functions of institutions/offices of CZM have been further
reinforced and improved in various localities. Secondly, sound marine environmental monitoring
networks have been established and perfected, forming effective networks that have been
monitoring and watching the key terrestrial-sourced sewage outfall in near-shore sea areas, main
estuaries into seas, marine protected areas (reserves), key bathing beaches, priority harbors &
gulfs, important aquaculture areas and red-tide areas etc., prepared and put out the bulletins on
marine & fishery environmental quality on regular basis, and provided services for production &
livelihood of the masses. Thirdly, aquaculture disease observation & reporting and disaster
prevention & mitigation systems have been set up with a view of ensuring safe production &
marine operation with the broad fish men. Fourthly, establishment of the marine protected areas
has protected aquatic wildlife resources & environment for their survival as well as biodiversity
in the relevant sea areas ­ rendering great service for the contemporary era and delivering
benefits for centuries.


                                                   43

B Helping reinforce the current laws & regulations for marine environmental protection and
develop new ones. Firstly, the Project has facilitated the provinces concerned in formulation &
further improvement of the planning for protection of marine eco-environment. Secondly, a series
of policies and statures/regulations on conservation & use of coastal resources have been
introduced, being early or late, based on local conditions, e.g. "Provisions of Fujian Province for
use and management of sea areas", "Regulation of Fujian Province for marine environmental
protection", "Provisions for keeping & protection of bio-resources in Bo Sea", and "Regulation of
Hebei Province for sea area management" etc.

(2) Construction contents in kind completed
A. CZM: under the Project have been built 4 CZM centers, 5 monitoring centers (stations), 5
    disease control centers (stations), 3 surveillance boats, 1 real-time 3-D environmental
    monitoring system, 2 marine reserves (centers), 2 WWT plants; plantation of 2307 ha of
    mangrove & forest belts, realizing an investment of 348.39 million yuan, representing 95.7 %
    of the adjusted objective.
B. Marine aquaculture: establishment of 220 units of cage (sea water) fish farming (200
    cages/unit); 6083 mu of shell-fish culture, 278 ha of algae cultivation, 13 hatcheries, 4
    commercialized fish-rearing farms, realizing an investment of 642.4 million yuan, accounting
    for 100.4 5 of MTR objective.
C. Shrimp production rehabilitation: 79 ha have been converted into new shrimp pond,
    re4alizing an investment of 5.46 million yuan, taking up 101.1 % of MTR objective.
D. Aquatic quality & safety: under the project have been established 18 sea food processing
    plants, 2 sea food wholesale markets, realizing an investment of 511 million yuan, occupying
    90.4 % of MTR objective.
E. Training/study tour and technical consulting: realizing an investment of 10.2 million yuan,
    accounting for 70.7 % of MTR objective.

The Project has completed an accumulative fixed asset investment of Rmb 1.517 billion yuan,
accounting for 95.5 % of the adjusted objective, of which 730 million yuan ($89.45 million) from
the World Bank was used, representing 91.0 % of the adjusted objective, and counterpart fund
used stood at 787 mil. Yuan, occupying 99.9 % of the adjusted objective; of which the
Government contributed 214 mil. Yuan, and self-raising by the project units stood at 573 mil.
Yuan. For details of construction contents in kind (material) under the Project and financing, see
attached tables 1 & 2.

4. Key factors affecting the project implementation
(1) Affecting factors beyond the control of the Government & project implementing units
(PIU)
A. Market and Price. With the continued development of aquatic production, the phenomenon of
supply outstripping demand was getting evident. Disorderly expansion of aquatic-rearing scale
with some species has led to acute competition in market place and price fell sharply. Expected
benefit for part of aquaculture items went down.

B. Change in Banks' rate of interest. Applied to the Bank's loan was LIBOR, which has
experienced big change , subject to regulation & control of international financial market. The
rate of interest went up to 6.99 % in 1999 when the project implementation was in early stage,
exceeding the rate of interest for loans from domestic commercial banks by approximate 2
percentage points. The advantage of low interest with the Bank loan no longer existed in
consideration of additional commitment fee and foreign exchange risk, hence affecting
motivation of project units to use the Bank loan.


                                                  44

C. Natural disaster. South China coast, Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and
Guangxi Zhueng Zu Autonomous Region etc. are typhoon-prone areas. To some extent,
implementation of the Project was affected because of the frontal hitting by a number of typhoon
such as "Feiyan", "Bilisi" and "Shenlaka" etc., thus reducing the project benefit.

(2) Affecting factors within control of the Government
A Macro economic policies. The first was the national macro economic policy. The Government
has attached close attention to the issues of "Sannong" (agriculture, farmers & rural area), Not
only does it advocate balanced social development in rural areas, and cut burden on farmers
through exemption of agricultural tax, but also has developed a series of policies/measures in
support of agricultural development. The Government has also assisted production of agro-
produce in leading production areas, supported efficient & quality eco-agriculture and improved
economic efficiency and pushed ahead with sustainable agricultural development. The second
was local strategies for economic growth. The government of Xiemen city has shifted its
development strategy from encouraging aquaculture to putting focus on protection of marine
ecology and rational use of sea area resources and to major adjustment of urban planning and
Government's planning for marine functions, and large-scale shell-fish and jelly-fish farming was
hindered in Hebei Province due to the discovery of an oilfield with big reserve in Tangshan area
in 2006, which forced both Xiemen city and Hebei Province to readjust the projects.

B. Department policies. The relevant government departments at various levels have rendered
great help and policy support to the construction and operation of the Project. Local DRC and
finance bureaus have provided counterpart funding required for the project whereas fishery
departments have offered management & technical services to the project implementation.

C. Counterpart fund. There was certain difficulty encountered in putting in place the counterpart
fund as committed by the governments and obtaining banks' loan as a result of longer period of
project preparation and of local finance strain and the changes taking place in the operational
system of the banks. However, with the big efforts of the governments and project management
agencies at various levels, the counterpart fund from the government finance has by and large
been put in full amount in place, but commercial banks were reluctant to grant loan to aquatic
projects so some of fish men and private owners failed to get loan, which affected the project
implementation.

D. Coordination among departments. As there were more project management agencies involved
in some project areas and things were viewed from perspectives of their respective & different
work, lack of consistency was found in thinking, causing inadequate coordination in the work of
various departments and producing certain impact on smooth implementation of the Project.

(3) Affecting factors within control of project units
A. Project management organization (PMO). The Project was constructed just at the very critical
    period for China market & economic development and for institutional reform, leading to a
    bigger change in the personnel at different levels of government bodies. Nevertheless, as
    requested by CPMO, staff of PMOs at provincial, municipal & county levels have basically
    been kept stable, which ensured the smooth unfolding of the project implementation work.

B. Project participants. All participants in the Project have played due roles in the project
    construction. PMOs at the central and various levels have fully performed the functions of
    decision-making and management. Through their own channels like professional
    associations, the project beneficiaries took part in the project design and management. But, as


                                                 45

    constrained in many areas such as market information and experience accumulation, one has
    seen such a phenomenon, that is that coastal farmers/fish men were involved in farming of
    the same species, but with different results generated. In most cases, processing sub-projects
    were undertaken by family-type private owners, and they differed from each other in terms of
    economic base, management ability and mode of operations, so there has been a big disparity
    in the outcome/efficiency obtained.

5. Monitoring and evaluation design, implementation and application
(1) Monitoring and evaluation design. For details, se PAD.

(2) Implementation and application. As requested in PAD, project units carried out monitoring
and evaluation of the project, and consolidated and analyzed monitoring & evaluation data on
semi-annual basis. Through monitory of the key indicators under the project, they had a quite
good handle on the progress of the project implementation, deviations and results, which guided
them to make timely adjustment and push ahead with the project construction as planned.
Accumulated monitoring information has provided basis for assessment of the project design,
analysis of the project outcome and summery of the experience and lessons. This was true not
only in the period of project construction, but has played an important role in effective operation
of the project upon completion.

6. Safeguard and finance and procurement in conformity with the Bank's requirements.
(1) National policy safeguard. The State has provided tremendous support to the implementation
of the Bank-financed project. The commitments of the Chinese Government made in the project
loan agreement and appraisal report have largely been realized.

(2) Financial activities. As required in the "Provisions for financial management of the World
Bank-financed projects" issued by MOF, the project units are staffed with competent financial
personnel along with establishment of special account. A unified project fund management,
accounting practices and method of fund withdrawal/reimbursement are adopted coupled with
establishment and maintenance of unified & complete records and account archive.

(3)     Procurement activities. In line with the requirements of "World Bank Procurement
Guidelines", procurement activities under the Project have been organized and undertaken.

7. Post-completion activities and Next step
The State's strategic objective of "initiating marine ecological protection", the regulations for
marine & fishery management, and its policy on development of marine industry provide policy
safeguard for sustainable development of the Project.

(1)     Management organization. The current PMOs at various levels will be kept in transition
upon project completion while finance departments at various levels will also provide certain
fund for operations and management of the project with an aim to insure continued operation &
management of the project.
(2)     Supporting services. After project completion, governments and sectoral management
agencies at different levels will continue fostering & supporting the operation of the service
system, offering guidance to the project units on timely adjustment of fish varieties and business
orientation, and continue supervising and managing technical training & operation for the project,
in order to provide full service to farmers and fish men in the project areas.
(3)     Follow-up project. Public goods under the proposed project takes up a big chunk while
fund allocation from the local finance is limited, and sources of fund like receiving grant etc
remain uncertain. In order for the said project to give free rein to greater social & ecologic benefit


                                                  46

and sustainable development, China SCRDP Phase II to be financed by the Bank should be
implemented as soon as possible, with proper provision of financial assistance gratis with a view
of enhancing the project sustainability.
(4)     Loan release & recovery. A mechanism of release and recovery of loan proceeds that are
due be established in order to ensure use efficiency of the recovered fund.

III. Evaluation of the results

1. Correlation of objectives, design and implementation
The project being designed as per the project objectives, investment in CZM, aquaculture and
sea-food quality & safety etc. is in keeping with the project objectives and things have been
undertaken in the implementation process strictly in accordance with the project design.

2. Realization of the development objective under the Project
(1) Economic:
A. Project total output, output value and net revenue. The project has generated increased
    production of 346164 tons ( of which cultured production was 279197 tons and processed
    output 66937 tons); cultivation of 973.5 tons of a variety of brood & seed stock (like sea-
    cucumber & jelly fish etc.) , rearing of 1.05 billion fries/fingering of jellyfish & precious
    fish, realizing an output value of Rmb 2.17 billion yuan and a profit of 529 million yuan.

B. Annual per capita net income with the project farmers/fish men. Through the project
    implementation, 39970 farmer households in the project areas have registered increased
    income. At present, Farmers/fishmen annual per capita net income in the project area has
    risen from 4642 yuan before the project launch (1998) to 7426 yuan (2007), of which the
    revenue from aquaculture went up from 2044 yuan before the project launch to 4679 yuan,
    128.9 % up over that before the commencing of the project., with its share (from aquaculture-
    - translator) in their total annual net income being increased from 44 % before the project to
    the current 63 %.

C. Economic rate of return. Findings from the analysis of economic & financial benefits show
    that its economic rate of return is 34.9 %, and its financial rate of return 30.3 %, both
    achieving the appraisal objective.

(2) Social aspect
A. Promoting the legislation on coastal resource management in the project provinces (region).
    During the project implementation, Fujian and Hebei provinces initiated, being early or late, a
    series of policies on and regulations for conservation and development of coastal resources,
    thus providing a sound policy climate for sustainable development of coastal economy, and
    strongly promoting sustainable development and utilization of China's coastal resources and
    healthy development of the associated industries.

B. Providing a lot of job opportunities to farmers/fish men. The pace of industrial restructuring
    and migration of rural surplus labor in the project areas has been picking up. Approximate
    100 000 labor in the project areas participated in the construction of infrastructure, with
    39970 farmers/fish men in the project areas having benefited directly from the Project. The
    Project offered 62189 jobs to the rural surplus labor. At the same time, Spurred by the
    Project, the project areas have witnessed rapid economic development. There have been more
    and more farmers/fish men that have embarked on aquaculture, aquatic product processing,
    which makes contribution to migration of rural labor, increased income with fish men,
    poverty elimination & getting rich and stable social security.


                                                  47

C. Creating jobs for women, increasing their income and uplifting their social status and
   facilitating the development of a harmonious society. In the project construction, women
   have been the main participants, and over 40 % of the women took part in the activities in the
   field of the project infrastructure; and over 50 % of the trainees were women in the project
   training. Over 20 % of the female representatives in the project implementation groups at
   village level were involved in the project selection and planning. Under the Project, the
   processing plants have hired about 28 000 female employees engaged in sea-food processing.

D. Increasing sectoral competitiveness. The project implementation has eased financial
   constrains & bottleneck internally within this sector, and to a large extent pushed China
   marine aquaculture to move towards high-quality and getting a scale. The implementation of
   sea-food processing component has accelerated the shift from crude (coarse) processing to
   refined & deep one. In particular, bringing in HACCP and European standard has been
   instrumental in improving sea-food quality in China and facilitated China's sea-food
   processing to be integrated with the international market.

E. Enhancing the tools and capability of China for CZM and fishery disaster prevention &
    mitigation. In terms of capacity building for CZM and fishery disaster prevention &
    mitigation, the project has put an accumulative investment of Rmb 348.4 mil. Yuan in fixed
    asset, resulting in initial establishment of CZM and fishery disaster prevention & mitigation
    system.

F. Developing a group of managerial people who have got familiar with the World Bank
    operations. Through about 10 years of implementation of the Bank-financed project, A large
    number of managerial personnel at provincial, municipal and county levels familiar with the
    Bank's operations have been trained and tempered, building up human resource for smooth
    launch of future projects.

(3) Ecologic aspect
A. Pushing forward with execution of comprehensive CZM plans, strengthening fish boat
    management over sea area, improving ability for law enforcement on the sea. Building and
    use of surveillance boats under CZM component has presented deterrence to law-breaking &
    offensive acts and effectively held back jeopardizing marine resources and eco-system,
    playing positive role in keeping a balance between orderly production order of fishery and
    fishery ecology. Establishment of the endangered species protection center in Xiemen not
    only protects rare & precious species, but has made it possible for eco-environment in the sea
    area to get gradually restored, and ensures long-term sustainable use of coastal resources.

B. Setting up fish hatcheries under the marine fish-farming component has ameliorated the
    demand for brood & seed stock in sea area arising from additional cage/net fish culture.
    Releasing of a variety of value-added brood & seed stock (fish, shrimp & clamps) into sea
    area both addresses the livelihood need for coastal fish men, and protect ecologic balance of
    biological species population.

C. Construction of product quality and safety component. The management model of HACCP
    was introduced, which has led to setting of critical control points for product quality.
    Installation of WWT facilities has addressed the issue of waste-water discharge. This practice
    has not only avoided environmental pollution from the project per se, but played a role of
    demonstration and promotion for processing outside the project areas.



                                                  48

   IV. Risk Assessment Affecting Project Results

        1. Anticipated risk assessment of the Project design
        Risk anticipation of the Project design is for the main accurate and conforms to the reality.
        Viewed from the project implementation, except for those disasters (for instance, typhoon)
        that occurred beyond expectation with a few project areas, most of natural disasters and
        management risk that have taken place in the project areas were within anticipated scope
        because of the strengthened project management and the measures for disaster prevention &
        mitigation taken ahead of time.

        2. Risk assessment of the project operation management
        (1) Impact from natural disasters. Marine disaster, i.e. red-tide & typhoon, which have
            occurred frequently due to abnormal global climate, will bring risk to the project
            operation.
        (2) Market and business concept. Wrong market projection and not-right business concept
            will also take risk for operation of the project
        (3) Uncertainty of operational cost with public-good component. The State's strategic
            objective of "initiating marine ecological conservation", development of laws &
            regulations for sea and fishery, and the policies on development of marine sector provide
            policy safeguard for sustainable development of the project (as mentioned earlier).
            However, as a result of the State's financial constrain, some public-good components
            have no other alternative but try commercialized operation by attracting participation of
            social capital or social forces, as was the case with receiving grants and investment from
            international or domestic organizations or individuals so as to maintain their own
            working. Nevertheless, here there are a lot of uncertainties, resulting in some risk for
            continued operation of these components.

   V. Evaluation of the World Bank's and Borrower's Performance

   1. WB performance
   (1) Adequate preparation for project identification. The Bank carried out a great deal of and in-
   depth investigation and undertook good research of the status of China aquatic sector and gained
   pretty good understanding of the same., and realized the importance of sustainable coastal
   resource development.
   (2) Rational project design. The Bank made relatively detailed arrangements for the project
   construction contents, implementation pace and environmental impact etc.
   (3) Careful & scientific project appraisal. During the project construction, the World Bank went
   many times to the project units to do supervision and offer advise; have had adequate exchange of
   views with the latter, and presented a lot of options which were more feasible in terms of the
   project implementation and of technical suggestions, hence speeding up the progress in the
   project implementation and improving the project quality.
      The task managers, officials and specialists from the Bank have shown a meticulous style of
   work, boosted serious work attitude, with strong policy awareness while being quite flexible. All
   these have left deep impression on us. We are satisfied with the efforts the Bank has made.

2. Borrower performance
(1) Government's performance. From project reporting/submission, establishment, appraisal to
  implementation, governments at various levels attached great importance and put a lot of human
  resource, goods and financial assistance, on the top of policy safeguards and departmental
  coordination; especially in the project implementation, government at different levels rendered
  full support for project construction by establishment of the project leading group & PMO which


                                                     49

  were staffed with strong & lean project management personnel and then ensured that the loan
  proceeds and domestic counterpart fund required for the Project put in full amount in a timely
  manner and that the project construction has been proceeding smoothly.

(2) PIUs' performance. Under the leadership of governments at various levels, PIUs at different
  levels earnestly studied the project documents, gained good understanding of the purposes for the
  project construction. They meticulously undertook the designs for sub-components and works,
  carried out construction & supervision in a careful manner, tracked down & monitored (the
  progress) on time, made rational arrangements for project implementation scheduling. So, the
  project construction got completed as scheduled in full quantity and good quality.

VI. Main Experiences and Lessons from the Project Implementation

       1. Main experiences
            (1) Governments' close attention. Cooperation among the relevant departments is the
                back-up force for the success of the Project.. SCRDP has been tightly linked with
                the key melody of agriculture and fishery development. This Project focuses on
                being regarded as a demonstration & making-people-well-off scheme for increasing
                income with farmers/fish men, increased efficiency with the sector, for
                revitalization of rural economy and promotion of sustainable marine fishery
                production, which is very popular among the people. The Project is in line with the
                national industrial policy and in keeping with long-term agricultural development
                planning of local governments, having receiving strong support and close attention
                from them. In the early stage of the project implementation, governments at various
                levels all formed project leading groups, strengthen the project organizational
                structure, coordination and leadership, enabling optimization of the policy climate
                for the project. Through coordination by governments and collaboration among
                comprehensive departments of planning & finance etc., and sectoral management
                departments of foreign exchange administration and audit etc., a sound climate has
                been created for unfolding of the work in various stages of the project.
            (2) Feasible project design plus strict & scientific implementation is the prerequisite for
                the success of the project. The project design and grounds of argument kept to the
                point the then disorderly & excessive development of marine resources and
                environmental pollution, and regarded as the core of project implementation
                sustainable development of marine fishery production, protection of coastal eco-
                environment and strengthening safety of marine fishery products, highlighting
                priorities and found a right orientation. In the process of implementation, things
                have been operated strictly as per the project requirements and procedures, thus
                ensuring completion of most of the components in adequate quantity and good
                quality.
            (3) Good project supervising mechanism and unhindered project information network
                are the foundation for the success of the project. System establishment precedes the
                project launch. To the end of effectively regulating the project operations, CPMO
                has issued a number of management provisions, such as "Provisions for
                Management of Project Implementation", "Provisions for Management of Project
                Procurement", "and Provisions for Project Financial Management" etc. Project
                provinces have set up a set of stringent check/supervision, fund
                withdrawal/reimbursement and tendering/procurement systems that are fit for the
                features of Bank's marine and fishery project, and formed easy project management
                information (MIS) networks, providing a solid foundation for the success of the
                Project.


                                                   50

     (4) Stable project management organizations and hard work of the project staff are the
         guarantee for the success of the Project. Right from start of the project
         establishment, FECC under MOA put up CPMO for coordination of the efforts
         among various project provinces, and between the project provinces and the World
         Bank. At provincial, prefecture and county levels were established PMOs
         responsible for routine execution and management of the project. Though PMOs are
         provisional management agencies, governments and departments at various levels
         have given careful consideration to staffing and financial arrangement, making sure
         that the said organizations are stable and staff fixed. Project managerial staff
         members have a strong sense of responsibility & mission, working earnestly and
         playing an important role in attaining the project objectives.
     (5) Responding to the national & local macro policies and timely adjustment of the
         project construction contents are the key to the success of the Project. Given the fact
         that it took a long time from the project reporting and establishment to its
         completion, things experienced major changes internally and externally. In the light
         of market demand both at home abroad and requests from project owners,
         readjustments of the project investment and it components were made in due course
         through timely consultation with the World Bank, effectively improving use
         efficiency of the fund.

2. Main lessons
Overall speaking, SCRDP has been successfully implemented, provided a big booster to
sustainable development of coastal resources and increased farmers/fish men' income,
however, there is some weakness, mainly including:
(1) Early-stage preparation for the Project
The cycle from the project identification, preparation, appraisal to its implementation was
excessively long. For that matter, some items missed the best time for implementation due to
big changes taking place in market, resulting in major adjustment in the period of MTR.

(We) failed to do good prediction of possible changes in macro-economic climate and of the
trends for China's economic development so there was a gap in the market projection, and
individual sub-components didn't attain their expected objectives.

Anticipation and appraisal of occurrence of extreme natural disasters (typhoon) were
inadequate, as seen in heavy loss registered in part of the project areas.

(2) Project management
In the initial stage of project implementation, some PIUs were short of experience in doing
the Bank-financed project, and didn't fully understand some rules of the World Bank, which
resulted in increasing the difficulty and cost for project implementation.

Affected by the reform of government organizations and of project units per se, plus too long
a period for the project preparation and implementation, some of project units saw a higher
turnover of staff members, lacking continuity of work.

A few individual items (sub-components) had an issue of lax management ­ tendering was in
violation of regulations during the project construction. For that matter, we took necessary
measures by criticizing and penalizing the responsible persons concerned.




                                            51

     VII. Questions from the Borrower

     1. Early-stage preparation for the Project. Early-stage preparation for the Bank project went
         through stages of sectoral study-tour, pre-appraisal, appraisal, negotiation, effectiveness
         and execution, taking up one and half or two years. Big spanning (in time) easily led to
         errors in the areas of market prediction, product positioning and assuring operational
         orientation etc with the project owners, thus producing direct impact on the effectiveness
         of the project implementation.

     2. Project check/supervision. From presentation of the project and preparation up till the
         project completion and account closing, the World Bank has adopted a management
         mode of "giving attention to entire-processes", with good results achieved. However,
         two supervision missions a year in the course of project implementation has not only
         increased input of human resource, goods and financial resource, but driven up the
         burden of project owners and project management cost.

     3. Project adjustment. Timely project adjustment is the key to insuring smooth project
         implementation, but it took 6 months to one year from submission of the project
         adjustment (plan) to the Bank to the latter's review and approval. This has, without a
         trace, reduced the use efficiency of loan proceeds while slowing down the project
         implementation.

     4. International grant (gratis) in support of the project. For projects of social- & ecologic-
         benefit type (of public-good type), single loan formula is not conducive to project
         implementation. It is recommended that loan projects focusing on public-good have to
         get international grant (gratis) in support of them so as to soften loan conditions.

VIII. Conclusions

SCRDP has spanned approximate 10 years and completed the project construction task in an all-
round way. The project preparation, identification and design were scientific and rational.
Meanwhile, the project components fitted in with various policies of the State regarding
development of rural economy. The models of organization and construction with the Project
obviously represent advanced level and were easy to operate. With the great importance attached
by governments at different levels and active participation of the project beneficiaries, this Project
has achieved good economic, social and ecologic benefit. The project construction and operation
will for sure lay a sound foundation for sustainable development of costal resources in the project
areas and even in peripheral areas. The Project has reached intended objectives, being crowned
with success.

Analysis of Risk to Development Outcomes and of Bank and Borrower Performance


                              Risk to Development Outcomes - Section 4

Technical
Innovative technology is involved in the Coastal Zone Management and the Products Quality and Safety
components. The integrated data handling, using GPS technology, satellite imagery and other remote
sensing, radar, communications and vessel tracking, and involving international liaison (in weather
tracking, for example), is demonstrably within the capacity of the authorities responsible and of low risk.
The technology involved in HACCP in food processing is also institutionalized internationally; evolving
standards and practices are well-tested in a variety of locations and the information is freely available to
the seafood processing industry, particularly through the national association of seafood processors.

Financial and Economic
Analysis has shown relatively high rates of financial return on investments and high rates of social return
to the project as a whole and at the level of participating provinces. There is a moderate risk that public
sector expenditures may be less than required and/or late in being made available.

Social and stakeholder ownership.
The support of the project's activities by stakeholders is considered in most cases to be strong. The
outcomes of the project have been strongly positive in terms of incomes from investment and the creation
of employment. A potential negative social impact is the concentrated dependence of local communities
on mariculture and seafood processing industry in the event of changed world market conditions (e.g.,
embargoes on imports) or catastrophic weather events (especially typhoons).

Political and governance.
There is an extremely low possibility of volatility in the political situation.

Environmental.
The project was designed to have strongly positive environmental effects; most of these have been
achieved and, with a heightened public awareness being steadily achieved via information and education
supported by the coastal zone management infrastructures, the risk of "back-sliding" is considered to be
very small. The project has had no negative impacts.

Government ownership and commitment.
For reasons stated above, no more positive indication of the government's ownership and commitment
could be required than the mandatory extension of coastal zone management to the whole of China's
coastline.

Institutional support.
The project from the beginning worked with established institutions of local governments where the
physical installations (buildings and equipment) and regulatory frameworks have been fully absorbed.

Natural disasters.
The occurrence of typhoons is the largest single risk and is ever-present. Three typhoons made land-fall
in project provinces during the life of the project. This is a significant risk particularly to the mariculture
investments made under the project.

         Assessment of Bank Performance: Ensuring Quality at Entry - Section 5.1 (a)

Strategic relevance and approach
The project had high strategic relevance; near-shore fishing and mariculture had been identified by
government as a key source of increase in food output, but at the same time there were worsening problems
of over-fishing, pollution, disease and declining catches and yields. The approach adopted combined
appropriate roles for the public sector in providing the framework of incentives, legislation and penalties in
a scientifically-researched knowledge base concerning resources and limits to development.

Technical, financial and economic aspects
The technical approach to providing the broadly-defined set of public goods that make up the framework of
planning and control of resource use was excellent, drawing on experience elsewhere in the world
(particularly the state-of-the-art approach of the USA). The choice of providing support to both public and
private sectors was based on high rates of financial and economic returns.

Poverty, gender and social development
The project did not have a specific poverty agenda, although major impacts of the project were an
improvement in incomes of small operators in mariculture activities and an expansion in employment
opportunities in seafood processing (where women predominate) enhanced by the skills' improvement
implicit in the widespread adoption of HACCP methods in numerous processing plants.

Environmental aspects
The project's raison d'être was the need to reverse the deterioration in the environmental conditions of
near-shore waters, a combination of land-based pollution and excessive, unsustainable resource
exploitation.

Fiduciary aspects
A weak point in preparation and appraisal was the apparent lack of critical assessment made of the lower-
level implementing agencies, which led in a limited number of cases to inappropriate use of loan funds,
misprocurement and failure to keep adequate records.

Implementation arrangements
A relatively simple structure for implementation was adopted, but in the early years of the project it became
clear that some of the implementing agencies at the lower levels were ill-prepared to participate.

Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
M&E are referred to only peripherally in the PAD. No arrangements appear to have been made for an
M&E system to be designed or for a base-line study to be carried out. The latter would have been critical
in defining the "before-project" initial conditions and a properly designed M&E system would have
enabled conclusions eventually to have been drawn concerning the causal links between project actions and
changes in parameters, thereby enabling a degree of confidence to be had in the question of attribution.

Risk assessment
The risks identified were limited to two (see paragraph 2.1.10) and in retrospect this can be seen as having
been an over-simplification. Two additional risks, concerning potential weaknesses in the implementing
structure and the evolution of demand for funding and credit under the project, would seem to have been
clear from the beginning.

            Assessment of Bank Performance: Quality of Supervision - Section 5.1 (b)

Focus on development impact
Bank supervision maintained a clear focus on the development impact of the project. Since the aim of the
project was to provide a framework for the rational and sustainable use of natural resources at the same
time as increasing the production of seafood, a balance was maintained between the public and private
sector roles.

Fiduciary and safeguards aspects
Bank supervision was exemplary with respect to both fiduciary and safeguards aspects. Procurement
review was very thorough, and environmental issues concerning processing plants were carefully
scrutinized.
Adequacy of supervision inputs and processes
The project was technically complex and dispersed over the entire coast-line of China, making supervision
expensive and demanding. The supervision process benefited from the Bank's in-house technical expertise
in coastal resource management. The process of Mid-Term Review and the first restructuring was drawn
out over a long period; it should be emphasized that the re-structuring was a very large task carried out
within the limitations of the supervision budget (which was barely adequate) and limited FAO-CP
assistance, and was necessarily carried out over an extended period. In later years of project
implementation, the supervision budget was insufficient to provide the full range of technical expertise
through consultants that was required.

Candor and quality of performance reporting
There appears to have been a tendency to be slightly more optimistic than the facts on the ground
warranted. At no point in the ISR sequence was the Development Objective (DO) rating less than
"satisfactory", and in only two reporting periods was the Implementation Progress (IP) rating defined as
"unsatisfactory" or "moderately unsatisfactory". As pointed out in QSA7, a "moderately unsatisfactory"
rating for the IP would have been more accurate in FY2004, given the problems faced by the project and
the imminent need for its restructuring, and a "moderately satisfactory" rating would probably have been in
order for FY2005, given the slow progress made in implementing the restructuring program. QSA7 also
felt that ISRs were not specifying key actions to be taken by management, and that management comments
were often rather perfunctory.

Role in ensuring adequate transition arrangements
In practice, the Coastal Zone Management component was implemented by those agencies that are
institutionally responsible at the local government level and the "transition" requirements were minimal.
The three components aimed at increasing production and improving the quality of seafood promoted and
enabled private sector investments in a wide range of activities that were "self-contained" and whose
continued operation is the direct responsibility of the producers and entrepreneurs involved, meaning that
there is no `transition" process per se.

               Assessment of Borrower Performance: Government - Section 5.2 (a)

Government ownership and commitment to achieving the objectives
The government at the national level had a strong ownership and level of commitment towards the project,
and this was reinforced by the passage of legislation in 2002 to extend the methodology of coastal zone
management to all coastal areas. It took a pro-active role in making a realistic assessment of the project's
status at the MTR and in expanding the project area in two restructurings.
Enabling environment
The enabling environment of the project was enhanced by the importance given by the government to an
expansion in seafood production in the Ninth Five-Year Plan at the same time as recognizing that
sustainability and avoidance of unnecessary economic losses could only come through a scientific process
of zoning and the application of controls. Macroeconomic stability and the maintenance of the momentum
of reforms has meant that farmers and entrepreneurs were able to plan in a consistent framework and
according to the demands of the market (which has fluctuated in terms of products and prices).
Adequacy of consultation
Consultation in the early phases of project preparation led to a number of changes in its scope. Coastal
zone management was emphasized when the government realized the strong need felt by all concerned for
more effective planning mechanisms. The implementation of coastal zone management concepts is in
itself a highly participatory process with inputs from a wide range of stakeholders.
Readiness for implementation
It appears that in the earliest years of the project, at least, there was a great deal of "learning by doing" with
the inevitable mistakes that occur when such an approach is adopted. More could undoubtedly have been
done to improve the project's readiness for implementation. The component parts of the implementation
structure should have been better prepared in terms of training with, for example, an operational manual,
financial management manual, procurement training, more detailed procedures for credit on-lending and a
proper monitoring and evaluation framework (including base-line studies).
Timely resolution of implementation issues
The issues that arose in implementation were relatively slow in being resolved, but this appears to have
been a function of the (necessarily) complex nature of the project and its wide geographic dispersion rather
than any lack of application by the government itself.
Fiduciary
Audits were carried out in a timely manner and the government emphasized the importance of the
implementing agencies putting the recommendations and findings into practice.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
The monitoring and evaluation arrangements were not properly defined at preparation and it appears that it
was somehow assumed that this would just happen. ("Each Project Entity shall maintain policies and
procedures adequate to enable it to monitor and evaluate ... in accordance with indicators satisfactory to
the Bank, the carrying out of its respective part of the project and the achievement of the objectives ..." ­
Loan Agreement Schedule 5 II. F.1) This was a shared responsibility of the government and the Bank, and
should have been defined in preparation and appraisal but was not.
Transition arrangements to regular operations
In practice, the Coastal Zone Management component was implemented by those agencies that are
institutionally responsible at the local government level and the "transition" requirements were minimal.
The three components aimed at increasing production and improving the quality of seafood promoted and
enabled private sector investments in a wide range of activities that were "self-contained" and whose
continued operation is the direct responsibility of the producers and entrepreneurs involved, meaning that
there is no `transition" process per se.

         Assessment of Borrower Performance: Implementing Agencies - Section 5.2 (b)

Commitment to achieving the development objectives
The willingness of provincial and lower-tier governments to borrow IBRD funds for environmental
monitoring and control was a strong indication that coastal zone management was seen as a high priority.

Adequacy of consultations
Consultation in the early phases of project preparation led to a number of changes in its scope. Coastal
zone management was emphasized when the government realized the strong need felt by all concerned for
more effective planning mechanisms. The implementation of coastal zone management concepts is in
itself a highly participatory process with inputs from a wide range of stakeholders.

Readiness for implementation
It appears that in the earliest years of the project, at least, there was a great deal of "learning by doing" with
the inevitable mistakes that occur when such an approach is adopted. More could undoubtedly have been
done to improve the project's readiness for implementation, and this is a responsibility shared by the bank
and by both central and devolved levels of government. The component parts of the implementation
structure should have been better prepared in terms of training with, for example, an operational manual,
financial management manual, procurement training, more detailed procedures for credit on-lending and a
proper monitoring and evaluation framework (including base-line studies).

Timely resolution of implementation issues
The resolution of issues varied widely between provinces and municipalities.

Fiduciary
There were numerous issues with procurement including two instances of misprocurement that required the
return of funds and cancellations. Although the problems with procurement were more pronounced in the
early years of project implementation, and were in part the result of unfamiliarity with the Bank's
procedures, they continued intermittently throughout the project's life.

Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
The monitoring and evaluation arrangements were not properly defined at preparation. There were no
base-line studies to give an accurate picture of the initial conditions. As a result, the M&E systems created
under the project largely used existing staffs and reporting mechanisms; basic reporting on the progress of
implementation was adequate, though there were some difficulties with timely reporting from some areas
early on in the project as they learned about new procedures, as well as undergoing administrative changes
(at MTR). Generally, the monitoring focused on inputs and quantifiable physical outputs. Structured
thematic assessments were not done to track important outcomes, and outcome indicators and targets were
not reviewed or changed.

Transition arrangements to regular operations
In practice, the Coastal Zone Management component was implemented by those agencies that are
institutionally responsible at the local government level and the "transition" requirements were minimal.
The three components aimed at increasing production and improving the quality of seafood promoted and
enabled private sector investments in a wide range of activities that were "self-contained" and whose
continued operation is the direct responsibility of the producers and entrepreneurs involved, meaning that
there is no `transition" process per se.
