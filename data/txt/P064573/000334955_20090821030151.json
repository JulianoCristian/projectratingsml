the Senegal River Basin\n            Water and Environmental Management Project for Africa Region\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            common assumption, that the weakest participating country is\n            the main limitation for the success of a regional project,\n            has proven to be invalid; this is especially true when a\n            strong regional institution is in place, which has the full\n            endorsement and confidence of the different riparian\n            countries of a shared river Basin. Global Environment\n            Facility (GEF) grant funding can play a critical role in\n            leveraging an inclusive reorganization of a regional\n            institution. GEF was catalytic in building a more inclusive\n            institutional structure for river Basin management\n            regionally and nationally. An important achievement was\n            increasing Guinean representation in Senegal River Basin\n            Authority (OMVS) at all levels, and more participatory\n            management and planning structures for river Basin\n            management. The Trans-boundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA)/\n            Strategic Action Plan (SAP) process played an important role\n            for mainstreaming environment at all levels and should\n            continue to play an important role for GEF projects\n            targeting trans-boundary water bodies or river Basins. Joint\n            co-implementation of a project through two GEF\n            implementation agencies (i.e. World Bank and United Nations\n            Development Program (UNDP)) on the basis of comparative\n            advantages identified only pays off when roles and\n            responsibilities of the two agencies are clearly planned and\n            laid out in advance with key reporting and supervision\n            processes harmonized to the extend possible."}, "docdt": "2009-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
