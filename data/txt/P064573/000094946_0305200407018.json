design criteria that takes into\n            consideration environmental, and social impacts. This\n            environmental management Framework (EMF) identifies the\n            process to implement micro-grant-funded activities, within\n            the framework of national environmental policies, and\n            provides mechanisms to assess impacts at the national level.\n            It is recommended to identify regional priority actions, and\n            prepare national micro-grant action plans, where each\n            riparian country would prioritize issues, and areas to\n            provide a strategic framework for resource allocation, that\n            includes spatial, and thematic priorities for\n            implementation. Likewise, training assistance, and workshops\n            should be developed for the environmental, and social\n            design, as well as for the screening process, to be able to\n            review, implement, and monitor program objectives; and, an\n            information, promotional campaign encouraged, intended to\n            engage rural communities in building their own capacity, and\n            mechanisms to utilize resources in a sustainable manner.\n            Priority issues in the Senegal River Basin include land\n            degradation, deforestation, soil erosion, overgrazing, and\n            desertification, in addition to adversity on water resources\n            management. To this end, soil erosion control measures will\n            be established, namely by reforestation practices, improved\n            farm management practices, and pastoral land management.\n            Furthermore, stream banks will be restored by controlling\n            water weeds, and invasive species, and, by improving the\n            flow from irrigation ditches, to enhance water quality;\n            local wetland habitats will be restored through the\n            establishment of community wetland protection and\n            surveillance groups, to also protect community nature\n            reserves, and implement small-scale research on wildlife and habitats."}, "docdt": "2002-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
