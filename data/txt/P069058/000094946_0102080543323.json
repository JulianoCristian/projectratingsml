"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall objectives of reforms in the\n            social protection and labor market fields supported by the\n            Social Sector Adjustment Credit Project are to: 1) support\n            development of institutional and budgetary mechanisms for\n            development and prioritization of social protection policy\n            and programs in Bosnia-Herzegovina; 2) improve the policy\n            framework for generating productive employment\n            opportunities; 3) initiate improvements in the impact and\n            efficiency of the social safety net, in particular focusing\n            programs on the needs of the poorest; and 4) strengthen the\n            social statistics base in order to ensure that social policy\n            is formulated on a well-informed basis. While the credit is\n            an important element of raising the profile of these issues\n            in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is only the first step in tackling\n            a large reform agenda. The credit conditionality targets\n            those areas where there is adequate progress and\n            concreteness in the policy dialogue to date. However, the\n            Letter of Development Policy outlines both the short-term\n            and medium-term program of social protection reform. Further\n            World Bank adjustment support will be dependent on adequate\n            progress on the medium-term reform agenda. This project is\n            also supported by a companion credit, the Social Sector\n            Technical Assistance Credit (report no. 20887)."}, "docdt": "2001-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
