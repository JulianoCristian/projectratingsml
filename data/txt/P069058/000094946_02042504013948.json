World Bank performance\n            overall is rated as highly satisfactory. Borrower\n            performance overall was satisfactory. There were three\n            lessons learned from this experience. First, the Bank was\n            effective in understanding the political economy of change:\n            Many aspects of the project required a keen undrstanding of\n            the process of change, and the Bank was adept at\n            facilitating solutions that were acceptable to many\n            stakeholders. In the intensive process of drafting the new\n            labor legislation, the Bank played an important role in\n            tempering the demands of some groups, for example, the trade\n            unions, to retain more of the privileges they were accorded\n            by the old law. Second, a substantial shift in\n            officials' attitudes was key to successful reform: The\n            active participation of officials at all levels in this\n            process led to a substantial shift in attitude, as they\n            confronted key issues and the severe constraints within\n            which they had to work. In the area of labor relations,\n            attitudes shifted from those rooted in the principles of a\n            centrally-controlled economy to those more suitable to a\n            market economy. Third, collaboration with the International\n            Labor Organization (ILO) facilitated reform. In addition to\n            their technical contribution, ILO participation provided\n            important credibility for the process, as they were\n            perceived as sympathetic to worker rights."}, "docdt": "2002-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
