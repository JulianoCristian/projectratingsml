The main project\n            objectives will include initiatives by the public, and\n            private sectors to strengthen the institutional framework,\n            and build capacities responsive to the epidemic. However,\n            the presence of biomedical wastes within the framework of\n            the project, poses adverse environmental impacts, due to the\n            potential, inadequate handling of infected materials. This\n            environmental assessment addresses specifically the\n            management of biomedical wastes, and examines the\n            institutional capacity within health institutions and local\n            authorities, to propose a feasible plan of action, to reduce\n            HIV/AIDS infection risks. Measures to mitigate biomedical\n            wastes disposal are as follows. Institutional, legal and\n            regulatory frameworks will be strengthened through\n            inter-governmental efforts by the Environment, Agriculture\n            and Public Health ministries to implement, and enforce\n            environmentally sound waste management practices. Health\n            facilities will be provided with sanitary equipment for the\n            collection, and removal of biomedical wastes, as well as\n            trained personnel in precautionary practices for handling\n            infected, or non-sterilized medical wastes, and, the choice\n            of small incinerators will be available for hospital uses.\n            Moreover, training and specific programs will be available\n            for health providers, to develop awareness on the direct,\n            and indirect risks of inappropriate wastes handling.\n            Effluent discharges will undergo adequate treatment at the\n            municipal level, including systematic incineration plans,\n            and compacted waste disposal. Public awareness will aim at\n            sensitizing communities on the related risks between AIDS\n            and biomedical waste disposal."}, "docdt": "2002-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
