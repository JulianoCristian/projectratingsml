F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives 1
The objectives of the project were to assist the Borrower in: (i) reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS in the
Borrower's population; (ii) mitigating the health and socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS on persons
infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS within the Borrower's territory, thus sustaining an economically
productive population; and (iii) building strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDOs were not revised but the key performance indicators (KPI) were formally revised in the Additional
Financing that was approved by the Board on December 19, 2006.


1
  The objectives are taken from the Development Credit Agreement and Financing Agreement. While similar in substance, the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) describes the PDOs differently.

                          xvi
1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1     Context at Appraisal
1. Following the identification of the first case of HIV in 1986, the Ministry of Health established a
National AIDS Control Program (PNLS) and implemented a series of medium-term plans (MTP). With
assistance during MTP II (1994­98), particularly from French Cooperation and the European Union, the
Ministry of Health (MOH) strengthened HIV surveillance and improved information collection and
analysis. Donor support for these interventions ceased in 1998, resulting in an interruption in sentinel
surveillance data collection from 1998 to 2000 and the reduction of PNLS staff to a single person.
2. Consequently, information about the characteristics and evolution of the epidemic was limited, but
the authorities were concerned by the increasing number of cases: (i) health facility data (2000)
estimated the number of HIV cases at 3,000-4,000 and the number of AIDS cases at 75 (1.8 AIDS cases
per 10,000 population), or more than double the reported 32 cases in 1996; and (ii) sentinel surveillance
data (1997) estimated the prevalence of HIV in the general population at 1.5-2.5%. Further, two-thirds
of those infected were estimated to be aged 30-49 years with some 20% of all infected people aged 25-
29. The main transmission mechanism was heterosexual sex, although mother-to-child transmission
(MTCT) was believed to contribute new cases, and rising drug abuse by injection was cited anecdotally.
3. Government authorities were further concerned by the potential impact of the epidemic on the
country's economic growth and social progress, which had been significant. Beginning in the late
1980s, Cape Verde's growth averaged some 2.5% per capita per year, and the country had joined the
ranks of lower middle income countries, with a GNI per capita of US$ 1,310 in 2001. Poverty had
declined; the human development index was increasing (from 0.59 in 1990 to 0.67 in 2003); life
expectancy at birth (69 years) was the third highest in Africa; and adult literacy rates were high (about
76% in 2002).
4. Though the 1997 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) did not mention HIV/AIDS, Government
authorities submitted a request for support from the World Bank in late 2000. The request anticipated:
(i) the CAS Progress Report (June 2001), which identified HIV/AIDS as an area for Bank support; and
(ii) the subsequent CAS (2002), which emphasized HIV/AIDS in the Bank's program of assistance
through a multisectoral approach, within the framework of the multi-country HIV/AIDS program for
Africa (MAP-Phase II). The project was thus consistent with both the CAS Progress Report and the
subsequent CAS.
5. In line with the MAP eligibility criteria, the Government: (i) established (July 2001) the "Comite de
Coordinaçào do Combate a SIDA" (CCS-SIDA) in the office of the Prime Minister; (ii) formulated
(2001) and adopted (January 2002) a national multisectoral HIV/AIDS strategy for the period 2002-06,
with the participation of central and municipal government, NGOs, and UNAIDS and other international
donors; and (iii) agreed to use exceptional implementation arrangements to fund multiple implementing
agencies.
6. Bank support for the country's efforts to fight HIV/AIDS was justified by insufficient donor
attention to the issue and the resulting inadequate resources to address the epidemic. It was expected
that the Bank's financial support to the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan together with its ability to
ensure appropriate fiduciary architecture and to attract donor interest would catalyze a coherent,
multisectoral, and well-funded response to HIV/AIDS in Cape Verde.
1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
7. The objectives of the project were to assist the Borrower in: (i) reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS in
the Borrower's population; (ii) mitigating the health and socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS on persons
infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS within the Borrower's territory, thus sustaining an economically


                                                                                                            1
productive population; and (iii) building strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. 3
1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
8. The original PDO were not formally revised during implementation of the project, but the Project
Key Performance Indicators (PDO and intermediate outcome indicators) were formally revised in
December 2006 at the time of the approval of additional financing for the project. The project was not
part of the umbrella MAP restructuring (in 2007)4 because the approved additional financing had
already dropped the indicator on seroprevalence of HIV in the general population in 2006.
9. Data on the original and revised PDO and intermediate outcome indicators are presented in Section
F of the Data Sheet and discussed in more detail in Section 3.2 and Annex 2.
1.4      Main Beneficiaries and Benefits
10. The initial project was expected to benefit the entire population, combining a comprehensive
Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) effort with smaller scale interventions targeting a
range of particularly vulnerable and specific at-risk groups for intensified services, including: (i) youths
(in particular teenage girls); (ii) women and in particular pregnant women; (iii) water and road transport
workers; (iv) commercial sex workers; (v) people addicted to drugs; (vi) the military and other
uniformed forces; and (vii) impoverished orphans. As confirmed by the IDSR II (2005), improved
sentinel surveillance data and the sero-prevalence study estimated overall HIV prevalence at 0.8%, and
the additional financing proposal opted to fund a smaller, better targeted number of activities focusing
on consolidating the initial results and finding ways to assist: (i) people living with HIV/AIDS; (ii)
HIV/AIDS affected households; and (iii) specific at-risk groups, including commercial sex workers,
street children, and drug addicts.
11. By financing sub projects through multiple channels, including ministerial, municipal, and civil
society groups, the project was expected to: (i) reduce the number of new HIV/AIDS cases; (ii) improve
the diagnosis, treatment and care for people living with HIV/AIDS; (iii) extend the productive life of
people living with AIDS; (iv) improve the ability of communities, households and individuals to prevent
or cope with impact of HIV/AIDS; and (v) improve the economic prospects of orphans and poor HIV-
stricken families.
1.5      Original Components
12. Project Component 1: Capacity-Building (US$ 0.86 million) was intended to finance capacity-
building activities for the public sector and civil society to implement HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and
support activities in the country. Sectoral entities, municipalities, civil society organizations, and the
Coordination Committee to Fight AIDS (CCS-SIDA) were all expected to benefit from capacity
building in selected technical areas as well as in administrative and financial management.
13. Project Component 2: Public Sector Initiatives (US$ 4.31 million) was intended to support
HIV/AIDS initiatives comprising public sector HIV/AIDS activities coordinated at national level by
ministries and parastatal agencies; and at decentralized levels by municipalities.


3
  There were some inconsistencies in the presentation of the indicators in the original credit within the PAD (between
Section A.2 and Annex 1) and between the PAD and the legal minutes of the negotiations (the indicators were not
included in the original DCA). The PDO and intermediate outcome indicators presented under Section F of the Data
Sheet are taken from: (i) original credit: PAD, Annex 1; (ii) additional financing: Project Paper, Appendix B.
4
  The umbrella restructuring eliminated the use of HIV prevalence rates as an outcome indicator after determining it to
be an inadequate measure for HIV/AIDS projects performance.

                                                                                                                          2
        2a) National initiatives. The Ministry of Health, Employment and Solidarity, which already had a
        unit (PNLS) with responsibilities for HIV/AIDS, was to continue to carry out health sector related
        HIV/AIDS activities, in addition to setting policy and strategy, and providing technical health
        related HIV/AIDS support to other ministries and municipalities. As part of the multisectoral
        approach to HIV/AIDS, each ministry was, at a minimum, expected to: (i) have a focal person or
        team for HIV/AIDS; (ii) establish a mechanism (at central and community levels) for informing and
        educating its employees and a social support network; (iii) prepare or update an HIV/AIDS strategy
        and action plan to include measures for preventing and mitigating the effect of HIV/AIDS in the
        work place; and (iv) propose HIV/AIDS interventions aimed at reaching clients of the ministries
        and agencies. Some of these activities were expected to be contracted out to civil society
        organizations or the private sector.
        2b) Municipal initiatives. Given the importance of Cape Verde's municipalities for effecting
        change at the local level, the project supported activities to be carried out by municipalities, or
        contracted out by them to civil society organizations or the private sector. Under this component,
        municipalities were to support: (i) HIV/AIDS awareness of municipal authorities, teachers, school
        management teams and community leaders; (ii) training and support for municipal and community-
        based staff in HIV/AIDS prevention, support, and care, provision of voluntary counseling and
        testing (VCT) services; (iii) HIV/AIDS-related health services at municipal facilities for prevention
        (including HIV-related IEC and condom distribution to the municipal workforce), diagnosis,
        treatment5, and care (for the syndromic treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI) and
        Directly Observed Therapies (DOTs); and (iv) promotion of community and civil society-led
        HIV/AIDS initiatives through their selection, contracting, financing and supervision. Many of the
        activities financed under this component were to support activities at community levels by civil
        society and the private sector, i.e. advocacy, training, promotion of community led HIV/AIDS
        initiatives, and DOTs.
14. Component 3: Civil Society and Private Sector Initiatives (US$ 2.62 million) was intended to
support community-led HIV/AIDS activities directly carried out, or contracted out, by civil society
organizations, such as NGOs, religious organizations and organizations of PLWHA. These activities
were expected to include, for example: targeted support to orphans, guardians of poor orphans, and
AIDS-stricken impoverished households; support to families affected by HIV/AIDS including revenue
generating activities; community-based IEC; home-based care; promotion of the use of condoms at the
community level; support of community-based HIV/AIDS networks in prevention, care, and support
activities.
15. Component 4: Project Facilitation, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 1.31
million) was intended to fund the operations of the Secretariat of CCS-SIDA in charge of facilitation,
coordination, review of action plans and funding proposals, supervision, monitoring and evaluation ( to
be outsourced), and support to CCS-SIDA for longer-term national planning and policy development.
1.6         Revised Components
16. The additional financing proposal retained the same four project components of the original project
as well as activities consistent with the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2006-2010), but shifted its
focus on high risk groups; proposed project results and outcomes were modified in accordance with the

project's achievements at the time and expected future results before the revised closing date of
December 31, 2008.
1.7     Other significant changes
17. Amendment of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). The original DCA was amended
four times to: (i) revise procurement procedures (April and July 2004)6; (ii) reallocate the project
proceeds (September 2005); and (iii) extend the closing date (December 2006). The Additional
Financing Agreement modified the project performance indicators and was amended three times to: (i)
reallocate the proceeds of the project (May 2007 and November 2008); and (ii) extend the closing date a
second time (December 2008).
18. Additional financing. A request for additional financing of US$5 million equivalent was approved
by the Board on December 19, 2006 and became effective on April 17, 2007. The additional funds were
requested to help finance: (i) scale up cost-effective interventions for high-risk groups successfully
initiated under the original credit; and (ii) identify ways of ensuring the financial sustainability of efforts
to fight HIV/AIDS, given limited public financing and the anticipated completion of the original IDA
financing.
19. The additional financing was consistent with the Bank's conditions for Additional Financing as
stated in BP 13.20 (June 2005). It was also consistent with Pillars 3 (human capital development) and 5
(social protection) of Cape Verde's Poverty Reduction Strategy (2004) and Pillar 3 of the Bank's CAS
(2005-08), which calls for implementing social programs aimed at alleviating poverty and inequity.
2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
20. Project preparation. Project preparation was initiated in the spring of 2001. A PHRD grant was
signed in June 2001 for US$475,000 (of which US$410,000 was spent) with the objectives of: (i)
carrying out a number of studies (baseline study, social and gender assessment, NGO capacity
assessment, etc.); and (ii) specifying institutional and operational mechanisms, including financial
management assessment. To support the single person responsible at the time for all the activities of
PNLS, consultants were recruited in the areas of IEC (to draft a strategy and training plan),
epidemiology/public health (to re-launch the HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance system), and HIV/AIDS
care and support.
21. Subsequently, the project preparation also utilized a project preparation facility (PPF) in the amount
of US$400,000 to: (i) restart the HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance (including procurement of reagents to
supply the sentinel posts); (ii) strengthen the implementation capabilities of CCS-SIDA and the
Administrative Unit providing procurement and financial management assistance; (iii) pilot the
implementation of the Project Operational Manual by making funds available to selected line ministries,
municipalities, and NGO's; and (iv) organize workshops and study tours to improve capacity in sentinel
surveillance, medical waste management and Bank operations.
22. Though most of the PHRD activities were carried out, the baseline study was not, with the result that
both essential elements of the background analysis (which might have led to a more targeted
intervention approach) and some baseline indicators for M&E were lacking. The PPF activities were
implemented and provided essential elements for enhancing project implementation.

 These amendments were intended to bring the project in line with the Bank's guidelines for the acquisition of
HIV/AIDS Medicines and Related Supplies (February 2004) and with the new procurement procedures (May 2004).

                                                                                                                 4
23. During the project preparation process, the Bank repeatedly flagged the following issues: (i) the
paucity of information concerning the epidemic and the need for baseline information on the sero-
prevalence of HIV; (ii) insufficient development of the strategy for certain interventions (VCT, social
marketing of condoms, and helping PLWHA to organize themselves) and logistical and supply
mechanisms; and (iii) the need to strengthen the technical capabilities of the PNLS and train health staff
in treatment and care of HIV/AIDS patients. Despite such concerns, Bank project preparation missions
proceeded on schedule.7
24. At the same time, the Government proceeded on schedule to: (i) create the national coordinating
body in July 2001; (ii) organize a broad consultative process to formulate the national strategy; and (iii)
establish ministry focal points and Municipality HIV/AIDS committees. Concurrently, NGOs were
developing HIV/AIDS action plans in anticipation of submitting proposals for project funding.
25. Similarly, project preparation for additional financing moved smoothly and swiftly in 2006, with
appraisal in October, negotiations in November, and Board approval in December.
26. Project design. The project was designed, with some adaptation, according to the first generation
of MAP's design and mechanisms for implementation, which was appropriate at the time given the
country's limited knowledge of the epidemic. Though a detailed analysis of the epidemic was
incomplete, agreement was reached on the project's components, which aimed to: (i) mainstream
HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care, and support activities into all sectors of Government and into
civil society; (ii) scale up successful interventions and coverage among the general population; and (iii)
strengthen coping mechanisms, particularly for orphans, households headed by women, the very young,
and the elderly. Project design discussions addressed and resolved a number of key challenges for the
country given its geographical and economical particularities, including: (i) the complexity of
introducing a multisectoral strategy, particularly where the Ministry of Health had played the
predominant role for an extended period; (ii) the difficulties of coordinating and managing program
interventions at national and sub-national levels, especially given the geographical dispersion of the
population among ten islands; and (iii) the weak capacity of the civil society to implement activities in a
new and difficult area.
27. The Bank's preparation team was headed by a transport specialist, who received assistance from
public health specialists and advice from ACTAfrica and TTLs who had already prepared multi-sectoral
HIV/AIDS projects. Project preparation followed two complementary tracks: (i) tailoring internationally
accepted practices for HIV/AIDS response to the Cape Verdean situation for incorporation into the
national strategy8; and (ii) systematically organizing consensus-building exercises through visits to
ministries, municipalities, NGOs, etc. to ensure a broad understanding of the multi-sectoral approach to
HIV/AIDS among all stakeholders.
28. The PAD for the original project correctly identified the major critical risks and proposed
appropriate risk mitigation measures, which were generally applied and adequate when they were
subsequently required to resolve problems with one exception. The PAD accurately identified the
potential risk related to adequate financing during and financial sustainability after the end of the project




7
  A draft PCD was prepared in the spring of 2001, shared informally with the Government and its partners in June 2001
and during an identification mission in July 2001; a pre-appraisal mission was conducted in October 2001; and the
appraisal mission was carried out in February 2002.

8
 Many of the "lessons learned" presented in the PAD were drawn from a note on "Early MAP Country Operations"
prepared in March 2001 by ACTAfrica and were consistent with UNAIDS guidance in developing countries.

                                                                                                                    5
(and particularly Government's ability to provide timely and sufficient counterpart financing during
implementation); in this case, however, no mitigating measure was proposed.
29. The Project Paper for the Additional Financing9 noted that while the changes in project components
were not substantial, the proposed changes in project design consisted mainly of sharpening the current
approach with an eye to target high risk groups. Specifically, the additional financing was intended to:
(i) build on project-financed studies (of commercial sex workers, street children and drug addicts) and
implement recommendations to better target project interventions; (ii) strengthen the expanding network
of VCT sites established on the individual islands; and (iii) improve the operations and results of the
M&E system. The Project Paper also emphasized the risk of adequate financing and the need for
sufficient time to secure the required funding to sustain activities after project closing.
30. Quality at Entry. No Quality Enhancement Review was conducted. At the decision meeting
(January 2002) the principal comments, which were subsequently addressed by the team, concerned: (i)
strategic issues related to the national HIV/AIDS strategy; (ii) the size of the credit; and (iii)
implementation issues related to the institutional arrangements (coordination, procurement of
pharmaceuticals, etc.), procedures (for M&E, financial management and procurement mechanisms, and
the operational manual), and conditionalities. Of particular pertinence to the project were the meeting's
comments on:
         the fiduciary architecture of MAP which results in relatively high fixed costs that vary only
         marginally between small and large countries and which need to be taken into account in
         providing a rationale for the size of the credit;
         the importance of a reasonable financial commitment by the Government, even though the
         country's fiscal situation might dictate other options for meeting this financial commitment; and
         the need to focus on capacity building (including intensive Bank supervision), particularly
         during the first year of implementation, and on ensuring the Secretariat's role of facilitation and
         coordination rather than command and control.
2.2      Implementation
31. Disbursement overview. The original Development Credit Agreement (Cr 3629-CV) in the
amount of SDR 7.3 million (US$9.0 million equivalent) was approved on March 28, 2002 and became
effective on July 17, 2002. Government was expected to finance US$0.6 million equivalent bringing the
total project cost to US$9.6 million equivalent. The Additional Financing Agreement (Cr 3629-1 CV)
in the amount of SDR 3.4 million (US$5.0 million equivalent) was approved on December 19, 2006 and
became effective on April 17, 200710. Government was expected to finance an additional US$0.5
million equivalent.
32. Though disbursement began slowly in 2002, expenditures had increased so rapidly by the time of the
mid-term review (September 2004) that a major concern was the potential depletion of funds for
HIV/AIDS without any other potential sources of support. In fact, from February 2005 through the
April 2007, the project was only able to fund selected priorities (initiated ARV treatment
implementation, M&E, and the institutional structure). Similarly, there were initial delays in disbursing
the additional financing (related to finalizing the action plans and financial agreements with various
stakeholders and implementers), but these were almost entirely committed (at least for the sub-projects)


9
  The initial Bank intervention assumed a longer-term involvement and included provision for a follow-up MAP project
(which was requested by the Government in 2005), but given the unexpected low prevalence, a project extension and
additional financing were deemed to be sufficient.
10
   The delay in effectiveness resulted from the effectiveness condition that a revised version of the Operating Manual
reflecting agreed changes be approved by IDA.

                                                                                                                     6
by the end of 2007 and disbursed over the remaining eighteen months of the project. The disbursement
profile is presented in Section I of the Data Sheet.
33. Implementation overview. Implementation began prior to project effectiveness with a number of
important actions, including efforts: (i) by MOH to adopt a draft IEC strategy, prepare a procurement
plan for reagents, pharmaceuticals, etc., and re-launch the HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance system; and
(ii) by the other ministries, municipalities, and NGOs to develop action plans for project funding.
34. After project effectiveness, the pace of implementation slowed,11 though the decision to use the
Administrative Unit (AU) of the Transport Project as a source of technical expertise for procurement
matters attenuated some of these effects. Bank missions expressed concerns (in April and September
2003) about the institutional arrangements12, Government's need to "recommit" to the implementation of
the national strategy, the insufficient number of MOH staff working on HIV/AIDS, slow progress in
addressing capacity weaknesses at all levels, and the complicated and time-consuming review by
municipalities of proposals from civil society organizations. The missions also emphasized the need for
promoting actions to empower PLWHA and to develop care and support programs for them.
35. By early 2004, overall project implementation had improved, the AU's functions had been
transferred to the ES-CCS and key replacement staff hired. The MOH, in particular, had made progress
in establishing surveillance, standard protocols and procedures (for STDs, IOs, VCT, and PMTCT), and
procurement of ARVs.13 Thereafter, overall project implementation was consistently rated Satisfactory
or better in ISRs with the exception of the last ISR in June 2009, when it was rated Moderately
Satisfactory, based on reduced ratings for project management (from Satisfactory to Moderately
Satisfactory) and especially counterpart financing (from Satisfactory to Moderately Unsatisfactory).
Component implementation was rated Satisfactory or better throughout, with occasional Moderately
Satisfactory ratings between March 2008 and June 2009 for Components 2a (national initiatives) and 4
(project facilitation).
36. The mid-term review was held as scheduled in September 2004 and noted that "in implementing the
project, the Government has actively engaged and encouraged participation of every level of society:
national and municipal public sectors, civil society and private sector ­ and society has responded
robustly." The MTR recommended the recruitment of facilitators for the municipalities, but this only
occurred later (in 2007) and proved to be useful both for implementing the additional financing and for
strengthening longer term capacity at the municipal level.
37. Implementation of the project was marred by: (i) an inability to mobilize sufficient non-IDA funding
for HIV/AIDS; and (ii) delays in and inadequate amounts of counterpart financing. Of the total US$1.1
million for counterpart financing, indicated in the original and additional financing credits, the project
had received US$0.54 million (or 49%) by June 30, 2009. However, because counterpart funds were
expected to finance only 10% of works, local goods, and operating costs, which altogether comprised a
relatively small proportion of the credit, there were no disruptions in the financing of the principal
activities.




11
   There were some difficulties in recruiting an Executive Secretary, related partly to the proposed salary scale and
partly to the interest and qualifications of the candidates.
12
   The September 2003 supervision mission reviewed the implementation difficulties at all levels and proposed solutions
but noted that the Government authorities did not entirely agree with either the Bank's analysis or its recommendations.
13
   During project preparation, MOH was somewhat reluctant to get involved with treatment. The PAD and the DCA
opened the possibilities for treatment "if future Government policy deems it appropriate" (PAD, p. 11), and subsequent
Bank missions encouraged and endorsed MOH's efforts to develop protocols, procure drugs, etc.

                                                                                                                      7
2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
38. M&E design. Successive preparation missions proposed to delegate the M&E components as
follows: (i) biological surveillance and epidemiological research (including the annual antenatal HIV
prevalence survey) to PNLS assisted by the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health; (ii) behavioral
surveillance to a consulting firm or NGO; and (iii) financial and program management monitoring to the
AU (and subsequently to the CCS-SIDA), including responsibility for an integrated data base and
reporting system for submitting M&E reports in an agreed format at agreed intervals.14 It was expected
that an in-country consultant would be recruited to develop an M&E system during the project
preparation phase, but when this did not occur, the Bank prepared the draft M&E manual (in June 2002)
and proposed the recruitment under the project of a long-term M&E officer with short-term technical
assistance.
39. M&E design for both the original credit and for the additional financing was weakened by: (i) the
absence of Project Outcome Indicators for two of the three PDO (mitigation and capacity), though
appropriate intermediate outcome indicators were selected to monitor all three PDO; (ii) the lack of
baseline data for some indicators (reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS); and (ii) the imprecision in the
formulation of certain indicators and/or the inability to obtain data to measure results. The original
credit relied on the Demographic and Health Surveys (or IDSR) to measure several indicators, but the
timing of these studies did not coincide well with project needs: (i) some baseline indicators used the
results of the 1998 IDSR instead of the planned baseline survey; and (ii) most indicators were to be
measured in 2005 (only three years after the start of the project) to ensure that the 2005 IDSR would
provide adequate and timely data.
40. Implementation. Under the arrangements for monitoring, CCS-SIDA was responsible for defining
M&E needs and for the strategic use of M&E data and reports to inform project and program
management. A team of two persons worked on M&E throughout the project, with the assistance of a
long-term M&E consultant and periodic visits by the Global Monitoring and Evaluation Team
(GAMET).
41. Two computerized management information systems were installed to assist project activity
monitoring, but the initial system never functioned satisfactorily and the subsequent system (TECPRO)
was not generally used by the M&E unit, which relied on Word and Excel tables to prepare reports.
These tables provided useful information on sub-projects (e.g., promoter, targeted people/number of
beneficiaries, estimated cost, type of intervention (awareness, treatment, and such), etc. but were
difficult to manipulate in a timely manner. Overall, insufficient human resources and an inability to
develop standardized indicators has hindered the development of program monitoring; this was
particularly the case at the municipality level where monitoring of sub-projects had some
weaknesses.
42. An ambitious schedule of quantitative and qualitative studies for surveillance and research was
carried out as follows:




14
  Regional technical assistance was envisioned for all three components, with World Bank Washington assistance to
coordinate operations research and ensure maximum MAP program learning and dissemination.

                                                                                                                    8

              Sources: Aide memoire (April 2003) for planned; report dates for executed.

Epidemiological surveillance was expanded from 2 to 22 sites and annual reports produced by MOH;
behavioral surveillance studies targeted uniformed forces (armed forces, police, etc.), female market
traders, and drug users (2004); and impact studies through APIS and INE were used to determine
several of the results of the project (2009). Other research was carried out on: (i) sexuality among
adolescents and teenage pregnancy; (ii) drug use by injectable drug users, sex workers, and adolescents;
(iii) vulnerability among orphans and street children; and (iv) communication strategies in general and
for social marketing of condoms in particular.
43. ISRs during the first five years of project implementation routinely rated M&E satisfactory; over the
last eighteen months of the project, however, M&E was rated moderately satisfactory in three of the four
ISRs, due principally to weaknesses in the management information systems and delays in obtaining the
data on project outcomes. The additional financing required that special studies be conducted at the end
of the project period; these were done but were only available after project closing.
44. Utilization. Data from the different surveillance studies (particularly the 2003 BSS and the 2005
IDSR) were used to modify the national strategy and to justify revised targets for additional project
funding. Data from the project monitoring system provided the basis for quarterly reports to the project
steering committee and to the Bank as well as for the annual reviews of HIV/AIDS in Cape Verde.
2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
45. Environment. The environment category of the Project at the time of appraisal was B, with
inappropriate handling and disposal of medical waste and inadequate management of the respective
disposal sites in urban or peri-urban areas cited as the major problems. Financed by the PPF, a detailed
waste management plan was a condition for negotiations in February 2002 and finalized in March
2002.15 The plan focused on revising existing health sector guidelines on appropriate management of
medical waste and on training of health care professionals and community workers delivering care to
HIV/AIDS patients; implementation of the medical waste management plan began in earnest in 2003
and it was noted in the aide-memoire of the January 2004 supervision mission that "the progress
achieved is worth sharing with other countries dealing with similar problems."
46. The mid-term review noted that: (i) the waste management plan is comprehensive and takes into
account all needs (ex. both storage and disposal aspects), all types of waste ­ solid, liquid, human
tissues/annexes; all geographical levels from hospitals to laboratories to the smallest health facilities at


15
  The revised safeguard policy, requiring a separate environmental plan for category B projects and disclosure in
country and in Infoshop, was introduced during the project's preparation. As a result, disclosure was not possible prior
to project appraisal.

                                                                                                                           9
community level; and (ii) Cape Verde has established clear ownership of the waste management plan
that has been locally developed. Throughout project implementation, the ISRs rated compliance with
environmental and social safeguards as satisfactory or highly satisfactory, and the medical waste
management framework is considered as a best practice for the sub-region.16
47. Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management. Procurement was carried out initially
by the AU and then by a staff of (mostly) two persons. ISR ratings for procurement were uniformly
satisfactory, though periodic reviews noted inadequacies in updating the procurement plan (due in part
to the demand-driven nature of the project), the broad range and small quantities of goods to be
procured, and the insufficient use of the operations manual as a reference for the appropriate procedures.
48. As noted earlier, project disbursement was constrained by the lack of available funds. As noted in
Annex 1, project cost, combining original and additional financing, was estimated at US$15.1 million
equivalent. On June 30, 2009, IDA disbursements totaled US$15.7 million and Government disburse-
ments US$0.54 million, with the discrepancies due principally to large exchange rate fluctuations.
49. Project financial management (FM) was ensured by a small, stable staff of three persons. 17 While
early reviews noted project compliance with the disbursement procedures set forth in the DCA and with
international accounting standards, FM was downgraded from Highly Satisfactory to Moderately
Unsatisfactory in September 2005 when the mid-term review's recommendations were not implemented,
resulting in the continued failure to produce timely Interim Financial Reports (IFRs), delays in preparing
the annual budget, and weak internal controls. Renewed adherence to a detailed action plan to
strengthen FM and the subsequent full installation of a computerized accounting system (TOMPRO)
restored the rating to Satisfactory by May 2006 where it remained for the duration of the project.
Though the financial management rating remained as Satisfactory at project closing, several
insufficiencies were noted, including: (i) weak accounting and financial management at municipality
level, particularly with respect to submitting receipts; and (ii) non submission and or delay in submitting
IFRs. The last IFR of November 10, 2009, was received after a 3 month delay and does not provide
information on status of pending receipts with regards amounts transferred to municipalities, ministries,
and civil societies.
2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
50. Politically and institutionally, the project has established a good basis for the post-completion
continuation of the project's benefits: (i) appropriate legislation has been adopted (though not entirely
implemented); (ii) the authorities were successfully mobilized and maintain a high interest in the fight
against HIV/AIDS; and (iii) the project ultimately succeeded in reaching the entire population through
the municipalities and the civil society organizations. Further, the early investment in capacity building
enabled the structures put in place to adapt to the changing project implementation conditions, scaling
up quickly in 2003-04, prioritizing actions when funds ran short in 2005-06, and then scaling-up again
beginning in 2007. The inclusion of associations, including associations of PLWHA, as formal
stakeholders was a significant step in the society's approach to the epidemic.
51. Technically, the project contributed to the adoption of policies, strategies, protocols, etc., which
consolidated the national consensus in areas of prevention, treatment, and mitigation. In particular, the
project should be cited for its adherence to a multisectoral approach, the focus on youth (whether in


16
   The estimated budget for the implementation of the waste management plan was about US$ 2.6 million (or more than
25% of the initial credit); data on actual expenditures is lacking but it is doubtful that this amount was spent. CCS-
SIDA was asked to provide additional information on the implementation of the waste management plan but have not
yet responded to the request.
17
   Secretariat staff of CCS-SIDA was for the most part remarkably stable over the life of the project with most key
personnel present for virtually the entire project.

                                                                                                                   10
schools, or in their mandated army training tours, or in other forums), and the introduction of ARVs.
All of these contributions have been embraced by both govenment authorities and civil society
organizations.
52. While there was a hiatus in funding between the closing of the project and the availability of the
Global Fund money, 18 the Global Fund grant (of US$5.3 million over the first two years) will cover
approximately 90% of the gap between estimated total program costs and available financing.
3.      Assessment of Outcomes
3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
53. The relevance of all three of the project's objectives and components as well as its specific activities
is rated Substantial for both the original credit and for the additional financing based on: (i) Cape
Verde's epidemiological situation and program priorities during the two distinct phases of the fight
against HIV/AIDS in the country; and (ii) the Bank's current overall policies and country strategy.
54. Based on available data and an assessment of the country's elevated risk related to its open economy
and large number of migrants, the original credit (2002-06) implemented the recommended
multisectoral approach through line ministries and in support of a large number of civil society sub
projects to reach broad segments of the population concentrated in high-risk groups. After the 2005
IDSR results which: (i) staged the view of the epidemic to one with low prevalence; and (ii) influenced
the revision of the National Strategy 2006-10, the additional financing (2007-09) applied a more
targeted approach based on improved knowledge (both in the Bank and in Cape Verde) of the efficacy
of specific interventions and the importance of focusing on high-risk groups. To this end, the additional
financing: (i) shifted the focus from developing plans to executing them; (ii) emphasized interventions
and services for high-risk groups while maintaining prevention efforts through IEC and condom
promotion at all levels; and (iii) expanded the capacity for diagnosis and treatment.
55. The PDOs remained consistent with the country's international commitments (MDG's, the Three
Ones, etc.) and national strategies as presented in the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(GPRSP). With respect to the World Bank's country strategies, the Project's Development Objectives
(PDOs) contributed to: (i) the identification (in the CAS progress report of 2001) of HIV/AIDS as an
area for Bank support; and (ii) the inclusion of HIV/AIDS within the MAP framework (in the
subsequent CAS of 2002). A follow-on HIV/AIDS project was initially envisioned but replaced by
additional financing consistent with the high case scenario of the 2005 CAS.
3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives
56. Based on outcome indicators measuring the reduction of the spread of HIV infection (substantial)
and on other key performance indicators measuring mitigation of the health and socioeconomic impact
of HIV/AIDS on persons infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS (modest) and on building a strong and
sustainable national capacity to respond to the epidemic (substantial), the project's achievement of its
development objectives is rated as Substantial. The rating is justified below with details available in
the Data Sheet and in Annex 2 (presenting the results chain). Furthermore, each project objective (and
ultimately the overall project achievement rating) was weighted in proportion to the actual
disbursements of the original credit at the time of approval of the additional financing, according to
Appendix B of the Implementation and Completion Results Report Guidelines (OPCS/IEG, August
2006 updated June 2007).


18
  The final extension of the project closing date, from December 31, 2008 to June 30, 2009 was intended in part to
provide bridge money to the Global Fund financing, but as of December 30, 2009, the Global Fund financing was not
yet effective.

                                                                                                                 11
57. Given that IDA funds accounted for 85% of the national program resources for HIV/AIDS activities
over the period 2002-2009, much of the progress during the project period can be attributed to project
activities (Table 8).
58. Objective 1: Reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Borrower's population. The project
made a substantial contribution to the achievement of this PDO during both the period of the original
credit and the period of the additional financing. The country was successful in reducing prevalence of
HIV in the general population from 2.08% in 2002 to 0.8% in 2009; and among women attending anti-
natal clinics from 0.8% in 2005 to 0.5% in 2008. These results were linked to changing behavior by: (i)
raising the median age of first sex; (ii) increasing condom use with non-regular partners; (iii) reducing
the proportion of sexually active people reporting having non-regular sexual partners; and (iv) reducing
the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections.
59. Raised median age of first sexual relations (Indicators 5 and 8). The project initially aimed by 2005
to increase the median age by one year among both females and males and thereafter to maintain the
median age at that level. The project results are presented in the following table.
                                Table 2: Project results to raise the median age of first sex
                                                                          Objectives                Results

The table shows that by 2005, the project had achieved the envisioned results, but that it was unable to
maintain the results for males and females. Although the project was not able to sustain the initial gains
and achieve the PDO, the project did contribute to an increase of almost two years in the median age of
first sexual relations for females.
60. Increasing condom use (Indicators 6, 7, and 9). The project initially aimed by 2005 to increase the
proportion of the 15-49 age group reporting use of a condom in their last sexual act with a non-regular
partner to 60% for males and 30% for females and then subsequently by December 2008 to 75% for
males and 50% for females. The project results are presented in the following table.

                                                                          Objectives                Results

The table shows that there was a significant increase in the use of condoms from 43% of men in 2005 to
78.9% in 2009 and from 9% of women in 2005 to 67.6% in 2009. Further, the INE study (2009) found
that among the youngest men and women (aged 15-19 years) condom use was even higher: 83% for
men and 71% for women.
61. The project aimed during the second phase to increase condom use among the 922 commercial sex
workers identified in the country. However, given the small sample sizes of the baseline and follow-up
surveys, the outcome of this indicator cannot be confirmed as positive or negative.

The number of CSW reporting the use of condoms increased, but the proportion of CSW reporting the
use of condoms did not.
62. Reduced proportion of sexually active people reporting having non-regular sexual partners over the
previous 12 months (Indicator 3). The original indicator was modified as follows at the MTR: By
"December 2006, reduce from the baseline of 69% for men and 39% for women to 50% for men and
20% for women, the percentage of sexually active people reporting having had non-regular sexual
partners over the previous 12 months." IDSR II (2005) provided the following result: 66% for men and
43% for women, indicating that the result was not met. According to APIS, the actual values for men
and women were 54.4% and 41.5%, respectively in 2009.
63. Reducing the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (Indicator 4). The project initially aimed
by 2005 to reduce by 25% the incidence of reported STIs (urethritis) in men age 15-49 years; the
indicator was never reported on and was replaced by the objective to reduce by 25% the prevalence of
STIs among the community as measured by syphilis prevalence amongst pregnant women. The project
results are presented in the following table.

                                                                                     Objectives              Results

Overall, the project did not achieve the 25% reduction but made progress in reducing the prevalence of
STIs (as measured by syphilis among pregnant women attending ANC).
64. Reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS (Indicators 1 and 2). The following table presents data from the
ANC sentinel sites and the sero-prevalence study over the period 2002-2008:
                                                           Table 6: HIV prevalence results

 (compared with the first year of the project).
 Baseline: ANC Sentinel; 2002-04: ANC Sentinel; 2005: IDSR II; 2006-08: ANC Sentinel

While acknowledging the limitation of both indicators, evidence from sentinel surveillance suggests that
HIV prevalence (for the general population and among pregnant women aged 15-24 years old attending
ANC) shows a decline.
65. In addition to these outcomes, the project achieved a number of other important results related to
reducing the spread of HIV:


                                                                                                                                         13
        The proportion of HIV positive pregnant women receiving preventive treatment for mother-to-
        child transmission (MTCT) of HIV surpassed initial targets and increased from 0 to 80% by
        2005 and to 100% by 2006.
        Voluntary counseling and testing services were expanded to all the municipalities and the
        number of persons tested has doubled since 2005. Significantly, among pregnant women
        attending antenatal services, 10% were tested in 2005, 94% are now tested, and the test is
        considered virtually routine.
        Though less impressive, results in Table 17 showed improvement in other areas of prevention as
        well (e.g., sensitization of vulnerable groups, blood transfusion, etc.)
66. Objective 2: Mitigating the health and socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS on persons infected
with or affected by HIV/AIDS. Though no outcome indicators were linked to this PDO, other
measures of achievement show that the project made modest progress in achieving this PDO during the
original credit and substantial progress with the additional financing. The overall rating for achievement
of this objective, using the ICRR guidelines, is modest.
67. Providing home or community-based support to PLWHA (Indicators 11 and 15). Social networks
for people affected by HIV/AIDS were by 2005 being implemented in all 17 municipalities. Though the
proportion of PLWHA benefiting from home or community-based support did not meet the targets for
2004 and 2006, this was in part due to the increased number of PLWHA who were being monitored19 as
part of the support system, as shown in the table below:
                   Table 7: Proportion of reported PLWHA receiving home or community-based support
                                                      Objectives                   Results

     Cumulative number of registered PLWHA                                30      318       503      746    1 018
     Number of persons receiving support                                  10       38       120      142      230

     form of home or community-based support
     Source: SE CCS-SIDA data

Overall, the number of PLWHA benefiting from home or community-based support increased from 10
in 2004 to 120 in 2006 and then virtually doubled by 2008.
68. ARV treatment (Indicator 20). As shown in Table 7, the number of PLWHA being monitored has
increased from 30 in 2005 to 1018 at the end of 2008; the number being treated with ARVs has
increased from 148 in 2005 to 462 (or 75% of those estimated to require treatment) were being treated
with ARVs. While there were periods during which stockouts of ARVs occurred in the supply chain,
the health authorities were able to provide adequate alternative solutions while emergency measures
were instituted to acquire the recommended drugs.
69. In addition to these results, the project also provided support for more than 500 orphans or more
than 10% of the orphan population estimated at 5,000 by the Solidarity Foundation.
70. Objective 3: Building a strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS
epidemic. Though no outcome indicators were linked to this PDO either, the project made substantial
contributions to this PDO during both the period of the original credit and the period of the additional

  In Table 18, the denominator used by the project to measure those targeted by the home visits is the number of
PLWHA identified at the "treatment poles" but not meeting the criteria for ART.

                                                                                                                    14
financing. Consequently, the overall rating for this PDO is substantial as evidenced by the results with
regards the following intermediate indicators:
       Training targets for ministries (Indicator 1), municipalities (Indicator 2), and NGOs (Indicator 3)
       were met and surpassed. The target for training all ministry HIV/AIDS teams in IEC (Indicator
       8) was partially met, with teams were trained in the priority ministries of health, education,
       defense, youth, and labor/social welfare.
       Though about a year late in implementing their HIV/AIDS actions plans, roughly two-thirds of
       Ministries (Indicator 4) and non-ministry national public sector agencies (Indicator 7) were doing
       so by 2004. All of the 17 municipalities were implementing an action plan by 2004 (Indicator
       10) and submitting acceptable financial reports (Indicator 13).
       NGOs and community associations were financed at the funding levels targeted by the project
       (Indicator 16) and submitted acceptable financial reports.
       The proportion of private sector entities investing in HIV/AIDS activities exceeded the project's
       target (Indicator 21).
       The project submitted a progress report every six months (Indicator 17).
71. In addition to these results, it should be noted in summary that the project succeeded in expanding
the national capability from a small unit within the Ministry of Health to a range of public and private
sector entities at national, municipal, and local levels and that these entities have in turn ultimately
succeeded in reaching the entire population.
72. Overall achievement result. Because the project was restructured and the indicators revised in
2006, the ICR guidelines require that the project outcome be assessed against both the original and the
revised project outcomes with separate outcome ratings weighted in proportion to the share of actual
credit disbursements made in the periods before (when 69% of the total credit was disbursed) and after
formal approval of the revision. Table 10 shows achievement (efficacy) ratings for each of the PDO
according to the guidelines, with an overall achievement rating of substantial. The worksheet detailing
the calculations leading to these results is available from the Project Files.
73. The project's importance for these results is shown by: (i) the Global Fund proposal indicating that
the project's share of total country financing for HIV/AIDS activities over the period 2002-09 was about
85%; and (ii) an ACTafrica survey (July 2008) estimating project contributions to certain key results:

3.3    Efficiency
74. Project efficiency was rated as Modest based on considerations of: (i) the allocation of funds to the
sub-projects; (ii) the project management unit's efforts to enhance implementation efficiency by
expanding capacity over the life of the project; and (iii) the results achieved relative to the costs,
particularly during the second phase of the project.
75. Analysis of the allocation of funds to the sub-projects shows a shift of resources from the period of

                    Source: SE CCS-SIDA data

From financing sub-projects emphasizing broad population groups (women, youths and the general
population) in the early years, the project shifted to financing sub-projects targeting high-risk and
vulnerable groups, and specific interventions in support of those infected and affected by the epidemic
in the later years. Table 17 in Annex 2 demonstrates conclusively that while the number of general
preventive activities declined over the period 2007-09, both IEC/BCC activities for vulnerable groups
and activities targeted to condom distribution, treatment of STIs, and VCT (for all groups but especially
for high-risk populations) increased substantially.



                                                                                                          16
76. Analysis of the sub-project allocations and overall project results show that project management was
able to simultaneously address a range of institutional, financial, and technical considerations.
Institutionally, the project focused in the early years on building skills among potential public and
private implementing agencies to develop capacity for expanding services later.20 For instance, the
project: (i) used the existing Administrative Unit to complement and then train CCS-SIDA personnel,
whose skills were then transferred to 8 facilitators recruited to assist the 22 municipalities; (ii) tested
approaches and relied on the NGO Platform as an umbrella organization to help other NGOs requiring
particular assistance in sub-project preparation and implementation; (iii) financed the key non-health
ministries (Youth, Education, and Defense) before financing others; and (iv) assisted the Ministry of
Health in establishing protocols, treatment procedures, and practices for ARV treatment before
expanding treatment to all of the municipalities. 21
77. Financially, the rapid disbursement of project funds and the results of the 2005 IDSR forced the
project to further prioritize and sequence activities based on the experience gained. As a result of
limited funding in 2005-06, the project limited expenditures to: (i) the institutional structure, (ii) the
ARV pilot, and (iii) support for selective funding of M&E. At the same time, however, the project was
able to sustain intersectoral coordination, increase interest and commitment with civil society, and lay
the groundwork for transferring greater responsibility for sub-project approval.
78. Technically, the project was able to balance the competing demands of financing sub-projects,
producing concrete results with difficult to access populations, and allocating sufficient resources to
ensure the highly visible treatment and mitigation efforts.
3.4       Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
79. Based on consideration of the various ratings criteria and indicators and disbursement prior to and
after the approval of the Additional Financing, the following table presents the overall outcome rating
for the project as Moderately Satisfactory.

   An evaluation of the first year of the ARV pilot was conducted in December 2005; based on the positive results of the
evaluation, the ARV intervention was considered to be a priority.

3.5        Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
80. While the PAD noted the importance of poverty and gender disparities for the spread of HIV/AIDS
and the need to address vulnerability factors, project implementation did not focus explicitly on these
themes nor did project supervision systematically address them. The project did, however, contribute
to:
            adoption of legislation to reduce stigma and discrimination, though interviews in Cape Verde
            suggest that very little has been done to implement the legislation;22
            development of associations of PLWHA and support for persons affected by HIV/AIDS, with
            more than 10% of total project expenditures spent on psycho-social support for PLWHA and
            for persons affected by HIV/AIDS; and
            identification of Cape Verde's population of orphans and vulnerable children (which was
            estimated at about 1500 in 2005-06) and support (medical, educational, and psycho-social) for
            this population.
81. More broadly, there is a consensus that the project had a significant impact on: (i) transforming the
discussion of HIV from a taboo subject to a national issue and that the resulting information of the
population has been crucial (even if changes in behavior have not been commensurate with increasing
knowledge of the disease); and (ii) establishing the responsibilities of the municipalities and the local
communities in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
82. As a multisectoral operation, the project was not intended to address major institutional or long-term
reforms within any one sector. The project did, however, strengthen certain key institutional changes
by: (i) making the national HIV/AIDS program multisectoral and mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities
into the action plan of every Government agency; (ii) ensuring a participatory national HIV/AIDS
program with private sector (for-profit and not-for-profit) participation and community empowerment;
(iii) expanding the national capability from a small unit within the Ministry of Health to a range of
public and private sector entities at national, municipal, and local levels, and by this, reaching the entire
population; and (iv) strengthening the capacity of national and municipal structures (particularly through
the recruitment of facilitators for the municipalities and of the NGO platform to assist other groups and
associations) as well as the Executive Secretariat of the CCS-SIDA for national coordination. Given
these achievements supported by the project, institutional change is rated substantial.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
83. Three positive unintended results of the project should be cited. First, several of the approaches
used by the project were "copied" for other interventions by the Government: (i) the multisectoral
approach was subsequently employed for use in combating other diseases (malaria and TB); and (ii) the
IEC campaign for HIV/AIDS was adapted to address the country's drug problem. Second, the project's
support for NGOs expanded their range of expertise (previously limited mostly to agriculture and rural
development) into the area of health. Third, because of the difficulties encountered in procuring ARVs
and other consumables in small quantities, the national drug manufacturing company (INPHARMA) has
begun examining the feasibility of producing ARVs in Cape Verde for countries in the sub-region; the
requisite studies leading to WHO certification was already underway.




22
     The DHS (2005) found that only 16% of those interviewed indicated the requisite tolerance for PLWHA.

                                                                                                            18
3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
84. Beneficiary assessments were not organized either prior to or at the end of the project. Similarly,
stakeholder workshops were not organized.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
85. Politically, administratively, and programmatically, the risks would seem to be negligible to low.
Government commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS is clear at central and municipality levels, and the
institutional measures and strategic documentation provide a sound framework for continued progress.
The growing program responsibilities for municipalities and the increasing participation of civil society
have strengthened implementation capacities at decentralized levels, not only for combating HIV/AIDS
but also for other initiatives. Administratively, the complementary responsibilities of CCS-SIDA and
the Ministry of Health have contributed to an effective implementation of the national strategy.
86. There are, however, important concerns about the financial future and sustainability of the measures
established between 2001 and 2009. These concerns were noted during preparation and at the mid-term
review; they were cited as a continuing risk and a major reason for seeking additional funds in 2006; and
they have been a preoccupation of supervision missions since 2007. The slowness with which
counterpart funding has been made available and the reduction in CCS-SIDA staff on the closing date of
the project are also worrisome, but as a middle income country, Cape Verde does have the means to
provide adequate resources for the national response to the epidemic. Further, the approval of the
country's Global Fund application (though not effective at the time of project closing) will provide an
additional period for transitioning to a sustainable funding level. However, given the uncertainties
about: (i) the timing of and conditions for using the expected GF financing; and (ii) the medium-term
prospects for financing the national program, the risk to development outcome is considered moderate.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
87. The Bank successfully pursued a project preparation strategy based on: (i) drawing lessons learned
from earlier MAPs with relevance for the Cape Verdean situation23; and (ii) developing a broad
consensus among all stakeholders to ensure that the enthusiasm generated during project preparation
would not dissipate during implementation. The Bank largely succeeded (both for the initial credit and
for the additional financing) in establishing the conditions for smooth implementation by: (i) building on
existing strengths (e.g., the national strategy, the complementary roles of CCS-SIDA and the Ministry of
Health, the skills of the Administrative Unit and subsequently the Executive Secretariat) for project
implementation, etc.); and (ii) sustaining the dynamism for rapid implementation of the project
components (e.g., through capacity building, expansion of sub-project initiatives to municipalities and
NGOs and other civil society organizations).




23
  The PAD cited Uganda and Senegal in particular and emphasized, among other factors, the importance of: (i) political
commitment; (ii) vulnerability factors as key drivers of the epidemic; and (iii) community participation as a process of
empowerment.

                                                                                                                     19
88. Processing of both credits was completed in a timely manner. Preparation of the initial credit was
helped by frequent technical visits from individual members of the preparation team in addition to the
scheduled missions; preparation of the additional financing was straightforward. In both instances,
other partners were consulted regularly and differences among them were handled with skill by the Task
Teams.
89. While project preparation for both the original credit and the additional financing succeeded in
establishing many of the principal elements for project implementation (e.g., administrative structures,
capabilities for procurement, accounting, etc.), it was less successful in organizing the modalities for
measuring project results. Among the shortcomings were: (i) the lack of initial baseline data information
for some indicators; (ii) the absence of outcome indicators for two of the three PDOs (though
intermediate outcome indicators were assigned); and (iii) the unavailability and/or lack of analysis of
data for certain key indicators all contributed to a somewhat difficult appreciation of the project's
progress.24
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
90. Given the large number of implementers and initiatives, the need for intensive supervision was
identified early on in the preparation process, and a number of donor agencies based in Cape Verde
expressed a willingness to assist in future supervisions. While this collaboration was not fully realized,
the Bank did respect its commitment to intensive supervision through the mid-term review before
returning to the usual rhythm of supervision thereafter.25 The mid-term review was organized as
planned (in September 2004); and the ICRR process was initiated during the final supervision mission.
Periodic assessments were also carried out by procurement and financial management specialists.
91. Among the strengths of Bank supervision were: (i) the continuity of the Task Team (with essentially
two TTLs over the life of the project26); (ii) its extensive support (with assistance from GAMET) for
strengthening monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) its frankness in informing the Government of how the
project was being rated within the Bank.27 In addition, the Task Teams responded in a timely manner to
requests for changes in the DCA and for non objections and other approvals. It should also be noted that
the Bank played proactive and important roles: (i) during the first phase of the project by encouraging
and assisting the Government in the adoption of protocols and the procurement of supplies for ARV
treatment; and (ii) during the second phase of the project by promoting the empowerment of the
municipalities and NGOs in the delivery of services.
92. The most important weaknesses were noted during the second phase, when, despite repeated efforts,
the supervision missions were unable to resolve key implementation problems related to: (i) project
financing, with respect to both counterpart financing (where an Satisfactory rating was maintained
throughout project implementation until downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory during the last
supervision mission); (ii) the collection of the necessary data on project outcomes (particularly toward
the end of the project); and (iii) the use the M&E data to present a clear description of the project's
progress (where the use of more output data might have provided Bank management with a better
evidentiary basis for commenting on and making informed decisions about what was actually occurring
on the ground.


24
   In addition to the usual covenants for counterpart funding and project audit and financial reporting, the only other
covenant in the DCA dealt with M&E, but this covenant was not systematically addressed in the ISRs.
25
   There was one notable hiatus in project supervision between late 2005 and late 2006.
26
   A third TTL managed the project but only to prepare the additional financing, not to supervise implementation.
27
   The aide memoires constitute a rare instance (in this author's experience) of where ISR ratings are noted in the aide
memoire and explained to the Government.

                                                                                                                           20
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
93. The Task Team's design of the initial and follow-on projects, its encouragement of specific
Government initiatives (to decentralize sub project funding, to introduce ARVs, etc.), its flexibility in
responding to changes in the project implementation environment, and its continuing frank dialogue
with the Government were all satisfactory. Due to some shortcomings in M&E design and in
supervision in the later stages of project implementation, Bank performance justifies a Moderately
Satisfactory rating.
5.2     Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
94. As previously indicated, Government contributed to many positive aspects of the fight against
HIV/AIDS, including: (i) clear political and institutional commitment; (ii) progress in establishing an
enabling environment based on the Three Ones (a comprehensive strategy, a single coordinating body
with participation by all stakeholders, and a common M&E framework); (iii) development of and
reliance on the implementation capabilities of governmental, non governmental, and community-level
organizations; and (iv) technical progress in monitoring the development of the epidemic. However, as
a result of its inability to provide adequate and timely counterpart financing and to leverage Bank
funding to establish a sustainable basis for financing the fight against HIV/AIDS, the Government's
performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
95. Though financial management and M&E were occasionally rated less than satisfactory in the ISRs,
implementation progress in general and project management in particular were never rated less than
satisfactory until the final ISR.28 This assessment is justified by project management's: (i) achievement
(and often overachievement) of planned outputs; (ii) timely accomplishment of major project milestones
(the mid-term review, and the Borrower's ICR); (iii) adaptation to changed circumstances (whether to
decrease disbursement and safeguard project priorities in 2005-06 or to increase disbursement after
receiving the additional funding 2007); and (iv) ability to quickly resolve implementation issues and to
respond to requests for information and/or to produce specific analyses of project data.
96. Of particular note are project management's: (i) adherence to the principles of multi sectoriality and
participation; (ii) institutional relationships with the Administrative Unit (of the Transport Project) and
the Ministry of Health, both of which could have been problematic but which were extremely positive
for the project; and (iii) contribution to capacity building in the transfer of responsibilities and
capabilities to the municipalities and to civil society organizations.
97. However, within the Executive Secretariat, some weaknesses in procurement, financial
management, and M&E were noted at various times. And among the other implementing agencies


28
  Financial management was downgraded from S to MU after the mid-term review when the recommendation to
improve accounting procedures at the municipality level was not implemented; the rating was subsequently raised to S
for the rest of the project. M&E was downgraded to MS toward the end of the project based in part on the inability to
develop the requisite outcome information. It should be noted that project management was somewhat strained toward
the end of the project with the departure of the long-time executive director, the need to disburse remaining project
funds, and the demands of responding to the Global Fund's application procedures.

                                                                                                                   21
(ministries, municipalities, NGOs, civil society organizations, etc.), there were also periodic difficulties
in submitting adequate plans, disbursing and accounting for funds, and reporting on results achieved.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
98. The Moderately Satisfactory performance of the Government and the Moderately Satisfactory
performance of the Implementing Agency yield an overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory.
6.      Lessons Learned
99. The PAD's thorough analysis of the lessons learned from the early MAPs was confirmed during
project implementation; the project's attempts to apply these lessons during project implementation were
neither straightforward nor easy. Examples of some of the difficulties from the Cape Verde project may
be important for other projects.
100. A multisectoral strategy requires does not mean that the funding should not be targeted. As IEG
has noted, the Bank should focus support for implementation on those sectors where activities have the
greatest potential impact on the epidemic and with some comparative advantage in implementation--
such as the Ministry of Health, and those ministries related to the military, education, and transport.
This project shows that, even if a project has started with the objective of covering all line ministries (as
in the first-generation MAPs, it has in fact put more focus on certain ministries such as the Ministry of
Health that received 64% of the overall funding allocated to line ministries, including education and
youth (14%) (Annex 2). This makes sense as these are the ministries with the largest number of
employees and most vulnerable (e.g teachers and medical personel posted in remote areas).
101. Implementation of a multisectoral strategy requires that roles and responsibilities (along with the
accompanying human and financial resources) be defined and respected by the various public and
private actors. While the project succeeded in building capacity through traditional means (training,
TA, etc.), its greater success may have been in focusing (as noted in the PAD) on facilitation and
coordination rather than command and control. By empowering public authorities and private agencies
at all levels, the project enabled these actors to buy in and contribute significantly to the achievement of
the project's objectives, particularly in the areas of awareness raising and prevention.
102. It is a challenge to ensure political commitment to target vulnerable populations. The key to
maintaining political commitment at all levels are not necessarily compatible with improving the
targeting of vulnerability factors. The transition from (i) information and sensitization of the general
population to (ii) support for more focused groups (women, youths, orphans, etc.) to (iii) actions aimed
at the specific drivers of the epidemic (commercial sex workers, drug users, mobile populations, etc.) or
persons living with HIV/AIDS has implications for local mayors (who may be less interested politically
in certain groups) and for civil society organizations (who may lack the skills for working with these
targeted groups).
103. For monitoring and evaluation to be useful over the long-haul, certain critical elements must be
in place form the beginning. The need for robust M&E is well-known but it is critical that certain
elements be correctly established from the beginning. While systems can always be improved, the lack
of baseline data for selected indicators and timely follow-up complicates results-oriented project
supervision by the countries and by the Bank's internal management (through the ISRs). Most projects
cannot fully recover from such an initial handicap during implementation and are consequently
penalized at the time of the ICR.
7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies: The Borrower has prepared a comprehensive final
evaluation report in Portuguese, which did not contain a summary. The task team and the Borrower

                                                                                                          22
agreed on the data at the time of the ICR mission and on those contain in the Borrower's report,
which used the same source of information. Hence, additional issues reflected in the Borrower's
final report and related to the Borrower's concerns with respect to the constraints on project
implementation (Part D) and the report's conclusions (Part E) are presented in Annex 7 in English.
The Borrower's final evaluation report is available from the Project Files.

Annex 2: Outputs by Component
          The project involved: (i) reducing the spread of HIV infection in the country; (ii) mitigating
HIV/AIDS health and socioeconomic impact at the individual, household and community levels; and
(iii) establishing a strong, sustainable national response to the epidemic. During both phases of project
implementation, the project relied on mainstreaming program activities into line ministries and agencies
at national/municipality levels and harnessing the capacity of communities and NGOs/CSOs to provide
services. However, from 2002-06 the initial credit reflected the traditional MAP approach, while from
2007-09, the additional financing adopted a more targeted approach.
        Reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. As shown in the following table, the project's health
results were generally positive for the output and intermediate objectives.

        The project achieved its projected outputs and increased significantly the percentage of pregnant
women using VCT; in fact, health facility personnel indicated that this is now considered to be part of
the overall battery of pre natal tests provided for all pregnant women. While there were periods during
which stockouts of ARVs occurred, the health authorities were able to provide alternative solutions
while emergency orders were being acquired.
        As indicated in the main text and indicated in the table below, the project in all likelihood
contributed maintaining the low rate of HIV prevalence in Cape Verde.

        Mitigating the socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS. Though no specific indicators were
proposed to measure the mitigation of the socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS, the allocation of
resources over the two phases of the project indicate the attention that was paid to persons infected and
affected by the epidemic. During the period 2002-06, 16% of the sub project funds were allocated to

same groups, with the funds used for diagnosis, treatment, and psycho-social support.
        Establishing a strong and sustainable national capacity. Though no specific indicators
measured this result, several findings suggest that a national capacity to respond to the epidemic was
established. Anecdotally, discussions with the principal actors responsible for mainstreaming activities
describe a profound change since 2002 in: (i) the country's willingness to discuss and respond to the
threat of HIV/AIDS; (ii) the various institutional measures to establish structures at all levels of society
and to protect PLWHA; and (iii) the participation in sub-projects of all ministries and municipalities as
well as some 70 CSO's and private sector enterprises, which attests to the widespread interest in
implementing programs to combat HIV/AIDS.
        Institutional measures at different levels of society. As shown in the table below, with a few
qualifications, the project was able to mainstream HIV/AIDS activities.

        Though the project met or surpassed its objectives with respect to mainstreaming activities into
municipalities, civil society organizations, and the private sector, the results varied somewhat among
these three entities. As shown in the table and documented by the sub-project results in this annex, with
respect to line ministries and non-ministry public sector agencies:



                                                                                                                                               26
          Ministries quickly established IEC agents, but preparation and financing of action plans was
          limited until 2007; in 2008, the project set allocations by ministry to implement action plans,
          accounting for the fact that 100% of ministries were able to implement their respective plans.
          Ultimately, all 13 line ministries and a number of other national agencies received funding, but
          the Ministry of Health was the principal recipient (receiving 64% of all sub-project funding);
          the ministries of education and youth were the other major recipients (receiving 14%).
          With the exception of 2003, only a few non-ministry public sector agencies actually
          participated in the program.
          The effort to incorporate HIV/AIDS in a skills-based learning approach advanced very slowly,
          and only in 2009 was the curriculum finalized.
        Similarly, municipalities and civil society organized themselves quickly in 2003-04 to receive
sub-project funding, and large numbers of sub-projects and great amounts were subsequently allocated
based on demand; in 2005-06, very few sub-projects received funding; and in 2007-09, the demand
driven approach was complemented with fixed allocations to each of the municipalities. A total of 95
municipal and 488 community sub-projects were funded by the project.
        Participation in sub-projects. Data collected by CCS-SIDA on the numbers and amounts of sub-
projects approved annually demonstrate the development of national capacity by location, type of
intervention, and beneficiary group. Overall, as shown in the following table, some 800 sub-projects
were approved with CSOs receiving almost two-thirds of the approved projects:

Financially, the Ministry of Health was the biggest beneficiary and received almost 40% of the sub-
project funds approved. As indicated in the text, sub-project approval occurred in two large waves,
interrupted by almost two years of limited financial resources. More detailed information by ministry,
municipality, and civil society may be found in this annex.
        Overall, as shown in the following table, more than 80% of the sub-projects were aimed at
youths and the general population during both phases of the project, but the share of allocated resources
declined from 74% in the first phase to 26% in the second phase as the average amount of the sub-
project allocation decreased from 1.3 million to 0.4 million CVE.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
Economic impact of the Cape Verde MAP HIV/AIDS Project
        No specific economic analysis was carried out during preparation of either phase of the Cape
Verde MAP. Instead, both PADs referred to the economic analysis contained in Annex 5 of the Multi-
Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region (Report No. 20727 AFR), which included a cost-
benefit analysis of HIV/AIDS interventions and an assessment of the overall impact of HIV/AIDS on
the economy. The main findings of the assessment as summarized in the PAD were as follows:
       HIV/AIDS has a negative effect on productivity levels, domestic savings and overall economic
       growth.
       HILV/AIDS increases health costs and runs the risks of crowding out other key public health
       programs, such as immunization, maternal and child health, malaria and parasitic diseases.
       Care and treatment of AIDS patients imposes high costs on families and reduces their earning
       capacity.
       Family coping strategies may result in children abandoning school or the family cutting other
       health or social expenditures to unacceptable levels.
        Though difficult to quantify and impossible to attribute solely to the MAP, a number of
potentially positive economic impacts of the project have been highlighted in the text for individuals and
households, for private sector firms and the Government, and for the economy as a whole. These are
summarized by level in the following paragraphs.
        Individual and household levels. From the perspective of slowing the spread of HIV, the
project focused on the appropriate elements of the population (particularly among youths, who are the
most potentially productive segment of the population) with the appropriate interventions for slowing
the spread of HIV (condom distribution, VCT, etc.). Then, when the IDSR indicated that this was
happening, the project shifted resources to the diagnosis and treatment of PLWHA and to the mitigation
of the effects on the affected families.
       Prevention: The argument for the potentially positive economic impact of the Cape Verde MAP
on prevention is based on the findings that:
       the median age of first sex has increased for young women, though it has decreased for young
       men;
       comprehensive knowledge has increased significantly (2005 IDSR), and the use of condoms
       with non regular partners has increased significantly (particularly for females); and
       sexually active Cape Verdiens are increasingly seeking testing for HIV, both among the general
       population and especially among pregnant women.
        Treatment: The Cape Verde MAP did not attempt to estimate the potential number of deaths
that could be or were averted by introducing ART, but the positive impact of treatment seems clear
based on the findings that:
       Cape Verde has dramatically increased as more than a thousand cases are being monitored and
       some 460 are receiving ARVs;
       management of PLWHA has improved with: (i) enrollment rates based on average CD4 and
       WHO stage on enrollment comparable to those in other countries; and (ii) relatively low loss to
       follow up; and


                                                                                                       32
        the project provided the means for helping households cope with the direct and indirect costs of
        illness, by providing medical and psycho-social assistance, nutritional support, and educational
        support for OVC.
Unfortunately, no assessment of the beneficiaries of MAP funded sub projects was carried out to suggest
how these sub-projects might have contributed to the overall quality of their lives, but it seems clear
that the project has contributed in at least small ways to mitigating the epidemic's direct and indirect
costs at the household level.
        Firms. The growth in the number of firms (from 2 of 85 to 19 of 85 in just three years) attests
to the importance attached to the fight against HIV/AIDS by the private sector.
       Government level. The project addressed non-health government agencies as well as the
Ministry of Health.
        Non-health agencies: Though not explicitly measured, the effects of the project on the
ministries of youth and education as well as on the uniformed services was probably substantial,
especially in terms of prevention, through sensitization and IEC, the distribution of condoms, and the
increase in voluntary counseling and testing. Immediate benefits among other non-health agencies and
for the municipalities are less likely to have been substantial, particularly after the second phase shifted
the emphasis from IEC activities to treatment and impact mitigation activities.
        Health agencies: The PAD's concern that the cost of HIV/AIDS might crowd out other key
public health programs did not occur for the simple reason that the MAP did not attract the amounts of
additional financing which were expected. An analysis of HIV expenditures as a proportion of total
health expenditures was not carried out.
        Economy. The effects of the project's impact on the economy as a whole have not been closely
examined; it is probably too soon, and there are certainly other confounding factors. But with presumed
declining incidence, increasing numbers of patients treated, and improved efforts to mitigate the effects
of the disease, the project did contribute to those elements which would be expected to have an effect on
productivity and the economy as a whole.
Financial sustainability of the Cape Verde HIV/AIDS Project
         From a strictly financial perspective, the sustainability of some of the project's benefits will be
greatly improved by the arrival of the Global Fund. The prospects of sustaining the public sector and
civil society activities funded under the project are mixed with some associations being self sufficient,
other organizations attracting new sources of financing, and some institutions may be adversely affected
if they do not identify alternative sources of funding. Of immediate concern at project closing was the
Global Fund's anticipated contribution from the Government.

Extract from the Government of Cape Verde Report on the Project (Translation of Parts D
and E of the Government's report)


D ­ Main Constraints

Implementation of the project was marked by various phases and a variety of difficulties, which
were perhaps normal in the context of a fairly complex solution, from both an organizational and
philosophical standpoint.

First, the multisectoral nature of the project, involving a host of different organizations and
institutions, should be noted.

Second, the choice of a decentralized execution approach entailed participation and management by
the Municipal Committees represented on all the councils in the country.

Given that the organizational and work approaches were new, the philosophy behind these
approaches was not always grasped at the desired speed, nor was this philosophy fully assimilated.

Taking all observations into account, the following are the main constraints identified with project
execution:

 Lack of experience on the part of many organizations with the design, preparation, and
   management of subprojects;

 Organizational weaknesses within a significant number of execution agencies, particularly
   community-based entities;

 Slow response times by some public execution agencies in the areas of submission of
   subprojects, financial absorption capacity, and submission of supporting documents;

 A host of accounting difficulties and delays, particularly with supporting documents for
   expenditures and the provision of data related to programmatic activities;

 Unstable organizational structures within Municipal Committees, with staff turnover resulting
   from electoral cycles. The investment made in personnel training is lost, along with knowledge
   of procedures and practices learned during project implementation;



                                                                                                 38
 The random nature of the disbursement system, which did not follow a fixed schedule for
   projects of this nature, proved inappropriate and had a negative impact on the development of
   activities by many subprojects and on the replenishment of a number of accounts;

 The delay in the reallocation of resources led to major bottlenecks and delays in disbursement
   by the Executive Secretariat to execution agencies and, as a result, to the extension of
   subprojects beyond the initially projected timeframes;

 The procurement system, run through UNICEF in Copenhagen, was not easy to manage. As a
   result, systematic delays were experienced with filling orders for reagents and ARV medication,
   leading the country to resort to emergency purchases from time to time; and

 Another problem stemmed from the fact that funding of projects of this nature, based on a
   revolving fund, with no safe guarantees being provided with respect to advances provided at the
   outset, can lead to problems. Consequently, owing to the fact that no guarantees were required
   in exchange for funds advanced, some of the funds provided are currently considered
   unrecoverable, while other funds, amounting to close to US$105,00, are tied up in legal
   proceedings.

E ­ Conclusions

The project contributed significantly to controlling the epidemic in Cape Verde, with the total
number of cases remaining at under one percent.

ARV treatment represented a significant step forward, leading to substantial improvements in the
treatment plan used up to that point, and offered hope and quality of life to patients.

The introduction of ARV treatment led to greater participation in HIV screening activities, with the
number of tests increasing from 8,000 in 2005 to 16,000 in 2008.

For the foregoing reasons, it can be concluded that:

 The project facilitated effective control of the epidemic;

 The main critical points such as vertical transmission and blood transmission are under control;

 Sexual transmission is fairly well controlled, with more targeted activities being required among
   the over 35 age group;

 The project guaranteed mitigation of the impact of HIV/AIDS on infected and affected persons;
   and

 The project provided a structured framework for combating AIDS in the country, which should
   remain in place with a view to the current and future control of the epidemic in Cape Verde.

Comments from the Government of December 29, 2009 to the Draft ICRR

Indicator 3a:
It was not prudent to commit to reduce, in 4 years, almost 20% of a change as it relates to
behavioral issues. This is a non-realistic target since behavioral aspects take time to occur.

Indicator 8:
According to data from the APIS 2009, the median age at first intercourse is:
Boys: 15 years
Girls: 16 years
There is an apparent decrease of the median age of first intercourse for boys from 17 to 15 years and
for girls from 17.2 to 16 years.
However, it noted that about 56% of those surveyed said they had not yet initiated sexual activity,
which suggests that most young Cape Verdeans initiate sexual activity at a later age than the median
ages show.
Beyond the numbers, this indicator should be interpreted in a qualitative manner.

Indicator 4:
This indicator has been altered during the mid-term review. The content was revised as follows:
"All ministries have and are implementing their Action Plans"
The mid-term review concluded that: "this indicator fully achieved its target at mid-term as all the
line ministries are implementing HIV/ AIDS work plans." This is an indicator that is cumulative.

Indicator 15: 29 This indicator was revised during the mid-term review, and can be further
described in the aide-memoire of the mid-term review.
In 2004 when HAART was introduced, 30 PLWHAs, of which 5, were advised to start treatment
with antiretroviral drugs.
Of the 5 who began treatment (all adults) received psychological support, nutritional and home
visits.
Also in 2004, 40 orphans received support from the project ( 25 girls and 15 boys) as follows:
· Psychological
· Food aid
· School supplies
In 2006, 503 PLWHAs were confirmed, of which 242 were on HAART and received support as
follows:
. 120 (all who were in stages III and IV) received psychological and nutritional support;
. 15 ICT activities and AGR;
. 54 with other type of supports
Also in 2006, 199 orphans received support similar to those already mentioned (psychological,
nutritional, etc.).

review aide-memoire is available in the Project files.



                                                                                                   40
Pag. 12 (paragraph 58. Raised median age of first sexual relations)
Although targets were not achieved, it should be noted however that about 56% of those surveyed
in the same age group, had not initiated sexual activity, which suggests that most young Cape
Verdeans begin sexual activity at a later age than the median age.

Pag. 14 (paragraph 66. Objective 2: Mitigating the health and socioeconomic impact of HIV / AIDS
on persons infected with or affected by HIV / AIDS)
Though no outcome indicators were linked to this PDO, the project made modest progress in
achieving it.

Paragraph 67. Providing home or community-based support to PLWHA (Indicators 11 and 15).
This objective should be assessed in light with the following aspects:
1) The country has a concentrated epidemic and not generalized to the population;
2) The number of reported cases of PLWHA includes people infected with HIV without AIDS,
people with AIDS and under treatment, HIV-positive people under treatment, HIV-positive people
who work, people who work under HAART, HIV-positive children, pregnant women under
treatment for prevention against vertical transmission, etc..
3) All cases at stages III and IV of the disease are first treated in hospitals, there are then sent back
to the community where they are followed by local health facilities.
4) The relationship between the numerator and denominator represented in the table does not reflect
what the revised indicator intends to measure, then we suggest a review of the classification of
objective 2.
5) All cases in stages III and IV of the disease received medical, psychological and social supports.

Pag. 15
3.3 Efficiency
Analysis of the allocation of funds to the sub-projects shows a shift of resources from the period of
the original credit to the period of the additional financing:

At mid-term review, a consensus was reached in raising awareness and social mobilization as the
project had already achieved the objective of mobilizing the Cape Verdean society to the problem of
HIV / AIDS, and from that time it was necessary to refocus the strategy for more targeted
interventions. Hence, interventions were focused on the most vulnerable groups, which resulted in
the approval of more projects and the allocation of more resources towards those groups.

Pag. 17
Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Paragraph 104. Based on consideration of the various ratings, criteria, indicators, and disbursement
prior to and after the approval of the Additional Financing, the following table presents the overall
outcome rating for the project as Moderately Satisfactory.
It is necessary to review the classification of objective 2, taking into account the reasons set out in
paragraphs 66 and 67 of the ICR. 30



30
   Note from ICRR team: Using the rating procedures required by OPCS, and especially IEG, three
ratings of Modest for objective 2 require an overall outcome rating of Moderately Unsastisfactory.


                                                                                                      41
Pag. 18
Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
Cape Verde has secured funding for AIDS for the next 5 years through the Global Fund with
negotiations that are almost finalized.
This funding will support the development of the main activities that have been implemented under
this project, which was closed on June 30, 2009, including prevention activities among high-risk
groups, treatment, psychosocial support to adults and children orphaned and vulnerable, screening
of all pregnant women at their first ante-natal visit, etc.. To this must be added the complementary
support from the Government of Brazil and the United Nations agencies as demonstrated with the
development of activities on prevention, training, etc..
