spread of HIV infection in the\n            country. To achieve this goal, the project will also support\n            the following objectives: 1) mitigation of the health and\n            socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual, household,\n            and community levels, thus sustaining an economically\n            productive population; and 2) establishment of a strong and\n            sustainable national capacity to respond to the epidemic.\n            Under the regional MAP II (report no. 20727), this project\n            finances HIV/AIDS activities for the period 2002-2006. It\n            has four components that reflect the two-tiered\n            decentralized administrative sstructure in Cape Verde at\n            national and municipal levels. Apart from the component on\n            project facilitation, coordination, monitoring, and\n            evaluation (which will support facilitation and coordination\n            of the project), each of the remaining three components\n            supports the full spectrum of HIV/AIDS prevention,\n            treatment, care, and support activities that are appropriate\n            at the respective level. The other three project components\n            are: capacity building, public sector initiatives, and civil\n            society and private sector initiatives."}, "docdt": "2002-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
