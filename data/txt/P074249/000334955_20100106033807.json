Verde were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: A multi-sectoral strategy requires\n            does not mean that the funding should not be targeted. The\n            Bank should focus support for implementation on those\n            sectors where activities have the greatest potential impact\n            on the epidemic and with some comparative advantage in\n            implementation such as the Ministry of Health, and those\n            ministries related to the military, education, and\n            transport. Implementation of a multi-sectoral strategy\n            requires that roles and responsibilities (along with the\n            accompanying human and financial resources) be defined and\n            respected by the various public and private actors. While\n            the project succeeded in building capacity through\n            traditional means its greater success may have been in\n            focusing on facilitation and coordination rather than\n            command and control. It is a challenge to ensure political\n            commitment to target vulnerable populations. The key to\n            maintaining political commitment at all levels are not\n            necessarily compatible with improving the targeting of\n            vulnerability factors. The transition from: (i) information\n            and sensitization of the general population to; and (ii)\n            support for more focused groups (women, youths, orphans, etc.)."}, "docdt": "2009-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
