SECOND WESTERN JOHOR AGRICULTURAL DEVgkOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                Malaysia
Loan Amount:             US$55 million equivalent
Terms:                   Repayable in 15 years including three years' grace, at
the standard variable interest rate.
Project Description:    The project would support the Government's ongoing
program of flood control and drainage in the valuable
farmlands in the southwest of Johor State. It would
be the second Bank-assisted project for the same pur-
pose and would extend over a further 210,000 ha worked
by 30,000 smallholders. The project would finance (i)
construction of a dam (storage capacity 92 Mm3) for
flood control and water supply to nearby small towns;
(ii) construction of 100 km of embankments and other
flood control works along the ri'vers of the Batu Pahat
river basin amounting to 10 M m' of earthworks; (iii)
completion and upgrading of the existing drainage and
roads network; (iv) replanting of 14,500 ha of senile
rubber with oil-palm, high-yielding rubber and
diversified crops; and, (v) support to project admin-
istration. The project would reduce flood damage to
farms and towns, increase incomes from higher value
crops, provide safe drinking water to communities and
improve road access for commuters to employment.
Without the project, recurrent flooding would continue
to cause crop losses and urban damage; and the poor
drainage and transport system would continue to
restrict replanting of old rubber with oil palm.
Risk:                    The main project risks would be delays in on-farm
development should Government budgetary problems re-
occur and delays in land acquisition. Government has
- reaffirmed the priority it gives the project and
incremental staff are already in place totexpedite
land acquisition.

SECOND WESTERN JOHOR ACRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. The Agricultural Sector
1.01      The agricultural sector continues to play a dominant role in the
Malaysian economy though its relative importance is declining as the country
proceeds toward industrialization. Nevertheless, in 1985, the sector
contributed about 23% of GDP, 40% of total merchandise exports and 35% of
total employment. In the 1960s and early 1970s agriculture grew at 7% p.a.
but slowed to an average 5.5% p.a. during 1976-80 and to 3.7% p.a. during
1981-84. Agricultural production has been primarily export-oriented with
Malaysia being the world's largest producer and exporter of rubber and palm
oil producing about 40% of the world's natural rubber and more than half of
its palm oil. Malaysia's share of world exports is about 45% for natural
rubber and 70% for palm oil. It is also a major exporter of wood and timber.
1.02      Malaysia's climate and soil conditions provide a strong comparative
advantage for tree crop development particularly rubber and oil palm. About
one third of Peninsular Malaysia and less than 5% of East Malaysia (Sabah and
!arawak) are under cultivation, while most of the remaining area is still
tropical forest. The total cultivated area is about 4.5 million ha, of which
about 2.0 million ha are under rubber, 1.3 million ha oil palm, 300,000 ha
coconut, 200,000 ha cocoa and 500,000 ha rice. About half of the rice area is
double cropped. Minor crops include sugarcane, pineapple, tobacco, coffee and
pepper.  The entire rice area and about two thirds of the tree crop area are
in smallholdings averaging 1.2 ha; the remainder is mainly in estates.
1.03      With the strong performance of the economy until recently, poverty
incidence has been reduced from about 49% in 1970, to 29% in 1984.  However,,
it remains high in the rural areas which account for about two thirds of the
nation's poor. This is particularly the case among paddy, rubber and coconut
smallholders, primarily because of small farm sizes. With increasing indus-
trialization and low incomes in the sector, the rural youth are migrating to
urban areas, reducing the agricultural labor force and furLher contributing tc
the slowdown of farm output.
Government Policies and Strategy
1.04      Government efforts in agriculture have traditionally been oriented
to poverty alleviation through programs of land settlement, technology trans-
fer, subsidies and infrastructure. In view of the downturn in agricultural
growth rad increasing migration to urban areas, the Government reviewed its
sector'.l objectives and announced its National Agricultural Policy (NAP) in
1984. Maintaining the emphasis on poverty alleviation, the NAP objectives



-2-
are:  (a) maximization of farm incomes to improve the quality of rural life
and facilitate retention of productive labor in the sectot; and (b) expansion
of production of traditional and new export and food crops to revitalize the
agricultural sector.
1.05      The Government's main objectives have been pursued through two basic
strategies: (a) land development and settlement schemes providing viable farm
sizes and adequate incomes and expanding tree crop production for export; and
(b) in situ development projects designed to consolidate small farws, rehabil-
itate idle lands, increase productivity and improve farm management. This has
Led to development of large land settlement schemes by the Federal Land Devel-
opment Authority (FELDA) and the State governments; irrigation and drainage
projects by the Ministry of Agriculture; land rehabilitation programs by the
Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA); and rubber
replanting and mini-estate development programs by the Rubber Industry Small-
hnlders Development Autbority (RISDA). Under the NAP, these strategies will
continue but greater attention will be given to the problems of uneconomic
farm units, unremunerative crops and low productivity in the in situ develop-
ment projects. This includes promotion of group farming with centralized
management, support to farm mechanization, crop diversification, the intensi-
fication of integrated support services and provision of credit for selected
crops.
1.06      The success of Government programs has been limited by the faster
rise in real wages for non-farm work, the reluctance of urban migrants to sell
land they no longer cultivate and fatling prices for agricultural com-
modities. Most affected has been the rice growing industry where production
has'fallen from a peak of 1.8 million tons of rice in the early-1970s to 1.2
million tons in the mid-l9ROs despite an increasingly more expensive output
price support scheme coupled with free fertilizer and other input subsidies.
The rubber industry has suffered from declining international competitive-
ness. The scarcity of rubber tappers has led to increasing areas of mature
untapped rubber even though wages for Malaysian rubber workers are double
those of neighboring producers. Government policy now accepts the- desir-
ability of structural change within the sector and has abandoned expl:cit
paddy production goals, trimmed some subsidy programs and is concentrating on
supporting change within high productivity areas. This has led to a decreased
emphasis on rice, rubber and coconuts in favor of oil palm, fruit trees, and
cocoa, all of which have a lower labor demand and a higher value-added.
Bank Sector Strategy
1.07      The Bank has consistently supported the Government's objectives and
institution building efforts in agriculture. Initially, Bank lending in agri-
culture concentrated on land development, settlement and irrigation.  More
recently emphasis has also been given to programs designed to raise productiv-
-ity in existing smallholder areas such as irrigation and drainage improvement,
rehabilitation of tree crops, land consolidation, agricultural research and -
extension. To date, the Bank has made 24 agricultural loans amounting to
US$781.3 million, nearly 45% of total lending to Malaysia. Of these, the most
successful have been the six loans to assist implementation of FELDA projects
in the states of Pahang, Johor and Negeri Sezobilan (Loans 533, 672, 885, 967,



1044 and 1590-MA).  These projects cover some 66 settlement schemes,
comprising development of 120,4l0 ha, construction of basic infrastructure and
settlement of 29,450 families.-V Favorable circumstances for these projects
included fertile soils in unoccupied lands, and readily exported crops, cil
palm and rubber. Success has been mixed among the area development schemes
among existing small farms producing foodcrops, particularly rice. Problems
have been smallness of farm size, shortage of irrigation water and low returns
relative to non-farm employment. However, in ecologically favored areas there
have been notable successes among which the MUDA Irrigation Projects (Loans
434, 1717-MA) led to a doubling of cropping intensity, increased yields. and
strong institutional development. Now that Peninsular Malaysia is running out
of long-run supplies of land available for new settlement schemes, Government
policy has reemphasized the need to concentrate on development of older areas
with entrenched rural poverty. Thy Bank supports thia view and is assisting
the program of structural change._
1.08      In view of the sector's contribution to national output and poverty
alleviation, an important thrust of future Bank assistance to Malaysia wiji
continue to be for agriculture along the lines proposed in the NAP.
Particular attention will be given to the solution of structural problems
facing the sector, through Iax4 consolidation and improved efficiency and
management of smallholder agriculture; and to strengthening the land devel-
opment and settlement programs, as the most effective way of providing viable
farm units and improving rural incomes.
B. Project Origin
1.09      Johor has the second'largest population of Malaysia's states and one
of the highest population growth rates; average per capita incomes are below
the national average and rural incomes are about one half urban incomes.
Johor is the largest agricultural producer, responsible for some 15% of
sectoral GDP. However, the annual growth rate of farm output at 1.6% for
1981-84 is one half the national average. The slow growth rate reflects the
high average age of tree crops and the depressed pineapple industry.
1.10      The southwestern part of the State, settled with smallholderst is
mostly poorly drained and flood prone, and has been minimally involved in the
nationwide replanting of rubber with oil palm. Less than 10% of the rubber
and pineapple areas have been converted to oil palm compared to 40% state-
wide. Public land schemes and private estates are mostly located on higher
elevations of low flood risk and lower development costs. In the early 1970s
a 300,000 ha block of these lowlands was selected for infrastructure develop-
ment to assist smallholders diversify into oil palm, vegetables, cassava,
groundnuts and other crops. Too large to be managed as a unit, it was divided
into two blocks for sequential development. The first block was appraised in
1973 as the Western Johor Agricultural Development Project (Loan 973-MA) which
became effective in August 1974 and was completed in October 1984. The second

-4-
block comprises Phase II and is the project proposed in this report. The Loan
included feasibility studies for Phase II to be prepared by MOA. These funds
were lOt used and preparation was made without Pank involvement. In 1981, the
Government submitted a feasibility report to the-Bank which included an
agricultural development plan and engineering proposals including a
consultfat's detailed design of the Bekok Dam. After review by the Bank it
was agreed to engage international consultants to: (a) review the general
infrastructure plan with emphasis on the hydraulic works and a study of the
flood control options; (b) prepare preliminary designs, cost estimates and
schedule of implementation for the selected option; (c) prepare a long-term
agricultural development plan and a specific program for the project
implementation period; and (d) review detailed designs for the Bekok Dam. The
work was financed under the National Small-Scale Irrigation Project (Loan
1444-MA). The draft proposals for the least-cost solution were reviewed and
agreed to by the Bank in 1983 and detailed design was begun. A final report
was accepted by the Government in 1985 and proposed to the Bank for
appraisal. The project was appraised in April 1985. A post-appraisal in
November 1985 was made to adjust final appraisal to the draft allocation made
under the Fifth Plan.
Experience under the First Project (Loan 973-MA)
1.11      The first project financed construction of two flood control dams,
river works, a drainage system, roads, a coastal embankment and agricultural
development in an area of some 135,000 ha. The project was completed in 1984,
five yeay later than expected at appraisal and experienced a 31% cost
overrun ._ The major causes of delay and cost overruns were inadequate
preparation of engineering works and budgetary shortfalls, implementation of
additional works not included at appraisal, and staffing shortages.
Consequent ccst overruns and delays reduced the IRR from 15X forecast at
appraisal to 10%. Expected benefits from vegetablest cassava, groundnuts and
agroindustry did not materialize with farmer interest centered on replanting
old rubber with oil palm and underplanting coconut with cocoa. Nevertheless,
participating farmers benefitted significantly and important secondary
benefits were generated in terms of road access and improved living
conditions.
1.12      The PPAR's main findings were that:  (i)3changing economic
circumstances adversely affected the project leading to farm labor shortages;
(ii) smallness of farm size often relegated farming to a secondary occupation
with reduced interest; (iii) civil works were inadequately prepared at time of
appraisal and appraisal premature; (iv) initial weakness in project
organization delayed implementation; (v) shortage of staff for land
acquisition delayed progress of works; and (vi) time could have been saved by
switching earlier to LCB procedures on roads and drainage civil works after
little interest in bidding was shown by foreign firms.
1.13      During preparation of the second project these findings have been
incorporated into project design.  The cropping pattern to be supported, pre-
dominantly oil palm, has a lower Labor demand per hectare than the mixed
31   Draft PPAR, December 2, 1985.



cropping pattern proposed-for the first project. The proposed project
envisages formation of mini-estates, that is, producer cooperatives in support
of Covernment strategy to overcome the problem of smallness of farm size. The
problem of inadequate preparation has been avoided by not appraising until
after completion of detailed design (now finished) of the Bekok Dam which is
the major project civil works component. During the ten-year implementation
period of the first project a satisfactory project organization eventually
evolved. It is proposed to continue using the same arrangements. The initial
land acquisition delays due to staff shortages for title proces@ing were
eventually overcome by increasing the staffing for the purpose. These staff
positions specifically created and filled for project land acqusition are
temporarily still in place and the staff are already working on land
acquisition for the proposed project.  During implementation of the completed
project, after 13 ICB contracts had been satisfactorily executed by local
firms and given the negligible response from foreign contractors, charges were
made to allow for LCB on remaining zivil works for drains and agricultural
roads. Under the proposed project, the ICB contracts would be large enough to
attract foreign bidders and the smaller contracts for works to be carried out
under LCB would be open to foreign bidders. The problem of cost overruns has
been addressed by adequacy of detailed design before appraisal.
Implementation delays have been dealt with by readiness of preparation and by
allowing a seven year's implementation period.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Locstion and Topogriphy
2.01      The project area covers about 210,000 ha, mostly in the Batu Pahat
river basin (1,950 62) in southwestern Johor State (see IBRD Map izo. 18871).
About 70% (150,000 ha) has very flat low-lying alluvial and organic soils.
Some 97,000 ha of the alluvial soils are poorly drained and still subject to
regular flooding despite drain construction and river improvement works over
the years. Flooding is primarily caused by overflow of the Batu Pahat River
tributaries, the Simpang Kiri and the Simpang Kanan Rivers and its two main
subtributaries, the Bekok and Sem'rong Rivers. A secondary cause is inade-
quate drainage. Major flooding occurs, on average, once every three years on
the flat flood plains adjoining the main river system. Some 24,000 ha are
affected by floods with a three-year return period, 32,000 ha by floods every
five years and about 42,000 ha by floods every 25 years. Flooding can exceed
a depth of one meter and persist for one to three months. The proposed proj-
ect would address this through construction of a dam on the Bekok River, flood
mitigation works for other rivers, and drainage works.  The flood control
design adopted for the project was chosen after examination of alternative
solutions and optimised during detailed design.
Soils and Land Use
2.02      Soils.  About 83,000 ha of alluvial soils are acid sulphate or
potentially acid sulphate within 0.5 m of the surface, necessitating closely
controlled groundwater levels to prevent acidification in the future. Peat



soils of varying depths of up to 3 m or more cover about 32,000 ha. Under dry
conditions, peat oxidizes and subsides. Drainage development in the potential
acid sulphate and peat soils areas should therefore be restricted to a minimum
to maintain tte groundwater table as close to the land surface as practicable.
2.03      Land Use.  The 1984 land use survey showed that 73% of the project
area has been developed for agriculture. Of this, some 95% is under tree
crops. The land use is summarized as follows:

2.04      However, most of the rubber is senile or mature with a yield average
of 380 kg/ha/yr compared with the national smallholder average of
600 kg/ha/yr. Low yields are due to inferior seedlings, waterlogging, low
tapping intensity and age. Coconut is grown mainly for home consumption but
there is strong interest in underplanting coconut with cocoa or coffee. There
are about 600 ha of cocoa and 1,100 ha of coffee interplanted among coconuts
in the project area.
2.05      Although Johor State-has led in the rapid expansion-of oil palm in -
Malaysia, the low-lying river basins have not benefitted because of the high
cost of infrastructure and variable yields on acid sulphate and peat soils.
Of the 50,000 ha of oil palm in the project area, 30% is in smallholdings on
the bottom lands and the balance on estates, generally above flood levels.
Estate yields are satisfactory at 15 to 20 tons ffb/ha, seven years after
planting. Efowever, smallholder yields, which average about 10 tons/ha, are
unsatisfactory.
2.06      Pineapples, grown mainly for canning, are planted on some 816 ha,
increasingly as an intercrop between oil palms during the first two years of
establishment where yields are low. Fruit, vegeta:)les and paddy are grown
also, mainly for home consumption.



- 7-
Population and Incomes
-2.07      The population of the project area is-about 300,000 of which-two
thirds are dependent on farming to some extent for employment. The average
family size is six. About 70% of rural households have electricity and 35X
reticulated water supply. The average annual household income for rural fami-
lies is M$356 per month, which is about the official estimate of the poverty
income level.  But a significant characteristic is that farm income comprises
only 56Z of total household income with the balance coming from employment of
family members in nearby towns, remittances from those working elsewhere and
government transfers. Further, average household income from the largest farm
size group was found to be only 30% more than that of the smallest farm size
group due to reduced nonfarm employment.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.08      The average farm size is 2.5 ha with about 80% owner operated and
the remainder under some leasing arrangement.  Small farm size is the major
cause of poverty, as elsewhere in Malaysia. The prospect of attractive
employment opportunities in the towns has contributed to lack of interest in
agriculture among young people and results in migration of labor, land aban-
donment and an increasing tendency to view farming as a subsidiary occupation.
Existing Infrastructure
2.09      Drainage System.  Drainage has been implemented for only 70%
(102,000 ha) of the alluvial soils in the project area, including 57,000 ha by
the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) outside the 8atu Pahat river
system and 45,000 ha of inland drainage schemes along the Simpang Kanan and
Bekok Rivers. These facilities constitute an extensive main drainage and
field drainage system which needs extension over another 40,000 ha, in the
project area. The main drainage system consists of parallel secondary drains,
spaced at intervals of about 400-1,000 m. The secondary drains usually drain
directly into major rivers or the sea. Where river bunds or a coastal embank-
ment exist, they drain into a collector drain inside the embankment. In most
areas an extensive field drainage system has been dug by farmers to transport
water from farm plots to the main drainage system, which comprises farm drains
(quaternary) and feeder drains (tertiary). Quaternary drains are dug along
farm boundaries.
2.10      Agricultural Roads.  Approximately lOO1,OO ha of the project area
have extensive agricultural roads along secondary drains. Spacing of roads
and drains is often wide, sometimes exceeding 1 km, and is generally suited to
rubber cultivation, with transport requirements for about 1 ton/ha/year of
sheet rubber. However, smallholders-are increasingly replanting old rubber
with oil palm which is transforming transport-requirements. For example, at
full production oil palm involves about 20 tons/ha/year of ffb. The density
of roads and secondary drains in the project area would therefore need to be
increased to meet the needs of the changing cropping pattern.
2.11      Water Supply.  Water b,pply currently depends on small, individual
water schemes but these are insufficient to meet demand. Quality is deterior-



-8-
ating because of salinity encroachment and pollution in coastal areas.
Development of water storage in resrvoirs to meet the potable water supply
needs of the Kluang District would therefore be included in the project.
2.12      The water supply requirements of the existing Sembrong and proposed
Bekok reservoirs have been reviewed by the Department of Public Works (JKR),
taking into consideration flood mitigation requirements, the need to maintain
compensation flows in the river and other potential sites. JKR co3cluded that
the designed water supply storage of the Sembrong reservoir (15 Mm ) is siffi-
cient but that the water supply storage at Bekok should be at least 24 Mm
with a provision for future increases up to 51 Mm . A yield study for the
Bekok River showed that a 50- ear safe yield of 225 Mld is available from a
water supp'y storage of 24 Mm".
2.13      Treatment plants are already being developed to deal with the
planned water supply increases. A new treatment plant at Yong Peng (25 Mld)
on the Bekok River is under construction for completion by uid-1986. Another
treatment plant with a capacity of 60 Mld located on the Sembrong River 3 km
uPstream of its confluence with the Bekok would also be constructed together
with a water distribution system under the Bank-assisted Johor Water Supply
Project (Loan 2654-MA of US$62 million) approved by the Board on March 26,
1986.
2.14      kationale for Bank Involvement,  The difficult hydrology of the Batu
Pahat river basin required long preparation and complex modelling.  Bank
assistance led to design changes and a satisfactory resolution of choice among
alternative engineering solutions. In addition to continuing assistance to
the MOA in project preparation and implementation, the Bank project would
strengthen the integration of farmer support services and assist the
Covernment's attempts at land consolidation through use of the mini-estate
concept (para 4.06).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
3.01      The proposed project would control floods and improve drainage over
98,000 ha in Weste'rn Johor (IBRD Map No. 18871) and would replant 14,500 ha of
senile rubber on smallholdings during the construction period. The works
would increase yields of younger existing plant stands and would enable the
development of a further 70,Q00 ha after completion of the works. as part of
the ongoing programs under several agencies. The civil works would consist
of:
(a)  construction of a dam on the Kembong River and a 6.5 km long channel
to direct river flows into this reservoir;
(b)- construction of extensive river improvement works on the Simpang
Kiri, Simpang Kanan, Bekok and Sembrong Rivers, including river
enlargement (79 km), river realignment (14 km), and new levees along
tidal reaches (55 km);



-9.
(c) construction of a catchment separator bund (12 km) between the
Simpang Kiri and Bekok Rivers and a small flood-retarding embankment
-on the Simpang Kiri River beside a future expressway;
(dY construction of a main drainage system consisting of higb level
drains (146 km in nonflooded areas and 69 km in flooded areas) and
associated structures, and lower level drainage outlet works on the
lower rivers, and replacement or construction of bridges;
(e)  replacement of eight existing bridges on the main rivers;
(f) flood protection for the town of Parit Sulong; and
(g)  development of three coastal blocks through construction of secon-
dary drains (85 km), new agricultural roads (112 km), resurfacing of
existing roads (920 km) and maintenance tracks along existing
secondary drains (350 km).
3.02      Agricultural development would involve about 14,500 ha of smallhold-
ings during the project construction period through:
(a) conversion of about 10,000 ha of old low yielding rubber to oil palm
of which about 3,000 ha would be developed as mini-estates;
(b) replanting of 3,000 ha of old rubber with high yielding rubber; and
- (c)  conversion of 1,500 ha of old rubber to diversified crops.
This development would form part of the 85,000 ha expected to be developed in
the project area over 20 years as a result of the drainage and flood control
works. It would be the first time-slice in the replanting of some 50,000 ha
of old rubber, the bringing of about 20,000 ha of swamp and scrub lands into
production with oil palm and diversified crops, and the intercropping of
another 15,000 ha of coconut with cocoa, coffee and fruits.
3.03      In addition, support would be given to project management in the
form of engineering consulting services, equipment and vehicles, administra-
tion buildings, equipping of a soils laboratory, and incremental project
staff.
B. Detailed Description
Civil Works
3.04      Bekok Dam.  The Bekok reservoir would be located on the Kembong
River, a sull tributary of the Bekok River. Bekok flows would be diverted
through a 6.5 km long channel. The dam, similar- in design to the Sembrong
Dam, would consist of a main embankment 3.9 km long and 15.5 m maximum height
and several saddle dams of a total length of 1.9 km. Associated works would
include:



- 10 -
(a)  an ungated primary spillway, 20 m long;
(b)  an emergency unlined spillway, 250 m long in one section; and
(c)  outlet works equipped with twin radial gates.
3.05      The proposed revised design provides 3or 24 Mm3 of water supply
storage and a flood mitigation storage of 68 Mm between the normal maximum
level for water supply and the crest of the primary spillway, giving a total
storage of 92 Mm . The-flood mitigation criteria agreed with the consultants
are:
(a)  storage of the 10-year flood without release for seven dayq (the
time required to drain the land located below the dam);
(b)  discharge rate of the 25-year flood not to exceed 50 m31s;
(c)  discharge only of floods greater than the 100-year flood over the
unlined emergency spillway; and
(d)  safe passing of the probable maximum flood.
Water would flow by gravity to the intake points for the potable water supply
extraction points provided under the Johor Witer Supply Project.
3.06      Sembrong Dam.  The Sembrong Dam, completed in September 1984 under
the first project at a cost of M$24 million, meets the water supply ani flood
mitig'ation requirements'defined in 1980. The reservoir provides 15 Mm of
water supply storage. Total length of the main and saddle dams is akout
2.5 km. The uncontroied spillway, 60 m long, is able to pass 360 m Is while
the 3utlet consisting of two radial gates has a total discharge capacity of
42 m Is.
3.07      River Training Works.  Rivers throughout the area would be canalized
by enlarging their channels to deal with the design flow and by improving
their alignment to increase the hydraulic gradient. In their lover reaches,
the rivers would be confined within embankments to prevent the lower lands
from being flooded by the rivers and by high tides. Work on the upper reaches
would be executed by conventional land-based plant while works on the wider
lower reaches would be partly carried out by dredge. Spoil would be disposed
of beside the banks of river channels and in discrete areas by pipeline trans-
port from the dredges.
3.08      Separator Bund.  A bund would be constructed to prevent unregulated
flood water from the Simpang Kiri River from spilling over into the Bekok
valley. This earth bur.d would be about 12 km long and would have an average
height of 2 m. A small flood retarding embankment would be constructed on the
Simpang Kiri River immediately upstream of the proposed kuala Lumpur to Johor
Bahru expressway to reduce the flood peak in the river below that point.
3.09     ,4ain Drains.  A system of main drains would be constructed to convey
drainage flows to the sea. Catch drains;-would be built approximately parallel



- 11 -
to the contour lines to collect drainage water from land above the 25-year
maximum water level. High level drains running perpendicular to the catch
drains would be constructed to take the flows to the river -or-sea at eleva-
tions close to or above ground level and would be enclosed between bunds to
prevent flooding. Drains would be constructed with a maintenance berm of 6 m
width between the drain and the embankment. The design capacity of drains is
based on the peak of the 5-year hydrograph and together with dikes gives
protection for a 25-year flood. Drains would be equipped with standard
drainage outlet structures where low lying land is protected by levees.
3.10      Main Road Brid8es.  Eight rural road bridges would be replaced
because of river enlargements. These would all be less than 50 m in length.
They would be constructed to standard design for bridges in the area.
3.11      Town Flood Protection.  Four towns (Batu Pahat, Parit Sulong, Sri
Medan and Parit Raja) are subject to partial flooding during major floods in
the main river systems of the project area and intense rainfall in the local
catchments draining through the towns. In addition, abnormal high tide levels
are a major cause of the flooding of Batu Pahat. Only flood protection of
Parit Sulong, which is the most severely affected, is included in the project
because it has to be implemented concurrently with the other flood mitiga-
tion works. The general concept of flood protection would be to construct a
ring levee around the towns with provision of manually operated outlet gates
to allow drainage of runoff from the area behind the levees. A ring levee
with a crest width of 4 m would be constructed around the town of Parit Sulong
enclosing an area of 68 ha. Two outlet structures, normally fully open, would
divert drainage water to discharge into Simpang Kiri river. A small pumping
station of 1.4 m3/sec capacity would be constructed to operate when the river
level exceeds 1.5 m above sea level.
3.12      Secondary Drains.  New secondary or internal drains would be dug in
newly reclaimed swamp areas and in existing drainage areas where the drain
spacing is too wide. To achieve uniformity, the same standards for drain lay-
out applied in the first project area would be used giving a spacing of 800 m
-between drains.
3.13      Agricultural Roads.  About 112-km of agricultural roads would be
constructed under the project to a minimum width of 4 m with a surface course
of 0.2 m graded lateritic gravel over a compacted earthfill embankment with a
minimum thickness-of 0.4 mo. The design carrying capacity of these roads is
3.0 tons.  Roads on peat soils would have compacted earthfill embankments at
least 0.6 m thick, on geotextile material overlying the peat, covered by a
coarse sand blanket.
3.14      Maintenance Tracks for Existing Drains.  Maintenance and local
upgrading of the existing drainage system is often constrained by inadequate
road access and insufficient space for equipment and spoil.  Maintenance is
often carried out from nearby roads, requiring traffic diversion or sometimes
preventing vehicle access during maintenance. Although maintenance is carried
out only every one to two years, traffic inconvenience is considerable, par-
ticularly in more densely populated areas and where traffic diversion is
impossible. Under the project some 350 km of new maintenance tracks will be



- 12 -
provided along all secondary drains which lack an adequate maintenance berm
and where insufficient space is available between existing roads and drains
for maintenance.
3.15      Land Acquisitiot   The proposed infrastructure works require acqui-
sition of about 3,100 ha of land. Crop compensation would also be made to 140
families now living on about 950 ha of government lands legally developed
within river reserves and who would be relocated. There are no households
presently in the Bekok reservoir area. Under the previous project land
acquisition problems were a major source of delay until the project financed
the appointment of 48 staff positions in the Lands Office. This has ensured
timely processing and would continue to do so. Work has already begun on land
acquisition for the Bekok Dam site giving a lead time of more than one year
before start of construction. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that Government would make appropriate arrangements for timely land
acquisition and for resettlement or compensation of the families to be
displaced and in accordance with a plan of action satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 7.01(a)).

3.16      Oil Palm Development.  About 10,000 ha of old rubber would be
replanted with oil palm under the RISDA-managed rubber replanting cess fund.
These would consist of (a) some 7,000 ha developed by individual farmers on
about 2,800 smallholdings of average size 2.5 ha, some organized intc group
replanting schemes with RISDA contract arrangements for land clearing and
planting, and (b) about 3,000 ha developed into 30 mini estates of about
100 ha each, under direct RISDA management. The total average annual conver-
sion of 1,450 ha would be double the achievements of recent years reflecting



- 13 -
the more attractive returns from oil palm. Oil palm development in the early
project years would be largely in areas free of flooding problems, especially
development blocks 9, 13 and 14 (IBRD Map No. 18871).
3.47      Rubber Development.  The project would replant about 3,000 ha of old
rubber on 1,200 individual holdings of 2.5 ha with modern high-yielding
clones, under the RISDA-operated replanting scheme. The annual replanting
rate of about 400 ha/year is only about 50% of recent performance, reflecting
declining interest in rubber. Farmers replanting with rubber will be mostly
located in less flood-prone areas or those who do not wish to sever their
eligibility for future RISDA rubber replanting grants. No rubber mini-estates
are expected to be formed due to lack of farmer interest.
3.18      Crop Diversification.  The project would replant old rubber with
diversified crops. Under the RISDA rubber replanting fund, farmers may
replant with any of 17 crops. It is estimated that 15X of the old rubber area
for replanting, amounting to 1,500 ha, would be diversified into crops other
than rubber or oil palm.
3.19      Engineering Consulting Services.  About 500 months of consultant
services would be required to supervise construction of project works and to
assist DID in design revision during construction (Annex 5.1). DID has
proposed that the consultants responsible for detailed engineering, a
consortium of local and foreign firms, would also be appointed for con-
struction supervision. The consultant's terms of reference have been prepared
and were reviewed at negotiations. Assurances were obtained that the
Government would by December 31, 1986 employ consultants for supervision of
construction under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 7.01(c)).
3.20      Equipment and Vehicles.  A fleet of maintenance equipment and vehi-
cles has been maintained by DID for road and drain maintenance in the first
project area. It is proposed to expand the machinery pool to maintain both
project areas by purchase of two front wheel loaders, five motor boats and
five four-wheel drive vehicles.  The existing equipment is well maintained and
adequately operated. Project office vehicles to be supplied would be one
four-wheel drive vehicle, I car and mini-bus for transport of personnel. One
four-wheel drive vehicle and scientific equipment would be provided for the
soils laboratory.
3.21      Buildings.  The project would finance construction of a project
office of 2,980 m'. Under the first Western Johor Project provision for a
project building was not used because rented accommodation was found. With
the extra staff needed for-the proposed second project land has been purchased
and a perma ent office would be constructed. In addition, a laboratory of
about 240 m for monitoring acid sulphate soils would be constructed for DOA.
3.22      Project Staffing.  The project would finance-about 13 extra
professional staff positions in DID necessary for supervising of construction
and operation, together with about 59 support staff positions. A further 23
positions would be financed in the Project Office to assist in project
planning and coordination of agricultural support services. To assist-



- 14 -
processing of land acquisition 48 positions would be financed in the Land
Office.
3.23     -Status of Preparation and Implementation Schedule.  The feasibility
study was completed in 1985.  The agricultural development plan would be a
time-slice of an ongoing program. Final design of the major civil works
component, the Bekok Dam, is complete. Detailed design for the river works
has begun and is expected to be completed in 1986. The project would be
implemented over a seven-year period beginning CY87. The proposed
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 3. Bidding documents for
construction of the Bekok Dam were made avaiLable to prequalified firms in May
1986 and construction would start in early 1987 at the end of the flood season
and is expected to be completed by end-1989. Regulated water yields from the
Bekok River would be available for use by the water supply treatment plants by
1990. Following prequalification of contractors, bids for river improvement
works would be called in early 1987 and construction would start in mid-1987
(Annex 3.2). Other works would be implemented progressively between 1988 and
1990 as land acquisition progresses.
C. Project Costs
3.24      The total project costs are estimated at US$148.3 million inclusive
of $8.0 million of taxes and duties with a foreign exchange component of
US$55.0 million or 37%. Quantity estimates were prepared for the project
works based on feasibility designs for the Bekok Dam, feasibility designs for
river improvement and drainage works and on prefeasibility designs for road
works. Unit prices were based on recent contracts for similar works carried
out for DID in Johor. The costs of equipment and vehicles are based on recent
bid prices. Project base costs are calculated from January 1986. Physical
contingencies of 10% were applied to works where detailed designs were avail-
able, and 15% for other civil works. Physical contingencies of 10% were
applied to equipment and vehicles and consultants. Physical contingencies are
equal to 7% of base costs. Price contingencies have been calculated at the
following rates of projected increases, using constant purchasing parity
-exchange rates and are equal to 22% of base costs:-

3.27      Civil Works.  One ICB contract for construction of the Bekok Dam
(US$20.9 million) and two ICB contracts for river dredging works (US$23.8-
million) would be awarded following international competitive bidding (ICB)
according to Bank Group guidelines.  The remaining river improvement and
drainage works would not be large enough for ICE and would thetefore be
carried out under contracts to be awarded following local competitive bidding
procedures (LCB) which are satisfactory to the Bank and in which foreign
bidders would be eligible to participate. The contracts for secondary drains,
agricultural roads, and oil palm mini-estates, which would be small and
scattered in space and time, would also not be of interest to foreign
contractors and would also be awarded after locally advertised competitive
bidding. The total cost of LCB works would be US$45.3 million. All ICB and
LCB bidders would be prequalified by DID to standards acceptable to the Bank.
3.28      Goods and Services.  Purchases of O&M equipment, service vehicles
and supplies totaling US$0.5 million would be grouped into packages for
procurement under LCB procedures in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
Small off-the-shelf items costing less than US$35,000 each and totaling not
more than US$0.2 million, would be procured through normal Government
procedures satifactory to the Bank. Local competitive procedures are accept-
able and foreign firms are allowed to participate. The fabrication and supply
of gates and hoists for water control structures would be carried out through
force account at an estimated cost of less than 12 of the total project
cost. DID has been fabricating its own gates and hoists for more than
30 years. Consultant services for engineering and supervision would be
obtained in accordance with Bank guidelines.
3.29      Contract Review.  Civil works contracts over US$2.0 million and sup-
ply contracts over US$0.2 would be subject to prior review. This would cover
about 80% of the total value of all contracts. Other contracts would be sub-
ject to selective post-award review.
F. Disbursements
3.30      Disbursement of the proposed loan over 8 years against: contracts and
statement of expenditures would be as follows: (a) 65% of the crst of civil
works; -(b) 55% of the replanting grants (c) for equipment and vehicles, 100%
of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported items, lOOX of the
ex-factory cost of locally manufactured items, net of taxes, and 75% of the
cost of imported items procured locally; and (d) 100% of expenditures for
consulting services.  For disbursements made against statements of expendi-
ture, documentation would be retained by the implementing agencies for Bank
review and scrutiny by auditors. The loan is expected to be disbursed over
eight years according to the schedule of disbursements shown in Annex 2.
Project completion is expected by December 31, 1993. The disbursement
schedule is one year faster than that for the standard profile for Bank loans
to Malaysia for area development on the basis of the readiness of engineering
(para. 4.14), progress in land acquisition (para. 3.15), and the experience in
implementing the previous project. A special account with an authorized
allocation of US$2.7 million corresponding to four months' expenditure would
be established to facilitate disbursements.



- 18 -
C.  Accounts and Audits
3.31      The agencies Involved in the project are all subject to normal gov-
ernment controi And audit procedures.  Assurances were obtained -during nego-
tiations that all agencies involved in project implementation would maintain
separate project accounts; that the special account and the accounts of the
implemuenting agencies and the Project Office would be audited annually by
indepenident auditors acceptable to the Bank; and that the auditors' reports
would be furnished to the Bank within nine months of the end of the
Government's fiscal year (para. 7.01 (d)).
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
4.01      Execution.  Malaysia would be the borrower and the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) would assume overall responsibility for the project. The
same organization and management as used in the first project would continue
for the proposed project. Two agencies would be primarily responsible for the
execution of the project, consisting of:
(a)  DID (Ministry of Agriculture) for civil work,  ind
(b)  RISDA for agricultural development of old rubber areas (Ministry of
Lands and Regional Development).
Agencies with support roles wouid include:
(c) DOA (Ministry of Agriculture) for intercropping of coconut areas
(d)  Farmers Organization Authority (FOA) for agricultural development in
nonrubber, noncoconut smallholder areas (Ministry of Agriculture);
(e)  Various research agencies for technical support of agricultural
development; and
(f) State Department of Lands and Mines for land acquisition;
(g) Bank Pertanian Malaysia (Agricultural Bank) for smallholder credit.
4.02      Project Office.  The existing Project Office established for the
First Western Johor Agricultural Development Project would be responsible for
management and coordination of the project in line with MOA policy. The
Offite would be responsible for coordination between executing agencies,
project planning and budgeting, reporting and monitoring as well as for
ongoing operations under the first project. Staffing of the expanded office
is largely in place and is organized under a P;oject Director, his Deputy
Director, an economist, an accounting officer, sociologist, information
officer, and executive officer.



- 19 -
4.03      Department of Drainage and Irrigation.  DID would be responsible for
constructing the civil works including the dam, river training, drainage net-
work, agricultural roads and bridges and buildings, and for engaging
consultants for design and construction supervision of the planned works.  The
DID maintains a team headed by a senior engineer at their office near Pontian
in the first project area and is competent to execute the proposed works.
When the project is completed the State DID would assume responsibility for
operation and maintenance of all these civil works except buildings which
would revert to their operating agencies.
4.04      Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority.  RISDA was
established in 1973 under the Minister of Lands and Regional Development to
administer the Rubber Industry Replanting Fund of 1952. Its mandate is pri-
marily to strengthen and modernize the smallholder rubber industry through
grant financing from the Rubber Cess Fund to replant low yielding, senile
rubber with high yielding clones and to promote improved production technology
through extension, agricultural credit, processing, marketing and other ser-
vices. Rubber smallholders have the option to replant with rubber or some 17
other crops, but farmers choosing the latter forfeit RISDA services three
years after planting and eligibility for future replanting grants. Until
recently rubber was the dominant crop in the project area but smallholder
interest in replanting with rubber is declining; nationally around 70X of
annual replanting is with rubber, with oil palm making up most of the balance,
but in some states more than half of all replanting is now with oil palm.
Although since 1984 RISDA administration costs have been funded from the central
government budget, smallholder replanting is almost exclusively financed from
the government cess replanting fund. Replanters receive grants in install-
ments during crop immaturity. Payments are spread over 3-4 years for oil palm
and 6-7 years for rubber, each payment requiring a satisfactory field
inspection report. The grant is intended to cover development inputs and
maintenance costs of replanting to first production, including land prepara-
tion and planting, fertilizers, chemicals and much of the labor. The total
grant for replants up to 4 ha is $3,705/ha for oil palm and other crops and
$5,434/ha for rubber. Details are given in Annex 6.1. Participants in mini-
estates (production co-operatives) are eligible for top-up credits with
interest from RISDA to meet additional costs including farm roads, improved
field drainage and fencing.  Other financial assistance from RISDA includes
credits for cash cropping and land title fees, and a fully subsidized
fertilizer program for rubber replanters providing full requirements for up to
4 ha for the first three production years. Family Income Maintenance Loans at
$15/acrel9onth (M$37.5/ha/month) are also available for a maximum of 10 acres
(4 ha), and RISDA caveats the land title until the loan is fully repaid about
10 years after production starts.
4.05      RISDA's extension and farmer training services are among its most
important and beneficial roles for rubber smallholders. A network of district
and subdistrict offices are maintained with close farmer contacts at the vil-
lage level. Similar services to ex-rubber farmers receiving replanting grants
for other crops cease with completion of the grant payments (except purchase
of oil palm fruit bunches, see paragraph 4.04).  RISDA also assists farmers in
rubber marketing through Group Processing Centers for the processing of
improved quality rubber sheet and the buying of wet sheet rubber for further



- 20 -
processing.  With the swing to oil pslm replantingt RISDA is taking an
increasingly active role in arranging processing of farmers' fresh fruit
bunches, despite the crop being outside the Agency's mandated responsibility,
as RISDA is the only agency able to help oil palm smallholders outside the
major federal schemes such as FELDA and FELCRA.
4.06     '¶o accelerate replanting and new *.roduction technology, RISDA
lauuched its mini-estate program in 1979. Up to September 1984 some 28,000 ha
of rubber in 249 mini-estates and 4,400 ha of oil palm in 34 mini-estates had
been developed throughout Malaysia. A minimum area of 40 ha is required to
start a mini-estate but there is no upper limit.  Participants are mostly.
small farmers with land titles who agree to caveat their land to RISDA
indefinitely until the full mini-estate development costs have been recovered,
in return for RISDA management and a share of production income.  RISDA's
field management staff are attached to field offices, operating through farmer
committees, and are organized as supervisors (responsible for up to 200 ha of
crop), senior supervisors (400 to 1,000 ha), assistant managers (1,000 to
2,000 ha), managers (2,000 to 5,000 ha) and group managers (above 5,0O0 ha).
Field operations are contracted but contractors must give preference to mini-
estate farmers for labor needs. Mini-estates benefit from enhanced infra-
structure developments arranged by RISDA, including access and farm roads,
drains, culverts, small bridges and fences as necessary with costs fully or
partly subsidized.
--                    B.  Support Services
4.07      Department of Agriculture.  The DOA would be responsible for agri-
culture support services, primarily for farmers with crops other than rubber
and oil palm which are covered by RISDA. Extension services for oil palm
would be provided in association with the Palm Oil Research Institute of
Malaysia (PORIM) for technical advice and new crop production technologies.
Other DOA services include farmer training, supply of planting materials
(cocoa, coffee, and fruit trees for intercropping of coconut and FOA group
developments) and monitoring of potential acid sulphate soils through the soil
testing laboratory at Air Hitam.
4.08      DOA operates the national coconut rehabilitation program as part of
government's policy-to alleviate poverty among coconut smallholders. The
National Agricultural Policy proposes that export of copra be phased out as
coconut production is reduced to meet domestic fresh nut and oil demand and
offset by profitable intercrops, using coconut primarily as shade with reduced
palm density. The main intercrops are cocoa, coffee and fruit trees (princi-.
pally durian, rambutan and mango).  Cocoa, which does not do-well on peat
soils, is being established on the better drained alluvia but must be protec-
ted from strong acid sulphate conditions.  Coffee and also fruit trees 'are- -
suitable for shallow peats (up to 1.5 m), but pineapple is the only satisfac-
tory intercrop on deeper peats.
4.09      With the discontinuation from 1983 of DOA's subsidized conversion
program amounting to $2,250/ha, the Agricultural Bank has been made responsi-
ble for providing farmers with credit at zero or low interest rates. DOA
would continue however to provide planting materials. There are about 25,000
ha of coconut in the project area mostly in need of rehabilitation.



- 21 -
4.10      The DOA operates a Training and Visit extension system established
under the Bank-supported National extension Project (Loan 1493-iA). The
project area extension officer/farm family ratio is about 1:660. Extension
officers are stationed at several IntegrAted Agriculture Serv-ice Centers in
the project area. These centers, which group all agency extension services
for the convenience of farmers, are under the MOA which is responsible for
balanced, integrated services to meet socioeconomic needs.  Within the project
area these services would be coordinated through the project director.
4.11      Farmers Organization Authority.  FOA, an agency of MOA, is responsi-
ble for supervising and strengthening Farmers' Organizations and agriculture-
based cooperatives. It assists farmers' cooperatives to develop group farming
and mini-estates and provides infrastructure, marketing centers, management
and technical services.
4.12      Agricultural Research.  MARDI, PORIM and RRIM would be responsible
for agricultural research needs..
(a) MARDI (Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute) is
a semiautonomous Federal organization under MOA and has received
Bank support under the Agricultural Research and Extension Project
(Loan 1115-MA). It maintains specific crop and general agriculture-
research centers in various parts of the country. In the Johor
Phase I project area it has established the Peat Research Center for
studies on the management and utilization of peat and acid sulphate
soils.  The results of these works will be applicable to similar
conditions in che project area.
(b) PORIM (Palm 0il Research Institute of Malaysia) was established in
1979. It is a semiautonomous body under Ministry of Primary Indus-
tries. Research priorities are established jointly wita the indus-
try and producers organizations. PORIM would be responsible for
research and technical advice on oil palm production on peat and
acid sulphate soils in the project area.
(c) RRIM (Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia), was established in
1926 and is now a semiautonomous body under the Minister of Primary
Industries. The RIM would investigate problems-of rubber cultiva-
tion in the project area using its field advisory staff and national
research facilities.
4.13      Agricultural Credit.  Agricultural credit needs are supplied by the
Agricultural Bank. Credit demand is generally low for treecrops because of
the funding supplied by RISDA to farmers contributing to the cess fund.
Direct provision of inputs by the DOA under diversification programs also
reduces credit demand and the Agricultural Bank's main work in-Western Johor
is in supplying credit-to farmers not qualifying for other funds. In the area
of the first project, the Agricultural Bank lends about M$3 million annually
for cocoa, coffee, coconut and pineapples. Interest rates are at 0% or 2% in
accordance with the guidelines of the National Economic Policy.



-22-
C. EngineerinE
4.14      Status of Engineering.  Detailed design for most of the civil works
to be implemented during the first four years is at an advanced stage and
should be completed before loan signing. Topographic surveys, including cross
sections for all river works, and detailed designs for improvement works on
the Simpang Kiri River have been completed. Detailed design of other river
works would also be completed by June 1986. Detailed design for the Bekok Dam
was completed in 1982. However, the original design was recently revised to
take into account the findings of subsequent flood mitigation studies. As the
agricultural roads will be built with a laterite surface and carry relatively
little traffic, detailed designs are not required.
4.15      Safety of Dams.  Failure of the ey;,ting Sembrong Dam and the pro-
posed Bekok Dam would cause considerable da  ge to agriculture in the project
area.  To assist DID in ensuring the safety of the Bekok Dam, assurances were
obtained that by December 1986 the Government would appoint a panel of experts
whose qualifications and terms of employment would be acceptable to the Bank
and whose responsibility would be to: (a) review construction quality and
progress; (b) review revisions in design and construction practice; and
(c) review the adequacy of the maintenance and safety program. Assurances
were obtained that DID would carry out a maintenance and inspection program
for the Sembrong Dam, and the Bekok Dam after its completion, to determine any
actual or potential deficiencies in the conditions of the structures or in the
quality of maintenance or methods of operations which might render the-dams
unsafe, and initiate any necessary remedial action (para. 7.01 (e)). Copies
of each inspection report would be furnished promptly to the Bank.
4.16      Operation and Maintenance.  DID would be responsible for operation
and maintenance (OEM) of the Bekok and Sembrong Dams and all river and drain-
age works down to secondary drains and roads. The operating rules of the
flood mitigation system have been defined during the feasibility studies and
would be included in the operating manual. During construction, DID would
continue to operate and maintain existing schemes in the area and would take
over the new works as completed.  DID is responsible for operation and
maintenance of both drainage works and roads in the Johor Phase I area, which
is satisfactory. Staff and equipment for the Phase I project will be
redeployed over both project areas, supplemented by contract works in line
with government policy.
4.17      Two types of drainage structures would require operation:  the
drainage outlet structures in the-river levees and coastal bund and drainage-
check structures in secondary and tertiary drains to control groundwater in
areas with potential acid sulphate soils.  During wet periods, drains.would be
flushed out, but in dry periods the water Level would be kept up by the water
control structures. Culvert-type outlet structures operate automatically, but
flume-type outlets require daily operation. Check structures, located in
secondary or tertiary drains, will require regular operation, particularly.
during the dry season.



- 23 -
4.18      The major maintenance problems are weed growth and siltation in-the
drains and outlet channels. Weeds will be removed by mechanical methods,
although the practicality of chemical control of weeds would be
investigated. Assurances were obtained during negotiation that promptly after
construction drainage works would be transferred to Johor State £or operation
and maintenance (para. 7.01 (f)). The farmers would have t4 complete and
maintain their on-farm drains as a condition for receiving replanting
grants. Extension workers would promote maintenance by farmers and train
farmers in correct maintenance procedures. The construction of new feeder
drains would make the farmers' task much simpler, since on-farm drains would
be no longer than 100 m. Other maintenance work includes maintenance of
access and field roads and clearing of maintenance tracks and culverts.
D. Progress Reporting
4.19      The Project Office would prepare consolidated quarterly progress
reports and submit them to MOA and the Bank. Collection of primary data on
civil works and agricultural activities would be supplied by the executing
agencies and reports would be provided on all components under the project.
E. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.20      The Project Office would continue its project monitoring role.  The
surveys of social and agricultural conditions during project preparation are
adequate for baseline analysis. Lessons learned from the previ l-s project
indicate the need for closer coordination between the monitorirz and planning
functions and for better balance between data collection and processing into a
usable form (draft PPAR, December 2, 1985). Evaluation would be made by a
body external to the Project Office.  A project completion report would be
prepared by the Project Office.
F. Environmental Effects
4.21      The environmental impact statement concluded that the project would
have a beneficial effect on the environment by providing drainage facilities
in an area presently suffering from flooding and poor drainage. Improved
water supply and drainage-would help to control water-borne diseases and
malaria. Although the project would bring about a temporary increase in the
turbidity of rivers during construction, this short-term negative effect is
considered minor and is outweighed-by the social and economic benefits of the
project. The project does not entail any forest clearance.

The 30 mini-estates, which must be at least 40 ha at inception - would expand
to 100 ha or more as other farmers opt to join. On average it is assumed that
each mini estate would have 50 ha for development in the first year and a
further 50 ha two years later.-
5.02      Crop Establishment# Palms would be planted at a density of about
148 palms!tEh-   i m triangulr planting).  One year nursery materials would be
supplied from FELDA and private nurseries at about M$3.50 per palm. Supply
for planting failures would amount to 10% on mini-estates and 15X on small-
holdings (losses on smallholdings could be very much higher if drainage works
are not in place). On flat terrain and deep alluvial soils, legume cover
crops are not generally sown but the rapid growth of palms minimizes dangers
of soil erosion.  RISDA supplies rock phosphate for the planting holes and
adequate limestone and fertilizer for young palms for three years. After that
individual'farmers would be responsible for fertilizer and liming.
5.03      Soils and their Management.  Oil palm is suited to the predominately
acid alluvial and organic soils of the project area, provided appropriate soil
management practices are followed. The pyrites - containing alluvial soils,
even though improved by drainage, are potentially very acid sulphate, a condi-
tion which can be provoked by excessive drainage. The experience of the
estate sector is that peat soils of up to 5 m depth (moderately deep peats)
with appropriate management can be successfully used for growing oil palm.
This includes rigorous drainage control to prevent excessive drying and the
development of acid'sulphate conditions for which the soil water table should
not fall below about 0.7 m; annual flushing of drains to remove acidity accu-
mulation, an adequate fertilizer regime particularly in supplemental copper,



- 25 -
boron and potash nutrition, and annual dressings of ground magnesium limestone
at rates of at least 400 kg/ha to slowly improve soil pH ratings. DOA will
expand their soil testing laboratory in the project area to monitor soil acid-
.ity in all drainage scheme areas.
5.04      Yields and Production.  The estimated oil palm yield profiles are
shown for mini-estates and individual holdings in Annex 6.2.  The mean annual
yield over 25 years of production is estimated at 17.0 tons/ha for mini-
estates and 14.5 tons/ba for individugl holdings.  Peak production of 23 and
20 tons/ha respectively would be reached about 10 and 11 years after planting.
The higher yields in mini-estates reflect the benefits of RISDA management,
including a higher average density of palms, better maintenance, and higher
fertilizer inputs.  Mini-estate production may decline rapidly after about 12
years, when farmers have paid off their loans and assume full managemt
responsibility. The Government is aware of this and is considering mechanisms
to keep mini-estates intact, for example by extending RISDA's management
period or forming cooperatives. Without the project most farmers would retain
their old rubber, yielding only about 300 kg/ha, or in face of labor shortages
they might convert to oil palm with prospects of poor establishment and low
yields due to flooding.
5.05      Harvesting and Processing.  Initial harvesting of fresh fruit
bunches is expected in the third year after planting and yields then rise
rapidly, peaking in 8 to 10 years. From year 12 yields slowly decline, and
increasing beight of the palms add to the difficulty of harvesting. The eco-
nomic life of the palms is about 25 years. Fresh fruit bunches would be con-
tract harvested on mini-estates and by farmers themselves on individual hold-
ings, and sold for processing to local dealers or factories in the general
area. There is already adequate factory capacity-within reasonable distance
of all parts of the project area and no new capacity will be provided under
the project.
B. Rubber
5.06      The project would replant about 3,000 ha of old rubber representing
about 1SZ of the total of old rubber land with modern high yielding clones.
The annual rubber replanting rate, which was 900 ha in 1984, and which
declined steeply in 1985 due to cess fund constraints, is assumed to average
400 hatyear over the project period. Further, the swing to oil palm would
gain momentum as more low production areas are drained and protected from
floods.  The phasing of rubber planting is shown in Table 5.2.

Individual farm sizes average 2.5 ha.  The formation of rubber mini-estates. is
not anticipated as farmer interest in them is low; but many individual farmers
with contiguous holdings will join RISDA's Group Replantir" Schemes, in which
RISDA arranges contract clearing, planting and the first        years of mainte-
nance works, to benefit from RISDA mAnagement and technology inputs. Charac-
teristically these schemes are 10-20 ha units. After the contract period,
farmers will assume full responsibility for all maintenance. Most rubber
replantings will be located on the slightly more elevated peripheral lands of
the project area characterized by sedentary soils and little affected by the
project drainage works program.
5.07      Yields and Production.  The assumed yield profile for rubber is
given in Annex 6.2. The mean annual yield projected over 20 years is 1070 kg/
ha. While without the project the large area of unimproved rubber would only
to yield about 300 kg/ha and would finally be abandoned, with the project,
there would be a net loss in total rubber production for about 22 years due to
the large-scale conversion to oil palm. Well grown new rubber would be ready
for tapping at the end of six years after planting. Yields would peak about 9
years later and then slowly decline, depending on maintenance standards. Some
use of yield stimulant can be assumed in later years although currently the
practice is little used by small farmers.
5.08      Crop Establishment.  Recommended clones would be planted at a den-
sity of about 500 trees/ha but losses during establishment would reduce the
stand to about 475 trees/ha. Planting material, mostly as bare budded stumps,
would be supplied from RISDA's central Johor nurseries. Rubber tolerates low
pH soils of 3.5 to 4.5 hence liming will not be necessary.
5.09      wield Maintenance.  To receive grant payments, rubber farmers are
required to establish legume cover crop in the interrows, maintain the rubber
in a well-weeded condition, attend to tree disease and pruning requirements
and apply recommended rates of fertilizer. Standards are ensured through reg-
ular RISDA inspectic-n. Currently farmers are eligible for free (subsidy)
fertilizer for three additional years after the rubber comes into production
to promote good yields for a longer period than commonly achieved in small-
holdings.
5.10      Harvesting and Processing.  RISDA has established a number of Group
Processing Centers in the project area to prepare clean sheet rubber. Cur-
rently, because of low rubber prices and the labor involved, many farmers pre-



- 27 -
fer to sell raw cup lump to dealers at a lower-price and save on the consider-
able work involved in making rubber sheet.
C. Crop Diversification
5.11      Under the rubber replanting grant administered by RISDA, farmers may
diversify into any of 17 crops other than rubber (see pare. 4.04). Oil palm
is overwhelmingly the alternative chosen but nationally nearly 9% of the
approved grant area in the period 1979-83 was used for other crops, princi-
pally cocoa, fruits (noncitrus) and coconut. In Johor- State for 1983, 13% of
the area developed under the grant was converted to other crops consisting of
fruits (noncitrus) 64%, cocoa 24Z, coconut 8Z, and citrus, fodder, coffee and
pineapple 3%. Under the project, it is expected that about 15% of the
agricultural a:ea would be developed as diversified crops. The grant paid for
all diversifietd crops is the same as for oil palm.
D. Farm Incomes
5.12      Farm models were prepared for the four major types of farm
development expected to take place. The existing old rubber is estimated to
give a net farm income of M$1,500/year equal to M$6/day worked. The income
level is less than one-half of the officially estimated poverty income level
(M$4,200/year) and the return to labor is much less than the M$10/day
unskilled rural wage rate. With the project, the highest net farm income
would be obtained by planting new rubber (Table 5.4) under current price
expectations. However, growers are expected to retain greater interest in oil
palm where the fewer days worked give a return to labor (M$30/day), more than
double that of rubber (M$14tday), and permit greater off-farm work. Growers
electing to join in a mini-estate group (production cooperative) would receive
a marginally higher return from their 2.5 ha share resulting from better man-
agement. Some interest is expected to be shown in crops other than rubber and
oil palm for local market supply. Rates of return on all farm models are
satisfactory.

VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Evaluation
Benefits
6.01      The project benefits would be (i} reduction of flood damage of farms
and villages resulting from Bekok dam construction and river training, (ii)
increased value-added from replanting old rubber trees with new clones and oil
palm, bringing swampland into production and diversification of coconut in
accordance with sector objectives (para. 1.06), (iii) provision of drinking
water to towns in Batu Pahat and Ketuang district. Other nonquantifiable
benefits would accrue such as improved road access for commuters to urban
employment, and institutional strengthening. The project would directly
benefit some 30,000 smaltholder families. At full production, it would result
in an incremental annual output of 4,100 tons of rubber, 40,000 tons of palm
oil and 900 tons of diversified crops. After the project works are completed,
another 72,500 ha would remain to be planted which should produce another
20,000 tons of rubber, 200,000 tons of palm oil and 4,500 tons of diversified
crops annually. Flood control benefits to agriculture are captured in the
estimation of incremental production with and without the project. Flood
control benefits to urban areas are assessed on the basis of the annual value
of recorded damage during recent years, varying between M$1 million and
M$4 million.  Most of the direct project benefits would accrue to about 30,000
smallholder families. The smallholders, over 95Z in the poverty target group,
have average annual incomes of US$350 per capita. With the project, average
incomes are expected to rise to about US$580 per capita per year. While this
would be above the absolute poverty level of US$360 per capita per year it
remains below the average per capita income of about US$2,000 per year.
Economic Analysis
6.02      Joint costs are allocated to the flood control and water supply com-
ponents of the Bekok dam by comparing the present worth of costs and benefits
of the dam built for flood-control alone and that of the dual-purpose dam
(separable costs-remaining benefits). The benefits of the water supply and
the associated costs, estimated at 482 of dam costs, are excluded from the
rest of the analysis. Other components were included at full costs.
6.03      The economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 14X
under the assumptions shown in the cost tables and crop models. The cost and
benefit streams are shown in Annex 4.1. The rate of return is relatively
insensitive to variations in basic assumptions. For example, commodity prices
would have to fall another 25Z from their present depressed levels before the
internal rate of return switches below 10X.  Costs would need to riseA40Z to
produce the same effect. Exclusion of urban infrastructure benefits entirely
reduces the IRR by only less than 1Z. Commodity prices used are shown in
Annex 4.2 and are based on Bank projections updated in January 1986. The
incremental output of rubber and palm oil represents only 0.3% and 1% respect-
ively of national production and would not cause market problems.  Labor is
costed at the full wage rate assuming the marginal opportunity cost of labor
is equal to the market wage.



- 29 -
B. Project Risk
6.04      The major risk is from land acquisition delays and government bud-
getary problems. In the previous project, land acquisition which became a
serious impediment to project implementation was eventually overcome by the
recruitment of an extra 48 professional staff in the Lands Office
(para. 3.15). Adequate provision foi the project has been made under the
Fifth Malaysia Plan. However, further spending cuts could influence the rate
of implementation. These two risks have been incorporated into the project
design by having a conservative pace of implementatior over seven years,
including a lead time of one year (1986) prior to coi_encement of works during
which land acquisition and further detailed design would proceed.
C. Cost Recovery
6.05      Direct beneficiaries of the project works would be users of the town
water supply, urban property owners and farmers. Costs of the town water
supply would be recovered through the tariff increase agreed in the Johor
Water Supply Project (Loan 2654-MA) for US$62 million, which was presented to
the Board on March 26, 1986. Recovery of costs for protection of urban land
from floods would be made through reassessment of the taxable value of the
property for annual land tax payment.
6.06      Recovery of costs for agricultural land improvement would be made
through the established practice of adding a betterment levy to the land tax
upon completion of project works. The current levy is M$14/ha/year,
representing 30% of the cost of operation and maintenance of drains and roads.
Almost 1OOZ of drainage levies due in completed (gazetted) areas are routinely
collected and those for Johor State are the highest in Malaysia. Indirect
cost recovery is made through export taxes on rubber and palm oil and through
the replanting and research cesses on rubber.
6.07      Johor State drainage levies were last adjusted in 1970.  They are
currently under review together with those for the rest of Malaysia, within
the context of cost-sharing between the Federal and State governments and the
beneficiaries. Under the First Western Johor Agricultural Development
Project, the Johor Government has been reluctant to gazette areas as completed
because this requires it to be responsible for operation and maintenance of
the scheme. Nevertheless, under the first project, Federal government
allocations remain satisfactory for adequate system operation and
maintenance. Timely gazetting of completed scheme portions and periodic
review of betterment levies are needed. During negotiations assurances were
obtained to this effect [para. 7.01(f)].
VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained on the  'llowing:
(a)  The Government would acquire or make available in accurdance with a
plan of action satisfactory to the Bank, land and interest in
respect of land for project purposes (para. 3.15).



- 30 -
(b) The Government would compensate people required to move as a result
of construction of works under the project, in accordance with
prevailing regulations (para. 3*15)4-
(c) The Government would by December 31, 1986, employ consultants to
assist in supervision of construction of Bekok Dam and o- river
works (para. 3.19).
(d)  Separate project accounts would be kept by DID, RISDA, and the
Project Office, and would be audited annually, together with the
special account, by auditors acceptable to the Bank; the auditors'
reports would be sent to the Bank within nine months of the close of
the Government's fiscal year (para. 3.31).
(e) The Government would by December 31, 1986 appoint a panel of experts
with composition and responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank with
regard to the Bekok Dam and related structures to
(i) review construction quality and progress;
(ii) review revisions in design and construction practice; and
(iii) review the accuracy of the maintenance and safety inspection
program (para. 4.15).
(f)  The Government would, under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank:
5i) promptly after completion of each segment of works, transfer
the responsibility for operation and maintenance of the works
to the State of Johor (para. 4.18); and
(ii) take all necessary measures to ensure that the State of Johor:
a.   gazette areas benefitting from drainage works constructed
under the project to enable the State of Johor to
collection drainage charges;
b.   collect such drainage charges; and
c.   periodically review the drainage charges (para. 6.07).
7.02      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$55.0 million to Malaysia. The loan would have a repay-
ment period of 15 years, including a grace period of three years at the stan-
dard variable interest rate.
