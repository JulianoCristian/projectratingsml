Some\n            lessons learned included: action on land acquisition and\n            detailed designs for civil works prior to project\n            commencement helps expeditious project implementation, as\n            was demonstrated by the smooth and timely implementation of\n            the Bekok dam construction and river improvement works under\n            the project. In a rapidly industrializing economy like that\n            of Malaysia, with growing labor shortages, attracting\n            competent technical staff to the public sector will be\n            increasingly difficult, and, therefore, greater reliance\n            should be placed on the private sector for the Operation and\n            Maintenance (O&M) of project works. To ensure long-term\n            financial sustainability of O&M of project works, and to\n            promote greater beneficiary participation in O&M, cost\n            recovery from beneficiaries should be increased through\n            inter alia appropriate adjustments in drainage charges. Peat\n            soils should not be drained by deep drains with large\n            spacing; instead, shallow drains with less spacing and with\n            water level control should be used to keep the area drained\n            without lowering the groundwater level significantly."}, "docdt": "1996-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
