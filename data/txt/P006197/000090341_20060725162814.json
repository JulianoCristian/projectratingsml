Overall framework for\n            prioritizing and targeting is needed; although about 46\n            percent of Bolivia's total land area is either\n            regularized or in process, the perception that\n            regularization has not been effective persists. Andean\n            indigenous communities represent very different issues and\n            require a modified strategy. Maximize local ownership of\n            process and community participation for results; as the\n            project matured, it became increasingly clear that local\n            ownership of the process and community participation\n            facilitated the field work, improved the quality of\n            information and improved the involvement of women in the\n            process. Build in research/policy analysis, piloting and\n            evaluation schemes ahead of full-scale implementation; the\n            project accomplished a great deal of learning through its\n            large-scale contracts (for field work, technology). But the\n            project did relatively little policy analysis and research\n            to compare methodologies, prioritize areas, pilot\n            innovations or evaluate itself. For these reasons\n            institutional learning processes were slow."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
