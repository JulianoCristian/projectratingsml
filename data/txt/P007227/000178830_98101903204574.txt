APPRAISPA, OF PJ%f EDUCATION PROJECT
SU iM%11ARY
i.        The Government of Guyana has applied to the International
De-rrel-Aopment As-o;ciatio/TI nt--ern4ati l  -1z, Por R1con,Struxti,n, -d Dneelo,,. 
ment for financial assistance for a project which consists of:
- (a) construction and equipment of
- (iLj Uoine nLew duld t.&jJd.LlUfcKl pIr.UJCL1Y Uteachd11r1 LUiCLLJLA college,
and
-(ii)  stverli,,,ultlaterazl sec.o1u..L-y schoolsa (glossary)J adLI
- Ub) related techniucal assistance
i.        T hie prupuosal, as originally uubnatLieU, caindiliu Witn tLac1er
training college, and ten multilateral and three vocational secondary schaools.
Following discussions with the appraisal mission, and to achieve consistency
in educational policy, the proposal was revised to one teacher training col-
lege and 12 multilateral secondary schools.  However, because Of the country's
limited financial and managerial resources, it was decided to concentrate on
the llimited project outlined in para. (i) above, ieaving the remairider OL the
revisled proposal as a later project for interested assistance agencies.
iii.      Guyana has a very high literacy rate (estimated at 83% in 1960).
But education is deficient in terms of quaiity of staff, relevance of pro-
grams and facilities, and offers restricted access to secondary level.
Therefore, the government has integrated into its overall development plans
for 1969-73 provision for well balanced improvements in the education se_tor -
of which the project constitutes two-thirds of the total investment.
iv.       The primary schools accommodate 90% of the age group, but quality
of output is poor. The quality of secondary education which enrolls about
10"7 of the age groujp is also poor, except for a few schools.. As tne lack
of qualified teache:rs is the major cause, the first priority of the govern-
ment;s effort is         teacher trairing.
v.        The output from the proposed. primary teacher training college with
a capacity of 660 students would raise the proportion of trained teachers in
primary education from less than 40% to 55% and together with in-service
training, to more t.han 60% of the teaching force by 1975.
vi.       Secondary education expansion is dependent on (a) the organization
by January 1969 of a two-year post-secondary teacher training program to
provide essential secondary teacher resources and (b) the training abroad of
key personnel. For the latter, fellowships are expected to be obtained from
multilateral or bilateral agencies in addition to those included in the project.
vii.      The need to prepare secondary school leavers more broadly for further
study and training, and to provide fac.ilities for the part-time training of
schoo:l leavers and adults calls for a replacement of the present narrowly
academic programs of the secondary school. The proposed multilateral schools

viii.     The educational plans now being implemented should also result in:
(a) ir.proved organization of the Minristry of~ Education, includin ng~h etbi sh-
ment of an inspectorate for secondary education; (b) better utilization of
a'll -.air.bl. fac lties  (  a ar.L1der1± entry &nd a±inrae .LportS    for

teachers throughout the service.

x.        A Project Implementation IUnit, responsible for the coordination of
UdeigiJ, cU11ZLtuUtUon, and equipment procurement, wouLd be set up in the
Ministry of Education by the government with IDA/Bank financial assistance.
It would supervise and coordUiabte prelimInary studles, investigations, ar.d
designs submitted by a firm of architects to be appointed as consultants.
Uonturact a-wards aiu procurement would col-lorm bo international buiLuing
procedures.
xi.       Estimated costs are acceptabLe, considering the relatively high
cost cOf non-*traditional building materials in Guyana, and site development
works associated with land subject to flooding. The total estimated project
costs are uS$iO miiiion; tne proposed credit/loan totailing U  .S flL miLuali
equivalent would cover the direct and indirect foreign exchange component;,
inclucding consulting services, training and interest and other charges dutring
construction. Remaining local currency costs ef the project would be financed
by The Government.
xii.      Construction contracts and procurement of furniture and instruc-
tional equipment would be under international competitive obidding. Local
firms would be eligible to compete for furniture procurement totalling
uS$3h0,000 under a Dreferential margin of 15,. In case local suppliers win all
orders,, then about 5';0p ($170,000) of the furniture component would repre,ent
local currency financing. With design and construction extending over f-ve
years, the (iisbursemzent period would be about six years.
xiii.     The projected increase in recurrent costs for education, over the
period 1969-1975, will be moderate.
xiv.      The project provides a suitable basis for blend financing ccns isting
of an IDA credit of US$2.9 million equivalent and a Bank loan of US$2.9 Tnillion
equivalent for a period of 30 years including a ten-year grace period.

on training of teachers, higher and technical education, and on establishing
a mL,tilateral pattern of ed-ucation to provide mranlpower more compatible with the
country's development needs.  In response to a government request, a joint

education proposal which was submitted by the government for the Bank Groupts
consideration in May, 1965.  A mission composed of Messrs. F. Lethem (ueconolnrist),
W. Adamson (general educator), S. Kadleigh (architect), and J. C. Jones (con-
sultant, technical education), visited Guyana in July-August, i965 tLo appraise
this proposa.l.
1.02      The project, as originally presented, consisted of one primary
teacher training college, ten multilateral secondary schools (four new and
six conversions) and three vocational schools.
1.03      Following discussions during appraisal (paras. 319, 320) and
thereafter, the Guyanese authorities proposed the division of the project
into two phases and requested the Bank Group's financing for Phase I, con-
sisting of:
- a Government Training College to prepare teachers for primary
schools;
- five new multilateral secondary schools and conversion of two
existing secondary schools to the multilateral type;
- some essential technical assistance and fellowships; and
- the establishment of a unit to supervise the execution of
the project.
The total estimated project cost is US$10 million equivalent.
Socio-Economic Background
1.04      Guyana's population, economic: activities, and social services are
principally concentrated in a 10-20 mile wide coastal strip.  The only other
major popula.tion center is at Wismar, across the Demerara river from the
bauxite extraction plants in Mackenzie (Nap).
1.05      The population of Guyana is about 693,000 inhabitants and is a
composite of many races: East Indian, African, Amerindian and European.
Traditionally, the population of Indian origin is engaged in agriculture
and the population of African origin irn administration and urban employment,

workers, resulting from the past inadequate structure of the education and
training systeml., which was of the traditional graJmar-school te, a,.d froLm
emigration, which reaches up to 20% per year for certain of these categories
(para. 2.18).  High emi-gration rates are related to socio-historical condi-
tions in Guyana itself, including poor educational opportunities, and to
uetter economl-ilic prospects inr several oth,er EngiLsn speuarking countriews, whe:-re
the selectivity of immigration laws encourages the trend.
1.08      It is not anticipated that improvement in Guyana's education system
in itself could reverse emigration trends.   But this, combined with a better
investment climate resulting in the creation of more jobs and broader promo-
tion opportLunities could help slow downi emigration. Full-time employment is
projected to reach 190,000 by 1975 with GDP growing at an average annual rate
of 5-.2% per annum from 1965 to 1975 (Chart 1).
1.09      Educational developments in Guyana are thus expected to contri'cute
to, and take place within, a more dynamic development perspective than expe-
rienced in the recernt past.



2. PRESENT SYSTE4 OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Structure and Administration
2.01      The structure of education in Guyana (Chart 2) follows roughly
the tradition and pattern of the British system. At the national level,
education authority is vested in the 14i.nistrv of Education:  the Permanent
Secretary is responsible for policy mat;ters and administration and the Chief
Eduication officer oversees the professional aspects of school organization
and operation. The Ministry directly supports government schools, provides
subsidies tc aided schools onerated by voluntary agencies, and is the ma;Jor
source of finance for the University of Guyana.  The Ministry exercises little
authority over aided schools and has no jurisdiction over private schools
even on matters of teaching standards or reporting of enrollment; but the
Ministrv int.ends to imnrnve the situati on gradually.
2.02      To implement. its rapidly expa-wndinog role and responsibilities, the
Ministry structure is undergoing changes (Chart 3), and staffing will need
to be strengt.hened, especial>y in nrefe'ssonnal edfuc-ation snecializations.
Reorganization is expected to be completed by 1972.
2.03      A. primary school inspectorate, staffed by District Education
Officers, is responsible for superision and prograiM review.^T  These officers
are unduly burdened with administrative duties and their number and profes-
sionaJ. preparation are inadequate.* No secondary school inspectorate exst
The Ministry recognizes these weaknesses and is planning to reorganize an.d
strengthen its Ql- '                                            Qe-'Q%n l Jr ape; e- o  1chl
torate and by appointing trained additional staff, especially in the subjects
of' science, English, social science, andC tch             1 A). A plarLr.g divi-

2.05 Prr±iiiay ed-ucation consisr,s of six. years of schooling, free n
compulsory. About half of the 400 primary schools are church owned and
controDlled.
.uo      Th e quality oI primary education is impaired by over-crowdeu hal-
type facilities, inadequate distribution of buildings in relation to density
of population, rigidi and out-moded curricula, inadequate instructional mate-
rials, and a teaching staff of whom about 63% are untrained (Annex 3).
2.07      Government action now being initiated to remedy these conditions
includes:  location of new schools with emphasis on equalization of opportu-
nity in general, but with due regard for urban areas with high population
growth; revision of syl-labi to provide greater correlation of studies with
local environment; and up-grading of teaching through in-service education.
Of imperative importance is an extensive effort to expand the numbers enter-
ing and improving the quality of teacher training at pre-service level.
2.08      I'Iost primary schools include a secondary education department of
three years for those under 15 years of age who do not qualify under the
cormmon entrance examination for a free place at a government-sponsored
secondary school and who do not have the resources to attend private second-
ary schools.  The common entrance exanination constitutes a most severe
screening (one admission for every eight candidates) and leads to the heavy
proportion of enrollment in these secondary departments (Chart 4). These
students may then take examinations after further education (Chart 2) so as
to qualify for secondary schools or certain vocational or craft training
programs.
2.09      The secon(iary departments, housed in the same hall-type facility
as the primary schools are over-crowded, inadequately equipped, with more
than 60% of the teaching staff unqualified and untrained. This situation
is in critical need of remedial action (paras. 3.12 and 3.18).
Secondary Education
2.10      Public secondary education which until 1962 accommodated the se-
lected few is now the fastest growing (Chart 5) segment of the education
system. In 1968, 10,000 students were enrolled in 26 government secondary
schools compared with 1,300 students in 3 government secondary schools in
1962.  This quantitative expansion (34% per year as an average) has been
achieved at a sacrifice of quality.
2.ll      The secondary schools established since 1962 are inferior, aca--
demically and physically. Housed in former primary school buildings, they
have limited or no ]-aboratories or workshops. Thus, the curriculum lacks
balance, comrprehensiveness and does not provide the students the opportunity
to fully develop their abilities, and does not train them for occupations
related to economic development. The concentration of effort is on narrowly
academic studies leading to the G.C.E. (General Certificate of Education;),
but with unsatisfactory results, due in large measure to the above condilions

Technical Education and Training
2.14      Education and training for technical employment is available at
two levels oILy. at the craft level thle Government Tech-unicaI Ins titute
offers pre-apprentice (full-time) and apprentice (block, day-release and
everllgj courses leading to the examinations of the City and Gui-lus o4.
London Institute.  Similar courses have been established by certain indus,
trial firms.  Tne total annual intake at the craft level is estimateu at
approximately 130 full-time students, 30 block-release students, and 300
part-time day and evening students. The total enrollment is of the order
of 1,000 students.
2.15      Techniciasn training is large:Ly confined to the Government Technical
Ins Uti,Ute iSn courses up tU aIn ntermedLate level, priLLcipLly in1 e±1,±i1UU-±u
and building. Some 50 full-time and 175 part-time day and evening students
are enrol]led. For higher technician training and university-level engineer-
ing, students must attend courses in Trinidad or elsewhere but higher tech-
nician courses are expected soon in thie University of Guyana.
2.16      Commercial. training at the lower levels is largely left to private
institutions although certain govermeent departments are operating their
own programs. The Carnegie School of Hiome Economics, iocated in Georgetown,
offers two-year full.-time courses in Home Management (Chart 2), with ar!
average annual intake of 72, together with a number of part-time courses
in a wide variety of domestic subjects (1,350 annual enrollment in Georgetown
and rural centers).
2.17      Agricultural training is provided at the Guyana School of Agri--
culture (Mon Repos) in the form of two-year full-time courses leading to
certificate and diploma awards (Chart 2).   The school assists in a special



- 6 -
training program for primary teachers by offering one-year and summer
courses; 16 teachers are enrolled at present.
2.18      The 1-1inistry of Health is responsible for a wide range of train-
ing including nursing, public health, and medical laboratory technicians
work. Nursing students are recruited at the G.C.E. "0" level and under-
take a three-year course at the Georgetown Hospital. The output of 50 per
year is inisufficient to replace the annual loss due largely to emigration.
(para. 1.07). A supplementary course of one year's duration leads to
qualification in mid-wifery.
Teacher Supply and Training
2.19      The quality of education at aCll levels is limited by inadequate
supply of trained teachers (paras. 2.06, 2.09, 2.11).
2.20      The Government Training College offers a pre-service primary
teacher training course of two years' luration to selected students upon
completion of G. C. E. "0" level.  It has a relatively well trained and
dedicated faculty. But with antiquated facilities utilized to the maxi-
mum, it can admit only about 100 students each year resulting in an out-
put of 85 per year, compared with an anmual demand estimated at 270 (para.
3.09).
2.21      In-service teacher training classes are held in two special
regional centers with an annual output of about 100l Specialist teachers
for home economics and handicrafts are given practical training at the
Carnegie School of Home Economics and the Government Technical Institute.
2.22      Secondary teacher training was non-existent in Guyana until a
year ago. For such staff, Guyana was dependent upon overseas training,
the employment of foreign teachers or uising primary teachers, graduates
of the Government Training College. nie University of Guyana Faculty
of Education has now opened a post-gra(luate course of two years' duration.
in which 60 degree holders employed as teachers or headmasters are enrolled
for up-grading.
Higher Education
2.23      The University of Guyana was established in 1962.  Previously,
Guyana was included within the regional framework of the University of the
West Indies. Working in temporary facilities, operating evening classes
and having a. limited number of faculties, the university has grown from an
enrollment of 165 students in 1963 to 572 in 1967 and, after completion of
the ongoing construction program, is projected to reach 1,750 in 1975. En-
trance is after G.C.E. at "0" level, with G.C.E. "A" (Advanced level recog-
nized by exemption from one year of uni.versity (Chart 2). The majority of
students are teachers pursuing programs toward a specialized degree.

Studies Abroad
2.24      Scholarships and loan for studies abroad, usually requiring
service in Guyana on completion of studies, are provided by the govern-
ment or external assistance programs; awards have decreased from 579 in
1963 to 289 (Annex 4) at present as Guyanese institutions are being in-
creasingly utilized. An estimated 15% do not return to Guyana after com-
pletion of studies.
Education Finance
2.25      Total Expenditure:  In 1967, public expenditure on education
is est.imated at G$17 million, 96% of which was by the Ministry of Educa-
tion anid the remainder by the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Public
Service and lIome Affairs. With private expenditure estimated at about
G$1l5 milliol, total education expenditure was 5% of GDP, which is high
compared to many countries with a comparable GDP per capita.
2.26      Recurrent Expenditure:  Between 1963 and 1967, recurrent ex-
penditure by the Ministrv of Education had an average annual growth of
12% (9.,5% in real texms) (Chart 7) and increased from 15% to 16% of the
government culrrent revenues.  The share of primarv and post-primary edu-
cation rose from 60% to 70% of the total and that of secondary education
(general and technical), from 10% to l5% over the same period.  The im-
balance caused by the increased weight of-primary education e:xpenditures
is to be graduallv corrected (nara. 3.16).
2.27      acrienditure on salaries increase- from 68% to 83% of total recur-
rent expenditures from 1963 to 1967e Teacher salaries are considered satis-
factorv in relation to the aeneral level of salaries in GlIvAana. Ln 23 of
the government secondary schools 97% of the budget is spent on teacher sala-
riesj leaving only G$l per student per enar for equipment and suppli es  but
the situation. is under review to meet thie requirements of the new curricula
(para. 3.12). Onlly six of these 'chooTs are uesed above the minimum economic
capacity for the curriculum presently-taught, but the planned increased
alloeations of "free"t places (nara. 3.10') shoul-d effect i-mmediate improvement
in utilization.
2.28      Capital Expenditure:  Of the 1.963-1967 total capital expenditure
(G$315 :mill;i7^7   abouFt 50% went to nri-mry schools And 30% to other nrirtarv-
school-type buildings used as secondary schools. The remaining 20% was
devoted to higher edueati.on. An increasing sha re of fun ds is pronided for
self-he:Lp construction of schools at primary and secondary level. Capital
expenrditures represented orly <% of total _xea by the KMinistr nof
Education over the period and proved inadequate for the needs..

2.29      Foreign aid:  Out of the revised 1968 budget estimate of G$2.6
million for capital expenditure on education,over 75% is committed from
aid funds.  Britain and Canada are presently financing the construction
and equipment of the university. Canadca is also to provide financial
assistance for a technical/vocational institute at New Amsterdam. The
United States has granted funds for the construction and initial opera-
tion of an industrial training center (Georgetown) and for a primary
school.  The three countries are also the major source of fellowships and
technical assistance, including the services of some 160 teachers over the
last three years, while the Carnegie Foundation is financing a special
curriculum development project at the Luniversity, with UNICEF providing
the teachers' stipends during training. The World Food Program has given
food within the framework of self-help school construction projects. Coor-
diriation and priority allocation of ext,ernal assistance - both capital and
technical - is the responsibility of the Mqinistry of Economic Development.
School Building and Construction Industry
2.30      The coastal belt where most schools are located is below sea level,
subject to flooding, and requiring expensive drainage and foundation designs.
Sites are difficult to acquire because of the scarcity of accessible land and
are often too small to allow for buildings to be expanded economically.
2.31      Most government secondary schools visited were of timber construc-
tion, originally built as primary schools to Ministry of Works and Hydraulicst
designs and sometimes erected bv self-help.   This type of building is inex-
pensive but is inflexible and inadequate for the needs of schools where prac-
tical subjects are taught. The furniture supnlied by the M'inistrv of Educa-
tion is unsuitable. In general, the standard of maintenance of buildings,
furniture and equipmient at the schos vnisitedr was poor, partly due to thin
difficulties of maintaining this type of building and partly because of the
lnk of an orgnnized nnd properly finannnced maintenance progra-m.

2.32    Tndi3enous building materi21s are m-ainly hardwood; clay; stone
and sand.  Although local timrber still plays a predominant part in building,
it is bheinog replae-edrr in onme of its traHitional uss hbv cenmint nroducts
because of the decline of timber production over the past decade
and t-he sub-standard qulity of timber supplies result-

substantial improvement is expected in about five years.
2.33    Construction is one of the major industries in Guyana and currently
em_l.pl-z about 15~00! persons. But the civil works contractors, excePt for
two U.K. firms with. permanent offices, are small.   No detailed

2.34    Government has only limited professional and technical manpower
resources for design and supervision of building projects aiid even witb the
support of the two private local architectural firms, probably would not be
able to carry out major undertakings relating to project design and super-
vi.sion, in addition to existing commitments.
3. MANPOWER PLANNING AND EDUJCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
lianrpoNaer Neeuds
3.0i     Between lyoo-75, overali employment is projected to grow from
140,0(0 to :L90,000, an average annual rate of 3.3%.   Agricultural employ-
ment i.s expected to increase from 32% to 35% of total employment in order
to keep pace, subject to the availability of agricultural credit, with the
introciuction of new rice varieties, the promotion of peasant cane farming,
and potential livestock developments. Construction and services are likely
to expand as a proportion of total employment, wnile a relative decrease is
likely     in mining and manufacturing as a result of continued mechanization.
3.02     The growth in the demand for professional, technical and skilled
workers - alLready in short supply - wi:ll accelerate; but for unskilled
labor, net demand will be limited to annual replacement needs.    This will
generate a shift in the educational qualifications needed for employment.,
with particular emphasis on initial versatility of training for later
specialization (a) as skilled workers and technicians for industry, agri--
culture, commerce, administration, and health services,(b) as teachers
(paras. 3.09, 3.13) and (c) as profess:ional workers. Thus basic education,

3.04     Employment opportunities for the unskilled, after completion of
8-9 years of schooling - the median educational attainment of today's unem-
ployed youth - should dramatically improve during the next decade, as a
result of the projected expansion and changes in secondary level education
(para. .3.10) and training (para. 3.14) to meet skilled manpower requirements
(Annex 5).
3.05     The present :Lack of agricultural technicians (about 40 per year a:e
needed for the private and public sectors against a supply of about 15 per
year) is aggravated by unattractive remuneration levels for technicians in the
extension services. T'o offset this shortage, special upgrading courses for
"certificate" holders in agriculture (Chart 2) have been started by the Sch.ool
of Agriculture.  'The introduction of agricultural streams in some.multilateral
schools should broaden the basis for recruitment to the School of Agriculture.
3.06     In the indu.strial field, the needs for craft level training esti-
mated at about 400 per year by 1975 will be met by the additional capacity

3.08     Primary EduLcation.  Present government admission policy into pri-
mary education at thte age of five years, nine months, has been projected
through 197', but by 1972, there should be less resistance against raising
the minimum age to Six years. Assuming automatic promotion, enrollments
should grow by 30% between 1966/67-19714/75 (Annex 2 A).
3.09     Primary Teacher Training. The annual teacher requirements taking
into consideration:
(1)' the government policy of a 1:40 teacher-pupil ratio
(acceptable in view of the increased proportion of
qualified teachers in the system);
(2) the availability of students with the minimum quali-
fications required for entry into primary teacher
training; and
(3) the impracticality of achieving a 100% qualified
teaching force by 1974/75 without dismissing large
numbers of teachers and overbuilding training capacity;
will be as follows:

having a capacity to produce at least 320 teachers a year.     Combined with
the proposed in-serVIce training program (Annex 6) the proportion of' trained
teachers would therefore progress from .40% in 1966-67 to 61% in 1975-76.
3.10     Secondary Education. The government has aiven assurances that
it willi implament its plan to increase enroilments in government secoud-
ary schools to reach an 80c capacity utilization (optimum feasible for
the curriculum taught) by 1972 (3rart t) through a revIsiorn n_f the exam-
ination system which wou±a raise intake to 3,200 in 1968 (against 70 in 1961
and 1000 in i966/67) and keep it at a level of not less than 15% of tne
expected gradle 6 primary education output (para. 4.08). Under this plan,
20% of grade 6 output would enter aided and private secondary schools, about
45% would enter secondary departments of primary schools, and less than 20()0
would enter the labo:r market.
3.11     Projected secondary school enrollments (Annex 2 B) are compared
with the 19566 enrollnents as follows (in '000):
Government Schools                  1966/67          1968/69          1975/76

Total enrollment                    32.9             27.9             23.3
3.12     This plan permits the transfer of enrollment from the overcrowded
and poorly staffed secondary departments of primary schools (paras. 2.09
and 3.18) to government secondary schools where staff and facilities would
be used with improvecl efficiency (para. 2.27).   Present narrow academic
curricula are to be replaced by modern broadly based curricula with diversi-
fied streams at the senior level of a system of multilateral schools. The
program for the construction of these schools over the period 1969-75 would
cater for more than 60% of total enrollments in government secondary schools.

i/ Nci additional teacner needs in 1960/609-i9609/7 0 because of decrease in
enrollments (Annex 2 B).
To compensate for the shortage of University of Guyana graduates for the
government and aide!d secondary schools snown above during the period 19680
through 1974, it is essential that a special program consisting of a two
year course for training 80 secondary teachers a year should commence as
soon as possible. Because the governrnent recognizes this need, such a
program has been organized by the Ministry of Education on an emergency
basis, and has been put into operation in early January 1969,
Such an arrangement is acceptable as a stop-gap
measure but eventually the training of diploma teachers for the general
secondary education system should be incorporated within an appropriate
educational institution such as the University of Guyana.   The government
intends to evaluate, in consultation with IDA/Bank, the feasibility of
such transfer by September 1972.
3.14     Technical Education. Plans for expansion include, at the craft
level: (a) the construction of the Guyana Industrial Training Center in
Georgetown, to open in 1968 with 125 full-time places, mainly for adult
accelerated training (six to twelve month courses) in the building trades,
and some 500 places for evening up-grading courses and (b) the construction
in 1969 of a second technical institute to be located at New Amsterdam wzith
an intake of 200 students per annum. Additional hostel-places will double
the capacity of the School of Agriculture.
3.15     Higher Education. Development plans for the University of Guyana
call for a continued growth of the existing faculties, raising the output
of graduates from hO (1968) to an estimated 220 (1975). About half of
the graduates are expected to engage in teaching, at least as their first
employment. The Faculty of Education is offering its post-graduate course
in education in the form of in-service treining. anticipates the introduc-



- 14 -
tion of a diploma-course in education (para. 3.13) and, with a Carnegie
Foundation grant, plans studies of educational problems including curric-
ulum development. The faculty, now dispersed in several rented houses,
hopes to attract external grant aid for the construction of facilities for
its teaching and research programs as part of the University's new campus,
the initia'L construction phase of which is to be completed at Georgetown/
Turkeyen by mid-1969.
Financial p?rojections
3.16    In primary education, additional recurrent costs will result from
the. mplynmnenntt. o^f n higchemr pronort+.ion of nqunlified t.+.n'hPrrc rathpr than from
the enrollment growth which will not cause any substantial increase in teacher
nu mbers (Annex 6). In secondary eu cation, increases in enrollments, in the
number of gPraduate teachers and in thes cost of instructional materials in
the multilatveral gc--hool (DV- fully compensated by the improved utilization
factor of existing schools) will generate an average annual growth of excpen-

3.17    Due to increased enrollments in primary schools and nigher costs of
construction (para. 4.16), planned capital expenditures on education for the
period 1966-72 had to be increased to G$24.5 million, a 75% increase above
the original plan allocation. During the period of construction of the
proposed project (1969-73), total capital expenditure is estimated at about
G$28 million and distributed as shown in the table below. Against thi s
total capital expenditure, so far, thep
only external assistance that government has obtained has been U.K. and
Ccnadian grant assistance of about G$3 million towards the 1969 and 1970
expenditure on higher and technical education. The projected expenditure
on secondary education and teacher training relates to that on the IDA/Bank
project, a significant portion of which would be covered by the financing
proposed herein. The over-all capital expenditure on education between 1969
and 1973 is now estimated to be about G$ 5.5 million a year against the
annual expenditure of about G$2.4

Strategy for Educational Developmenit
3.18     In summary, to make the most efficient utilization of available
resources for education, meet manpower needs and improve the employment
prospects of young people, the government is assigning top priority to an
expansion of primary and secondary teacher training and modernizaticn of
secondary education.,  The transfer of enrollments from secondary departments
of primary schools into secondary schools will result in improvement of t;he
seconcdary departments by relieving present over-crowding.
3.19     Def'inition of the Program.  The government request for financial
assist;ance was reviewed within the framework of the government's strategy
for ecducational development and modified during appraisal to consist of the
follo-wing:
(1) one teacher training college with a total enrollment
of 660 providing for an annual output of 320 (initially,
270 primary school teache:rs and 50 teachers for the
secondary departiments of primary schools - para. 3.09);
(2) twelve multilateral secondary schools, with a total
enrollment of 9,600, each ofl'ering three academic and
three 'practical" options in the final two years of
the course. The latter options would replace three
secondary vocational schools included in the original
request. The decision to replace the vocational schools
was prompted by (a) the increased nrovision for vocational
training already completed or agreed upon (para.3.14),
and (b) the need to provide, a broad nre-vocatinnal nrogram
(in the multilateral schools) for those who would later aspire
to gunpe-visorv and hiahPr levels of onprnInemPnt in indistrv_
commerce, and agriculture. An aciditional consideration
was the proposed use of +he "practical" facilitie  in
the 12 multilateral schools for the training of youths
and adults when the schools would not otherwise be in
use  .            To accommodate enrollment demand the
new schoLJsLA shoud be .inI full  a     by 197  (Char 6).



- 16 -
3.20 Feasibilit-y of the mu.ltilateral school program. Th.e above program
for establishing 12 multilateral secondary schools within the period 1969-73
cannot be realized because of (a) A-fficulties in meeting specalist teacher
and administrator  requirements; (b) the lack of adequate capacity of the
building in-'ustry to hantle t  volume of constrcution involved; (c) the
increase in estimated construction costs due to the nature of the proposed
si.tes, the type of schools contemplated and the construction materials
required.
3.21     The government has accordingly decided to implement the multilateral
schuoo'l construction program in two pha.ses so thdat it woul" be fU±l±ly UoJtionLU±L-
al by 1975, but to request IDA/Bank financing at this time only for Phase I
consisting of 7 multilateral schools (paras. 4.01, 4.02) bo be constructed
between 1969-73.  Phase II, consisting of 5 multilateral schiools could form
the basis of a possible later request to the IDA/Bank.
4. THE PROJECT
General
h.01     The proposed project consists of the following:
(a) construction and equipment of one teacher training
college and related boarding facilities, to prepare annually
270 teachers for primary schools and initially 50 teachers
fir the secondary departments of primary schools;
(b) construction and equipment of five new multilateral second-
ary sehools, conversion of two existing secondary schools to the
multilateral type and related boarding and staff housing facilities.
Combined enrollment would be 5,700 students;
(c) professional services for an analysis of alternate
building materials, design, and supervision of cons-
truction;
(d) provision of 15 man-years of fellowships; and
(e) establishment of a project implementation unit.
Completion of construction is e.xpectee by the end of 1973.

4.07    The intake would be provided f'rom among students with GCE "O"level
passes in four subjects; as projected, their numbers will meet the needs
for t'he several types of post-secondary training opportunities. The full-
time teaching staff would number 35, about 15 more than at present.     Fifteen
one-year fellowships for studies at the University of Guyana or abroad are
needed to train the new staff, including those responsible for student
guidance and supervision of practice t,eacher training. In addition, the
Government Training College needs a general adviser on organization and
administration for about two years. Thie government has given assurances
that it will obtain the necessary trained staff and make best efforts to
obtain the requisite adviser   (Annex 1 i,). The government has alreadr taken
steps to obtain the required fellowships from external sources (para. 4.14,
.Annex 1 B).

obtained that the goverranent      will take prompt legal action to acquire
the two remaining sites in time to meet the proposed construction schedule
and that in the meantime consultants vwill have access to them. The site of
one school, Anna Regina, is on the Essequibo coast, within the territorv
which is disputed by Venezuela.   This dispute is being discussed by a Mixsed
Commission established by the Geneva Agreement in February 1966 by the
Governments of U.K., Venezuela and the former British Guiana.
4.10    The project enrollment of 5,700 would constitute 385 of total enroll-
ment in government secondary schools by 1974i75.   The additional school
capacity would be 30j' above 1968; at the same time, unsuitable existing ac-
commodations would be replaced.   The projected maximum annual output of jCE
"0" level is 970 by 1975 or 200% above the present output. The project
would satisfy a critical need to improve the quality of secondary education
and would be phased in such a way that. its additional capacity would become
available precisely when existing facilities will be utilized at their
optimum capacity (Chart 6).
4.11   Curricula.  At the junior level, the curriculum has been revised to
include practical work, i.e., arts and crafts, wood and metalwork and home
economics. At the senior level, five of the seven schools will offer a choice
among three academic options (arts, sciences, and a pre-university technology)
and three pre-vocational options (technology, home economics, commerce or
agriculture). The other two schools, catering for a single geographical area,
are complementary in their offerings.   Two schools will retain for the time
being their sixth-form streams. A guidance program will be provided to help
the students in their choice of options in relation to aptitude, ability,and
future career choice.
4.12    Accommodation. The construction would include 92 classrooms, 19
laboratories, 51 workshops and practical workrooms and 53 special subject
rooms with a high average use-factor of 81%. The average total area of
58.3 sq. ft. per student is economica: 59% is net teaching area, 21% admin-
istration and communal facilities; 20%7 circulation.

for the lower forms, the project can only be staffed by depleting other
schools of their best teachers unless an immediate start is made with the
proposed two-year course to train 80 diploma teachers per year and a
continuing program is established as contemplated.  As agreed durirg negctia-
tions, this energer-Ay program was iritiated in early January, 1969.
4.14     Fellowships and Training. Except for teachers of handicrafts, home
economics, and agriculture, the technical teachers required for this project
would have *to be trained abroad. A comprehensive description of the train-
ing requirement for the project was prepared by the government (Annex 1 3)
and discussed with external aid agencies. In view of the likelihood that
the desired foreign assistance will be obtained, the technical assistance
provided by this project would be limited to satisfying the key needs of
the Government Training College, the multilateral secondary schools, and
related pos:itions in the Ministry of Education as summarized below:
(1) 15 man--years of fellowships are needed to train:
(a) one specialist each, in guidance, and in speech
and drama, for the Govermnent Training College (2 man-years);
b) one! supervisor each in technology, science and English
3 man-years) for the secondary school inspectorate to be
established in the Ministry of Education;
(c) one departmental head ( 1 man-year), one teacher in
commerce (3 man-years) ancL three technical teachers
(6 man-years), for the multilateral schools.
Assurance have been obtained from the Government that it will obtain the
special trained staff necessary, as well as make best efforts to obtain
the requisite advisors from external sources, in accordance with Annex 1 A.
Cost of the Project
4.15     Cost estimates in the proposal submitted for appraisal were based
on the government s exDerience in building traditional schools with unsuit-
able local timber at early 1968 prices. Because of the increasing dif-
ficulties in getting the local timber in adeauate quantity and qualitv
(para. 2.32),, it is cloubtful that industry could meet its regular com-
mitments and the requirements of the oroiect. even at much higher prices.
Guyana, at present, is a net importer of' timber and wood products. More-
over. the traditional tvne of timber design is not anoronriate for the
type of multilateral schools which government, after discussions with the
anpraisal mission. has decided to build.. Revised estimates were therefore
prepared by the Ministry of Works and Hydraulics for more suitable buildings
constructed with less timber and more cpment produntq_ These estimates were
cross-checked with cost data for similar projects recently completed, and
proverA. t'ha becmpYral -- at n +. ao t92 prvc  squar foot-r+.  A considrablr'h1P
decrease in cost-in-use resulting from the more durable basic structure will
partially counterbalance the higher captal costs. More realistic figures
for site development (para. 2.30) than in the original proposal have also

L4.18   Equipment and furniture lists, together with their estima-ted costs,
have been reviewed for all the schools and are satisfactory.
14.19   Total estimated costs per student place may seem high compared to
other countries. But once site development, professional fees and
contingencies are excluded to allow international comparison, the costs
per place of US$615 equivalent for the Government Training College and cf
US$770 equivalent for the multilateral. secondary schools are reasonable.
14.20   Annual recurrent costs of the project schools are estimated at
about G$1.7 million per year. Only G$31.2 million per year represents
additional expenditure due to the project, equivalent to 81% of the Ministry
of Education total recurrent expenditures in 1967. The annual recurrent.
cost of the secondary school system as a whole is estimated to rise to
about G$5 million by 1975(Chart 7).

Implementation
4.21     The need to break with the traditional forms of school construction
and to establish a more economic use of available materials for the design
of the project schools requires the employment of a firm of consultant
architects with experience in the technical and cost studies which precelie
the developmnent of new building techniques, as well as experience in school
design in tropical climates. The consultants, preferably in association
with one or more Guyanese architect firms, should make preliminary surveys
and analytical investigations, design, and supervise construction. They
should also design or select appropriate furniture for the schools. Appoint-
ment of such consultants is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit/loan.
4.22     About one year would be needed for the consultants to perform the
preliminary surveys and investigations. Because of the scarcity of qualified
labor, the limited volume which can be handled on each site by the build'ing
industry, and the need to phase teacher .and administrator training, construc-
tion will not be completed before late 1973.
4.23     Throughout the period of disbursement, a Project Implementation Unit
would be established to initiate, coordinate and supervise all aspects of
the implementation of the project. To head this unita full-time Project
Director acceptable to IDA/Bank has been appointed and will be entrusted with
duties and responsibilities agreed to during negotiations with IDA/Bank. The
unit would be located within the Ministry of Education, and the Project
Direc-tor would have direct access to the Minister of Education and be directlv
responsible to the 'Permanent Secretary. Assurances have been obtained from
government that the Proiect Director wlould be asqisted by an architect and
a specialist in the procurement of instructional equipment and furniture,
both acceptable to IDA/Bankn   He would also be ' isted bhv secialiqts in
education and accountancy, and supported by an adequate staff.
4.24     Se'lection of the civil works contractor and procurement of instruc-
tiona'l equiipment, b,oks and furniture would he on the hnnis of internationn1
competitive bidding. Bids would be invited in packages of a size likely to
encourage international comrnetition.  In evaluatin  bidding for the suTpply
of furniture, Guyanese firms would be allowed a preferential margin of up
to 1*9 of +he .-i.f. landed costs, excluive of impnrt. Atiei or nther. tses.
If al:L furniture contracts are awarded to local manufacturers, 50% of the
furniture component (i.e. a170,000 or less than 3% of the proposed oan and
credit) would represent local currency financing.   The current import duty

- interest and related charges on the Bank loan; and
- the actual foreign exchange cost of imported furniture
and/or tne ex-works costs of locally manufactured furniture.
Since completion of the project would require five years (para. 4.22) funds
would be disbursed over a six-year period (Annex 9) to include the construc-
tion liability period. Undisbursed funds would be avalLable for cancella-
tion. Any excess over the estimated cost of the project would be met by
the government.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     The proposed project would be the first step in a national program
to improve the quality, efficiency and pattern of the public secondary edtu-
cation system to meet Guyana's economic and social needs (Chapter 3).
5.02     The Government Teacher Training College would modernize its curric-
ulum and increase its output to meet thle annual needs for primary school
teachers. T'his would contribute to an improvement in the instructional pro-
gram and the quality of the output frorn primary schools (paras. 3.09 and
3.19).  The multilateral schools would help to alleviate post-primary unEm-
ployment ancl would provide both academ:ic and pre-vocational education to
produce the more versatile school leavers needed in a developing economy.
Trained guidance counsellors would assist the students in selecting their
stuidy programs from the broader choice available to them (paras. 3.02, 3.04,
3.19'L
5 01     The nroposed oroiect is economically conceived. soundLY located,
and well-programed. Estimated costs per place are reasonable. The govern-
ment wmild h abh1e to meet the recurrent costs and h250 of the capital cost
of the project (paras. 3.17, 4.20, 4.25).
5.04     The establishment of a Project Implementation Unit and the proposed
mrogram of tranining tn met staffing nee-es woluld ensure an effective imDle-
mentation of the project. (paras. 4.14, 4.23). Procurement would be on an
inte4national competitive basis, in accordance with TfA/FLnk gilidelines
(para. 4.24).
5.05     Assurances have been obtained from the government that:



- 23 -
(i) The resources and services of the Ministry of Education
will be strengthened, particularly in the field of second-
ary education, including the establishment of a satisfactory
secondary school inspectorate and guidance services, and the
appoin-tment of a competent educational planner in the Planning
Division (para. 2.03);
(ii) Optimwn utilization of public secondary school capacity will
be achieved by September 1972 (paras. 3.10, 3.12, 4.08) by
improving the flow to ardthrough secondary schools (paras.
2.12, 4.08).  This will require a revision of examination
and admission procedures and an adaptation of examinations
t meet Guyanese conditions. (paras. 2.08, 2.11, 3.07);
(iii) The two-year secondary teacher training course with an annual
output of 80 teachers, has been.put into operation in early
January 1969; government will consult with IDA/Bank regarding
the feasibility of transferring the responsibility for the
cc,urse to an appropriate educational institution by September
1972 (paras. 3.13, 4.13);
(iv) The project schools will be used part-time, for adult voca-
tional training (para 3 19);
(v) The s-necial stnff noeped   for the GoverrTnmnt. Trainingr College
, the Ministry of Edvucation     and the project schools
w,ill be obfaijned -in acrdance~ with t~he c'schedule in
Annex 1 A.  Government will also make best efforts to obtain
the requ ri r rdvisrs from external sources according to the
same schedule (para. 4.07, 4.14);
(vi) The legal action required to ensure access by the consultants
t+o the unacquilred sites 5..J I. 5be t   jken pro.ptl.y, znd -1 sites
will be acquired in time to meet the agreed construction
schedule (para. 4 .O9);

ical investigations, prepare the designs of the teacher train-
ing college and the m,ultilateral scxhools and to super-vise
construction (paras. 4.21, 4.22);
(viii)  Government will establish a Project Implementation Unit within
the MLnistry of Education, with necessary iacilities and
full-time professional personnel, including the project
architect andu the procurement officer to be acceptable to
IDA/Bank; the Director of the Project Implementation Unit,
already appointed, with DA/Bank approval, will be entrusted
with duties and responsibilities agreed to with IDA/Bank
(para. 4.23).



5.06     Appointment of the consultant architect would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit/loan (para. 4.21).
5.07     The proposed project is suitable for a blend financing consisting of
an IDA credit of US$2.9 million equivalent and a Bank loan of US$2.9 mil:lion
equivalent for a period of 30 years, including a 10 year grace period.  It
is proposed that disbursements should first be made from thel IDA credit and
after its eKhaustion, from the loan funds. The Borrower would be the Govern-
ment of Guyana.

1) Arts and crafts: The light crafts as taught in the first and second
forms of the wni1ti1atern1 schools T..1l be 1inclued a opin+al,, slnhects

Since few teachers are adequately qualified in both subjects, the teaching
at this level shoUld be integr-ated -with the muore vocatvonally bLased
instruction given in the upper school.
3) Engineering and building: The upper school subjects included under
tais heading are  geometrical anu technical drawing," technology anu trade
theory," and "workshop practice".  To these must be added, for reasons
given above, the subjects of '"woodwork"' and "metalwork".
Ideally, teachers of these subjects should have had experience
within the engineerinig or building industries and should be able to offer
appropriate qualifications at technician or craft levels.  In fact,
persons so qualified are in considerable demand and may be unattracted
by the normal teacher salary scales. Failing such source of supply, the
teacher qualified in educational handicrafts (industrial arts) should be
recruited following a special course of at least one year's duration with
the more mature equipment, techniques, and processes available at the
Government Technical Institute or similar institution abroad. Teachers so
recruited and trained should be able to assume responsibility for the
work of the third form and much of the Technical "B" stream in the upper
school.
Whlere it is possible to recruit from industry generally immediately
after obtaining the appropriate "career" qualifications, two levels
should be contemplated corresponding to technician and craft requirements.
The for-mer having obtained an Ordinary (National) Diploma in engineering
or building at the Technical Institute, should be sent abroad to complete
a course at the Higher (National) Diploma level and to obtain a teaching
certificate.  The latter should possess a Full Technological Certificate
(C.G.L.I.) in his particular craft but would need pedagogical training,
either "pre-service" or "in-service" in character. The "diploma" teacher
(or graduate, if available) would normally be in charge of the work of
the Technical "A" stream and the "certificate" teacher, that of the "B"
stream with considerable elasticity to permit of the full employment of both.

schools (except Buxton), it will be possible to appoint a specialist in
each subject.  As in the case of the light crafts, needlework and cook Ery
will be included as optional subjects in the second year of a separate
goverrLuent 'diLplOlrria training program carried out in co-operation with the
Carnegie School of Home Economics.
6)  Agriculture: The project calls for two teachers of agriculture in
each of tWoC schools; the selection of the teachers in each school should
be such that both theory and practice can be adequately covered.    The
most likely source of recruitment is from former diploma students of the
Guyana School of Agriculture who have had some field experience and can
be induced to retur-n for a cne-year ad-hoc training course arranged jointly
by the School and the Government Training College.
