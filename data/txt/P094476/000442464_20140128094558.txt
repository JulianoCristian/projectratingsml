F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The original objective of the Project was: "To assist the Recipient in meeting urgent community-
driven recovery and development needs by providing social and economic services and
infrastructure to communities."
                                                                                                       vii



  Note: Because the CDF is a demand driven project there is no target set for indicators at the
start of the project. The target depended on the demand from the community.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDO was: "To increase access to priority economic and social services and
infrastructure in war-affected and underdeveloped areas of Northern Sudan, including the three
areas."

ended a civil war that had raged for nearly 40 of the previous 50 years. During the war an
estimated 2 million lives were lost, millions more people displaced, and widespread destruction
of economic and social infrastructure. The CPA was the first real chance for peace and
development for the Sudanese people in decades. The report of the Joint Assessment Mission
(JAM) assessed emergency and longer term development needs for the two former combatants.
The CPA specified that a Multi-Donor Trust Fund-National (MDTF-NS) be established to
finance and coordinate the reconstruction and development needs in the Sudan’s conflict-stricken
States as presented in the JAM. The CDF Project was the first project funded by the MDTF-NS
and the Government of Sudan (GOS) and aimed to channel funds to local communities in war-
affected and underdeveloped areas, including North Kordofan State, Kassala State and the Three
Areas—Blue Nile, south Kordofan and Abyei.

2.       Socio-Economic Context. Estimates of average poverty in the North were at least 50
percent of the population, and regional estimates were much higher in the west (Darfur and
Kordofan) and in eastern regions such as the Red Sea Hills. In the North, approximately 40
percent of urban and 60 percent of rural populations did not have access to a minimum of 20
liters of water per person per day within a distance of 1,000 meters, and the differential between
access in rural and urban areas was growing. Two out of three primary schools were without
adequate water and half were without adequate sanitation facilities, with consequent negative
impacts upon school attendance, especially for girls. Many rural and peri-urban inhabitants were
paying as much as 50 percent of their family income for water, often of dubious quality.

3.      Among children under five, 35 percent in the North suffered from chronic malnutrition
(low weight for age). Malnutrition is strongly associated with structural and transitory poverty,
insecurity, and lack of access to services such as safe water and health care. Gender disparities
were pronounced in the North, with differences within regions by ethnic group. GOS data
indicated that women on average earned 68 percent less than men, placing Sudan 141st out of
177 countries. The challenges in Sudan were particularly great in the states affected by conflict
including: North Kordofan, Kassala and the Three Areas-Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Abiye.

4.     National Development Priorities. The JAM stated that “chief among these [challenges]
is improving governance and creating the decentralized governmental system envisioned in the
CPA that allows for community-driven recovery and an important role for a vibrant civil society
and independent media.” “The NG [National Government] has additional responsibilities related
to guaranteeing the special status of, and enabling development in, the Three Areas ….”

  Note that until 2011, the Government of Sudan was referred to as the Government of National Unity (GONU). For
simplicity, the ICR uses Government of Sudan (GOS) throughout.

5.      The Grant Agreement for the CDF Project was signed on January 16, 2006 and became
effective in April 26, 2006. The duration of the first phase was to be three years divided into two
installments or “slices,” of 18 months each. Total project cost was estimated at US$50 million
for the first phase. The total cost allocated for Slice 1 was US $25 million of which MDTF-NS
and Government of National Unity contributed $15 million and US$10 million equivalent,
respectively. In addition, a total of US$1 Million was allocated by the World Bank (LICUS) to
finance start-up costs and capacity building activities. A key rationale for the CDF Project was
to strengthen peace by investing in communities that had been affected by conflict. If successful,
the Project would help create a stake for the Sudanese in national unity.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.      The PDO in the original Grant Agreement of January 16, 2006 was: “To assist the
Recipient in meeting urgent community-driven recovery and development needs by providing
social and economic services and infrastructure to communities.” 2 For ICR assessment, this
PDO Grant Agreement is used rather than the variation quoted in the Final Project Proposal
(FPP). As Table 1 shows, a full results framework was not introduced until the FPP for Slice II
(dated December 2007, approved January 2008). The original FPP (November 24, 2005)
presented only a list of indicators and potential outcomes, but without any targets or baselines:

    •   Strengthen the role and capacity of localities and NGOs in the delivery of basic social
        services with local community participation in a sustainable manner.
    •   Strengthen local community participation in the identification of basic social and
        economic needs within a framework that encourages transparency in priority setting and
        allocation of resources.
    •   Establish a viable framework for an effective cooperation and partnership among social
        sector ministries, Localities, NGOs and local communities in the provision of basic
        services targeting particularly the poorest areas. Demonstrate the Government’s
        commitment to the empowerment of local agents of change (Localities, NGOs) and
        develop social capital at the local level by strengthening the role of local partners in
        implementing social development activities.

7.     These outcomes are consistent with the Project activities and the results framework that
was later developed.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

8.     When the October 2010 additional financing was approved, the results framework was
revised. The PDO was also revised to: “To increase access to priority economic and social

2
  The original PDO in the Final Project Proposal document was slightly different: “To meet urgent community-
driven recovery and development needs in the war-affected and underdeveloped areas of North Sudan, including the
Three Areas by providing social and economic services and infrastructure.” The Three areas are Blue Nile, South
Kordofan and Abeye. The Project also covered Kassala State and North Kordofan.
                                                                                                                  3


services and infrastructure in war-affected and underdeveloped areas of Northern Sudan,
including the three areas.” As the Project was funded under the MDTF-NS, the PDO revision
did not require approval by the Bank Board, but rather the Oversight Committee (OC) for the
MDTF-NS. Measurement of PDO indicators began with Slice II of the operation when the
indicators were established.

Note that the achievement of the PDO will have a split assessment, up to the October 2010 restructuring (65 percent
disbursed) and from then until Project close (35 percent disbursed).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

9.      The main beneficiaries were the communities of the Three Areas, North Kordofan and
Kassala States. Originally, communities in 10 Localities were selected. By Project close, with
additional financing, the Project had reached 28 Localities, including 616 communities with a
total population of 2.8 million according to the final Implementation Status Report (ISR) citing
GOS estimates. The communities were selected within each Locality based on criteria
developed by the GOS and reviewed by the Bank to identify marginalized communities with the
poorest social infrastructure. Each community established a community-based organization
(CBO) that would be responsible for decisions and contributions with respect to the Project.
These CBOs represented Project beneficiaries who were trained in community mobilization,
needs identification, facilitation of implementation of projects and management. Local and
national government institutions also were targeted for capacity building.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1 Community Development Subprojects

10.     Component 1 was to address pro-poor community development priorities laid out in the
peace protocols, with particular emphasis on access and quality of basic education, health and
water services. It intended to build and renovate basic education and health facilities, promote
adult literacy and child immunization campaigns, launch rapid vocational training programs for
school-drop-outs, facilitate the creation of youth centers, launch revolving textbook projects and
other social services directed at the poor. Programs to facilitate the social integration and
inclusion of vulnerable groups such as elderly, disabled, women heads of households and
children victims of violence, AIDS victims, drug addicts, war-crippled victims, unemployed
youths, etc., were also to be emphasized. The component was also to concentrate on the
provision of small rural infrastructure including access and rural roads and environmental
protection activities including community potable water, wells and spring protection, small
wastewater treatment schemes that use appropriate technologies, improved solid waste
collection, treatment and disposal and reforestation and protection of natural sites.

1.5.2 Capacity Building, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Project Management

11.     This component was to provide training, technical assistance and capacity building to
localities, NGOs and local Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), to improve their technical
skills in the identification, planning, programming, management and delivery of social
subprojects. In addition, this component was to establish the eligibility of target localities to
receive funds from the project through conducting a training program aimed at building their
capacity in the areas of project management (e.g., transparency, accountability, financial
management, procurement), and community participation and empowerment (e.g., participatory
planning process and inclusion of marginalized segments of the population in decision-making).
Once the Project confirmed that these localities met the Minimum Qualifying Criteria (MQC),
the localities were eligible to receive funds under the project, which they would then channel to
service providers for the benefit of the target beneficiary communities using NGOs, CBOs,
private sector, and social sector ministries.
                                                                                                5

1.6 Revised Components

12.     The activities implemented under Component 1 were considerably fewer and more
streamlined than as described in the original FPP component description. In reality, the
component did not contain any specific provisions for program for vulnerable groups. The
component essentially provided for the building and rehabilitation of health units, classrooms,
community centers and water points as chosen by communities. Thus, such activities as
vocational programs, adult literacy, child immunization campaigns revolving textbook projects,
programs to facilitate the social integration and inclusion of vulnerable groups such as elderly,
disabled, women heads of households and children victims of violence, AIDS victims, etc., were
not specifically funded. However, these activities were better accommodated by the building of
structures needed for these social services. While the component did finance community potable
water and wells, it did not provide access and rural roads or environmental protection activities.
The 2007 QAG learning review recognized that the Project needed to be streamlined to improve
implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

13.     The CDF Project, like all MDTF-financed projects was initially structured as a two phase
project, of three years each. Table 2 shows that the first phase of the project was financed
through two slices i.e. Slice I ($25 million) and Slice II (planned $25 million). Donors had
expressed a preference that there should be two slices with the second slice contingent on the
performance of the first. Because of MDTF-NS budget constraints, phase two was dropped and
instead the limited amount of remaining money was added to projects under implementation with
good performance (such as CDF) as additional financing. The CDF project received $20 million
additional funding i.e. $10 million each from the MDTF-NS and the GOS. Table 2 shows
financing installments for the Project. Slice II was approved on January 14, 2008. The total
funds from MDTF-NS were US$52.8 million and US$42.2 million (equivalent) from GOS, for a
total Project value of US$95 million. The additional financing supported a scaling up of from 10
to 28 localities. Table 3 provides a timeline for the CDF Project.

14.     In 2012 a significant allocation of funds of SDG13 million was made in order to remedy
a number of deficiencies and defects in Project outputs. This allocation did not require a
restructuring because the allocation occurred within the same expenditure category. The
allocation would have otherwise been used to finance new sub-projects.

15.     Though the Project was an emergency project, from the beginning, through its CDF
approach, it implemented activities with longer term development potential. Rather than
designing a new non-emergency operation under the MDTF-NS, the original Project was scaled
up to expand these longer-term activities (community sub-projects).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.     The CDF Project was prepared and implemented under the terms of the MDTF-N, as well
as under emergency conditions as guided by OP8.5 (later OP8.0). Thus, preparation was
conducted by the Borrower under the guidance of the Oversight Committee (OC) and with the
help of Bank staff. The OC also approved the Project rather than the Bank Board.

17.    Approach to Preparation. To guide preparation of the Project, the preparation team
applied three main principles:

   •   Finance the most critical services and investments for communities
   •   Identify the most needy populations
   •   Deliver investments quickly

18.    During a comprehensive process of stakeholder consultations, the community-driven
development (CDD) approach was accepted as the best way to meet these criteria. The Project
                                                                                                   7


design built local ownership with the help of “social mobilizers” who informed the communities
about the project and who discussed community responsibilities for and contributions to the
Project (Box 1). The surveyed areas had been deprived for decades of government investments,
and, so, the critical needs were relatively easy to identify: water supply, basic education and
health. Communities were best placed to confirm these needs. Needy populations were
identified through surveys and rankings based on a variety of characteristics such as lack of
health and education facilities, potential for livelihood improvement, population size and
readiness and willingness to participate. The CDD approach also offered a way to achieve
speedy delivery of Project investments through rapid appraisal. To further ensure quick delivery,
the Project design used a new direct financing feature whereby the central PIU account
transferred funds directly to the Localities (the sub-provincial unit of government), which were
closer to the community projects.

19.    Employing the CDD approach meant that the Project was delivering not just physical
outputs, but also offering a vehicle to deliver outputs and services in the future. As seen in the
next section, the GOS has indicated that the CDD approach will be mainstreamed in the
government.
                              Box 1—Role of the “Social Mobilizer”
        The main purpose of the Social Mobilizer was to ensure that women were integrated into
        the Project. With strict divisions between males and females in Sudanese society, the
        social mobilizer had to be female to reach women. But the social mobilizer was also the
        key person to raise awareness about the Project, mobilize community interest in the
        Project, and act as the main liaison between the community and the Project throughout
        preparation and implementation. This person explained the CDD approach as well as the
        community’s responsibility in participating in the Project and was a key to its success.


20.     Coverage vs. focus of Project Resources. One of the important trade-offs for Project
preparation was balance between broad geographical coverage vs. a more intensive focus of
Project resources as well as the necessary complementary resources required for economic and
social service delivery. With one side of the trade-off, the Project risked leaving many more
communities without any Project benefits at all. With the other side, the Project risked spreading
investments across too broad an area that the Government would not be able to make sufficient
recurrent expenditures for essentials such as school supplies and medical staff and teachers.
Because of the equity concerns related to focusing on fewer communities while marginalizing
others, the Project opted more for coverage. The Project design included an unusually large
Government contribution (more than 40 percent of total Project resources), which accommodated
an even broader geographical coverage. The Project design attempted to mitigate the risk of
spreading resources too thinly by introducing the concept of community service package and
other measures, which are detailed in Section 2.2.

21.     Quality at Entry. The CDF project was part of a quality at entry learning review of
recipient executed trust funds by QAG in the Bank in October 2007, prior to the approval of
Slice II of the Project. The QAG review commended the task team for developing a project that
was highly appropriate to the emergency and post conflict conditions of the country. The QAG
pointed out that “as implemented, the project’s development objectives were clear and realistic,
more or less given by the nature of circumstances in Sudan but the documentation can leave the
                                                                                                 8


reader with the impression of a set of objectives far too ambitious for a post-conflict situation.”
The QAG also noted that the lack of assessment of country risks was indicated as deficiency.
The identified risks, mitigation measures and their effectiveness are presented in Table 4.

2.2 Implementation

22.      Context for implementation. Implementation was carried out in a difficult environment
in which some of the villages had been totally abandoned because of earlier conflict. In addition
to the already challenging context at appraisal, during the 2005 – 2013 implementation period of
the CDF Project, the country experienced a number of additional difficulties. These challenges
included: (a) the secession of South Sudan (July 2011), which resulted loss of over 75 percent of
oil revenue - the main foreign currency source for the country- which in turn resulted in an
immediate negative fiscal and balance of payments difficulties for Sudan; and (b) the outbreaks
of conflict in two of the four States targeted by the project (i.e. Blue Nile and South Kordofan
states) that made them periodically inaccessible.

23.     Implementation by communities. By investing in community sub-projects that
supported social services, the Project helped supported the return and reintegration process in a
number of villages. The maximum size of a typical sub-project was US$100,000 equivalent.
Criteria-based selection helped avoid political interference in selection of communities. The
selected communities and their CBOs took the lead in implementation. They submitted
subproject proposals (with assistance from the social mobilizer) that had to meet specific
selection and eligibility criteria as stipulated in the project’s Operational Manual (OM). The OM
contained a menu of eligible and ineligible projects, with a bias towards simpler, low-risk
activities.

24.     In addition to the MDTF-NS and Government funds, communities also made
contributions toward the new CDF investments. Interviews during the ICR field mission in
Kassala State indicated that community contributions were typically 10 percent of total costs, 5
percent in kind and 5 percent in cash, but with the cash portion in some instances paid by the
locality where the community was not able to contribute in cash. This approach was new to the
villages, and these community contributions should be viewed as progress toward local
ownership. The practice of initial community contributions has carried over, to some degree,
into a responsibility for maintenance of the assets, such as water points and solar units, but less
so for schools and health units. There are two mechanisms in place to ensure adequate
maintenance: First, schools and health facilities must have been approved by their respective
State or Locality education and health sector relevant staff; and second a MOU is signed between
the Locality and the community that the Locality will assign staff and allocate running cost (from
the MOE and MOH) for these facilities and communities will support the Locality effort to the
extent possible. For water supply, solar energy and community centers, community committees
raise funds and manage facilities. Sub-projects completed in 2006-07 remain functional, some of
which were visited during the ICR mission.

2.3 Risks

25.    The risks presented in Table 4 are those from the original FPP of November 2005 that
were carried over into the FPP for Slice II (December 2007). These risks were largely mitigated
                                                                                                                     9


as the table shows. However, there were a number of other risks that were not identified, which
did materialize and which affected the Project.

                            Table 4: Implementation Record with Respect to Risks

                            There were delays in counterpart funding. MDTF funds were used until they were
                            reimbursed near the end of the Project. While this was not a good practice, the
                            delayed counterpart funding did not affect Project outcomes.

                            the poorest and most underserved communities. The social assessment and

                         This risk was not particularly relevant because the Project did not rely much on
                         NGOs, but rather CBOs and the social mobilizers.
                                                                                                                10


26.      Capacity building to ensure effective community participation. Capacity building
included a wide range of activities. For example, through its local government leadership
enhancement initiative, CDF trained 30 senior local government officials (i.e., 13 Locality
Commissioners, 13 Locality Executive managers and 4 development planning managers) drawn
from 13 localities. This training was complemented by the Matching Grant from CDF to Locality
Government to help the Local Government officials to translate their learning to practice by
initiating and implementing development activities in their respective locality. The local
government officials responded positively to the training and the provision of the Matching
Grant and demonstrated strong leadership in coordinating the development work in their
respective Locality, mobilizing communities and resources to implement development activities
and engaging the state authorities. This was an important step toward establishing effective
cooperation and partnership between Local Government and communities in the provision of
basic services to the poor.

27.    Mitigating the risk of spreading Project resources too thinly. The risk that Project
resources were spread among too many communities was partially mitigated. There were, for
example, many instances in classrooms where there were severe shortages of learning materials.
The Project team concluded that, given that the nature of the Project which was to make national
unity attractive, it would have been even more risky to have left out a larger number of
communities entirely from Project benefits.

28.     The Bank recognized that this risk had materialized in its revisions to the Project results
framework in the 2010 Additional Financing FPP: “During the design of the CDF project, it was
assumed that decentralization would facilitate the central government to provide block grants to
state and local governments while the CDF would help local governments to adopt participatory
planning and implementation. Since the expected decentralization has not taken place, this
[intermediate] indicator was dropped.” A related example was: “Decentralization has not taken
place and localities do not receive funds for local development.”

29.     Mitigation of this risk included a number of participatory steps to ensure that the Project
investments would result in service delivery as promised in the PDO (both original and revised):
Community Action Plan preparation and prioritization by the communities; revision and
approvals by the Locality Steering Committees and State Coordination Committees; and written
commitments from the education and health sector authorities that staff and other materials
would be provided when the facility was completed. The ICR field mission and monitoring data
confirmed that these agreements were largely respected (Section 3.2). The Project also required
that no school or health center would be constructed unless it was signed off by the relevant State
Minister in order to ensure that the operation of the facility met the sector standard and would be
included in the state budget. For water, the individual State governments agreed that all water
projects built by the project will be owned and managed by the communities. The Independent
Evaluation of the MDTF-NS in Sudan 3 reported that “.. respondents distinguished positive

 Independent Evaluation of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund in Sudan – Final Report, Feb 2013.             There was an
inconsistency in the calculation of the total number of beneficiaries because the sum of individual totals of
beneficiaries from education, health, water and solar were far less than the total number of claimed beneficiaries,
even if it is assumed that no beneficiary enjoys more than one project output. This discrepancy is explained by the
                                                                                                                   11


factors already supporting the sustainability of various projects, including the level of transfer of
knowledge and skills to PIU staff within the GoS; the high degree of ownership of some projects
like the CDF, especially by some state and locality governments; and the current discussion on
replication, expansion, and/or the integration of some projects into state/locality and federal
budgets”.

30.      While shortage of supplies and staff are systemic and country wide problem, it is
important that the allocation of resources has increased in CDF supported health and education
facilities. For example the number of teachers increased in CDF financed schools from 3,375
before CDF intervention to 5,027 after the CDF intervention—about one additional teacher per
two classrooms built; CDF schools received priority for school furniture provided by the
Government to schools. In addition the project took measures to address the risk. For example
in health CDF in collaboration with the Ministry of Health trained 267 Midwives who returned
to their villages and provided services in the CDF built health facilities.

                 BOX 2: CDF Partnership with National Health Insurance Fund

      CDF created a partnership with the National Health Insurance and local health authorities to
      secure sufficient human and material resources for 19 health facilities built by CDF. CDF
      brokered the partnership between the community and the National Health Insurance Fund- a
      government organization which provides very little service outside of Khartoum. Based on
      the agreement, 19 health facilities in North Kordofan and Blue Nile, built by communities
      with CDF support, are managed by the National Health Insurance Fund. The National Health
      Insurance Fund provides all the staff, drugs, medical equipment and recurrent costs and
      provides health services to both those who have health insurance and those who do not have.
      The latter patients pay for the services they receive from these health facilities. The main
      benefit to those who are not insured is the access to good quality health services close to their
      villages.


31.    In general CDF supported education and health facilities received a better allocation of
resources compared to other similar facilities, which is important for a project of a post-conflict
and reconstruction nature like CDF. One example is described in Box 2 where the Project
partnered with the National Health Insurance Fund scheme.

32.     One risk that might have been better identified was the increase in conflict in South
Kordofan and Blue Niles States, two of the four states in which the Project operated. Part of the
reason may have been the relative calm prevailing during 2005-07 leading the Bank and the GOS
to underestimate the potential for instability. As a result of the conflict, Project activities had to
be curtailed, particularly in Blue Nile and South Kordofan and it was not possible to monitor
Project activities after conflicts erupted. This Project was known to be high risk and that it was
operating in post-conflict areas, but it is not clear what the mitigation plan would have been, had
the risk been fully anticipated. The Project mitigated the risk by reallocating Grant funds from

fact that the total number of beneficiaries from education, health and water supply are from facility data whereas the
total number of beneficiaries is the number of population in the 616 communities benefited from CDF.
                                                                                                 12


conflict to non-conflict areas (within the same states or to other states). The PIU also attempted
to mitigate the impact by meeting with Walis (State Governors) and Ministers in charge after the
eruption of the conflicts in Blue Nile and South Kordofan States, and received official
commitments that all sub-projects in the conflict areas, would be completed after the security
situation improved. The status of these commitments could not be confirmed during the ICR
mission.

2.4 Seven Innovations in Design and Implementation

33.     An important strength of the Project was the (at least) seven notable implemented design
features of the CDF that were innovations in the Project area and for the country as a whole.
Some of the innovations demonstrate that the Project not only aimed to address urgent short-term
needs, but also established technological and institutional structures that could produce benefits
over the longer term.

   i. V-Sat for connection between localities and Khartoum. This technology permitted
        reliable communication between the center and the Localities, which was critical for
        project management and M&E.
   ii. Solar energy introduced. Solar installations provided school, health facilities, mosque
        and street lighting cell phone recharge, and health center refrigeration. With the
        provision of school lighting, schools can operate a second shift after dark. This lighting
        also encouraged the enrollment of girls, who would not be able to go to school without
        this lighting. These installations were implemented through partnership with the local
        Solar Institute and private sector contractors. Solar installation costs have fallen sharply
        since this innovation was piloted. Unfortunately, the contribution of solar to the project
        was reduced by US$3 million because of serious procurement problems.
   iii. Building teacher’s dormitories adjacent to schools relieved communities from having to
        pay housing and transportation allowances to teachers. Poorer families could send their
        children to school because they no longer had to pay, thus a poverty reduction benefit. It
        also reportedly reduced teacher absenteeism.
   iv. Social accountability approach implemented. This approach included Community
        Scorecards that measure access, usage and satisfaction of beneficiaries. It was new for
        villagers to be asked for their feedback before.
   v. Community Service Package concept established. This concept refers to specified
        amenities required to consider the facility functional. For example, schools need to have
        toilets and washing and drinking water, locks and fences for security and furniture. The
        service package concept needs to be further engrained to include health and education
        supplies as well.
   vi. A Project Account for the PIU, funded through the MDTF-NS, which transferred funds
        directly to the individual accounts of each participating locality, instead of going
        through the State Governments. This avoided an unnecessary step that would have
        slowed down the flow of funds and possibly led to leakages.
   vii. Empower local officials through delegation of authority and training. Local officials
        experienced a higher level of responsibility which was part of the overall decentralization
        goal. This innovation also needs further work, because with the absence of true
        decentralization, these officials do not have the actual authority and resources they need.
                                                                                               13

2.5 Output Quality and Remedial Actions

34.     The report on functionality of CDF investments (October 2012) identified a number of
issues in implemented projects that needed to be addressed to improve impact and sustainability.
Some of those were related to insufficient dormitories for teachers, security fencing, toilets and
water supply and may have occurred because communities wanted to maximize the use of the
US$100,000 community allocation (e.g., getting more classrooms or water supply and health
clinic), and sometimes left out certain components of the community service package,
particularly those needed for schools. In response to these findings, the Bank/GOS reallocated
SDG13 million (approximately US$3 million) that was remaining from the total project costs of
the US$95 million – reduction in the solar costs etc. The lower-than-anticipated investments in
insecure areas in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan states were reallocated for other subprojects
within the states in secure areas. This reallocation occurred within the same
Component/Category—Sub-projects, and no restructuring was required for that purpose.
Communities were also creative in accessing other funds, e.g., from UNICEF, for some of these
investments. This experience demonstrates that communities do need substantial guidance in
ensuring better functionality of the investments they choose. Communities did, in fact, have to
be persuaded of the value of additional features such as toilets, fencing and dormitories.

35.     Output quality was also measured through the use of Community Scorecards (CS) in
which communities would express their (dis)satisfaction with the promised economic and social
services from the project. The CS process followed three basic steps: 1) present the standard of
service for the investment; 2) users and providers assess the performance relative to that
standard; and 3) hold a joint meeting between providers and community beneficiaries.
Beneficiaries reported that they appreciated being asked their opinions, and could discuss
corrective measures. The CS exercises provided a good complement to other results data. The
overall community satisfaction rate was 90 percent at the end of the Project.

36.     Summary and conclusion. The Project developed local ownership and capacity through
a CDD approach to deliver basic social structures for the neediest communities in post conflict
areas. The GOS stake in the Project at the central level was strong as evidenced by the large
commitment of counterpart funds, more than 40 percent of the total and ownership grew as the
benefits of the Project became more visible. Ultimately, the central government decided to adopt
CDF as a model for service delivery going forward.

2.6 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.6.1 Design

37.     As was sometimes the case for projects prepared under emergency conditions, a full-
fledged results framework was produced during the FPP for Slice II, after the original FPP. The
PDO indicators in the Slice II FPP were related to the original and revised PDOs and were output
oriented with the exception of the education enrollment indicator and access to improved water
supply. An opportunity was missed to establish Project baselines during community selection
process. There were also limited economic services to measure (only water supply for animals),
but that was an issue of overreach of the PDO (both original and revised).
                                                                                                                  14


38.     In the 2010 additional financing document, one PDO indicator was dropped, four were
revised and one was added, leaving, five operative PDO indicators after the 2010 additional
financing. The number of health beneficiaries and the estimate of total beneficiaries are based
on population estimates of beneficiary communities. 4 Once the community was reached with a
Project investment, the entire community population was counted as beneficiaries. More
meaningful indicators could have been measured. For example, for access to water, a sampling
could have been taken of time saved from carrying water from a set of beneficiaries in selected
communities. Another example could be the number of people actually served in clinics, as
recorded in logbooks, and with some notation of the type of service provided, e.g., midwife, first
aid, malaria treatment, etc. Thus, the results framework gave a somewhat exaggerated picture of
the reach of the Project for some of the indicators.

39.     The results framework in the Slice II FPP included many intermediate indicators that
were either beyond the scope of the Project, redundant, or not measurable. It became clear that
most of the intermediate indicators (28) could not be measured and were dropped at the time of
the 2010 additional financing. In addition, nine of the indicators were revised and four new
indicators were added, leaving 14 intermediate indicators after 2010. These indicators were
relevant to the Project activities and help measure achievement of objectives.

2.6.2. Implementation and Utilization

40.     There was a great deal of good quality Project reporting, including four community
scorecard exercises, regular quarterly progress reports by the PIU, and regular Monitoring Agent
Field Visit Reports in Project areas. The Monitoring Agent role was particularly valuable to
Project management. There were also portfolio reviews of the all the MDTF-NS-funded
projects, including CDF. Thus, a substantial amount of concrete and qualitative data was
generated and these data were important to fixing problems that arose in the Project.

41.     Monitoring of implementation was essential to program management to confirm the pace
of construction and the prospects for scaling up. The Functionality Assessment Report was
essential in identifying follow up investments to correct defects in Project activities. Community
Scorecard exercises were valuable in confirming that the Project activities were popular and
worth scaling up and in identifying issues that required trouble-shooting.

2.6.3 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.    Environmental and Social Safeguards. The Project was rated as environmental
Category B. The Category B rating was because of well drilling and construction of facilities.
The sub-projects were limited in scope, had small footprints and the impacts were localized. The
Project triggered two safeguard policies, Environmental Assessment (OP/BP4.01), and
4
  There was an inconsistency in the calculation of the total number of beneficiaries because the sum of individual
totals of beneficiaries from education, health, water and solar were far less than the total number of claimed
beneficiaries, even if it is assumed that no beneficiary enjoys more than one project output. This discrepancy is
explained by the fact that the total number of beneficiaries from education, health and water supply are from facility
data whereas the total number of beneficiaries is the number of population in the 616 communities benefited from
CDF.
                                                                                               15


Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP7.50). As an emergency project (originally under OP8.5-
Emergency Recovery Assistance), the required environmental assessment could be and was done
after project effectiveness. The risk of involuntary resettlement was low because the criteria in
the Project’s OM did not allow sites requiring resettlement. A detailed social assessment was
carried out, “Social and Conflict Analysis-Synthesis Report” February 21, 2006, before Project
effectiveness, which was commended by the QAG learning review. Compliance with safeguard
policies was rated satisfactory. Deficiencies in some safeguards, such as medical waste disposal
that were identified in the Functionality Assessment Report (March 2012) were addressed.

43.     Procurement. Generally, procurement management was straightforward, befitting a
CDD project. The Monitoring Agent rated the Project’s procurement performance as “MS”.
One innovation that worked well was “community contracting” in which the communities did
their own contracting with local contractors. Community Contracting (CC) helped communities
build capacity in carrying out delivery of basic social and economic services. CC also meant that
the payments for construction of facilities remained in the community. This innovation did put
an additional workload on Project staff that needed to provide more intensive help to the
communities in working out contracting arrangements.

44.     There was a shortcoming in procurement relating to solar panels. A procurement agent
was selected who had difficulty in providing adequate procurement documentation. More
importantly, there were also complications related to economic sanctions in which it was not
possible to produce a letter of credit acceptable to suppliers for the ICB procurement. As a
result, the major procurement of solar panels floundered for more than one year and was
ultimately cancelled. Toward the end of the Project, procurement for $1 million was completed
and units for 162 villages were installed. In the end, although the difficulty in procurement
delayed the solar energy installation, the Project came close to reaching the original plan of 200
villages. The shortfall was in Blue Nile and South Kordofan states. In these two states, 40
villages had to be removed from the ICB because of the security issues.

45.     Financial Management. The Monitoring Agent rated FM performance as moderately
satisfactory. There was an FM issue mentioned above in which MDTF funds were used when
counterpart funds were delayed, which is not an approved procedure for a typical Bank-
supported project. Audit reports were unqualified, but cited weakness in internal control and a
cost overrun in expenditure Category 2—goods including vehicles, furniture, generators, IT and
communications equipment. The introduction of Vsat and other IT equipment and generators to
supply the LIU offices with power were not included in the cost at the project design stage.
There were also some difficulties in producing an MIS system, and a separate FM system was
developed by a local consultant. The FM system adequately controlled the flow of funds in the
Project which was well-administered by the PIU FM specialist. This system was demonstrated
during the ICR mission and confirmed the system of controls for community subprojects. A
feature of the Project that facilitated FM was that the resources for community sub-projects were
transferred from the PIU account at the MFNE-NS directly to the target localities of the target
communities. This feature sped up the flow of funds because they by-passed the State
Governments.

2.6.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
                                                                                                   16


46.    With the expiration of the MDTF, the GOS and donors have been exploring ways to
support the CDF activities. The GOS has decided that the CDF model be mainstreamed into
government operations. Budget commitments to continue community development projects
have not yet been specified. Donor support for the continuation of the CDF model has not yet
materialized on a significant scale. The newly effective Bank supported Health project is
expected to support some of the gains achieved by the CDF.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

47.     The assessment of outcomes refers to two periods, from project effectiveness until the
revision of the PDO and additional financing in October 2010, and from that point until project
close. Outcomes are weighted according to the percentage of disbursements at the two intervals.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Before Restructuring—Satisfactory
After Restructuring— Satisfactory
Overall— Satisfactory

48.     Objectives. The stated objectives of the Project continue to be relevant to the country’s
priorities, because there is still large unmet need for basic education and health facilities, as well
as water supply and renewable electricity. The objectives are also aligned with the current
Interim Strategy Note (FY2014-FY2015) Pillar 2 that emphasizes national and local programs
for service delivery focusing and building systems for service delivery and accountability,
especially in areas emerging from conflict. The revised objective referred to increased access to
economic and social services. The Project provided economic services limited mainly to
increased water supply to livestock. It provided an important component of other services, i.e.,
physical structures, which encouraged the contribution of the other components of services such
as teachers and medical supplies. As indicated in paragraph 21 above the QAG Learning Review
noted that the project objectives, as implemented, were clear and realistic, given the nature of
circumstances in Sudan.

49.    The Project also trained village midwives, and put in place agreements with the
Government to supply teachers and durable goods. Water and solar services are much less
dependent on provision of additional resources and are direct services. Services were hampered
by inadequate teaching materials, and, at least in a few cases, limited medical supplies and staff.

50.     The original PDO referred to “meeting urgent community-driven recovery and
development needs,” while the revised objective referred to increased “access to priority
economic and social services.” This change was significant in that it recognized that the Project
was meeting longer term, not just emergency, development needs. Capacity building (a major
activity of the Project) was also not explicitly referred to in the PDOs, though it was partially
captured in some of the intermediate indicators.

51.    Design. The activities of the Project were relevant to country needs. What was
exceptional about the relevance of design were the innovations described in Section 2.2. These
                                                                                                 17


innovations and others described in this ICR were relevant to government needs as evidenced by
how they were embraced by local and central authorities. The relevance of design is also
evidenced by the fact that these innovations and the Project outputs respond to both short-term
and long-term development needs in Sudan.

52.    The design took into account the risk that commitments of complementary resources
from local authorities, staff and supplies were essential complements to CDF outputs for
successful service delivery. These commitments proved important to project success even if they
could not fully compensate for the fact that resources from decentralization would not be
forthcoming. The high level of GOS contribution did demonstrate government commitment to
expanding the reach of Project design, which meant that fewer communities would be left out of
CDF investments.

53.     Implementation. The restructurings, particularly the revision of the PDO and indicators
and the up scaling of activities increased relevance and reflected that the activities were not just
to meet urgent needs, but to contribute to longer-term access to services. Changing the objective
to access vs. meeting urgent needs also improved the specificity of the operation. Capacity
building, both as part of the explicit program and that which was gained in implementing the
Project was also a key component of the Project’s relevance to country needs.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Before Restructuring—Moderately Satisfactory
After Restructuring— Moderately Satisfactory
Overall— Moderately Satisfactory

54.   Original PDO: To assist the Recipient in meeting urgent community-driven recovery
and development needs by providing social and economic services and infrastructure to
communities.

55.     Revised PDO: To increase access to priority economic and social services and
infrastructure in war-affected and underdeveloped areas of North Sudan, including the three
areas.

56.    As stated earlier, there is a split assessment of the achievement of the PDO, up to the
October 2010 restructuring (65 percent disbursed) and until Project close (35 percent). The
achievement of the PDO indicators also shows a proportion that is similar to the disbursement
percentages (table 5): school enrollment (60 percent), access to health (52 percent), access to
improved water sources (55 percent), community satisfaction (83 percent) and total beneficiaries
(76 percent). As also noted, the results framework was not established until the Slice II
approval (January 2008). After an initially slow start progress in reaching communities and
delivery of community sub-projects and capacity building caught up and Project funds were fully
disbursed for Slice 1 and Slice II. With the good record of implementation, additional funds
were made available by the October 2010 restructuring when the PDO and PDO indicators were
revised. Although there were many changes to the intermediate indicators, the PDO indicators
aimed at capturing the same outcomes prior to revision, but with some refinements to improve
measurability.

PDO Indicators

57.     There were five PDO indicators that were monitored, and one - dropout rates – which
was dropped because it could not be monitored. Instead, enrollment rates were monitored. Four
of the five indicator targets were met:

   •    Primary school enrollment total-182,740, boys-103,791, and girls 78,949, (against targets
        of 164,098, 96,744, and 67,354, respectively)—Ministry of Education
   •    Increase of people with access to water with 596,734 people (target-553,863)—Project
        estimates based on community populations.
   •    Increase of people with access to health services with 602,632 people (target-774,056)—
        Ministry of Health.
   •    Percent of people satisfied with service delivery, 90 percent (target-90 percent)—Fourth
        Community Scorecard exercise.
   •    Total number of direct beneficiaries 2,796,853 (target-2,621,794), of which 51 percent
        were female (against a target of 51 percent)—Project estimates based on population.

58.     By providing permanent classrooms and family health units (FHUs) in good condition,
the Project supported increased access to social services. Provision of solar electricity also
provided a social service because children could do school work after dark, health facilities could
store vaccines and other drugs and community centers would have lighting. The solar units also
powered fans in some classrooms improving learning conditions; and provided power to teacher
dormitories. The provision of water supply can be viewed as a provision of a social service
rather than just a component of a social service. Increased access to water benefited not only
schools, but entire communities. Latrines in schools and fences around school grounds also
improved learning conditions and made schools more accessible, especially for girls. Border
                                                                                                   20


fences prevented animals from wandering into school grounds and deterred vandalism of school
buildings.

59.     The percent of people satisfied with service delivery was measured most recently by the
Fourth Community Scorecard exercise (document dated June 2013). The CSC surveyed men
and women and reported a consensus rating. Based on the report, the vast majority of
communities (90 percent) were satisfied with service delivery. Likewise, the Independent
Evaluation of the MDTF-NS in Sudan 5 reported that beneficiaries have expressed high
satisfaction with the benefits from the CDF project. The Independent Evaluation of the MDTF-
NS report indicates that “... during discussions with beneficiaries at project sites – particularly in
communities where the CDF was implemented.

60.     The Independent Evaluation of the MDTF-NS in Sudan, based on extensive field
observation and interviews and a review of project documentation, drew up the conclusion that
“… the CDF's community-led development design has had a positive impact on participating
remote communities' access to education, water, health, and social services. In addition, “the
evaluation team observed important impacts that would be difficult to quantify related to a shift
in community attitudes and capacity as a result of their participation in the project, as well as
their acceptance of and trust in the CDF project staff.” This report further highlighted three
exemplary impacts of the CDF project; the following impact stories related to the CDF project
are taken from the Independent Evaluation report:

          a. Bringing development to closed communities- The Community Development Fund
             has been deeply involved with bringing development to several closed communities
             in Kassala state. Some of the tribes in this part of Sudan have long been wary of
             outside involvement in their communities and have experienced very little
             development as a result. Over a period of many months, CDF staff met multiple times
             with these communities, building trust and explaining the benefits the community
             members would gain from their involvement with the project. This investment in
             establishing a good relationship with community members eventually led to their
             participation in the CDF, which brought schools, training, and other services to these
             traditionally closed villages.
          b. The whole school approach - A fully functioning school requires more than
             classrooms, desks, and blackboards. Water points, toilets, and teacher housing are
             also important components to ensure that schools are completely operational. ... As
             part of the whole school strategy… CDF ensure adequate dormitories are available
             for teachers as needed. … Without the housing, the teachers would not have been able
             to travel daily to the schools due to the long commute. The dormitories allow them to
             remain in the village throughout the week and then return to their homes in town on
             the weekend. Through their inclusive approach, these projects ensure that schools and
             teachers have to provide the children in their communities with a better quality of
             education”.

    Independent Evaluation of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund in Sudan – Final Report, Feb 2013.
                                                                                                21


           c. Mainstreaming gender: The MDTF-NS strives to make its projects gender sensitive,
              conducting analytical work on how to mainstream gender in activities and developing
              projects and products that are gender-suitable. Several of the Fund’s projects have
              had a particularly high degree of impact on the lives of women. With the Community
              Development Fund, women have been incorporated into the community-level
              organization, decision making process, and project implementation from the
              beginning. During visits to communities in Kassala and Blue Nile State, the
              evaluation team found that the opportunities afforded to women through their
              involvement in the CDF had a positive impact on other parts of their lives as well –
              sometimes ensuring their greater involvement in other aspects of the community’s
              life.

61.    The CDF project has also made a positive impact on gender and the marginalized. With
regards to the inclusion of marginalized groups, for example in Kassala, has expended
considerable effort, reaching out to more closed and marginalized tribes in that state, and has
seen a great deal of progress opening the communities to the idea of development and girls’
education 6. Similarly, CDF has made significant impact on the lives of women in the areas it has
been implemented. Through the project, women directly participated in community decision-
making through the Community Development Committees (CDCs), although their level of
engagement varied by location.

62.     As stated earlier, the economic services supported by the Project consisted mainly of
water provided by the Project that was used by livestock owners. There was no indicator for
economic services. One PDO indicator that fell short of its target was the access to a package of
health and nutrition services, with an actual of 602,632 (vs. a target of 774,056). One benefit of
the Project was job creation related to construction and service delivery, which the results
framework did not count. The overall record of the Project with respect to PDO indicators
suggests a rating of moderately satisfactory.

Intermediate Indicators and Additional Evidence for Ratings

63.     Intermediate indicators provide additional, albeit indirect, evidence for achievement of
the PDO. The Project supported sub-projects in 616 communities, including 596 school
construction/rehabilitations (total of 3,021 classrooms), 187 health facilities built/equipped, 273
midwives trained, 183 water supply improvements, and 162 village solar electricity units. Annex
2 has more detail. All of these indicators met or exceeded their targets. In addition, the Project
built teacher dormitories for 267 schools, exceeding a target of 220 dormitories. ICR field visits
confirmed that this intervention was critical to ensuring teacher availability in remote areas.

64.    The results framework used several intermediate indicators under the category “Improved
management of local infrastructure and services,” which helped capture the results of the
Project’s capacity building activities:



6
    Independent Evaluation of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund in Sudan – Final Report, Feb 2013
                                                                                                 22


   •   Community infrastructure managed through a community committee-(289 committees
       actual, 270 target)—Project reporting. Here
   •   Community water points with user fees covering operations and maintenance (O&M)-
       (181 water points actual, 178 water points target i.e. all water points built by CDF have
       user fees that cover O&M)—Project reporting.
   •   Renovated and new facilities in which Localities sign agreement for O&M responsibility-
       % (100 percent actual, 100 percent target)—Project monitoring.
   •   Community Development Initiatives fully implemented by CBOs-% (26 percent actual,
       25 percent target)—Project reporting.

65.      Each of the four targets were met as confirmed by the PIU during the ICR mission. By
ensuring the existence of a community management committee, establishment of user fees for
water, and signed agreements to carry out O&M, the results framework was also capturing the
sustainability of the Project outcomes. The fact that a smaller percentage of community
initiatives were fully implemented reflects the long list of community needs along with an
underestimate of the time required to meet those needs.

66.     Solar units. During the ICR field mission, beneficiaries expressed strong appreciation
for the lighting from solar units. PV solar street lighting systems have contributed to the security
of the villages, created gathering places for reading, and informal meeting places during
Ramadan and spaces to socialize. The PV lighting also created a better overall environment that
encouraged teachers to stay in villages. The results framework could have included intermediate
indicators that would have captured these benefits.

67.     Capacity building. In terms of training, 69,100 people (40,040 male and 29,060 female)
participated in community-level workshops and training sessions on a variety of topics. The
CDF also trained 30 senior government officials through its local government leadership
enhancement initiative, and trained 273 village midwives.

68.     Additional Evidence for Capacity Building.           Achievements by local government
officials through the leadership initiative included:

   •   The project that was started by the Hameshkoreib Locality (Kassala State) Commissioner
       (i.e. starting the first girls’ school in the locality and enrolling at least 100 girls) is
       completed and 150 girls are attending school. This community is very conservative still;
       it was not possible to film the school while it girls are attending classes.
   •   In four nomadic communities of Sodari locality (North Kordofan State), the Locality
       Commissioner and his team have mobilized resources from local government,
       community and NGOs and built dormitories to facilitate the education of children from
       the community; so far 438 students are registered to start their education.
   •   The rehabilitation of the rural hospital in Wad Banda Locality (North Kordofan State),
       which was initiated by the Locality Commissioner, is completed and started providing
       quality health services to the people in the locality. The main aim of the Wad Banda
       Commissioner and his team was to reduce the costs associated with people travelling
       outside the locality to get medical care. The completion of the rehabilitation of this
                                                                                                23


       hospital contributes to the reduction of cost of travelling to get services outside the
       Locality.
   •   The newly formed Tadamon Locality (Blue Nile State) the commissioner and his team
       effectively addressed the sanitation problem in the town and surrounding villages by (a)
       establishing a proper solid waste collection and management system - 2 tractors and 2
       trailers purchased with funds provided by CDF and employing workers to manage the
       system, (b) sanitation awareness education in collaboration with health institutions, (c)
       organizing communities to contribute to the running cost of the waste collection and
       disposal and keeping their environment clean.
   •   In Kailak Locality (South Kordofan State) the locality leadership mobilized resources and
       renovated the Local government offices and built staff house and offices for the
       administrative unit bordering the Southern Sudan; and as a result of this effort
       government staff could be posted in this remote area and provided services to the people.
       This was an important achievement to establish the legitimacy of government and
       strengthening of the peace.

69.     These examples underscore the fact that the Project, though providing urgently needed
inputs, also succeeded in achieving longer term capacity building.

3.3 Efficiency

Before Restructuring—Satisfactory
After Restructuring—Satisfactory
Overall—Satisfactory

70.     An economic analysis was not carried out at appraisal and no economic rate of return was
calculated for this Project. The total amount of resources under the CDF was US$95 million
(combined MDTF and GOS resources). The results framework estimates 2.8 million
beneficiaries overall, which would translate to a gross investment of US$33.93 per beneficiary.
Investments are broken down by Project activity, i.e., education, health, water, solar and capacity
building benefits (Table 6). Expectedly, education has the highest investment per beneficiary
(primary student) because the education benefits require a permanent structure that beneficiaries
use each day of the school year. Solar energy benefits the most people per dollar of investment.
The per-beneficiary investment shows costs for benefits that are highly valued by the
communities.

                            Table 6: Investment per Project Beneficiary

           Sector           Total Cost        No. of        Investment/ Beneficiary
                               US$         Beneficiaries             US$
    Education               57,681,977       182,740                 316
    Health                  7,284,860        562,704                  13
    Potable Water           11,102,078       602,632                  18
    Solar Energy            2,653,657        658,613                  4
                                                                                               24


71.    In addition, there was cost recovery for water use for livestock and some human
consumption that funded O&M for many of the water points, including pump fuel where solar
was not available. There are no detailed accounts for the cost recovery, but the MOU between
the communities and the State Water Corporation (of the GOS) requires that the communities
provide the State Water Corporation with 60 percent of collected user fees and use the other 40
percent to cover operational and minor maintenance costs.

72.     Another measure of efficiency is to compare costs of construction to other norms in-
country. A detailed report, “Independent Evaluation of the CDF Construction Projects &
Comparisons to Similar External Projects,” compared CDF construction costs to those of other
projects in Sudan. In all cases, The CDF structures had similar to substantially lower per square
meter costs. For example, in a comparison of a CDF school and a non-CDF school built in
Telkok Locality (Kassala State), the construction costs of the CDF school per square meter were
about one-third that of the “Rebuilding & Developing East Fund school (SDG622 vs.
SDG1,813). Another example in the report is the construction of two identical water stations in
Damazine Locality in the Blue Nile State. Again the CDF cost was less, though similar,
SDG104, 124 vs. SDG111, 481.

73.     The multiple extensions of the closing date, adding up to several years, also did not seem
to have any negative effects on efficiency. The extensions came with considerable additional
financing in 2007 and 2010, 76 percent above what was originally planned. The Project
activities were scaled up (from 10 to 28 Localities and from 200 to 616 communities). In the
case of solar there were some procurements that did not materialize. The result was that only
US$1.4 million (MDTF) out of US$4 million available was actually used. However, that
component was a small percentage of the overall project (about 4 percent). Moreover, the price
of solar units fell sharply since the attempted procurement because of technology
improvementsThe unused resources were successfully reallocated to other activities. .

74.     Finally, regarding some of the Project’s intangible benefits, the final evaluation of the
overall MDTF, the “Independent Evaluation of the MDTF”, concluded the following about the
CDF Project: “[The efforts of CDF staff] , which took a considerable amount of time in some
instances, were vital to successful implementation of the subprojects…. The evaluation team
heard repeatedly in the focus group discussions with CDF communities that CDF is the only
dependable development partner. This trust in the CDF’s capacity to deliver on its promises—
while not easily quantified—is a positive outcome which could be a cornerstone for future
interventions.”

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

   3.5.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

76.     Community selection was based on the lowest scores for social and economic
infrastructure. Thus, from that standpoint, the beneficiaries were relatively poor. To the extent
that the Project promoted access to improved education and health structures and equipment, the
Project had a positive impact on poverty. The provision of water infrastructure constituted a
direct service to the poor.

77.     Regarding gender impact, according to the CS, there is limited satisfaction with women’s
participation in CDF and development processes by communities, as reflected in average or
below average satisfaction scores by communities in the CS. While women’s participation was
viewed to be ‘good’ in some localities in North Kordofan and Blue Nile, it was consistently rated
low in most localities, with the worst scores observed in Al Gash in Kassala. The lower rating
may be attributed to cultural norms and practices, although CDF project processes appear to hold
promise for positive changes in this Locality. For instance, in Al Gash where women and men
are not expected to mix in a public meeting, the construction of a school bringing together boys
and girls is an important step in breaking these barriers. A gender strategy and plan of action has
been prepared by CDF, but is not yet implemented.

78.    The MDTF-N Sustainability Study noted, there have been substantial perceived
economic benefits, especially for women in most areas, from the interventions in terms of
reduction in time for water collection, enhanced education for girls, and improvement in health
conditions and reduction in maternal deaths. On the social front, the community centers,
equipped with televisions and satellite dishes, have helped in strengthening social relationships at
community level.

79.     The capacity building activities implemented by CDF have made strides in social
development with communities, through Community Action Plans, identifying and prioritizing
their needs and implementing many of the project activities. Communities also own and manage
community infrastructure including water supply schemes and village solar power; mechanisms
to generate funds through user fees and community contributions, and manage through
                                                                                                      26


community committees. The resources provided by CDF directly to local communities were, in
most cases, the only funds available for development projects in the Locality. The CDF also
supported capacity development of Local Government to ensure its commitment to local
development agents i.e. communities and Community Based Organizations (CBOs).

80.     Despite the Project’s efforts, a study 7 on CDD impacts of the Project concluded that the
Project has so far “…failed to increase social capital in war-torn areas of Sudan.” This study was
carried out in North Kordofan and Kassala as the other two States were unstable. However, the
study also found that program villages perceived marked improvement in the cohesion of their
communities, suggesting that the stock of social capital may be growing. Cohesion of
communities is essential to promote communal development initiatives and is critical to promote
peace and stability in conflict prone areas like Sudan. The overall conclusion of the study
underscores the fact that building social capital is a longer term process than a typical project
lifespan.

    3.5.2 Institutional Change/Strengthening

81.      The Public Expenditure review (PER) of 2007 revealed that most state and locality public
spending on health and education went to salaries, while a minimal amount went to investment
spending. Investment spending in the health sector was extremely low, with over 95 percent
going for current expenditure. One of the main recommendations of the PER was that further
increases in government health and education spending should aim to improve spending on non-
salary recurrent costs and investment. The CDF responded to this need to shift resources toward
investment for the construction of basic social infrastructure including school and health facility
with the aim of improving access and quality of service delivery. In addition, the Social and
Conflict Analysis study pointed to the complete collapse of social and economic infrastructure,
particularly education and health infrastructure across the States were inadequate. The main
problem facing the basic education was full collapse of school environment conducive for
education. Most of the schools were built from local materials, and lacked seating, sanitary
facilities and drinking water. Similarly, the health facilities are very poor with trained health
personnel usually found only in urban areas. Buildings of health facilities seldom received
maintenance and were in very poor condition.

82.    With the advent of the CDF, for the past seven years, the GOS has provided more than 40
percent of the resources for the CDF under the MDTF. During that time, the CDF had a manager
for each of the 28 locality implementation units, which have already been handed over to GOS.
Overall, more than 200 staff were employed by the CDF and the majority of these staff have
stayed on. All equipment and computers and furniture were maintained in working order before
being handed over to the GOS. There was also continuous training in procurement and FM at
the locality level. The Project trained about 35 procurement officers, before which there had
been none at all. These officers, in turn, trained government officials in a kind of cascading
build-up of capacity.

 “Community-Driven Development and Social Capital: Lab-in-the-Field Evidence from Sudan,” Alexandra
Avdeenko and Michael J. Gilligan, May 22, 2012.
                                                                                                 27


83.    The CDF Project was an important first step for GOS in the new focus on service
delivery. The GOS is retaining the same implementing structure as the PIU as it mainstreams the
CDF approach to service delivery. The position of Director General at the state level is taking
over the PIU role. Some of the capacity has been retained, but people are now being paid
Government salaries which are far lower than Project level salaries.

   3.5.3 Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

84.     There were a number of unintended outcomes. One positive outcome was the progress in
mixing boys and girls in CDF-built schools in communities where it was not thought likely.
Another unintended benefit was that Federal & state governments kept the Locality
Implementation Unit structures intact, such that overall capacity built could be preserved to
continue the CDD approach within local governments. The positive reputation and trust
established by the CDF will be valuable in future interventions and scale-up.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N.A.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

85.     The balance of the factors increasing risk and reducing risk support a rating of substantial
for risk to development outcome.

4.1 Factors lowering risk

86.      The conclusion of the MDTF-N Assessment of Program Sustainability, World Bank -
October 23, 2011 on local ownership supports the case of sustainability. “Ownership of the CDF
approach by Government and other stakeholder is very strong and the commitment for its
expansion by the federal and state governments as well as the Mahalliyah’s is very evident.
Community ownership of the interventions, especially schools, health facilities, water points and
community development centers is very high and has been significantly internalized.
Communities have shown clear readiness to participate in the operation and maintenance of the
facilities”.

87.    The Sustainability Study of MDTF-N also found that "Communities have mobilized to
ensure benefits are sustained. They have shown strong initiative in operating and maintaining
solar electrification and water projects. For water projects, it is important that the current
partnership between communities and the states’ water authorities that define the role,
responsibilities, and revenue sharing arrangements be maintained to help improve the sustainable
management of water points.”

88.     The CDF design had several built-in features to lower risk to outcomes: (i) a
participatory approach throughout the project cycle; (ii) building the capacity of communities,
CBOs and local government entities; (iii) promoting stakeholders’ partnerships with Localities;
                                                                                               28


and (iv) implementation in close collaboration with local governments’ administrative structure
(MOUs). These measures resulted in active participation of the community in the identification
of their problems and solutions to address the problems, and some gains in social organization.

89.     Also lowering the risk to development outcome is the GOS decision to adopt CDF
procedures for future investments, in particular, procurement, FM and safeguards processes, as
well as community consultation, approval and implementation procedures. In fact, the GOS has
declared that the CDF model will be mainstreamed as the main service delivery approach. This
decision has been backed up by budget commitments for 2014 to CDF-style investment. The
Government has further declared that the priority for service delivery is to first support the CDF
investments that have already been made, including missing structures and defects, and only then
expand further into new communities and Localities.

90.     In Sudan water sources are owned by the State water corporation except those built or
rehabilitated by CDF and communities which are owned by the community. CDF managed to
convince State Wali’s (governors) to provide a special decree to allow communities to own and
manage water sources. The community has an MOU with the water corporation to share
revenues and responsibilities in OM. Sixty percent of the revenue is provided to the water
corporation which is responsible for major maintenance, audit and community training. Second,
for schools and health facilities there is a MOU signed between community local government
and CDF with clear roles and responsibilities.

91.    The staff of the project Locality Implementation Units (LIUs), with the exception of the
Manager and social mobilizer, who worked with the project during the implementation period,
returned to their localities offices with additional experience from the Project.

4.2 Factors increasing risk

92.   There has been and remains instability in parts of two of the four target States, Blue Nile
and South Kordofan. Because of this instability, it was not possible to monitor the Project nor to
conduct fieldwork for the ICR.

93.      While the requirement that all subprojects include operations and maintenance
arrangements whether through the establishment of user groups or maintenance funds has
worked well for community owned and managed subprojects including water supply, solar
energy and community centers, that is not the case for health and schools that are managed by
local government. Although all subproject approvals have been explicit about the recurrent cost
implications of project investments and have been spelled out in Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) and that commitment is sought from the proper authorities to cover these expenses, the
abilities of local government to discharge its operations and maintenance responsibility for
schools and health facilities remains a challenge.

94.      The CS exercises revealed concerns about lack of inputs from the local and central
governments. The CS also cited poor communication between the community and relevant
sector departments such that even when inputs such as text books were available at the locality
level, it was difficult to access them.
                                                                                               29


95.     Also working against sustainability is the lack of external funding going forward. The
CDF will be no longer funded by the MDTF which has expired. There are only small amounts
of resources secured so far. One of which is a US$2 million grant from China to support solar
installations. Basically, the CDF model is going forward using GOS resources, but without
supervision from the Bank as was the case during the CDF. The New Partnership Trust Fund is
planned to continue some of the CDF activities but with a small resource envelope so far. DFID
has provided an initial amount of US$2 million to the fund. At the present time, only analytical
work can be planned with this level of resources. Efforts are ongoing to build up the resources in
this trust fund.

96.     Another cause for concern about sustainability of Project outputs is the loss of capacity
after the close of the CDF. The social mobilizers who performed the critical task of mobilizing
community participation and implementation of the Project and in whom the Project built
capacity have all dispersed. The GOS will need to make efforts, to the extent possible, to locate
these mobilizers and re-deploy them so that they can continue their work in community capacity
building and train other social-mobilizers.

97.    Only four of the 28 Locality managers in whom the Project also built management
capacity, are still carrying out CDF tasks. This is because CDF activities are now being
managed at the State level. Thus, another link has been added to the chain between the central
government and the targeted communities.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

  5.1.1 Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.      The Bank worked well with the GOS and other stakeholders to design community
selection criteria, enlist social mobilizers, and generally familiarize stakeholders with the CDD
approach to service delivery. This assistance brought a number of important innovations for
Sudan. In addition it helped the country apply a rational set of community selection criteria to
overcome political interference and engage communities for the first time in decades. The CDD
approach also allowed communities to choose interventions and to contribute to the investment
itself. The Bank, through the MDTF supported basic capacity building that was sufficient to
initiate implementation. The QAG Learning Review commended the Project for its high quality
Social and Conflict Assessment. The QAG also commended (i) the project institutional
arrangements for implementation, especially on locality level; (ii) the quality and adequacy of
FM arrangements; and overall (iii) the project team’s flexibility and ingenuity in finding ways to
work in the Sudanese environment.

99.  There were also a number of shortcomings in the quality at entry. Even though it was not
uncommon for CDD projects, there was no results framework in the original FPP. The results
                                                                                               30


framework was introduced with the approval of Slice II, but needed substantial improvement at
the time the additional financing was approved in 2010.

100. The risk assessment also had some weaknesses. Issues of security could have been better
articulated in the FPP. The choice of community coverage over focus of Project resources had
its costs, but was justified in that fewer communities were excluded from Project benefits.

5.1.2 Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

101. Supervision missions were regular sufficient and were composed of an appropriate range
of expertise, including FM, procurement and safeguards. The overall reporting for the project
was thorough and of good quality for the most part. Field visits were conducted by the
monitoring agent (MA) which provided specific information on issues that could be addressed by
the PIU and the Localities. The Functionality Assessment was particularly useful and guided
project activities to remediate defects and deficiencies in Project outputs. Additional financing
was secured to scale up the project and was effectively used to expand sub-projects.

102. The delivery of outputs was timely and complete with the exception of solar units and
some school furniture. This was a good performance in a fragile state with low capacity at the
local levels. The Bank could have played a more active role in overseeing the procurement of
solar panels. Donors wanted international procurement and the OC opted for ICB procurement,
which was difficult under the economic sanctions against Sudan. In the end, the solar resources
were used for other sub-projects.


5.1.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

103. With performance at entry rated as moderately satisfactory, and performance during
supervision rated as satisfactory, and an outcome rating of moderately satisfactory, overall Bank
performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

 5.2.1 Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

104. The MFNE strongly supported the Project by providing a large share (44 percent) of the
resources for the Project. Counterpart contributions were late because of the financial crisis and
austerity measures. In the end, all counterpart funds were provided to the Project. The GOS has
also declared its commitment that the CDD delivery mechanism will be mainstreamed as a way
of delivering social services to the communities. Thus, the commitment to continuing the
program is, at least officially, firm.
                                                                                              31



    5.2.2 Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

105. In Project documentation, the MFNE is described as the implementing agency. The
MFNE established a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), at the central level as an independent
unit with administrative and financial autonomy and supervisory role over the Locality
Implementation Units (LIUs). On the ground, it was the Localities working with participating
communities and with the help of the PIU that were ensuring implementation. The social
mobilizer worked well with the CBOs to build capacity, and select and implement the
investments. The overall performance of the implementing agency was rated as Moderately
Satisfactory by the Monitoring Agent, mainly because of the weaknesses of the PIU during the
implementation of the project, including (i) the use of MDTF Grant Funds to cover for
counterpart contribution during the delay of government contribution which is counter to the
Grant Agreement; (ii) delays in submission of financial management reports; and (iii) lengthy
International Competitive Bidding procurement process for the Solar energy component of the
project.

106. The localities with the help of the PIU contracted the construction of schools, health units
and wells, with the exception of community contracting which was carried out by the
communities themselves (again, with substantial assistance from the PIU). The Localities
completed training in procurement and financial management under the Project. Compliance
with safeguards requirements was rated satisfactory for most of the Project. Local Project staff
returned to their previous positions in the Localities, but with increased project management
experience. The final evaluation report for the MDTF concluded the following about the
performance of CDF staff: “As community members witnessed the consistency and dedication
of the CDF staff, their willingness to participate fully in the process increased.” Thus, the
example set by CDF staff was a key to the success of the Project. Finally, the Borrower
produced a good quality, evidence-based ICR (Annex 7), which is a further source of
information for Project ratings.

5.2.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

107. With Government performance rated as satisfactory, and IA performance during
supervision rated as moderately satisfactory, the overall Borrower performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

108. Shortening the path of the flow of financial resources from the source to the end-
user can help achieve quicker delivery of goods and services. As the PDO indicated, there
was an urgent need for social services. In response, the CDF Project design called for direct
                                                                                                 32


disbursements from the central PIU account to the localities, thus bypassing the provincial level.
This direct path shortened processing time and reduced potential leakages.

109. Developing a strong relationship with Government can make it possible to gain
approval for design features that are beneficial, but politically difficult. Getting the central
government in Khartoum to agree to pass financial disbursement authority past the State
governments and directly to the Localities was a difficult measure to get approved. Through
good relations with the MOF and having built credibility through preparation of other projects,
the team was able to get the direct financial flow approved, which facilitated implementation.

110. If broader community coverage is opted for rather than a more concentrated
allocation of project resources, then measures need to be taken to ensure that resources are
not spread so thinly that their impact is diluted. In the case of the CDF, policy makers,
understandably, felt a great deal of pressure not to leave out communities from CDF benefits, but
rather to cover as many as possible. Unfortunately, the localities were not able to fund
adequately the necessary complements for service delivery, such as learning materials and
supplies.

111. Additional capacity building beyond an initial community contribution is required
to develop a maintenance mentality for new assets. The Project required communities to
contribute in-kind in-cash or both, which was a good first step. To reinforce a mind-set for
maintaining the assets will require continued active efforts by Localities, probably using social
mobilizers, over an extended period of time.

112. It is important to demonstrate benefits of the CDD approach to stakeholders in
order to win their support for the approach. Initially, people in the communities were
skeptical of the CDD approach because the central government had not invested in social
services in recent years. In preparing the CDF project, the preparation team presented several
successful cases of CDD implementation (Yemen, Tanzania and Malawi). By showing
stakeholders what these investments achieved, they were persuaded that the same benefits could
be produced in Sudan.

113. The role of “Social Mobilizer” is essential for CDD projects and any capacity built
through this role should be sustained after Project close. Social mobilizers were essential in
not only gaining women’s participation in the Project, but also informing communities, and
winning their acceptance of the Project’s investments, including their obligations through initial
community contributions and ongoing O&M. With the capacity built within the social mobilizer
cadre dispersing after Project close, the GOS will have to find a way to reconstitute this capacity,
or start from scratch if the CDF model is to be truly mainstreamed.

114. The menu of investment choices for participating communities needs to be well
thought out in order to provide the actual service the investment intends. The CDF
provided a choice of investments that was consistent with the community context and were
appropriate in terms of design and cost. In addition, communities do need substantial guidance in
ensuring better functionality of the investments they choose.

                                     at this time. Furniture is also needed. Already had a school

     1. Introduction:
The purpose of this [summarized] Core ICR is to disseminate the findings of the assessment to the CDF
staff members, WB managers and concerned government agencies and other key stakeholders. Its
recommendations are important for the CDF for future improvements at the project design and
implementation levels. On the other hand, the ICR Report is one of the WB’s drives to increase
development effectiveness.

The scope of this ICRR is limited to assessment of Slice II operation’s objectives, project design,
implementation process (Borrowers’ performance) and lessons learning. In order to highlight these
aspects the assessment will focus on outputs, outcomes and sustainability. The thematic coverage is
limited to water supply, education and health, while the geographical coverage includes North Kordofan
State, Blue Nile State, Kassala State and South Kordofan State.

      2. Program Context Development and Design:
      2.1 Brief description of the country and sector background:

After decades of conflict between the Government of Sudan and the then southern regions of the country
and now South Sudan, the CPA marks the first real chance for peace and development for Sudanese
people. There is massive inequality in human development outcomes and access to basic services between
regions and states of Sudan, with those states in conflict suffering disproportionately from limited access
to basic social services and economic opportunities. The CPA recognized that the prevailing wide
regional disparities in development, access to services and opportunities are the underlying structural
causes of conflict and need to be addressed.

The Social and Conflict Analysis study 8 conducted in the South Kordofan, Blue Nile, North Kordofan
and Kassala states (i.e. the states that are benefiting from Community Development Fund Project (CDF)
project) concluded that the cost of war in these states, besides loss of lives and displacement, was
complete collapse of social and economic infrastructure, particularly education and health infrastructure
across the states were inadequate. The main problem facing the basic education was full collapse of
school environment conducive for education. Most of the schools were built from local materials, lack
seating, sanitary facilities and drinking water. Similarly, the health facilities are very poor with trained
health personnel usually found only in urban areas. Buildings of health facilities seldom receive
maintenance and were in very poor conditions.

The Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) had been established within the CPA context to facilitate the
coordination of the reconstruction and development needs of the country both in the southern and
northern parts of the country. The Community Development Fund (CDF) is one of the Projects which are
financed by the MDTF-North and Government of National Unity (GoNU) to address urgent community
recovery and development needs in the war-affected and underdeveloped areas of Northern Sudan
including the Three Areas-Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Abyei.

      2.2 Development objectives:

    Republic of the Sudan, Community Development Fund, Social and Conflict Analysis- Synthesis Report, Feb, 2006
                                                                                                       43

The development objective of the CDF in Sudan was to meet urgent community recovery and
development needs in the war-affected and underdeveloped areas of North Sudan by providing social and
economic services and infrastructure. Social service delivery is perceived by CDF program designers as a
vehicle for facilitating conflict resolution and ensuring peace dividends to the war-affected populations.

Subsequently, the specific objective of the Program is to increase access to priority economic and social
services and infrastructure in war-affected and underdeveloped areas of The Republic of Sudan (Northern
Sudan at the time of design).

    2.3 Components:
The CDF project is composed of the following two main components:
   a. Community Development Sub-projects: This component addressed the pro-poor community
      development priorities as laid out in the peace protocols, with particular emphasis on access and
      quality of basic education, health and water services.

    b. Capacity Building, Monitoring and Evaluation and Project Management: This component
       provided training, technical assistance and capacity building to Localities, NGOs and local
       Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), to improve their technical skills in the identification,
       planning, programming, management and delivery of sub-projects

Through these components the program attempt was to provide sustainable socioeconomic services to the
target groups.


    2.4 Costs and funding,
The total initial budget of the CDF is US$50 million. The contribution of MDTF was US$30 million and
the contribution of GONU was US$20 million. Then the budget increased to $95 million distributed as
follows:

    •   MDTF:           US$52.8

    •   GONU: US$42.2

    •   In addition to the invaluable community contribution which was estimated to be SDG 13.95
        (Equivalent to approx US$ 3 million).

    3. Implementation arrangements:

The Ministry of Finance delegated CDF project execution to a Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
established at the central level as an independent unit with administrative and financial autonomy and
supervisory role over the Locality Implementation Units. Locality Implementation Units (LIUs) are
established in each of the targeted locality/district and are in charge of implementation in-tandem with
local government, communities, CBOs and NGOs. All staffs of LIUs, except the manager and the social
mobilizers who are hired by the project, are government employees and are paid by the state.
Communities are responsible to (a) identify and prioritize their needs through Community Action Plans
prepared by the community in participatory approach (with the help of CBOs, NGOs and CDF LIUs), (b)
contribute to the cost of projects in kind and/or cash, (c) directly participate on the implementation and
management of their prioritized needs. CBOs and NGOs support communities in building capacity and
                                                                                                        44

provide technical support in the implementation of projects which are beyond the communities’
capability. Local government through its Locality Steering Committee reviews and approves a
consolidated Community Action Plan of the district, oversees the implementation of projects, ensures
human resources and recurrent costs allocated to schools and health facilities financed by CDF, together
with the state government ensures the allocation of government staff to LIUs and take over the full
responsibility at the end of the CDF project.

CDF has been designed to align its implementation with regular government structure to avoid a complete
parallel structure which undermines government capacity and leaves a big gap upon project closing. To
this effect, all the staff (except the Manager) at the Local Implementation unit are government employees
who will be going back to the local government planning unit with all the equipment and vehicles of the
CDF Local Implementation Unit. The training of local government leaders and the learning by doing
which was promoted by CDF will facilitate the smooth transfer of all CDF resources, approaches and
objectives to local government.

The entry point of the CDF was conducting of social assessment in the targeted areas and needs
identification survey as part of project preparation. The assessment and survey results were used for
designing and providing basic training to facilitate the identification and prioritization of community
needs, prepare Community Action Plans (CAP) that will be supported by CDF project and implemented
by the community. CDF encouraged communities to create and strengthen Community Based
Organizations that will facilitate the community’s participation and manage local development initiatives.
It also fostered linkages between communities and local government institutions, NGOs and private sector
contractors.

    3.1 Main Beneficiaries:
The beneficiaries of CDF project are the communities of the war-affected and underdeveloped areas of
South Kordofan, North Kordofan, Blue Nile and Kassala states. They are in 616 communities which are
the most needy ones and represent about 16% of the total communities in these States. The total number
of beneficiaries is 2,796,853 which is about 33% of the total number of population in the 4 States.

    3.2 Problems faced during the implementation process:
The project management had faced some challenges and problems during the implementation process and
dealt with them as appropriate. For example, the technical and institutional capacities of the LIUs were so
limited. This has been tackled by training and organization. For example all the over 30 procurement staff
hired by CDF at Local Implementation Unit level had no formal training on procurement prior to joining
CDF. The CDF in collaboration with the World Bank Procurement specialists provided regular
procurement training and back up support to capacitate the Local Implementation Unit procurement staff.
Similarly, CDF trained the engineers, social mobilizers and financial management staff in order to
enhance the capacity and thereby improve implementation of the project.

An important operational problem was the logistical constraints. It had been overcome by appropriate
sequencing of the activities, effective coordination and community participation. Although not serious
the project sometimes faced delays in the release of counterpart funding releases from government. This
usually results in delays in paying the contractors and consequently slippages in the implementation
scheduling. One of the problems that worth mentioning were the delay of community contribution and
this was solved by intensifying mobilization activities.
                                                                                                        45

One case was reported on dispute over selection criteria in Kailak between the Commissioner and
Executive Manager. This was tackled amicably through transparency and involvement of key
stakeholders including the beneficiary community and community leaders in the concerned areas.

    4. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
    4.1 M&E design:
The CDF had designed its own M&E system for monitoring the project activities and for the proposed
evaluation requirements for the project results and impact. The system was formulated of formats for data
and information collection for performance assessment and for measuring progress towards achieving
outcomes and objectives. The M&E system used the indicators of each component from the results
framework for consistency purpose. It specifies the methods of data collection and the responsibilities of
each partner. The M&E system was designed as a flexible document that can be revised and updated
when the need arises.

      4.2 M&E implementation:

The M&E Officer of CDF used to send monitoring formats to the LIUs on quarterly bases for the
reporting and on other occasions as needed. More formats for collecting data from the beneficiary
communities and other key stakeholders were also developed for some specific information needs. The
data and information collected by these formats were used for assessing the financial and physical
performances and for measuring the progress against the intended results of the Programme. The
Community Scorecards were also implemented with the overall objective to strengthen participatory
community monitoring and accountability (PCM&A) in CDF operations.

      5. Description of programme performance:
      5.1 Component I: Community Development Sub-projects:
Performance on Education Sector:

Five hundred ninety six schools have been completed and are providing services to 182,740 (78,949 Girls
and 103,791 boys). 276 teachers residences built i.e. over a third of CDF built schools have teachers’
residences which helps to attract and retain teachers in a remote area. CDF financed schools are
permanent building structures with essential facilities including desks, toilets, hand washing basin and
fences. Over 116 schools and teachers residences are powered with photovoltaic solar energy which
facilitates studying at night for students as well as allowing teachers to prepare for their lesson plans.
Anecdotal evidences suggest that students in schools benefitting from solar power have improved their
exam results; it also encouraged teachers to stay in villages with PV solar systems. The provision of solar
lighting enabled schools to provide adult literacy classes for women in the night.

Community Scorecard result for education services related to availability of adequate qualified teachers,
enough desks, dormitories, latrines and permanent structures such as classrooms have been rated
favorably by communities. On the other hand, indicators such as availability of text books, provision of
school meal and water supply recorded low scores, indicating dissatisfaction 9. The Program has
improved the physical environment in 596 schools in the four targeted States. This was achieved through
construction of 3021 classrooms (72.4%) and 1,287 teacher offices (84.3%). The students’ seating has,
also, been improved at different levels as illustrated by the pie chart below:
Female/Male ratio has changed in South Kordofan from 1.37:1 to 1.3:1;

The number of teacher in the Blue Nile has increased by a high percent of 76.60% but the highest increase
was in Kassala where reached 80.12% while the lowest rate of 22.28% recorded in South Kordofan State.
In North Kordofan the increase was 41.50%. High percentages of increase in number of teachers indicate
that the shortage was substantial and vise versa. And the aggregate increase in number of teachers is
1652 constituting 49% of the baseline number. The achievements have met or exceeded the planned
targets.

Students: The number of students has significantly increased in all States. Kassala State witnessed a
dramatic increase of 108% and the Blue Nile came next by 38.1% while North Kordofan achieved more
than 31% and the lowest increase was in South Kordofan with 28.5$.. The overall increase is 41.6% with
more for girls with about 44% increase while that for the boys is about 40%. See the tables No. below:

The diagram below illustrates the above table for more visibility. It is clear that the impact of the CDF in
Kassala is substantial followed by South Kordofan, North Kordofan and Blue Nile, respectively. The total
number of children enrolled after the CDF intervention over three years is 53,641 (41.55%). This is
mainly attributed to the construction of the classrooms, teachers’ offices and teachers’ houses in addition
to the community mobilization.

    5.1.1          Health Sector:
The health sector attempted to reduce pregnant women and child mortality and to reduce the general rate
of common diseases and to reduce the distances to the health services for the communities. These
objectives were achieved through delivery of outputs in terms of construction of health facilities and
provision of equipment, furniture and training of health personnel.

A total of 110 health facilities have been completed and are providing services to total of 562,303 people
in the four states targeted by CDF. Half of the health facilities financed by CDF also have health workers
residence which serves as an incentive to attract and retain health workers in remote and underserved
areas. 52% of the served population in the four States were females. The table below shows the
breakdown of the beneficiaries by State and gender:

CDF has supported the training of 210 midwives to contribute to the efforts of government to increase the
availability of skilled health workers in rural areas. Fifty nine health facilities are powered by
photovoltaic solar system and this contributed to the availability of health services at night, refrigerated
storage facilities for drugs and vaccines, and solar lanterns for midwives in order to facilitate service
delivery at night. Increases in the rate of vaccination in areas where the health facilities powered by solar
refrigerators are reported by North Kordofan state Ministry of Health. For example, in Sodari locality in
North Kordofan state the ten health facilities built by CDF and operated by the National Health Insurance
contributed to the improvement of coverage of vaccination from 28% to 78%.

CDF facilitated the partnership between the community and the National Health Insurance - a government
organization that administers health insurance fund. Based on the agreement, 17 health facilities, built by
community with CDF support, are managed by the National Health Insurance Fund (Sodari, Gsheikh and
Wadbanda). The National Health Insurance provides all the staff, drugs, medical equipment and current
costs and provides health services to both those who have health insurance and those who do not have.
The latter patients pay for the services they receive from these health facilities. The main benefit to those
who are not insured is the access to good quality health services close to their villages.
                                                                                                           49

Communities expressed high satisfaction due to completion of sub-projects as this has meant access to
health services close to the communities. Building health units has provided access to basic health
services which were not readily accessible. While communities are satisfied with the access to and quality
of health facilities, the level of satisfaction with health services was rated moderate overall. This was
largely on account of low ratings by some communities on critical elements of the health service delivery
i.e. shortage of drugs and staff at the health units 10. To address the issue of shortage of trained health
workers CDF supported the training of 210 midwives who were selected from rural communities and
went back to their villages after completing their training

      5.1.2         Water Supply:
The CDF has managed to considerably increase access of 183 war-affected and rural communities to safe
drinking water. The total number of direct beneficiaries is 596,734 persons 48.86% of them are males
and 51.14% females.

All the water supply schemes are managed by the community committee and selected community
members trained as technicians on O&M. Preventive and minor maintenance handled by the trained
technicians while major maintenance done by the State Water Corporation. CDF supported communities
own and manage the water supply scheme that has been constructed or rehabilitated with the support of
CDF. Elsewhere in Sudan, all water supply schemes (even those constructed by communities or NGOs)
are owned and run by the State Water Corporation which is a government organization. There is a
revenue sharing agreement between SWC and communities benefiting from CDF. Revenue collected
from water sources is shared between communities (40%) and the State Water Corporation (60%) and the
State Water Corporation in return provides training of community members on O&M, audit of the
accounts of the community and provides major maintenance when needed. The 40 % revenue retained by
the communities is used for minor maintenance and expansion of the scheme. This arrangement has
dramatically increased the sustainability of the water supply systems owned by the community.

There is improvement in the overall access to improved water for communities benefiting from CDF
interventions. During the recent Community Scorecard exercise, communities have given a high
satisfaction rating for water supply related services. Benefits to communities include: (i) reduced time and
distance travelled to fetch water, in turn reducing the burden on women and girls who are traditionally
responsible for fetching water for the family; and (ii) access to better quality water–both for human and
animal consumption.

      5.1.3         Solar
The main aim of the PV solar installation is to improve access and quality of services provided by
community infrastructures. CDF financed the installation of 162 Photo voltaic (PV) solar system sets in
10 localities. PV solar system installation in public facilities such as schools, health facilities, religious
establishments and village streets has improved the access and quality of basic social services. The
installation of the PV solar systems in schools facilitated studying at night for students as well as allowing
teachers to prepare for their lesson plans which in turn improved the exam results and promotion; it also
encouraged teachers to stay in villages with PV solar systems. In addition, PV solar street lighting
systems have contributed to the security of the villages, served as gathering places for reading, created
informal meeting places during Ramadan and sanctioned spaces to socialize with peers. The number of
people benefited so far from the solar facilities is 658,613 persons

    5.1.4    Component II: Capacity Building, Monitoring and Evaluation and Project
        Management:
The capacity building activities implemented by CDF have been effective in empowering communities to
take the leading role in identification and prioritization of their needs and implementation of project
activities. Communities also own and manage community infrastructure including water supply schemes
and village solar power; mechanisms to generate funds (through user fees and community contributions)
and mange it (through community committees) are put in place by the community to ensure effective
O&M of community infrastructures.

Resources provided by CDF directly to local communities, often the only funds available for development
projects in the Locality, has great potential to create tension between the Local governments and local
agents (i.e. community, CBOs and NGOs) if not managed carefully. To address this problem CDF has
supported activities that enhance the capacity of Local Government and ensure its commitment to the
empowerment of local development agents i.e. communities, Community Based Organizations (CBOs)
and NGOs. Through its local government leadership enhancement initiative, CDF trained 30 senior local
government officials (i.e., 13 Locality Commissioners, 13 Locality Executive managers and 4
development planning managers) drawn from 13 localities/districts. This training was complemented by
the Matching Grant from CDF to Locality Government to help the Local Government officials to translate
their learning to practice by initiating and implementing development activities in their respective
locality. The local government officials responded positively to the training and the provision of the
Matching Grant and demonstrated strong leadership in coordinating the development work in their
respective Locality, mobilizing communities and resources to implement development activities and
engaging the state authorities

This component provided training, technical assistance and capacity building to Localities, NGOs and
local Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), to improve their technical skills in the identification,
planning, programming, management and delivery of sub-projects. As part of the well-articulated
implementation strategy, activities of capacity building component were prioritized for supporting the
establishment of implementation units at the cener and Localities in which the project is implemented.
One PIU was established at the central level and 28 PIUs at Locality level. At this stage basic training was
provided to PIU members at community level for facilitating and prioritization of community needs
                                                                                                        51


The managerial capacity of the beneficiary communities has been upgraded to the level that they managed
their subprojects with minimal support from CDF. They have, also, managed to carryout contractual
responsibilities and monitoring of the implementation process. So, the CDF started with establishment,
strengthening and organization of PIUs as a pre-requisite for successful, effective and efficient
implementation. Capacity building activities included training and management workshops for CDF key
stakeholders. The workshops went beyond training to informing communities, NGOs, State and Local
Government Authorities on CDF’s facilities and procedures on timely basis.

Basic training was provided to facilitate the identification and prioritization of community needs and
preparation of Community Action Plans (CAP). Local communities have, also, been encouraged to
establish their own Community Based Organizations (CBOs) for more organized participation and
management of local development initiatives. This activity has entailed fostering linkages between
communities and local government institutions, NGOs and private sector contractors.

An example for community organization is well demonstrated by the achievements in Damazine where
112 communities were organized. 112 Development committees were formed of 15 members with
women representation ranges between 3 and 4 per committee. The VDC encompasses subcommittees for
education, health and water for managing the delivery of services and for facilitating community
development programs. The VDCs have been, also, supported to open bank accounts. You have to also
indicate the capacity building for Local government officials through RRI and the impact it has on the
adoption of the CDF approach. Use the info from the various RRI reports you have In advancing the
applications of the Rapid Results Approaches, the CDF project conducted a number of rounds in training
in Leadership Development. The main participants were the locality commissioners and the Locality
Executive Managers as top locality leaders. The major features of training are:

    •   Focused on the role of leaders as “Chief Performance Inspirers”
    •   Anchored in specific performance challenges that each Commissioner and/or Executive Manager
        chose and committed to, at the start of the program
    •   Based on a “learning by achieving” pedagogical model, versus on lectures or case studies
    •   Integrated with the Rapid Results methodology that CDF has already used to inspire new
        performance levels at the community level.

The major objectives of the training are to Increase the odds that the leaders in the pioneering Localities
continue to drive performance and results in the areas they targeted or in new areas. Successes were
measured based on progress that had been made on the targeted areas some months after the training, and
to launch a performance-based leadership development program in the Localities.

        Gender:
As explained under each sector above the CDF programme has achieved a realistic gender balance in
terms of service delivery and participation. The general trend of social transformation indicates more
gender balance even in Kassala State where women are culturally deprived from participation in public
life. This was achieved through gender mainstreaming approach pursued by CDF for mobilization,
planning and implementation of community development activities.

Progress reports record women participation in terms of physical labour, cash contribution and caring for
functionality of projects. The Programme has, also, provided special sub projects for women in response
to women and girls priorities such as fences, female dormitories, girls schools, midwifery training,
latrines for girls and schools water facilities.
                                                                                                        52


    6. Procurement:
The procurement procedures for the CDF project are clearly outlined in the OM of the project. The
procedures in the OM are prepared based on the Bank’s Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD and IDA
Credits, May 2004. The OM includes procedures for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) and simplified and streamlined basic procurement methods such as shopping and
local competitive bidding.

In addition to the adherence to the OM the CDF had developed what is called “Community Contracting” as a
response to the local context. The Community Contracting method is governed by the procurement methods
and in consistent with the standard procurement procedures of the Bank and the GoS and use of simplified
local shopping procedures. The main purpose is to achieve physical decentralization through contracting local
entrepreneurs for small contracts. In order to have informed policy and decision-making process the CDF had
conducted mapping for local resources and capacities. Implementation of a community-based procurement
method entails involvement of the community in the contract management process. For effective use of local
procedures the CDF had trained the Local Implementing Units (LIUs) on procurement procedures. The
initiation of the community contracting, the capacity building and recalling lessons learnt from Slice I have
contributed to smooth management of procurement process throughout the program cycle.

    6.1.1       Financial management:
The CDF started by developing a Financial Management Manual for controlling the project financial issues.
The manual was approved by the World Bank in 2006. The CDF is using since 2007 a comprehensive
computerized Financial Management System (FMS) developed based on the FMM and encompasses
accounting policies and procedures, chart of accounts, and reporting formats. It was developed at the
beginning of the program and was in use since the commencement of the program. This has facilitated the
financial control at all levels (CDF, PIU & LIU) and enabled the financial officers to produce timely and
accurate financial reports. It has, also, facilitated smooth auditing by the internal and general auditors. The
Financial Officers and accountants have been trained on the FMS and it was translated into Arabic Language
for easy use by Pius and LIUs.

    6.1.2       Assessment of Sustainability:
The factors of sustainability of CDF impact exist at different levels for the different components and
within the same component. The most important factor of sustainability which is “Sense of Ownership”
proved to be very strong across all components and in all targeted communities. This is evident by the
community contribution that has exceeded the target of 10% in some cases and by the effective
participation of community members and local PIUs. The Programme has boosted this sense of ownership
by training and mobilization of the beneficiary communities.

The second important factor of sustainability is the in-built mechanism which is manifested by the cost-
recovery fees paid by the beneficiaries, for services. The revenues of water sources is about 2,000 on
average per months shared mostly with the Water Corporation for their technical supervision and
sometimes with the localities. The water Stations are, however, all owned by the communities and their
share is used for maintaining sustainable operations. The fees levied by committees for education, health
and water ranges between 1 and 4 thousand Sudanese pounds for meeting the operational cost of
facilities. The communities have, also, initiated Sandooq (Community Fund) as a traditional mechanism
for gathering community contributions which is used for emergencies and for sustainability of basic
services.

The responsibility of follow up as a constant factor of sustainability is normally shouldered by the line
ministries or departments. The expected role from the Government is confined to employment of cadres,
provision of technical support and payment of salaries. This is, so far, works albeit involves uncertainty
                                                                                                           53

particularly in the areas where conflicts has resumed. The role of line ministries is backed up by the
Locality and community follow up. They prepare and execute maintenance and rehabilitation plans.

    6.1.3       Assessment of Outcomes:
Generally, the assessment concluded that the CDF subprojects have achieved high rates against the
expected outcomes. This is true for the two main components: capacity building and basic services
subprojects. There are tangible achievements in the components that contribute to respective outcomes.
For example, the CBOs and LIUs have been empowered, M&E system is in place and a framework for
collaboration among stakeholders was established. On the side of basic services, schools physical
environment has remarkably increased (See photo in the cover page) the rate of enrollment of children in
schools has dramatically increased, the dropout rate decreased and number of teachers increased.

    6.1.4       Achievement of Program Development Objectives:
To contribute to achievement of the PDO the Program was divided into two major components (capacity
building and basic social services) with a subsequent specific objective of increasing access to priority
economic and social services and infrastructure in the targeted areas. One can, confidently, argue that the
project has largely contributed to the achievement of the PDO through achievement of the specific
objective. The technical capacities of the PIU, LIUs and CBOs have been built and now they are in a
position to carry on the recovery and development processes. This, however, doesn’t rule out the need for
further technical and institutional support. Furthermore, the access of war-affected and rural poor to the
basic social services has dramatically increased in the four targeted States. For instant, access to education
increased by 108% in Kassala State (as highest) and by 28% in the Blue Nile State (as lowest). Similarly,
the access of 163 communities (562,537) to water supply improved.

Other impacts are interventions in such as initiating the first ever girls education in communities where
traditionally girls were not allowed to attend school as in many communities in Kassala State,; almost
over 90% of schools in the CDF areas of operation were not on permanent structures rather they were
made of local material such as grass, straws wood etc and some of them were under trees. Construction of
permanent structure for schools and furnishing them has improved the quality of schools and in some
places in Blue Nile , and South Kordofan States, schools were closed during rainy season and the number
of days the children attend school in an academic year was limited because the old structures could not
protect children from rain.

The health sector has, also, achieved its objective through delivery of the expected outputs in terms of
constructing 460 rooms for health facilities and provision of equipment, furniture and training of health
personnel. The CDF has increased the number of health centers/units by 70% improving access 562,303
inhabitants to better health services (53% females).

    6.1.5       Lessons Learnt and Recommendations:
    •   Lesson 1: Effective coordination of humanitarian assistance with other actors at donors,
        implementing agencies, LGAs and communities ensures harmonization of procedures and
        implementation strategies. Consequently, outcomes will be achieved at high rates and the
        likelihood of sustainable impact will be greater as well.

        Recommendation: It is highly recommended to a permanent and coherent coordination
        mechanism for community development that articulates the Government, NGOs and private
        sector’s efforts.

    •   Lesson 2: Transparency in decision-making process from the outset of the project to the end point
        is very essential for reducing the political interventions and conflicts and conflict of interests. A
                                                                                                   54

    practical example is given by the transparency of the CDF in setting selection criteria for
    beneficiaries that reduced conflicts among stakeholders.

    Recommendation: It is essential to have an organizational structure and coordination mechanism
    that ensures transparent information sharing, decision-making and operational procedures.

•   Lesson 3: It is has been observed through the years of CDF implementation that the support of
    LGAs to any decision makes it easier to reach a consensus among the members of the community
    development committee.

    Recommendation: For smooth implementation of community development projects it advisable
    to establish a genuine and strong partnership with the LGAs.

•   Lesson 4: Use of communication facilities and mass media proved to be effective means for
    timely delivery of messages to communities, for follow up and cost effective.

    Recommendation:

•   Lesson 5: Opting for folklore and traditions (Traditional dances, songs, poetry … etc.) for
    mobilizing rural people to participate in collective activities (Nafeer) proved to have positive
    impact.

    Recommendation: It is recommended to use the folklore and traditions in forms of traditional
    celebrations, drama (Mobile theatre), horse races … etc. for people orientation and mobilization.
    Community mobilization is very vital for accelerating community contribution.

•   Lesson 6: Counterpart funding is necessary for effective partnership with the national
    Government and for dragging Government contribution. However, it implies considerable risk
    when the Government doesn’t fulfill its commitments on timely basis. Delay of Government
    funding imbursement was the major problem faced the CDF through its life cycle.

    Recommendation: It is advisable that the partnership agreement be very concrete and include
    firm clauses about funding imbursement and financial control for strict adherence to budget lines.

•   Lesson 7: Continuous engagement of development practitioners at local level democratic ways
    creates space for the voiceless to participate and to be heard.

    Recommendation: It is advisable to establish a mechanism for effective community participation
    in the decision-making process.

•   Lesson 8: Communities have a lot of potential to organize themselves and effectively produce
    results through new initiatives such as participatory planning and decision making.

    Recommendation: It is strongly recommended to invest in capacity building because it is a
    critical ingredient to unleash the potential of the community for local development and for their
    successful empowerment.

•   Lesson 9: Decentralization proved to be effective for community development and encourages
    community participation and sense of ownership.
                                                                                       55

Recommendation: It is recommended to accelerate the decentralization process for community
development projects and involving all key stakeholders in participatory planning.
