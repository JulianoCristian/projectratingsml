MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF WESTERN SAMOA
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to
the Independent State of Western Samoa of SDR 3.6 million (US$4.6 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a
Telecommunications Project. The proposed project would be cofinanced with the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) as the lead institution. ADB would make
available a loan of SDR 5.7 million (US$7.4 million equivalent) from its
Special Fund Resources. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) will
provide a technical assistance grant of US$100,000. In addition, ADB would
provide a technical assistance grant of $484,000 from its Japan Special Fund.
2.       Background.    Western Samoa has four direct exchange lines (DELs)
per 100 population, slightly below the average for South Pacific countries.
The demand for services is not being met. The quality of the service is poor
because the existing equipment is technologically obsolete and spare parts are
difficult to procure.
3.       The Post and Telecommunications Department (PTD) is a government unit
under the administrative control of a Cabinet Mirister. Its Telecommunications
Division and a Telecommunications Controller are jointly responsible for all
national and international services. The Telecommunications Division shares
common accounts and administrative services with the Postal Division.
4.       Telecommunication operations contribute substantially to Government
revenues (9.4% of the total in 1988) and to the development of the country.
PTD is a net foreign exchange earner for the country; mainly because of the
many expatriate Samoans in Australia, New Zealand and USA, PTD received net
remittances of WS$ 8.9 million (US$4.0 million equivalent) from overseas
telecommunications authorities in 1988.
5.       In 1986, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) funded the
preparation of a Master Plan by ITU, for the future development of
telecommunications in Western Samoa. In 1987, the Government adopted the
Master Plan as the basis for setting the objectives for telecommunications
development under the country's Sixth Development Plan (DP6:1988-1990). The
ITU plan concluded that the existing telecommunications network is close to
the end of its effective working life. Exchanges are increasingly difficult to
repair and maintain; their capacity is limited and cannot be expanded to meet
either the backlog for connections or the expected future growth. Outside
plant also needs major upgrading or replacement. Transmission links will need
a larger capacity to serve as a trunk national network. In the absence of new
investment, the resulting further congestion would inhibit development
activities in both the private and public sectors.
6.       Government Sectoral Objectives and Strategv.   The Government's
sector objectives aim to: (i) ensure the provision of telecommunications
facilities to support the country's overall development objectives; (ii)
improve postal and telecommunications services to rural areas; (iii) provide
reliah- e services at an economical price; and (iv) seek a long-term reduction
in the sector's dependence on foreign assistance.



7.       At the request of the Association, the Government issued its
telecommunications sector policy paper in December 1988. The paper addresses
institutional issues and has five main themes: (i) encouraging greater
autonomy in telecommunications operations; (ii) separating regulatory and
operating functions; (iii) developing effective sector regulations to cover
operating standards, tariffs, and the role of the various participants in the
sector; (iv) supporting the introduction of private sector competition in such
areas as equipment supply and installation to foster greater efficiency; and
(v) maintaining a regulatel monopoly for all local and international voice
services.
8.       Rationale for IDA Involy_ment.   The geographical dispersion of the
Pacific Islands countries, their isolation, and the proportion of the
population living in rural areas contribute to the importance of establishing
effective internal and international communications. The Association's
strategy is to ensure efficient operation and cost-effective development of
telecommunications infrastructure by supporting improvements in the operating
envirinment and institutional efficiency of entities in the sector through
policy, regulatory and institutional reforms. The proposed project responds
to Western Samoa's request for IDA and ADB assistance to explore sector
options, implement required changes, and support modernization and expansion
of the infrastructure. It would be the first operation for the Bank Group in
the telecommunications sector in Western Samoa.
9.       Pro1ect Objectives.   The main objective is to finance priority
investments to upgrade the telecommunications network and to build a basis for
its future expansion, and to lay the groundwork for the development of rural
telecommunications. The project would also assist the Government by
(i) formulating and implementing modifications in institutional, policy and
regulatory environment for telecommunications; and (ii) strengthening PTD's
project implementation and O&M capacity by developing its human resouxces.
10.      Project Descraition.   The project would (i) provide telephone
exchanges in the country's capital city of Apia and four other cities (Asau,
Faleasiu, Lufilufi, and Salelologa); (ii) provide digital microwave links
between Apia and new exchanges; (iii) upgrade and expand subscriber cable
network in each exchange area; (iv) provide vehicles, ancillary equipment and
spare parts; (v) establish a training school; and (vi) provide consultants to
carry out technical assistance and training for policy development,
institution building, project implementation, and utility operations.
11.      grolect Cogt and Fn&nUcigJ.  The total cost of the proposed project
is estimated at US$16.3 million equivalent (inclusive of import duties and
taxes of US$3.7 million equivalent). The project's foreign exchange costs
would be met, under parallel financing, by: (i) the proposed IDA credit of
US$4.6 million equivalent; (ii) an ADB loan of US$7.4 million equivalent from
its Special Fund Resources; and (iii) an ITU grant of US$100,000. All of the
service charges during construction would be covered by the ADB loan. The
local currency cost would be met by the Governmett from its annual budget.
Details of project cost and financing are given in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement categories and schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in the Independent State of Western Samoa are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report
prepared by ADB, No. LAP:SAM 22280, dated May 1989, is being distributed
separately.



(vi)   by January 31, 1991, the Government shall decide whether and how
to re-organize (incorporate) PTD in the light of the
recommendations made by the review mentioned in (ii). If a new
corporate entity is established, the Government shall implement a
plan for the orderly transfer of PTD's responsibilities and
assets, including onlending of the proceeds of the IDA credit and
the ADB loan, to a new corporate entity; and
(vii)   Prior to July 1, 1992, the Government shall review and revise
telecom tariffs and charges to enable PTD to generate sufficient
revenues to meet operation and maintenance costs, depreciation,
and debt service obligations, and to yield a rate of return of at
least 8% per annum on net revalued fixed assets in service.
In addition, the following are agreed conditions for the effectiveness of the
Credit:
(i)   meeting of all conditions for effectiveness of the ADB loan;
(ii)   establishment of the Project Management Office; and
(iii)   appointment of the remaining two key positions in PTD
(Telecommunications Controller and Telecommunications
Accountant).
16.      Benefits.  The proposed project would prevent a potentially major
network collapse and extend the existing network, both for domestic and
internatlonal traffic, to satisfy existing and future demand. The provision of
digital exchanges and microwave links lays the basis for an adequate national
network and further expansion of rural services. The benefits expected from the
project include increasing foreign exchange earnings, fostering the development
of tourism and developing a skilled staff able to manage the institution
effectively. Since a large portion of the proposed project involves the
rehabilitation of existing facilities, the environmental effects of the project
are negligible.
17.      Risks.  The major risk is the lack of experienced and qualified
management and staff in PTD, which could delay project implementation and
threaten the effective operation of the new equipment. This risk will be
contained by recruiting additional expatriate experts to help to constrLct,
operate and maintain project facilities, to train staff and to ensure the timely
completion of the project.
18.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit complies with
the Articles of Agreement or the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.

12.              e ArraW  eEnt.  Since telecommunications services are managed
by a Government department (i.e., PTD), the issue of an onlending rate for the
ADB loan #-id the proposed ;:DA credit does not arise at present. However, if
and when iTD becomes a corporate entity, which will be dependent on the
outcome of an organizational review of PTD by January 31, 1990, the Government
would then onlend to that entity all the funds allocated to the project (the
proceeds or unpaid balances of the IDA credit and ADB loan) at the rates and
conditior.s applicable to ADB's OCR loans.
13.      Project Imnlemantation.  PTD would be the project implementing
agency. Despite the lack of experienced and qualified local management and
staff in PTD, its performance has been satisfactory and broadly comparable to
that in neighboring Pacific countries. Before the ADB loan becomes eff'sctive,
a Project Management Office (PMO) would be established within PTD to supervise
the day-to-day implementation of the project. The PMO would be adequately
staffed and would be headed by the ADB-funded consultant, appointed as project
manager, who would be responsible for supervising the day-to-day
implementation and coordination of the project. To avoid project delays, the
Government has hired a consultant (financod under the ITU grant) to begin bid
preparation starting in June, 1989. Issuing of the tenders is planned for
September 1989; awarding of the contract is scheduled for January 1990.
14.      Dlamunxeme .  For contracts each costing less than US$20,000
equivalent, reimbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs). Documentation supporting t-s SOEs would be retained by
PTD in Apia and made available for review by ADB and IDA supervision missions.
Withdrawal applications would be reviewed by ADB under procedures specified in
a Letter of Credit Administration to be agreed between IDA and ADB, and
disbursement from the IDA credit would be made upon ADB's telex advice. The
project completion date is June 30, 1992, and the closing date is
December 31, 1992.
15.      Actions Agreed.   During negotiations with the ADB and IDA, the
following agreements have been reached:
(i) prior to January 1, 1990, the Government shall increase the
number of telecommunications technicians receiving advar.ced
training to a total of at least seven persons per year. In
addition, each supply contract for equipment to be procured under
the project shall include a training component, acceptable to ADB
and IDA;
(ii'   prior to January 31, 1990, the Government shall complete a
review of the organizational and institutional structure of PTD,
and develop policy statements and legislation and procedures for:
(a) the future institutional structure and organizational form of
PTD, (b) cost-based tariffs and adjustment methods, and (c) the
regulation of the telecommunications sector;
(iii)   the Government shall ensure that all lands or rights to land,
required for the project are made available to PTD prior to
July 1, 1990;
(iv)   by January 1, 1991, PTD shall introduce a commercially-based
accounting; system, acceptable to ADB and IDA;
(v) beginning January 1, 1991, PTD will prepare and submit to ADB and
IDA annual reports on achievement against agreed performance
indicators (as listed in the ADB Staff Appraisal Report
Appendix 6);
