Specifically, the project\n            will: (i) upgrade the telecommunications system between the\n            country's principal population and commercial centers;\n            (ii) improve the international gateway access through the\n            provision of 100 international lines; (iii) replace obsolete\n            equipment that is no longer practicable to maintain; (iv)\n            introduce modern and appropriate technology that is less\n            maintenance intensive than existing equipment; (v) provide\n            basic infrastructure for the subsequent development of rural\n            telecommunications; and (vi) provide sufficient capacity on\n            the national and international network to remove bottlenecks\n            and ensure that capacity is in place to handle forecasted\n            traffic growth."}, "docdt": "1989-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
