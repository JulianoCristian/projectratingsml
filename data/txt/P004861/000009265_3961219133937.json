The main objective of the project was to finance\n            priority investments to upgrade the telecommunications\n            networks, build a basis for its future expansion, and lay\n            the groundwork for the development of rural\n            telecommunications. The project would also assist the\n            Government by formulating and implementing modifications in\n            the institutional, policy and regulatory environment for\n            telecommunications; and strengthen PTD's project\n            implementation and operations and maintenance (O&M)\n            capacities by strengthening and training its human\n            resources. The Project met its main development objective to\n            upgrade and expand the country's telecommunications\n            network and to build a basis for future expansion, also\n            laying ground for the development of rural\n            telecommunications. Eventually, this objective was met\n            beyond original targets, together with the\n            rehabilitation/replacement and upgrading of installations\n            destroyed or damaged by two cyclones during the project\n            period. These actions could be combined through adequate\n            adjustments to the on-going actions and works under the\n            project, also benefitting from the cooperation between the\n            main cofinancing agencies and the beneficiary, and from the\n            arrangements for project implementation. By ceding project\n            administration to the ADB, the main cofinancier under the\n            project, IDA intended to obtain some operational\n            simplification and resource savings, and also prevent\n            duplication of activities in the implementation of a\n            relatively small project for utilities type infrastructure,\n            in a very distant location."}, "docdt": "1996-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
