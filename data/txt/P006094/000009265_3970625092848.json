This\n            project will:  (a) improve the reliability of BEB's\n            distribution system, reduce power losses and provide fuel\n            savings; and (b) permit BEB to meet the growth in\n            electricity demand over the medium term. It would, in\n            addition, (c) strengthen BEB's organization and\n            management; (d) improve BEB's finances; and (e) assist\n            in planning BEB's long-term investment needs."}, "docdt": "1986-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
