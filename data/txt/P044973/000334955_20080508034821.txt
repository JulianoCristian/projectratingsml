 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This project performance audit report (PPAR) covers the Southern Provinces Rural
Electrification Project (SPRE, Credit 30470-LA for US$34.7 million), which was
approved in March 1998 and closed in June 2004.

The PPAR was prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG, formerly OED),
based upon the Implementation Completion Report (ICR), project documents, and
interviews with government officials, civil society and private sector representatives and
staff of the Bank and other agencies. Fieldwork was undertaken in March 2007, which
benefited from the support of Ms. Mingngakham Pangnasak and Mr. Morten Larsen of
the World Bank office in Vientianne in arranging the mission. Mr. Anousak Phongsavath
and Mr Oudom Kasisingdeth arranged fieldwork for the mission, and accompanied it to
the field. The mission is grateful to others who spared their time to share their views, and
for the cooperation of the Government of Lao PDR in undertaking this study.

This project was selected for review as an input to the IEG study The Welfare Impact of
Rural Electrification: A Reassessment of the Costs and Benefit, delivered in June 2007.
Baseline data were made available to IEG which allowed a more in depth analysis of
impact issues than is usually the case in a PPAR.

Following standard IEG procedures, the draft of this PPAR was sent to the borrower for
comments before finalization, but none were received.

Summary

The Southern Provinces Rural Electrification Project (SPRE), approved in 1998, followed
on from earlier Bank projects providing electricity to rural areas of Lao PDR through the
electricity utility, Electricité du Laos (EdL). There was also an off-grid component,
implemented by the Department of Electricity (DOE). In summary, the project exceeded
its physical goals for both the grid and off-grid components, but both suffered from
institutional shortcomings.

SPRE had two objectives: (i) expand rural electricity service in seven central and
southern provinces of Lao PDR, where economically justified, through grid extension
and off-grid electrification; and (ii) strengthen EdL's capacity to plan and implement
electrification investments and to operate on a commercial basis.

After a slow start, the project exceeded its physical goals, connecting 721 villages
compared to the target of 520. Cost savings allowed for additional civil works, including
a third sub-station. However, system losses remained high (at around 21% in 2004 versus
a target of 16%), being highest in project provinces. The off-grid component provided
electricity to 6,097 homes compared to the target of 4,600.

Performance of the grid extension component was overshadowed by continuing financial
difficulties for EdL, stemming from both tariffs below cost recovery levels and arrears
mainly from public agencies. By the end of the project in 2004, the performance of most
financial indicators was below expectations. However, subsequent implementation of the
financial recovery plan is moving EdL toward a financially sustainable situation.

The off-grid component suffered from technical problems, so that many households are
receiving less than one hour a day of electricity rather than the 3-4 hours they would get
were the system working satisfactorily. These technical problems are a manifestation of
an underlying structural problem in the program incentives, which are oriented toward
planning and installation of connections to new villages, with maintenance being
financially unrewarding. However, a private company is providing solar home systems to
many communities despite a much lower level of subsidies than those available through
the Bank project, so there are also issues of technical capacity and delineating roles
between subsidized and unsubsidized services.

SPRE was highly relevant: government has set a target of 90 percent electrification by
2020, and rural electrification is part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. The
project achieved its first objective of supplying energy services, but not the second of
strengthening EdL. Efficiency is measured by the ERR, which was 13 percent (lower
than the 61 percent in the ICR given technical errors in the latter's calculation). The
overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory, because of EdL's unsatisfactory
financial performance for most of the project's duration and the technical problems
discussed above. Bank performance was satisfactory, and that of the borrower
moderately satisfactory (again reflecting EdL's poor financial performance). The risk to
development outcome is modest since measures implemented toward the end of, and

                                               x


subsequent to, project completion have addressed the financial sustainability issue, and
technical issues are being addressed under the follow-on Rural Electrification Project.

The lessons learned from the review are:

  · Consumers are willing to pay tariffs at cost recovery levels. The willingness to
     pay analysis shows that consumers are willing to pay for electricity at levels
     exceeding supply costs. Lao PDR has been able to implement sizeable tariff
     increases in a short space of time with no adverse social impact or notable demand
     reductions (indeed it can be argued that any reduction in usage by already
     connected customers would help extend supply to new locations).

  · But poorer households remain unconnected. Even after the grid has been in a
     village for more than 10 years, some 20 percent of households remain unconnected.
     Smart (i.e. efficiently targeted) connection subsidies for late connectors would help
     achieve government's 90 percent coverage target.

  · Explicit attention needs to be paid to technical efficiency. Technical problems of
     system losses and outages reduce financial performance and undermine project
     benefits. Explicit components are needed to tackle such issues.

  · Off-grid components promote social equity in electrification coverage... but
     are not necessarily the most cost effective strategy. The off-grid component has
     helped reach remote communities which would not otherwise have got electricity
     for a decade or more. However, the rate of return to these investments is lower than
     that to grid extension, or of subsidizing connections for late connectors, and it is not
     proven that the beneficiaries from off-grid programs are poorer than those
     benefiting from grid extension.

  · In countries where the private sector is relatively undeveloped, substantial
     support may be required to provide off-grid services in poor areas. At the
     same time subsidies should not crowd out purely commercial actors. A sensible
     balance would direct project supported companies to the more remote areas unlikely
     to be attractive to purely commercial firms, but a subsidy scheme needs to ensure
     that such activities are sufficiently attractive.

1.      Introduction

1.1       Electricity in Lao PDR is largely generated by hydropower, with a limited use of
diesel. Off-grid schemes are being developed in less accessible areas. The first grid system
was developed around the Nam Ngum dam, completed in 1971 with assistance from a group
of eight donors, including the World Bank. A large part of the electricity generated by Nam
Ngum was exported to Thailand. Exports to Thailand continue to account for a large, though
falling, share of the electricity generated, and have been supplemented by exports to
Vietnam. However, the country's grid has developed in a fragmented manner, with four
principal grids in different parts of the country (Northern Grid, Central Grids I and II and
Southern Grid). Since the grid is not national, regional consumption needs are also met by
imports from Thailand, making Lao PDR both an exporter and importer of electricity.

1.2       The Government of Lao PDR (GoL) places high priority on rural electrification,
with the goal of electrifying 90 percent of the country's households by 2020 (of which 75
percent will be on grid) as well as increasing hydropower exports to neighboring countries.
Interim targets are for 70 percent coverage by 2010 and 80 percent by 2015. Growth in
coverage since the nineties has been high, averaging over 10 percent a year which is more
than sufficient to meet these targets (Figure 1), and several new dams are under construction
to increase power generation. Off-grid connections are needed if electricity is to be available
in less accessible communities, including those in mountainous regions and on river islands.

1.3        The Government's              Figure 1 National electrification rate
strategy of electrification, adopted
in 1998, gave priority to                                           50

electrification, (ii) complete commercialization of EdL, and (iii) develop a financing strategy
for domestic and export power developments.

1.4         Rural electrification falls under the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM, formerly
the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts, MIH), with generation by Electricité du Laos (EdL)
and services provided by provincial electric power authorities. In the latter half of the
nineties steps were taken to commercialize of EdL as part of Government's strategy to
commercialize the energy sector. Along with a reorganization of the utility into profit
centers, EdL entered into a performance contract with the Government, laying out
performance targets and committing GoL to take steps toward improving EdL's financial
viability, including through an increase in tariffs for domestic power consumption. The utility
nevertheless continues to depend on export revenue, which has historically been used to
cross-subsidize domestic residential consumption. As an earlier IEG assessment pointed out,
this represents an extremely regressive use of natural resource rents since it is the better off
who benefit most from electricity subsidies.1 The domestic tariff structure also cross-
subsidized residential consumption from revenue from commercial users. EdL has a sizeable
debt from the substantial investments of recent years, the burden of which became severe
following the large devaluation of the domestic currency in the aftermath of the East Asian
crisis in 1997. Successive Bank projects have sought to restore EdL to a sounder financial
footing through higher tariffs.

The role of the World Bank and other donors

1.5          The Bank has been involved in the country's electrification from the outset,
contributing toward the construction of hydropower facilities, and now includes rural
electrification in the Country Assistance Strategy. Over the last 20 years Bank support has
focused on the central and southern provinces, first through the Southern Provinces
Electrification Project (SPE), then the Provincial Grid Integration Project (PGI)--which had
a substantial rural electrification component --and the Southern Provinces Rural
Electrification Project (SPRE); see Table 1. The latter project is being followed up by the
Rural Electrification Project (REP I, but called SPRE II during preparation). This new project
will support off-grid services throughout the country, though investments in on-grid services
will continue to be confined to the seven southern provinces. Despite the introduction of off-
grid components, on-grid has taken the bulk of the finances (Table 2).

building objective, failing to improve the poor financial position of EdL.3 The report argued
that these problems were evident at the time of project preparation and actions to address
them should have been included in the conditions for effectiveness, noting also that the same
argument applied with even greater force to SPRE.

1.7        The other main donor supporting the sector in recent years has been the Asian
Development Bank, which has supported projects in the Northern Provinces and Vientiane
Plain. In addition, UNDP supported the Vientiane Plain Rural Electrification Projects I and II
while NORAD co-financed ADB's project for Vientiane Plain and Northern Provinces.
Export credits from India and China are of growing importance, and both countries have
projects in the southern provinces.


2.       Project preparation, design, implementation and
         outcomes

Preparation

2.1        The Southern Provinces Electrification and Provincial Grid Integration projects
established the basic infrastructure for rural electrification in the central and southern
provinces, drawing largely on domestically generated energy. In principle, the Southern
Provinces Rural Electrification Project (SPRE) was a straightforward extension of these
previous projects, requiring a relatively small amount of high-tech investment: two new
substations and less than 60 km of high voltage sub-transmission lines were included in the
design. The bulk of the project cost was taken up by distribution extension (poles and lines)
reliant upon the existing transmission infrastructure. Technical assistance was provided by
the Swedish utility, SwedPower, which designed the proposed investments in line with
agreed least-cost principles. However, preparation was delayed. Appraisal was originally
planned for December 1996, but eventually took place in December 1997. The project was
submitted for Board approval in March 1998 and became effective in August of that year.




2. Since 1993 the Bank has, in accordance with the new energy strategy, promoted increased private sector
participation in electricity generation and distribution, which in most countries has been focused on generation.
Privatization is not a political option in Lao PDR at present, so the Bank has pursued commercialization.

2.2        Three factors explain the delay. The first was the resettlement policy. The Bank
argued that there was little capacity and understanding of this issue on the government side,
and the consultants involved in project design were not convinced of the need to address
resettlement. At an internal Bank review meeting, it was decided that the issue should not be
pressed, in order to retain government support for the project. But the correspondence trail
after that meeting shows that resettlement was later put back on the agenda. A mission was
fielded in September 1996 with the result that a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was in
place by the time of project appraisal. However, problems relating to this issue resurfaced
during implementation.

2.3        The project was also delayed by two related factors--the commercial status and
financial performance of EdL. The Bank wanted a Performance Contract between the
government and EdL setting out their respective responsibilities and giving the utility more
independence. This contract, prepared with Bank assistance, was signed in January 1998.
EdL's domestic supply operated at a substantial loss, with the utility having increasing
problems servicing its debt. The performance contract agreed on a schedule of tariff increases
to address these issues. There was also an average tariff increase of 63 percent in October
1997.

2.4        The original project design was built around grid extension. But government's
electrification targets could not be met by grid extension alone. Therefore, at appraisal, an
off-grid component was added to the project, to be operated on a commercial basis by EdL.

Objectives and components

2.5        As stated in the Project Appraisal Document (p.2), SPRE had two objectives:

        (i)      Expand rural electricity service in 7 central and southern provinces of Lao
                 PDR, where economically justified, through grid extension and off-grid
                 electrification; and

        (ii)     Strengthen EdL's capacity to plan and implement electrification investments
                 and to operate on a commercial basis.

2.6        The project had three components: (i) grid extension; (ii) off-grid electrification;
and (iii) institution building.

2.7        Grid extension: The Distribution Extension component was to increase electricity
service in seven southern Lao provinces: Bolikhamsai, Khammouane, Savannakhet,
Saravane, Champassak, Attopeu, and Sekong. It was planned to finance the construction of
about 52 km of high-voltage (115 kV) subtransmission lines, 2x20 MVA of 115/22 kV of
transformer capacity, 1200 km of medium-voltage (22 kV) lines, 900 km of low-voltage (380
kV) lines, 34 MVA of 220/380 kV distribution transformers, and 50,000 consumer meters.
The project would also pilot the use of low-cost single wire earth return (SWER) systems in
rural areas.

2.8       Off-grid electrification: The Off-Grid component was to test methods of providing
electricity service in approximately 46 rural communities which will not receive grid access
for at least 10 years. The pilot was to: (i) establish local institutional, financial, and technical
capacity for sustainable implementation of rural diesel and renewable energy systems; (ii)
implement small diesel, micro-hydro, photovoltaic systems (and others according to demand
from operators); and (iii) identify and develop the objectives, institutional arrangements, and
scope for a national off-grid rural electrification program. The aim was to make off-grid
project development more sustainable by: (i) maximizing the involvement of the private
sector and beneficiaries; (ii) operating the off-grid systems on a cost-recovery basis; (iii)
defining and strengthening appropriate institutional and financial mechanisms; and (iv)
developing designs to minimize costs.

2.9       Institutional Development: This component was intended to finance technical
assistance and equipment for project management, commercialization and sector regulation
and development. Project management assistance was to be provided to EdL, including (i)
engineering consultants to provide hands-on assistance and training in project management,
procurement, construction supervision, and monitoring; and (ii) equipment including vehicles
for supervision and maintenance, computers and other office equipment. Financial
management and commercialization support would be provided to EdL to finance the
services of (i) the Resident Financial Management Advisor; (ii) the procurement and
installation of billing and collections system; and (iii) short-term expert advice to EdL's General
Manager as determined during the course of the project. This was expected to include advice
with regard to corporate planning, budgeting, and training. Technical assistance was also to
be provided to MIH and EdL to assist in regulatory and technical matters, including the
formulation of a strategy for the power sector that would support implementation of the
Electricity Law and the preparation of a sector development action plan and a hydropower
development strategy.

Overview of implementation

2.10      Implementation lagged in the first two years, with only 36 percent of the expected
amount disbursed by the second
year of the project (Figure 2). There        Figure 2 SPRE disbursement profile

were initially delays in preparing                         40

Proposals made by the government in March 2000 were considered insufficient to remove
the need for suspension. That month a supervision mission proposed a financial restructuring
plan for EdL, threatening suspension unless there were signs of progress by June 2000. In
April, the government wrote assuring the Bank that measures would indeed be taken to
redress the situation. Its proposed plan of action included formation of a Tariff Review
Committee (rather than specific proposals on tariffs). This was accepted by the Bank in
October. But by mid-2001 the Bank was expressing concern that implementation of the plan
had stalled. A program of tariff increases was finally introduced from May 2002 (see
paragraph 2.15 below).

2.11       These problems did not hinder progress with grid extension, although there were
initial procurement delays, and heavy rains slowed progress with the works. Eventually,
more villages than planned were connected to the grid--721, compared to the appraisal
estimate of 520, with 51,805 household connections against the planned 50,000 (Table 3).
Cost savings on the planned activities allowed additional works to be undertaken.
Specifically, US$3.9 million was spent on (i) upgrading of the 115/22 kV Paksan substation
with 2x16 MVA transformers; and (ii) constructing a new 115/22 kV outdoor substation at
Thakhek with 2x30 MVA transformers and the erection of a 3 km double circuit steel lattice
115 kV transmission line. The success of these activities demonstrates both the existing
capacity of EdL in implementing grid extension, and the supportive role played by the
institutional development activities to support these investments.

2.12         The off-grid component also got off to a slow start. The hope that the pilot program
would be commercially viable proved over-optimistic, imposing an additional financial
burden on EdL, the implementing agency. Hence the credit agreement was amended,
allowing the Department of Energy to take responsibility for this component. As with grid
extension, physical targets were exceeded, with 6,097 households receiving off-grid power
compared to the appraisal target of 4,600. However, there have been problems with the
maintenance of these systems (see paragraph 2.24 below).

2.13       In short, during project implementation, quantitative targets were amply exceeded,
but there were institutional problems with both on and off-grid programs. For the on-grid
program, the central concern was the performance of EdL--its weak financial position and
its failure to cope with system losses and outages. The off-grid program failed to ensure
adequate maintenance, reflecting flaws in the incentive structure built into program design.

Financial performance of EdL

2.14       EdL became an autonomous agency in 1997, charged with operating on a more
commercial basis. But a review of financial performance two years later found it to be
unsatisfactory. Although operating profits seemed to be satisfactory, the return on capital was
low (and overstated, since fixed assets had not been re-valued). Also, residential consumers
were heavily cross-subsidized by exports. Growing domestic demand reduced exports, these
falling from over 80 percent of generated power in the early 1980s to less than 60 percent by
the late 1990s (Figure 3). In addition, EdL was unable to finance the investment program
required for continued service expansion, reducing its ability to service current and future
loans. Finally, there were serious payment arrears, notably from government agencies (but
also irrigation users). These problems were exacerbated by the devaluation of the kip, since
most materials were imported and the loans were denominated in foreign currency.

2.15      With the assistance of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, the
government took steps to strengthen EdL's performance. The financial restructuring plan of
2001 partially converted government debt into equity, and retroactively adjusted the terms of
other loans. It was also agreed that, from January 2002 onwards, tariffs should be increased
by 2 percent per month for a period of 36 months. During 2002, tariffs regained their pre-
crisis dollar value (Figure 4). However, the government suspended the tariff increases in
2004, pending the results of a tariff review study.4 It then rejected the recommendations of
the study so further work was done to amend the study's conclusions. The government was
then invited to choose one of        Figure 3 Share of exports in generation

2.16                                         Under the financial plans for EdL, it was also agreed that existing arrears would be
offset against taxes. However, new arrears continue to accrue which are not covered by the
agreement, though three measures are in place to limit such arrears (earmarked budget
allocation for bill payment, an energy audit of government customers and an agreement that
government customers can be disconnected for non-payment). Continuing measures are
being taken to address this situation, but it is recognized that it may take some years for it to
be fully resolved.

2.17        Although measures are now in place to strengthen EdL's finances, progress during
SPRE was only moderately satisfactory, with all but one of the performance targets being
missed at the end of the project (Table 4). Only the target for the self-financing ratio was
met. However, it is not clear that this is a good measure of financial performance for a utility
undertaking substantial system expansion which is mostly financed by foreign loans and
grants. Such aid-financed expansion will drive down the self-financing ratio, but this does
not necessarily reflect weak underlying performance (the verdict on which will hinge on
whether the user charges for the new capacity are sufficient to cover O&M and debt
servicing).

Technical performance of the grid: system losses and outages

2.18        In 1996 system losses were very high: the cost of delivery was 30 percent higher
than the cost of generation. At appraisal a target was set to reduce system losses to 20 percent
by 2000, and the Performance Contract stated that they should be reduced to 16 percent by
2004. But losses remained close to 21 percent in 2004, though they had been lower in earlier
years. EdL's Annual Report for 2005 states that, "system loss is high and on the rise" (p.23).
The problem is worse in SPRE provinces, where system losses averaged 20.2 percent in 2004
and 20.6 percent in 2005, compared to 15.6 percent and 12.5 percent respectively for non-
project provinces (ibid.). Continued high losses will further weaken EdL's financial position.

2.19        Both EdL engineers and Bank staff agree that system losses would almost
inevitably have remained high under SPRE since it largely extended distribution systems on
the basis of existing infrastructure. This results in long distribution networks using medium
and low voltage lines--the source of the system losses. These engineers agree that as the

lines confirm that cuts peak during the rainy season. IEG's impression is that the problem is

not being seriously addressed by EdL--or by the Bank. For example, there is no performance
indicator on outages.



Off-grid component

2.21      A World Bank (ESMAP) study on the appropriate institutional arrangement for the
delivery of off-grid services was conducted under the auspices of SPRE.5 This study
proposed that private sector operators be brought in at the provincial level, to be trained and
supplied by EdL. However, the proposal was never implemented and, ultimately,
responsibility shifted to the Department of Energy (Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts),
with the Bank and GoL agreeing that EdL had no expertise on private sector promotion and
could ill afford the financial burden associated with this component. Meanwhile, JICA had
helped finance a pilot off-grid project in Vientiane Province, implemented by DOE; but it
was unwilling to fund scaling up. It was this pilot which served as the basis for the SPRE-
financed off-grid component (employing some of the same staff), although the model bears
strong similarities to the ESMAP proposal.

2.22      The program was run by the Off-Grid Promotion Support Office (OGS) in DOE. In
each province a private company was to be appointed as the Provincial Energy Services
Company (PESCO). In consultation with DOE, EdL and the provincial authority, the PESCO
identified those villages which would not be linked to the grid for at least ten years (this
threshold is sometimes reduced to five years). From this list, the PESCO selects villages for
the planning exercise: an assessment of ability to pay based on an inventory of land,
livestock, and other assets drawn up in consultation with the village head. If the PESCO
decides to proceed, a village meeting is held at which a Village Electricity Manager (VEM)
is appointed, who is responsible for day-to-day maintenance and collecting the monthly
payment. This payment is divided up between the Village Fund (10 percent), VEM, (20
percent) and PESCO (20 percent), with the remaining one-half channelled to the reflow
account of OGS to maintain materials supply. For the village to be eligible for the program at
least 80 percent of households must sign up at the planning stage.

2.23      The options are for diesel powered small generator, pico-hydro, or solar home
systems (SHS). Wind power is considered not economically viable in Lao PDR and biomass
systems are currently under development. To date, all villages have opted for SHS, except
one which chose a pico-hydro system. The household can choose different panel sizes and
pay an installation fee (the lowest being US$16) and then monthly payments under hire
purchase arrangement over five or ten years. The cheapest panel costs Kip 10,000 (US$1) a
month for ten years (Table 5). The solar power is routed through a controller to a car battery
for recharging, which can then power light bulbs, radio, and TV for up to 4 hours per day.

2.24       Over 6,000 households were connected to off-grid supply under SPRE, exceeding
the appraisal target by one-third. However a survey undertaken in Vientiane Province in 2006
revealed a number of operational problems, with over 80 percent of SHSs not working
properly or at a low level of service.6 Most controllers were no longer working: 40 percent
were absent, and most of the others had been bypassed so the panel was connected directly to
the battery. The resultant power fluctuations shorten battery life (which was anyway only 2-3
years), as does excess use by connecting too many lights or appliances. As a result nearly all
batteries were past their useful life, with over half the batteries being more than four years
old. Most households have not replaced these batteries (which cost US$20-50), but continue
to charge the battery getting just 30 minutes to one hour of electricity each day.
Consequently, project benefits are much lower than expected.

2.25       These problems are partly technical and partly incentive-based. There is
disagreement about the technical flaws. The rival private scheme (Sunlabob; see next
paragraph) uses five-year solar batteries, arguing that these are superior. OGS (now called
the Village Off-grid Promotion Scheme, VOPS) program managers argue the greater cost of
these batteries is not warranted. The second technical issue is the quality of training and
capacity of the field staff recruited under the project (the PESCO and VEM). Sunlabob
provides its engineers a higher level of training. But it is the incentive structure which puts
the greatest constraint on maintenance. Payments to the provincial company, the PESCO, are

geared toward planning and installation: the PESCO receives US$2 for each household
which signs up and US$1 for installation. By contrast, the cost involved in collecting the
monthly fee means that the PESCO barely breaks even (source: IED). Overall, being a
PESCO (or a VEM) appears not to be that financially attractive. One PESCO withdrew and
VOPS is having trouble recruiting in new provinces, though three new PESCOs were
eventually established under REP in early 2007.

2.26     A further issue is the channel through which the service is delivered. Although the
PESCO is a private company, the scheme is subsidized by Bank resources. But at the same
time there is a private company that delivers SHS which has won several international
awards, including one from the Bank's Development Marketplace. There is clearly not a
level playing field. Sunlabob has received assistance (e.g. GTZ financed its initial training)
but not on the scale of the subsidies to OGS/VOPS. In addition, Sunlabob has to pay other
duty and taxes from which the government program is exempt. As a result the minimum
monthly payment for a Sunlabob system is Kip 35,000, compared to Kip 10,000 for
OGS/VOPS. It is telling that no Sunlabob trained engineers have applied to become
PESCOs, suggesting that there is not money in it.

2.27     Is it appropriate for the Bank to subsidize a government program in direct
competition with a private company? This is a question which need be confronted even if it is
recognized that government's electrification targets are very unlikely to be met by relying on
the private sector alone. The response under the Bank's follow-on Rural Electrification
Project has been to make VOPS more commercially viable. To begin with, management of
the scheme was contracted out. Although DOE retains oversight, a French company, IED, is
responsible for implementation, allowing a greater degree of flexibility. IED has been
discussing with the ministry the possibility of raising tariffs closer to commercial rates.
While ensuring that operations are sufficiently financially attractive for the VEM and
PESCO, steps have been taken to encourage VOPS to focus its activities on the less
accessible and poorer regions that are less likely to attract commercial suppliers ­ hence
leaving a market space for Sunlabob rather than acting in direct competition. This approach
supports the government's goal of a 90 percent electrification rate by 2020.

Resettlement, environmental and social issues

2.28     SPRE did not require large-scale land acquisition or resettlement; there were only
three substations constructed, all on land already owned by the government. A small length
of high-voltage transmission line was built. These are meant to have a 30-metre channel
cleared on either side of them, requiring land acquisition, some forest clearance, and a very
small number of homes to be resettled. Distribution lines, which nearly all follow the line of
the road in order to keep down installation costs, have a very small "footprint." However,
government is meant to provide compensation per square meter of land used where
appropriate.

2.29       The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), prepared by the government before
appraisal, was approved by the Bank. Some problems arose during implementation--there
are differences of opinion about their nature and extent. The Bank's Implementation
Completion Report, in line with supervision reports, states that some provincial authorities
were unwilling to reimburse owners for land acquired for public works, as this was not
normal practice. Where there was reimbursement it was not at the agreed rates. The report
also notes that some provincial authorities were unaware of the RAP. On the other hand, EdL
states that the disagreement arose over scrub land. They agree that the Plan allows for
compensation but argue that it was not appropriate to compensate households for land in
which the household had not invested. Following the visit of a resettlement specialist (and a
revision of the Plan) a compromise was reached. Compensation was paid for scrub land, but
the money went to the village fund rather than to the household. The independent evaluation
report of the resettlement component,
commissioned by EdL, takes a middle          Box 2 Voluntary resettlement in response to
line. It notes that EdL and the              electrification: Don Khor village, Champasak

it did acquire the necessary expertise       Source: IEG field visit
in resettlement planning.

2.30       For the reasons outlined in paragraph 2.28, the environmental impact of the project
was slight, though not nil. The category B rating was therefore appropriate. The procedure is
that once trees are identified for clearance, EdL notifies the Forestry Department which then
sells the concession to a commercial company. According to the Forestry Law an equivalent
area should be replanted elsewhere, but this does not appear to be monitored or enforced
(although there are other schemes to encourage investment in tropical hardwoods, notably
teak).

2.31       A final issue was the failure to enforce the safeguard for indigenous people. Many
of those living in project areas are from minority ethnic groups. The Bank's Operational
Directive (OD 4.20, now replaced by OP 4.10) required that an Ethnic People's Development
Plan (EPDP) be prepared. No such plan was prepared, the appraisal report making no
mention of the ethnic composition of the population in the project area. An EPDP has been
prepared for the follow-on project, REP I, and this sets out a consultation process, in order to
ensure that ethnic identity is respected.

2.32      The benefits from rural electrification are not to be denied, and are documented
later in this report. However there is one issue not referred to in Bank discussions, which is
that of involuntary resettlement. The government's position on resettlement admits of
various interpretations. Government has in the past attempted involuntary resettlement,
especially of people in remote areas. It is currently promoting a policy of "village clusters" to

                                               14


facilitate service delivery. Clustering might entail some measurement of resettlement,
potentially violating the terms of the new resettlement policy worked out with external
agencies which does not permit involuntary resettlement. In some respects, government is
complying. Communities on the far side of the new Theun 2 dam were encouraged by the
government to resettle. But when they refused to do so the government agreed to provide
them with off-grid electrification. It remains to be seen whether the resettlement policy will
be honored in the long term. Rural electrification may still potentially provide a platform for
involuntary resettlement. But at present rather the contrary is the case, with households
voluntarily moving in order to be closer to the grid (Box 2).

Monitoring and evaluation

2.33      Project monitoring was oriented toward EdL performance, in particular monitoring
of compliance with the performance contract. Information was also collected on the overall
outputs from the project (connections). This report has already made some suggestions on the
indicators used: specifically that system loss data should also be collected specifically for the
project provinces; that outages should be included as a performance indicator; and that the
self-financing ratio is not necessarily an appropriate measure of financial performance at
times of aid-financed expansion. Overall, the monitoring system was satisfactorily
incorporated into EdL's operations, was well focused and served the project well.

2.34      At appraisal there were no plans for a comprehensive evaluation; no survey was
undertaken. There had been a baseline survey under the earlier Southern Provinces
Electrification Project and government had felt that the benefits were so self-evident that
there was no need for an end-line survey in that case. However a baseline survey was
undertaken for REP I in 2004. EdL commissioned an evaluation of the RAP (see paragraph
2.29).

2.35      Monitoring and evaluation of the off-grid component was weak, so that the extent
of technical problems was not appreciated until the survey carried out by IED in 2006
(paragraph 2.24). A systematic monitoring system has been introduced under VOPS.

3.      Impact of rural electrification and economic analysis

3.1       The economic analysis in this PPAR is based on data collected in the project areas
in 2004 as the baseline for the follow on project, REP. This analysis underpins the ERR
analysis, which addresses the efficiency question. But the data also shed light on patterns of
electricity coverage and usage.

Coverage and distribution of rural electrification in the Southern
Provinces

3.2       The background documents for the baseline survey present data on the number of
electrified households (Table 6). The first four columns show data for villages electrified by
the three World Bank projects (though only the earlier years of SPRE) and other projects.
The electrification rate is 31 percent in the seven provinces as a whole and 41 percent in

                                                                                                                 15


project areas (i.e. including those not yet reached under SPRE and REP 1). These figures rise
to 43 percent and 69 percent respectively once the additional households electrified under
SPRE by project close are included in the total. At the time of the survey, Bank-supported
projects accounted for 60 percent of the electrification in rural areas of the seven provinces,
rising to 69 percent including the additional households electrified under SPRE.

3.3                                Just over three-quarters (77 percent) of households in electrified villages are
electrified, with this rate being lowest in most recently connected communities (Figure 4).
For most communities which were connected more than three years ago, 80 to 85 percent of
households have a grid connection. Connection rates are, as expected, lower for poor
households: 65 percent of poor households in electrified villages are connected to the grid.
This bias in connections is shown in Figure 5, which shows the Lorenz curve for grid
connections and electricity consumption. The bottom 40 percent of the population (ranked by
a wealth index, see Annex B) have just one quarter of the grid connections and account for
just 15 percent of consumption of electricity supplied by the grid.

3.4                                However, the gap in the electrification rate between the poor and non-poor has
closed over time. In the early nineties the electrification rate for the poor was only one-third

                                                                                           16


of that for the population as a whole, but then grew rapidly from 1996 to reach 80 percent by
2004 (see figure 6). This increase came about as electrification reached poorer villages, as
shown by the poverty rate in communities by year of grid connection.

3.5                            These results raise a question about which communities are connected. The Bank
projects have begun from the main population centers, which are to the west of the country
along the Mekong River, and then spread out from there, following the road in the interest of
least cost. Regression analysis of the survey data confirms that villages nearer to roads and
the provincial headquarters are more likely to be connected (see Annex B). More remote
villages ­ those in mountainous areas or on river islands (see Box 2 above) ­ are less likely to
be connected.

3.6                            Thus far, EdL has been increasing coverage by extensive growth (that is extending
the grid to more communities) rather than intensive growth (that is expanding coverage to
households in already connected communities). As shown in Figure 4, even in communities
connected 10-15 years ago, there remain around one-fifth of households which are not
connected. These are poorer households who cannot afford the connection fee of around
US$100 (Kip 1 million). This pattern was evident under SPRE, when there was a substantial
increase in the number of connected communities ­ 721 versus 520 planned at appraisal, a 39
percent increase, but a much smaller increase of less than 4 percent in the number of
connected households (from 50,000 to 51,805). Analysis of the survey data shows that the
vast majority of houses that will connect do so in the first year, with most of the remainder
doing so in the following two years (Figure 8). Reaching the poorer households, who can be
designated as "late connectors" will require some subsidy if government's target of 90
percent coverage is to be met.7 Finding a way of doing this would be consistent with the
Bank's energy strategy in which the first of four pillars is directly benefiting the poor.

the market. The market for electricity is readily segmented, since most households take the connection

Uses of electricity

3.7                           Lighting is the most common use for electricity: all electrified households get their
light from this source. However, the majority of electrified households also have appliances
that are less common in non-electrified households, notably TVs and fans, both of which are
owned by over 70 percent of electrified households. Grid households watch 2.5 hours of TV
a day on average, compared to less than 15 minutes for non-grid households. A significant
minority of electrified households (27 percent) have rice cookers. But in general electrified
households still use fuelwood for cooking purposes, though on average electrified household
use less than do non-electrified ones.

3.8                           There is less evidence of the use of electricity for productive purposes and it is not
clear how many new enterprises have been created as a result of electrification. Less than 10
households covered by the REP baseline survey have separate workshops using electricity,
and there is no evidence that these were set up as a result of electrification. There is one type
of electricity-related enterprise that can be identified: the community at "the end of the line"
operates battery charging centers



immediately and are unlikely to wait. The connection subsidy could thus become available three years after the
grid first reaches the community. Such a connection subsidy would qualify as a "smart subsidy" in recent
terminology.

3.9       for areas not yet connected, though this business shifts once grid extension takes
place.


4.       Rate of return analysis

The financial rate of return (FIRR)

4.1       The financial rate of return is relatively straightforward. On the benefit side are the
revenues earned from new electricity sales. On the cost side are the investment costs to create
the new capacity and the O&M expenses for that capacity. Given the assumptions stated in
the ICR, a financial rate of return of 6.5 percent is obtained (Annex C). This is the real return,
so it is more than sufficient to service the credit, which government on-lends to EdL at 7
percent (a real interest rate of zero at the current inflation rate). Since the tariff increases are
index linked, this return should be protected --unless average real tariffs are allowed to fall
below cost recovery at some point in the future. In addition, there is no explicit treatment of
system losses in the analysis. It should be assumed that the data build in the existing level of
losses, at 20 percent in 2004. Achieving a reduction in these losses to 12 percent (a 3 percent
reduction in system losses a year) will increase the financial rate of return to 7.0 percent. The
financial rate of return to off-grid investments is 15.9 percent (ICR calculation), reflecting
the fact that this is a subsidized program.

The economic rate of return

4.2       The ICR estimates the rate of return to the grid extension component to be 60.5
percent, compared to the appraisal estimate of 22.8 percent. This higher rate of return is
attributed to a higher willingness to pay (WTP) than anticipated at appraisal. The WTP
estimate is based on the survey data from 2004. These data were also used as the appraisal
estimate for REP; the appraisal report presents the calculations in more detail. The latter
analysis estimates that the WTP for grid connection for lighting alone is US$72 per month
per household (equal to US$866 per year although the SPRE ICR takes a lower figure of
US$584). This is a remarkably high figure, rather in excess of the total income of many
households in the area, though it is commonly recognized that households are generally
willing and able to devote up to 10 percent of their income to energy needs. The high
estimate comes from an error in the calculation of the WTP.

4.3        The most common means of calculating WTP is to obtain two data points on the
demand curve: the price and quantity of consumption with electricity and with the main fuel
source (usually kerosene) of non-electrified households. The demand curve is interpolated
between these two points, preferably by assuming a constant elasticity of demand, so that the
area under the demand curve can be calculated as the willingness to pay. The Lao survey
allowed observation of four, rather than two, data points, corresponding to those using
candles and lamps, those using car batteries, those using a mixture of these sources, and those
with access to electricity. As shown in Figure 9, joining these four points gives a reasonably
shaped demand curve.

4.5       The revised estimate can be checked for plausibility in a number of ways.
Compared to the ICR figure of US$585, the PPAR figure is well less than 10 percent of
household income rather than nearly all of it. As the ICR itself says a number of times, many
households can only afford to pay US$1-2 a month, though the survey shows that on average
unelectrified households pay US$3, and IEG calculation suggest that they would be willing
to pay US$5.60, which is higher but plausibly so. Other sources of data can help triangulate
IEG's WTP estimate. First the 2004 survey data used to estimate WTP in the ICR also
contained two direct questions on WTP. The first of these was whether or not the household
would be willing to pay for electrification if the cost were 1,000,000 kip (approximately

                                                      20


US$100),8 to which the majority of households (57 percent) replied in the negative. A second
question asked those not willing to pay 1,000,000 kip how much they would pay, to which
the median answer was 500,000 (US$50). A second source of information comes from the
break during project, during which supplies of project-supplied light bulbs ran out. Anecdotal
evidence is that many households chose not to replace the bulbs through commercial
purchases (costing around US$7, compared to the project-supplied price of US$3.50),
preferring to go six months without electricity than pay this additional amount.

4.6         The revision of WTP has, of course, affected the ERR quite considerably. Using
IEG's estimate of the WTP decreases the ERR for the grid extension component from 60.5
(ICR estimate) to 12.6 percent (Table 8). The return to the off-grid component is adversely
affected by not only the lower willingness to pay estimate, but also because actual hours of
electric power fall considerably short of that planned because of the technical problems
outlined above. The combination of these factors reduces the ERR for the off-grid component
to 1.5 percent (see Annex C). In consequence the ERR for the whole project is 12.1 percent.

5.       Ratings and lessons learned

Outcome: Moderately satisfactory

5.1         Relevance: The project was highly relevant, and remains so, being consistent with
both the 1996 and 2005 Country Assistance Strategies. In the latter, electrification is listed
under improving infrastructure to support regional integration and private sector
development. Government is strongly committed to electrification, having adopted a target of
90 percent electrification coverage by 2020. Rural electrification is seen as a supporting
sector for growth in the 2004 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and electrification
explicitly listed in the priority sectors for poverty reduction. The off-grid component, added
at appraisal, has helped electricity reach more remote communities which would otherwise
have been excluded. However, the design did not explicitly address how to encourage
connections amongst poor households.

5.2       Efficacy: The IEG definition of efficacy is where the project objectives are met,
which they were for the physical aspects of the project (with targets being exceeded),
showing also the success of the project in meeting ID objectives related to technical support.
But the objective of EdL operating on a commercial basis was not met in the lifetime of the
project, though the basis was laid for this to be achieved at a later date. Similarly, the off-grid
component achieved its physical objectives. But the aim of providing these services on a cost
recovery basis was not achieved, and it has proven difficult to stimulate private sector
interest in the project ­ despite the fact that there is a private sector firm also in operation.

5.3       Efficiency: The ERR for the grid extension component was at the threshold, and
that of the off-grid component well below it, with an overall average return also at the
threshold. In aggregate, the project was efficient at providing electricity to rural households
because of the focus on grid extension. However, the off-grid component can be considered
justified, despite the low ERR, as it was a pilot which will provide lessons for the future.

5.4       Taking into account relevance, efficacy and efficiency with respect to the two
project objectives, the overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory (see Table 9 for
summary).

Risk to development outcome: Low

5.5       The principal source of risk is the financial sustainability of EdL's operations. The
Financial Recovery Program has put in place a program, agreed with government, to tackle
this problem. With the agreed program of tariff increases, tariff rates will be at a level to
achieve cost recovery and a return on capital. There has not been social resistance to these
increases, partly since tariffs had initially fallen substantially in real terms, and remain
around the average for the region.

 Bank performance: Satisfactory

5.6       As stated in the ICR, project preparation was sound. Agreement of the performance
contract between EdL and government was a condition for negotiations, though in the event

                                              22


proved insufficient to ensure adequate steps being taken, which only finally happened once
the project was underway and the Financial Recovery Program was proceeding. Bank staff
kept up pressure on this issue; but without compromising the pace of overall project
implementation.

Borrower performance: Moderately Satisfactory

5.7       Borrower performance was sound with respect to grid extension--where a sizeable
expansion was accompanied by significant cost savings; and establishment of a successful
off-grid program, albeit with some technical problems. However, overall borrower
performance is rated as only moderately satisfactory on account of the time taken to resolve
EdL's financial problems, leaving most financial performance indicators unmet at the close
of the project, and the technical problems in both grid and off-grid components. This rating is
lower than that in the ICR. However, the ICR's rating, which indicates a more positive view
of the financial performance issue, appears based on developments which have largely taken
place since SPRE closed. The assessment in this PPAR is based on actions taken during the
lifetime of the project.

Lessons learned

5.8       Consumers are willing to pay tariffs at cost recovery levels. The willingness to
pay analysis shows that consumers are willing to pay for electricity at levels exceeding
supply costs. Lao PDR has been able to implement sizeable tariff increases in a short space
of time with no adverse social impact or notable demand reductions (indeed it can be argued
that any reduction in usage by already connected customers helps extend supply to new
locations). Tariffs have already reached historical highs, and will reach full cost recovery for
short run marginal cost (O&M) plus a return on capital by 2011 ­ the WTP calculations show
that these levels will be acceptable to consumers.

5.9       But poorer households remain unconnected. Even after the grid has been in a
village for more than 10 years some 20 percent of households remain unconnected. Smart
connection subsidies for late connectors would help achieve government's 90 percent
coverage target.

5.10      Explicit attention needs to be paid to technical efficiency. Technical problems of
system losses and outages reduce financial performance and undermine project benefits.
Explicit components are needed to tackle these issues.

5.11      Off-grid components promote social equity in electrification coverage... but
are not necessarily the most cost effective strategy. The off-grid component has helped
reach remote communities which would not otherwise have got electricity for a decade or
more. However, the rate of return to these investments is lower than that to grid extension, or
of subsidizing connections for late connectors, and it not proven that the beneficiaries from
off-grid programs are poorer than those benefiting from grid extension.

5.12      In countries where the private sector is relatively undeveloped substantial support
may be required to provide off-grid services in poor areas. At the same time subsidies should

                                          23


not crowd out purely commercial actors. A sensible balance would direct project supported
companies to the more remote areas unlikely to be attractive to purely commercial firms, but
the subsidy scheme needs to ensure that such activities are sufficiently attractive.

Annex B. Analysis of RE I baseline data (2004)


Description of survey

The survey was carried out in the seven provinces covered by SPRE I and REP 1. The sample was
divided into four groups (Tables 1 and 2). Group 2 comprised households electrified under earlier
projects (SPE, PGI or SPRE), group 3 was non-electrified households in the same community and
group 4 was made up of households in villages to be electrified under REP 1. Finally Group 1,
considered the baseline, was made up of households in villages scheduled for electrification under
SPRE but not yet reached. Electrification here refers to grid connection. The sample included a small
number using solar home systems (SHS) or pico-hydro, and a substantial number obtaining electricity
from car batteries.

Table 2 shows the number of villages and households under the various projects. The sample design
was also stratified for province and project but in a way that was self-weighting. Therefore survey
weights need only be used to join the different groups together into a single sample. Doing so gives a
sample which is representative of the areas surveyed, i.e. past and current project areas. The sample is
not representative of rural areas in the seven provinces since no data were collected from non-project
villages. These data cannot be used for analyzing inter-community targeting, nor for estimating access
to electricity.

The total electrification rate in the seven provinces is 30 percent as shown in Table B. 2 and B. 3,
whereas it is 40 percent in Bank project areas alone if including those villages not yet reached under
SPRE and REP 1 ­ a discrepancy which illustrates that the sample is not representative of the
provinces as a whole. Table B. 3 also shows that, at the time of the survey, Bank-supported projects
accounted for 60 percent of the electrification in rural areas of the seven provinces surveyed.

Sources of energy

Table B. 4 shows the sources of energy. The main points are as follows: (1) there is negligible use of
pico-hydro, photo-voltaic systems (PVS), and small-generators, certainly too few to analyze these
users statistically; (2) grid households reduce their use of kerosene/diesel and car batteries for lighting
once they are connected to the grid9; and (3) electrified households continue to use firewood (for
cooking).

Energy consumption can also be shown in a common metric, such as kg of oil equivalent (koe, see
Table B. 5). Electrified households consume more than twice as much energy as non-electrified ones.
This is partly an income effect, but also because electrified households pay much less for their energy
(Table B. 6) ­ this is the "unequalising effect of electrification" whereby the better off capture the
bulk of the benefits.




9. Kerosene is little used; most of the households shown in this row consume diesel.

Once income is taken into account, electrification increases energy consumption by 35 percent as
shown by the regressions reported in Table B. 7. There is a small, just significant, difference in the
use of firewood and charcoal by grid connected households (Table 6), reflecting the use of electric
rice cookers by these households (Table B. 8).

Uses of energy

Appliances

The most common appliances are TV and fan, which are owned by almost 80 percent of households
connected to the grid and one-third of those using car batteries (Tables B. 8 and B. 9). Of course there
is also an income factor in the ownership of these items ­ but a probit regression shows that being

                                                             32                                      Annex B


connected to the grid increases the likelihood of owning a TV by 84 percent (Table B. 10).10 The
result is that TV usage is, on average, over 2.5 hours a day in grid-connected households compared to
less than 15 minutes for unconnected households. Comparing TV owners only, the difference is
smaller, but still substantial and significant. On the other hand, grid connection has no significant
impact on radio ownership or usage.11

Children's homework

Data are available on how long children spend doing homework each evening. This is given as an
average for all children in the household. Hence the relevant sample is households with children of



10. Interpreting the probit may seem odd when non-electrified households cannot have TV. Another way of
doing the calculation is as follows. In a non-grid community, one-third of households use car batteries, and one
third of these (i.e. one-ninth of the community) own TVs. Once the community is connected to the grid then
80% of households acquire TV, which is an incremental increase of 69%.
11. This finding is consistent with a weak relationship between electrification and radio ownership in cross-
country data.

school age who are attending school, so the model needs to correct for sample selection bias. The
selection equation is identified with distance to school. Other conditioning variables for homework
are household income and parental education, plus the number and age of the children. Lighting
source does not have a significant impact on time spent doing homework (see table 11).

regions of the island of Luzon.


Who has electricity? Determinants of grid connection.

There are two aspects to this: (1) being in a community which is connected, and (2) taking the
connection.

Community level connections

The first question can be analyzed using community level data, and is a function of ease of access to
the community and its wealth ­ we should expect this to be the case as most companies used a
financial return decision rule which accounts for costs (ease of access) and expected benefits (number
of connections, which is a function of wealth).

There are three aspects of location. First, the grid has been extended from provincial headquarters in
stages. Towns and areas close by were electrified under PGI, the lines extended under SPRE and the
lines are being extended further still under REP 1. These extensions mostly follow the main roads,

                                                     34                                           Annex B


helping to reduce construction costs. In Champasak, for example, many villages are along the
Mekong river, whereas the road south is some 10-20 km east of the river. Hence many of these
villages were missed under SPRE, though lines were run to them for larger villages, and more are
being "filled in" under REP 1. Three factors are important: distance to district headquarters, distance
to road, and size of village. A second factor is village income, since utilities connect those
communities which can afford the connection (meaning that at least 60 percent of villagers are
projected to connect). In practice this factor may not matter, since, as outlined elsewhere, the cost of
electricity is less than that of alternative energy sources, so the 60 percent target is likely to be met in
all communities, though there will be non-connectors who cannot afford the connection fee. The final
factor is locational: it is not economic to connect smaller island communities or those in mountainous
regions. These are the areas unlikely to get a grid connection in the next ten years which are targeted
by the off-grid program. Unfortunately the questionnaire did not collect information on these
variables. However, ethnicity can be a proxy for living in a mountainous region, with the Lao Tueng
in particular living in more mountainous regions.

The model was estimated using probit (community connected to grid or not) and tobit (proportion of
community which is connected). The community size variable is positive and significant, and distance
to district capital significantly negative. Distance to road is negative but insignificant; but the variable
is correlated with distance to the district capital and when that variable is dropped the distance to the
road becomes significant.

Household connection decision

Whether a household decides to connect to the grid once it is available in the community is a function
of wealth. This is so since, although electricity is available, the poor may not be able to afford the
service, high connection charges being a frequent barrier. In Lao PDR it is estimated that 30 percent
of the population cannot afford the connection charge of $100.

                                                                                 35                                                   Annex B


The implications are that those who can afford to do so connect to the grid once it becomes available,
though they may retain off-grid sources as a backup in case of power outages, whilst others may wait
many years to connect. Figure B. 1 shows that around 60 percent of households in Lao PDR connect
within the first year; the vast majority of households that will connect do so in the first three years of
the grid reaching the community.

Annex C. Economic Rate of Return

Grid extension

As discussed in the main report, the ICR calculation relies on the calculation in the PAD for
REP I. That analysis used three separate linear demand curves to give a willingness to pay
(WTP) of US$72 per household per month. Using instead a single, constant elasticity
demand curve, gives a WTP of US$5.60 per household per month. This figure is 11.4 percent
of the WTP used in the ICR. Hence the IEG calculation takes the WTP to be 11.4 percent of
that given in the ICR, although this is not reduced as consumption expands as is done in the
ICR (this in turn results in a small over-estimate for IEG calculations whereas the ICR
approach gives an under-estimate). Using this lower estimate of WTP reduces the ERR to
12.6 percent.

Off-grid component

The ICR reported an ERR of 26 percent. The analysis in this report makes two adjustments to
the calculation. First, as argued for grid connections, consumer surplus is over-estimated. For
off-grid connections this surplus is estimated at US$90.59 a year, equivalent to US$7.55 a
month; this is more than the IEG estimate for the consumer surplus from grid connection,
which is not plausible. However, insufficient information is available on the method of
calculation of the consumer surplus to re-estimate it as was done for grid connections. Two
approaches are used here. The first, as an upper-bound, is to use the same consumer surplus
as that calculated for grid connections, which was US$5.60 a month, equal to US$67.20 a
year. The lower bound is to take the same percentage of the ICR's consumer surplus as that
from the grid estimate, which was roughly 10 percent (5.60/584.7=9.5%), i.e. US$9.06 a
year. Making this adjustment gives an upper bound of the ERR of 19.9% and a lower bound
of -1.7%. A final alternative approach is to assume that a linear demand curve was used in
the consumer surplus calculation. Adjusting for a constant elasticity demand curve usually
gives a consumer surplus around 50-65 percent less. Taking the value of one half (i.e.
US$45.30 per household per year) gives an ERR of 13.5%

A second adjustment is required to reflect the technical problems which mean that many
households get power for between 30 minutes and one hour a day rather than the intended 3-
4 hours. Consumer surplus is not adjusted from 2001-2005, from 2006-2009 it is taken as
half the estimate from full power, and from 2010 onwards at 30 percent. This adjustment
alone reduces the ERR from 26.0% to 16.0%. Combining with the re-estimates of consumer
surplus gives a range of -7.3% to 10.4%, resulting in an average of 1.5%. Using the
alternative approach of estimating consumer surplus at half the ICR level gives an ERR of
1.2%.
