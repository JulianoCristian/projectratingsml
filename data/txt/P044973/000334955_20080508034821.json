outcome rating is moderately\n            satisfactory, because of EdL's unsatisfactory financial\n            performance for most of the project's duration and the\n            technical problems. Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            that of the borrower moderately satisfactory (again\n            reflecting EdL's poor financial performance). The risk\n            to development outcome is modest since measures implemented\n            toward the end of, and  subsequent to, project completion\n            have addressed the financial sustainability issue, and\n            technical issues are being addressed under the follow-on\n            Rural Electrification Project. The main lessons from this\n            review are as follows: (i) the consumers are willing to pay\n            tariffs at cost recovery levels, and the willingness to pay\n            analysis shows that consumers are willing to pay for\n            electricity at levels exceeding supply costs. Lao PDR has\n            been able to implement sizeable tariff increases in a short\n            space of time with no adverse social impact or notable\n            demand reductions (indeed it can be argued that any\n            reduction in usage by already connected customers would help\n            extend supply to new locations); (ii) but poorer households\n            remain unconnected, even after the grid has been in a\n            village for more than 10 years, some 20 percent of\n            households remain unconnected. Smart (i.e. efficiently\n            targeted) connection subsidies for late connectors will help\n            achieve government's 90 percent coverage target; and\n            (iii) explicit attention needs to be paid to technical\n            efficiency, and technical problems of system losses and\n            outages reduce financial performance and undermine project\n            benefits. Explicit components are needed to tackle such issues."}, "docdt": "2008-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
