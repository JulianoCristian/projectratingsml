Regardless of success, it\n            is re-emphasized that Government commitment should be\n            addressed early on, strongly ensured through a comprehensive\n            risk assessment, while lessons indicate the following.\n            Project design should have taken into account the\n            house-wiring costs, due to highly negative connection rates,\n            as well as high prices faced by customers; therefore, a\n            House Wiring Affordability Plan is suggested (to be\n            introduced in the following operation), which would reduce\n            prices through increased competition and price regulation,\n            including provisions of term payments by the poorest 20\n            percent of customers. In this context, charges by private\n            firms to connect households to EdL (Electricite du Laos)\n            grid after the electrification of villages need to be\n            regulated. Notwithstanding, investments in loss reduction\n            were effective, as well as enhanced measures, including,\n            inter alia, the use of state-of-the-art software and\n            hardware, and project evaluation technologies for reducing\n            technical losses, which will be introduced in the following\n            operation. However, problems (which largely arose due to the\n            position of the Off-Grid Promotion Support Office (OPS) as a\n            government office) such as delay in centralized procurement,\n            lack of effectiveness in management of non-performing\n            Provincial Electricity Services Companies (PESCOs), could be\n            overcome by contracting out the OPS' daily operational\n            functions for the off-grid program. Moreover, financially,\n            through the off-grid component, it has been found that the\n            private sector in Lao PDR is unwilling to make long-term\n            capital investments, although it will contribute working capital."}, "docdt": "2005-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
