International Development Association\n            (IDA) resources provided the EdL with the needed investment\n            to expand its network, while helping it become financially\n            sounder through improved cost recovery efforts. IDA also\n            supported the ministry of energy and mines to pilot and\n            establish sustainable off-grid electrification delivery\n            systems. IDA established close working relationships with\n            key policy makers in reforming the power sector. The project\n            applied innovative techniques to connect households in very\n            remote areas. Solar home systems and small, village-based\n            hydro schemes helped electrify more than 6,000 households in\n            villages without grid coverage. Building on the success of\n            this project, IDA plans to continue its support to the\n            government through two rural electrification projects and a\n            Greater Mekong sub-region power trade project."}, "docdt": "2007-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
