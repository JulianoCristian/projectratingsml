The project's components are three:\n            1) The Distribution Extension component will finance\n            lower-cost extension of the distribution grid in rural areas\n            and small towns, as well as a subtransmission system to\n            electrify areas; 2) The Off-Grid Rural Electrification\n            component will pilot standalone electricity systems\n            including renewable energy technologies, and will develop a\n            national plan for off-grid rural electrification; and 3) the\n            Institution Building component will support EDL in project\n            management and commercialization, and will provide\n            assistance to the government in sector planning and further commercialization."}, "docdt": "1998-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
