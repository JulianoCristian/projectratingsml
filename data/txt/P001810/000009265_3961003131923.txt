MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE lIN    NATIONAL DEVElOPMENT ASSOCIATION
T1O THE EXECUTIE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO MOZAMBIQUE
FOR A CAPACITY BUILDING: PUBUC SECTOR AND
LEGAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.           The following memorandum and recommendation of a proposed credit to Mozmbique
fbr SDR 10.9 million, the equivalent of US$15.5 million, is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and would help finance a capacity
building: public sector and legal institutions development project.
2.            IRS.  Economic and social development in Mozambique are impeded by
severe shortages of high-level manpower to plan and manage policies and programs. These shortages
result from a combination of weaknesses in education and training and in the public sector institutions
that seek to recruit, retain, and udlize middle and higher-level personnel. There are only 3,000
university-level graduates in the entire country of 16 million persons, and less than half of these
graduates possess the required skills (e.g., in finance, economics, law, business management, public
administrion, etc.) to oversee the ongoing Economic and Social Rehabilitation Program. At
Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM), both quality and efficiency of learning are being seriously
hampered by atrion and demoralization of the local teaching staff, lack of textbooks and library
materis, poor study and living conditions for students, and deficiencies in university management.
Because of these factors, the drop-out rate is unacceptably high (half the entering students never finish
their degree), and many graduates lack the skllls needed by employers. Due to poor working
conditions and staff attrition, the University is unable to realize its potential as a fulcrum for policy
resech and analysis. In upper secondary education, weaknesses in teaching and availability of
textbooks and learng materials are resulting in poor student learning achievements; repetition rates
are hih (25-30% annually), and graduates are unprepared for university study or to enter the labor
force as productve workers.
3.           Many top civil sernts are fleeing the public sector to join the private sector and
intentional agencies, becase of low pay and poor conditions of service in government. Nearly
4,000 foreign technical assistance personnel have been recruited to cover this critidal manpower
shortage: such expatriate persomel is costly (about US$200 million annually), is often badly-
managed, and fails to transfer knowledge and skills to local caoterparts. A large share of
Mozambic;ns who remain in the Government have inadequate educadonal qualifications and skills.
Less than a fiflh of the top 3,000 officials have a university degree, a surprising 16% have no fonmal
schooling at all, and few senior civil servants have received pre-service or in-service training in
public adminisrdon, financl or personnel management, etc. In both public and private sects, the
situation of the legal profession is especially critical: there are only 90 lawyers in Mozambique, and
shortages of judjes, law clerks, and other legal workers are equally severe. The basic court system
is barely funiioning, and many imporant legal insions (e.g., Bar Association, Administve
Tribunal) are either embryonic or non-eistent.
4.           The proposed project is based on the analysis and recom  contained in the
Bank's 1991 QDaV Buidng Framework Par and StIt also utlizes the findings of
recent studies on public pay and employment and local government; work done by the Government
(under the auspices of the UNDP NatCAP Program) on improving the utilization of technical
assiamce; and the UEM's 1991 institutional stabilization plan. The project has been designed to
complement and reinfor  a companion IDA project, focussing on Human Resources Development



-2 -
with hnestments in the University and upper-secondary education, and a number of other donor-
financed Initiatives, including SIDA support for public administration and a salary incentive fund for
top-level civil servants.
5.             gn. The project's main objective is to build and maitain capacity in
key public institutions and skill areas by expanding the supply of well-trained senior planners, policy
analysts, managers, and tehnicians, and by enhancing pay and other incentives and conditions of
employment for senior civil servants. Specific objectives include: (a) strengthening legal institutons
ana professional capabilities, and (b) developing public administration and management skills and
enhancing civil service personnel systeis.
6.                      d     . The proposed project will contribute to building capacity in
Mozambique through the following two components: (a) Strengh LegaL Insitutions -
implementation of a long-term strategy to strengthen legal instiutions and expand legal education;
pre-service and in-service training for lawyers, magistrates, and other legal workers; and creation of
computerized legal data bases and library collections (53% of project costs); and (b) Jmproing Public
Adm ion and Develo nMau mnt - establishmert of a Ministry of State Administation
(MAE) planning unit to formulate civil service reform policies and oversee their implementation:
technical assistance and training to support ongoing improvements in public sector personnel
management job grading, recruitment and promotion, career structures, training for professional
growth); monitoring and coordination of an incentives scheme for senior civil servants to be financed
by donors; and creation of a fund for in-service training in public administration and management
(47% of project costs). The project costs and financing plan are presented in Schedule A. Schedule
B provides the procurement methods and disbursements by fiscal year as well as the estimated
disbursements for the project. A timetable of key project processing events and the stats of Bank
Group Operations are given in Schedules C and D respectively. lstitutional background and a
detailed description of the project is atached as a Technical Annex.
7.            ojc Imlemnti. Managers have been identified for each of the main
components, and are located within the Ministry of Justice, and MAE, respectively. These managers
will assign direct implementation responsibility to existing administrative uiits (e.g., UEM Law
School, legal NGOs, trainig facilities) and will assist with day-o-day activities and monitor results.
An inter-ministerial committee, presided over by the Minister of State Adminitraton, with the
Minister of Planning and the Minister of Finance acting as co-presidents, will be responsible for
ensuring consistency and strengthening linkages among the four components of the project and for
reinforcing ties with the companion Capacity Building Human Resources Development Project.
S.           roJec SuaWnablI1v. Within the project, virtually no new Government posts will
be creaed, and as there are no civil works in the project, with investmen  concentated in the
provision of technical assistance and training, recurrent costs for operation and mainnce are
minimal. In addition to being internally sustainable, the goal of the project itself is to improve the
institutional and financial sustainability of other development activities in Mozambique. The
thousands of trained Mozambicans who will benefit from the project, and the more effective public
and private institudons that will emerge, will help to sustain future development.
9.           Loesson Learned fro  Previous IDA Involvement. While no PCRIPPAR has been
carried out on IDA assistance to education or public administration in Mozambique, a joint
IDA-Country Implementation Review held in February 1991 revealed a number of generic lessons for
the future. Some of the most important are that: (a) dynamic local involvement is fundamental to
acbieving project objectives; (b) strong donor coordination during project preparation helps to avoid



-3-
duplication/gaps in effbrt and reduces the management and reporting burden on local institudons; (c)
streamlining Government procedures for contracting TA and civil works can facilitate project
implementation, as can the use of standard bidding documents; and (d) project coordination and
management s-ystems need to be firmly established at the outset and strengthened continuously through
appropriate staffing, in-service training, and use of local consultants. These lessons and others have
been fully incorporated in the design of the proposed project, which was formulated by the
Mozambican institutions which will be responsible for implementation. Standard contracts for goods
and services have all been prepared in advance of project effectiveness.
10.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project springs from the core of our
Mozambique country strategy, which emphasizes the development of institutions and skills for
sustained growth. The continued restructuring and liberalization of the economy, the achievement of
durable peace and internal security, and implementation of effective resetdement/rural development
and poverty alleviation programs will all require greatly enhanced indigenous capacity. The
seriousness of the current "crisis of capacity" demands bold and imaginative solutions backed by
substanial resources from the donor community. Given IDA's current position in Mozambique as the
major lender for structural reforms, and its heavy involvement ii economic and sector analyses of
capacity Issues, IDA is well-placed to take the lead in this area.
1t.                 Aco. During negotiations, the Government has given assuras that (i)
not later than October 1993, and each year thereafter, annual progress and audit reports on the salary
incentive fund would be submitted to IDA; (Hi) not later than December 31, 1994, MAE's draft plan
for the restructuring of the civil service career system would be submitted to IDA; and (Iii) not later
than November 30 of each year a joint project implementation review would be carried out and a
mid-term review by November 30, '952I. Cnditions of effectiveness are (a) Key project
implementation staff are employed; (b) The Project Advisor for the legal component has been
slected, with experience and qualifications satisfactory to the Association; and (c) that Government
has furnished documentary evidence satisfactory to the Association, certifying Government's formal
approval of its Capacity Building Action Plan. Condiions of dia it for training will be the
completion and approval bv IDA of training programs for the first year of the Project, which shall
include, inter alia, the following: (a) type and number of trainees; (b) location and institution where
training will be received; (c) objectives and length of training activity; and (d) estimated budget.
12.          E.srnmental Ratig  The project is rated Category C.
13.           .Qb,ge       ves  Capacity building in Mozambique will expand significanty the
supply of higher level humn      , which is a necessary condition for the achievement of all
IDA program objectives. The proposed project also contins speial measures to further the process
of public seM r reform. and to increase women's educational opportunities and participation in the
legal profession.
14.          B      .eflts The proposed project will make a substantial contribution to social and
economic development in Mozambique, by enhancing critical skills, systems, and local institudons.
Several thousand legal workers will receive additional training and will be able to participate more
effectively in the reformed and revitalized legal system. Development policy analysis by local

institutions; including the University and government policy units, will improve substantially. In a
larger sense, the country as a whole will benefit from stronger public and private sector performance.
1S.         BRks. The main risk facing the project is that the capacity to plan and manage
Implementation of the various project components will not materialize or will deteriorate over time.
This risk will be mitigated through project design that emphasizes the same capacity building and
susainig measures that the project aims to spread throughout the economy: namely, creating an
sffective work environment (through appropriate staffing, availability of office technology, etc.) and
offering stimulating and relevant training (pre-service, in-service, on-the-job) to key project
personnel. Swift adoption of measures to improve incentives for senior officials will help to bolster
implemeittation capacity. Tle capacity of local training institutions will also be increased through the
use of 5lintc" arrangements with external training programs.
16.          Recordaio. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Diretors approve the
proposed loan.

nNICAL ANNE T1
klEh=ANDUM AND RE(:ONIfiNDATIO  OF THE PRESIDN
FOR A CAPACITY BllLDNG: PUBLIC SECIR AND
IdEGAL INLbLUlEaa= DEVIELOPI,ENrI PROJECT
I. M Caacity: Causes and I
A. Introdution
1.           Mozambique is facing a severe crisis of capacity. There is an exremely serious
shortage of well-educated and experienced Mozambicans who can assist in the planning and
management of both public and private sector activities vital to the counry's progress in the
economic and social spheres. The handful of Mozambicans who are capable of providing
leadership in these areas are being siphoned off to the private sector, because the civil service is
increasingly unable to compete with private institutions in terms of pay, conditions of
employment, and work enviroment. The Government is relying more and more on cosdy
expatriate technical assisns, who are frequendy poorly-managed, less productive, and relatively
ineffective in building up local skills and institons. All of these trends undermine severely the
ability of Mozambican Instiutions, especially in the public sector, to carry out the Economic and
Social Rehabilitadon Program (ESRP), efect the trsalftination of the economy from a centrally-
amistred to a market system, design and inplement key development projects - and
ultiately, improve the lives of Mozambique's 16 million people, many of whom are living in
abJect poverty.
2.           To deal systematically with this crisis of capacity and elicit new policy and
programmatic responses to the problem, the Government requested the World Bank Cm
conjunctn wihi the Swedish Agency for Intational Development (SIDA)) in December 1990
to collaborate in carrying out a study on capacity building. Two document emerged from this
collaboration: (a) a shorer Capac  Bupding .EuamokZ aPe , discussed extensively with the
Government and donor comymnity and presented to the Mozambique Consultative Group (CO) in
December 1991; and (b) a longer, more in-depth  ait  Building Sector Sy, completed in
October 1991 and widely diseminate widtin Mozambique and to the donors. During the CG,
the Government proposed to fArther refine the framework paper Into a Capacity Building Strae
and Action Plan and present these in a meeting with donors. An outline of the strate was
completed prior to negotiations, the complet strategy and a letter from Government decaring its
commitment to said stregy will be nesented to IDA before Board approval. It is expected that
the donor meeting would take plae in November 1992, and formal approval of the Capacity
Building Action Plan would be a condition of effectiveness.
3.          In both documents, five main causes for weak development capacity were
documented and analyzed: lack of incentives and productive Isittional structmes, procedures,
and practics, especialy in the public sector, insufficint quantity and quality of university
graduaes, resch, and other cont    svices; poor quality of Wpper secondary education; low
quality, relevance, and cost-effectiveness of various types of vital professiona training for
Mozsmbique's future development (such as economics, finance, law, acountcy, and public
administraon); and the sub-opdmal use of technical assistance to build indigenous long-term
capacity.



- 12 -
4.           In the second half of 1991, the Government also requested the Bank to work
closely with it in prepaing proposals, eligible for I(DA financing, which would respond to some
of the weanesses identified in the two capacity-building studies. The proposals would be part of
a wider capacity building 'program' consisting of a large number of donor-assisted project in the
areas of education, training, civil service reform and public  istratio, and private sector
management strengthening. Thbse efforts include a major SlDA-financed public adminision
reform project; a salary incentive fund for senior civil servants to be supported by Switzerland,
Norway, and others; USAIID and DANIDA support to the legal sector; EC financed training
programs in public administration; and UNDP-led efforts to improve the management of foreign
technical assistance.
5.           The proposed project as well as the proposed IDA financed companion project,
focussing on human resources development (Staff Appraisal Report No. 10731-MOZ) is therefore
part of a much broader effort to maintain and expand local capacity to plan and manage
Mozambique's development. The proposed project responds to the need to improve the "demand'
side: incentives and conditions of employment and professional traning, both pre- and in-service.
While, the companion project will attempt to respond directy to two other dimensions of Capacity
Building, by supporting Govermment and donor effirts to increase significandy the "supplyw of
trained and qualified policy analysts, planners, managers, and technical specialists for the public
and private sectrs of the economy. It is expected that, as a result of the two projects, thousands
of additional Mozabicans will be trained in key professional domains, and that concurrent
actions in the areas of public pay and employment and the reform of public instutions and in the
management of technical assisance will encourage these Mozambican professionals to join and
remain in civi service carers.
6.          In the sections that follow, the current state of ins"tion buildingltraining in law
and public adminisration are eamined. A simila analysis of the current state of university and
upper secondary education is conained in the Capacity Building Human Resources Development
Project Staff Appraisal Report. Their links to capacity-building, key outstanding issues, strategy
considerations, and other ongoing initiatives to improve the supply of high-level manpower, are
also discussed.
B. I lstitudomn andu Training
Bkad and lssms
7.           Me 1O    Fram         During the colonial period, no law school existed in
Mozambique and the few lawyers within the country were either Portuguese nationals or
Mozambicans trained in Portugal. At the time of independence, the flight of judges, lawyets and
law clerks left only 25 lawyers in the country. This lack of qualified persons hindered the
fonnulation of new laws and the Portuguese legisldion was retained, although former leglation
considered contrary to the 1975 constituion was to be treated as automatically revoked. As of
today, the Mozambican legal famework is composed of old Portguese codes, decrees enactd
after independence and recent legislation all applied in a uncoordinated manner.
8.           The 1990 Constiuton and the 1991 private sector development legislation
envision a democratic pluralistic society and a friv-enterprise system. No market economy can
operate without an extensive underpinning of private law. Modern legislation on fundmental
matters, inter alia, international trade, company structure, corporate finance, tax regulations,



- 13 -
adminitrative law, bankruptcy law and business law needs to be enacted. To effectively
implement such a extensive legal reform, a strong and well educated legal profession needs to
develop in Mozambique. Moreover, these laws will be meaningless unless a competent judiciary
is esablished and appropriate mechanisms are put in place to efficiendy enforce and disemiate
the law.
9.                     Professen Currently there are about 90 fully qualified lawyers in
Mozambique to serve a population of 16 million. 27 of these lawyers are female professionals.
Initial assessments provided by the Law School estimate that approximately 1200 graduates would
be needed by the year 2000 to fulfill the need of legal services demanded by both government and
private sector, although it would be very difficult to accomplish this ideal goal. The legal work
of the naton is carried on by three different groups. First are the "advogados" who qualify for
this title, after becoming a "licenciado'; there is one woman 'advogada". Under the proposed
Bar Association regulations, the licencia  would have to complete a one year "estagio"
(intership or practical training at a government agency.) "Licenciadosm are those having
completed the fill 5-year law school course. Second, there is a group referred to as "tecnicos
juridicos* who have finished a portion of law school sufficient to obtain a degree of "bacharel en
direito' and their practice is limited to the lower courts. Finally, the "assitentes juridicos' have
normally completed high school and a practical training course ranging from etree to six months.
10.          Besides lawyers, legal services in Mozambique are performed by a variety of
professionals. First, there is a vast group of paralegal staff working in the admiistration and the
judiciary, lacking essental legal skills. Second, "notarios- enforce legal requirements that various
acts and documents be notarized and "conservadores" maintain updated registries. At present, the
educational programs for the profession of notary have not been clearly established. Thid, a
signiflcnt nmber of government employees, with no forma training in law, must of necessity
deal with legal matters.
11.          Thei JudI      Under the post-idependence system of justice, considerable
discredon and power was placed in the r      and the investigatory competene of trial
judges. The shortage of legal personnel made the revamping of the court system a difficult task.
However, until 1977, a few Portuguese judges remained in Mozambique under a bilateral
agreement between FRELIMO and Portagal. By 1978, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) had created
a national court system, guided by the broad principles of popular justice that FRELIMO had
originally formulated. Judges' decisions were largely based on common sense and the general
notions of justice set forth in the constiuion. In communal viUlages, the local tribunals were
entirely composed of lay judges with no legal training. In some provinces, (e.g., Nampula), there
is only one judge.
12.          The Instituto Nacional de Assistencia Juridica (INAJ) was created by the
govemen in 1986 to organize, control and monitor legal services. IN.1M maintains a list of
legal technicians from which the public can select a legal representative. The INAJ list contains
42 advogados (of which only 20 are litigators); 40 tecnicos juridicos and 12 assistentes juridicos.
The Bar Association is only just created (early 1992), there is no program for continuing legal
education, nor any stary requirement for updating legal knowledge and skllls. In May 1991,
INAI convoked the fis extraordinary session of its general assembly to consider a draft statute
creating a national Bar Association (ordem dos advogados mopambicanos). This statute would
limit the admission to the bar, establish ethical standards, and impose sanctions for violations. In
the past, only INAJ could provide legal services to the public. Now it is intended that the private
Bar Association will function alongside INAI. MULEIDE, the Women's Association for Law



- 14-
and Development, has been established, as a private organization, to improve the siaion of
women through studies, lea assistce and civil education. In August, 1992, MULEDE
opened a small office to provide legal sevices to poor women and to advance the equality of
w ^nen.
13.          In 1989, the Supreme Court was made a separate body from the Minstry of
Justice. These two insotons joined efforts to start a one-year practical training program for
magstwt. At presnt 'licenciados' are not required to complete this training to become judges.
In addition to the Supreme Court, the 1990 Constiton calls for the estabisment of an
independent judiciay and a new Administrative Tribuna to hear and decide claims agaist the
State. Other specialized courts (e.g., Labor, Tax, Maitime) may be created in the future.
Recent legislation has been enacted defining the institudonal aspects of the adinin of
justice. The 'Lei Organica dos Tribunales Judiciais of March 1992 calls for the following
courts: the Supreme Court; provincial courts, and disrict courts. Simultaneously, the Assembly
of the Republic enacted the 'Lei dos Tribunais Comunitarios', establishing a community court
system with jurisdiction over small claims, family disputes, and minor misdemeanors. Copies of
lagislation can be found in the Project file.
14.          The 'Procuador Geral da Republica- (Attorney General) is responsible for
determining the -legality of legislationL The Attorney General's office is further obligated to
defend the juridical order and to see that laws are enforced. The Attorney General's office has
only 70 professional staff for the entire nation, of which only four are licenciados. Eight of these
procurators are female. This lack of personnel burdens these professionals who must take
responsibility for districts other than their own. The situation is worsened by the lack of
transportaton and insufficient budget for lodging.
15.          The Minitry of JustiCe iS responsible for the revision, streamlining and drafdng
of legislation in Mozambique. This comprehensive task is futher aggravated by the fact that
many of the nation's laws and regulations have besn wrten by non-lawyers and existing jurists
have little experience in legiative drafing. To assist the Ministry of Justice in underindg this
responsibility, there is a technica council composed of four, full-time paid lawyers, and four part-
time paid jurists. Moreover, there is only one attorney in the division of research and legWation.
The notaD   registry office does not have lawyers. *Notariosm and "conservadores- play a
fundamental role in the Mozambican economy by certifyng and regiteing property rights and
tides. Clear ownership of property is a key aspect of any market economy. Anoter area of
concern of the Ministry is the design and implementation of traning of professional and in-service
training of legal staff and court officials.
16.           WPT  he nation's law school at the Eduardo Mondlane University
opened after independence in 1975. In March 1983, the school was cleosed. Some believed that
the law school was a center for reactionaries, but otier factors played a more significant role in
the decision to close it down. Neiter the original curriculum patterned after the Portuguese
model, nor the later socialist-oriented curriculum, equippd lawyers to meet the needs of the
Mozambican society, and a decision was made to close the school until the curriculum could be
revised. . I was finafly reopened in August 1987.
17.          The latest curriculum, implemented in 1991, aims at providing a well-rounded
modern legal education in the neo-roman Civil Law tradition. The frs two years, as is typical of
Civil Law education, largely concentrate on soial sciences with the bulk of the technical juridical
subjects left to the last three years. Several aspects of this curriculum are noteworthy. The



- 15-
r _eqim  for two years of Portuguese and English reflects the Mozambican reality where
qualifed juri  will, in the fue, oft  naeed to work in both these languages. 'ne program
apprs to provide a good general background in the domesdc area - both for civil and cminal
law. Mzmbique may be a leader among developing nations in making tax and tarff law a
mandatory course. The requirement for three hteational subjects - public international law,
private international law and intational economic law - is both unusual and admirable, as is
the compulsory introduction to a computer course. While the proposed curiculum is
praseworthy, it is questionable whether the Law School has the necessary human and materW
resources to carry it out. The curriculum is once again under review, however, the changes
anticipad are minor, such as adding a requirement for a course in *Legal Writing and
Research'.
18.          The Law School cumendy has 435 students, of which 72 are women, with the
entering class of school yea 1991-92 numbering 100. University teachers are divided ino five
categories:  rf   s caedatcos, ciados. auxiliares and  ass    grme    and
The entire teaching corps does not include a single catedratico and is composed of 8 full-time and
33 part-ime professors, the student-teacher ratio is 1:17. There are only seven women teachers
at the Law School. Twothirds of the students work and study only part-time; one third are full-
tm  students. The Law School has three classrooms for 200 students each, and 7 classroms
which hold 35 students eab. Registration has not been computerized and there are only eght
admintative employees and one documentaion technician. There are virtually no tebooks for
the sdents and the law libry resources are meager. There are no electives, no speciization
and no gaduate courses.
19.          Ani Mnia needs assessment for the Law School was carried out in June 1991, with
the assistance of a grant provided by SIDA. The report points out that the main obstacles faced
by the Law School are: isufficient number of qualified professors; lack of strategic planning and
modern pedagogical approach; lack of bibliography and updated legal mateials; poorly trained
staft and non-existent career development plans for the tea cing corps, including the provion of
contng  education progrms. There is consensus among all legal ititutionst the need for
short-term graduate training to update the knowledge of existing jurists is of utmost priority.
20.          The lack of appropriate technical skills is aggted by the isolation from other
legal tradions in which the Mozambican professional operates. In short, today's lawyer has
litte eWerience in coping with the intricacies of ineatonal transactions or the complexities of
fiancial and business legal issues. Coordination on this Issue is essential, as the definition of
common guidelines would maximize the donors' efforts and avoid burdening the weak
Mozambics Implementation capacity.
21.          In summary, the main issues to be addressed by the project are that:
(a)   there is a severe shortage of lawyers in Mozambique.
(b)   the education and training of M.izambican lawyers has not prepared them to
handle complex problems of international fice, investment and trade (e.g.,
some of the recent graduates have received all their legal traning in Easen
Europe universPites).
(c)   the few available lawyers are extremely overloaded, takg up governmnt posts,
case trials and other legal assistance tas  simultaneously.



- 16-
(d)    the Mozambican legal profession needs assistance to adequty perform its work.
Further resources are necessary to overcome the shortage of essental Igal books
and materials, as well as computerization to achieve greater efficiency in carrying
out legal work.
(e)   the typical Mozambican lawyer is isolated and lacks professional concts in other
nations and tberefore does not benefit from sharing the knowledge available from
others. A similar situation appears to exist within the country where books,
knowledge and experiences are not efficiently shared by legal professionals.
(f)   the lack of an association of lawyers, one of whose goals would be the creation of
continung education programs is of utmost importance to upgrade legal skills and
facilitate professional exchanges.
(g)   the judiciary is poorly equipped, lacks basic professional skills and incentives to
establish and mainain its independence.
(h)   the 6issemination of the law and court decisions is very weak and there is no
efficient system for the cataloguing and indexing of legal collections. Thus, legal
professionals, common citizens and prospective investors do not have access to the
legal framework in force. Compatible legal data banks and inteibrary loan
syms are essential to facilitate sharing of professional knowledge.
22.           Goerw  sea=  forS              aft       Le    Serces Aware of the
magitude of the structrad  weaknesses suffered by the legal profession and insdiuons, the
Mozambican authorities have given special priority to the strengteing of legal services and to
the definition of a strategy for the sector. The forum for the definition of said strategy was the
PPF-financed seminar held in Maputo from Febrary 17 - 21, 1992, where the role of the lawyer
in a society under transformation and the needs for legal training were reviewed and agreed upon.
As part of the government's strate, the Mimistry of Justice established as of December 20,
1991, in agreement with the Supreme Court, the Attorney Geaeral, the Adminstrative Trial
and the Law School, a special working group (WG) composed of representatives of all mentioaed
institutions. The WG is responsible, inter alia, for defmning the guidelines for the long-erm
strategy to build professional capacity within the legal profession and the judiciary, periodically
updatng them, and coordinating all existng and future donor contributions in the sector.
23.           Other strategic measures taken by government include the recent approval of the
Statute on judicial magistrates and the enactment of the framework law on the judiciary by the
legislative assembly (see Para. 12). Furthermore, draft legislation liberalizing the pracice of law
may be enacted in the near fuitre. In the past, only INAJ could provide legal services to the
public. Now, it is intended that the private Bar Association will function as a separate
professional association and that INAJ continues to cater to the large majority of citizens who
cannot afford to pay for legal fees.
24.           In close coordination with the Supreme Cout, the Ministry of Justice launched a
pilot program of short-tem practical training for magsta, court clerks, and judicial
administraors. Due to the satisfactory results of said program, MOJ has proposed to expand it
and coordinate simflar training carried out by other legal institutions under a single trahiing
faciliy. In defining the instituional and functional features of the Center for Judicial Studies
(Cento de Estudos Judiciarios), other existing relevant models will be examined (eg. Portugal,



- 17 -
California, New Mexico). This Center is to coordinate such training. The proposed Center oims
at ensuring the most dficient utilization of scarce resources, while harmonizing different training
iniaves. Initially, the Center would provide pre-ervice training for -magistrates and, at a later
stage, to extend its fiture operations to include refresher courses for district judges and
orientathual practical courses to recent Law School graduates interested In pursuing a judicial
career. Ultimately, all magistrates would receive one or two years of specialized training.
During the 1992 Seminar, a policy decision nm the roles of the Ministry of Justice and the Law
School as training centers was reached and coordination mechaisms were designed and approved
to avoid overlaps and conflicting curricula.
25.          Donor 1 x        T Ihe donor community has responded in a positive way to
the urgent plea made by the Mozambican legal institutions. The WG's comprehensive program to
strengthen legal capabilities, aims, not only at integrating the recommendations and results of
ongoing assistmce financed by other donors (e.g. DANIDA, USAID, SIDA, France, Portugal,
U.K.'S Commonwealth Secretariat, Brazil, and the Friedrich Elbert Foundation), but also, at
providing coordination mechanisms for fiture donor interventions. It is expected that the
proposed project will develop local capacity to prioritize the multiple needs of the legal profession
and to design and implement a well-rounded strategic program of actions. During the Appraisa
Mission, two meetings were held with these other donors and the WO submitted a list of
proposals for additional financing. The representative of the University of Lisbon, under the
DANIDA agreement, joined the mission to further coordinate project implementaion. In addition
to the expected participation of donors at the annual workshop, joint progress reviews will be
carried out to provide the forum for open exchanges among Mozambicans, the Bank and donors
interested in the sector.
26.          The USAID-financed *Mozambique democratic initiatives project" is intended,
inter alk,  instiutionalize an indpeadent judiciy and promote the decentralization of
government. Of the total US$4 million provided to Mozambique approximately US$500,000 have
been earmarked to finance a legal sector survey and a legal sector action plan. Technical
assistae In this area will be provided in two phases by a tem of lawyers. To avoid overlapping
and duplication of efforts between the Project and USAII) assistance, the WO sharedi its program
with the USAID team of consltants which visited Mozambique in May-June 1992. Other recent
contributions include: a USAID US$20,000 Grant to INAJ to disseminate civic education
materias to the population and a US$70,000 Grant by the U.S. Goverment to the Ministry of
Justice to train 25 district and provincial judges. Under an initial NORAD grant, MULEIDE has
started up a workshop.
27.          Ihe "nstitutional Support to Teaching and Adm on of Law in Mozambique
Project' financed by a DANIDA grant in the amount of DKr15.5 Million provides a three-year
assistance progm  to the Law School, the Supreme Court and INAI. Under its allocation the Law
School will train teachers in Denmark and Portgal and has parily financed academic exchanges
with the University of Lisbon under a cooperation agreement entered into between the two Law
Schoois. Ibis agreement provides for the supply of three Portuguese professors per semester.
Salaries are jointiy paid by Portugal and DANIDA. The Law School is obligated to pay for
internadonal travel, local lodging and transportation. Other beneficiaries under the DANIDA
grant are INAJ, to finance media campaigns to inform citzens of basic rights, and the Supreme
Court, to acqure library materials, purchase computer hardware and software and finance visits
of judges to Denmark.

28.          The Law School has also received gras from the French cooperation to purchase
esseial office materials and equipment for a total amount of US$17,000 and typewriters through
a Frledrich Elbert Foundation contribution. Tle U.K. Commonwealth secrtaa is support
the Miity of Justice through Its "aid for democracy and good governance program".
29.          Ious Bank Involenet To strenen the ability of the Ministry of Finance
and of the Bank of Mozambique (BOM) In the areas of economic policy formulation, capital
budgeting and Banking operations, the Bank provided a credit to assist in financing the
Economic and Financial Management Techical Assistance Project" (Credit No. 2066-MOZ).
As put of this project, a legal assistance component (LAC) has been included to enhance the
BOM legal deparnt's ability to effectively respond to an ever growing number of requess for
legal advice on a variety of complex intional financial issues. Under the project US$0.8
million has been made available for capacity building in the form of advanced legal seminas,
practical  ting, short-term graduate training and, updated legal materias, as well as computer
hardware and software to establish a legal data bank of legal forms and contractual clau   as well
as cataoguing and retrievat of laws, decrees and other legal materials. It is expected that legal
reforms in other areas (e.g. Local Government and ROCS I Projects) will be coordinated with and
draw upon the technical advice of the WG.
30.          In October 1990, a Bank mission reviewed progress on the implementation of the
LAC and tried to ascerain the best method for building legal capacity wifhin BOM and other
sectrs of the Mozambican government concerned with legal aspects of economic developmen
Durlng the mission, BOM hosted a wodrshop with a variety of lawyers in Maputo to determine
more precisely what are the legal needs of the country. Participants were asked to identify
training needs ani urgent acttons to be taken as part of an overall capacity building effort to
strengthen legal services in Mozambique. (Sample questionnaire is in the project file.) Ile
respondents concluded that their professional activities were seriously affected by the laclk of
appropriat taining to cary out their work, insufficient legal materis and books, and deficient
diseminaion of the law, new reguations and court decisions. The priority areas chosen for
further training are, inter alia, international, finncial, economic, tax commercial and conact
law. During the period 1990-91, several follow-up actions have been carried out including, the
selection of the legal profession as one of the target areas of the capcity building study, and
farthr prepratory activities caried out by a local iformal task force, which later became the
current WG. To help overcome the past isolation of the Mozambican legal profession, the PPF is
f cing study visits abroad by key jurists to acquaint them with other legal realities, experiences
and alternatives, including a visit made in May-June 1992 by the Dean of the Eduardo Mondla
Law School to New Mexico to examine a disk based, full text compuerized legal infrmaon
system and techniques for computg the  minaon of justice, as well as New Mexicos
judi training programs, ways to deliver legal services to the poor, means of protect  the
enironment, and methods of altemative dispute resolution. Also under the PPF, several study
tour are being undertaken by officials from the Procurator General's Office: three in Zimbabwe,
three in Portua, and three in Brazil.
31.          As wvidenced by the foregoing discussion, Mozambique might profit from ext
assistance in almost all legal fields and practical aspects of the legal profession and the judiciary.
Ihe efficient utilization of assistance provided from various donors and the proposed project has
two fudamental prerequisites. First that a longterm strategy to strengthen legal capabilities be
arefully designed, discussed and approved. Second, that special coordination efforts be
undertkn by the legal institutions. Joint progress reviews, by Govermment, IDA and the main



- 19-
donors, of ongoing capacity building actions to strengen legal services will be caried out
annually under the project to:
(a)    coordinat all legal aistance inputs to avoid duplication;
(b)   supervise and distribute information to all relevant Instiutions and private
practidoners on location of various legal documents, books and materials, as well
as forthcoming legal lectur and training sessions;
(c)    carry out critical review of ongoing programs to ensure    the most important
legal needs of Mozambique are being satisfacwtorily met and propose adequte new
programs;
(d)      aluae benefits deriving from ongoing cooperative or tWning arrgement
with relevan instiutons and explore the negodation of new arrangements; and
(e)    carry out periodic assessments of the long-term strategy to propose necessary
adjustments.
C. lPbtic Sector Reffiom and Public Astrdaden Traidng
hi ad Main hIu
32.           Mahnie snd lEinbi        of the I aiil Servine   1 1990 It was esdmaed that
tot civil service employment in Mozambique was approximately 105,000. Of this total, more
ta half were attached to the Miistries of Health and Education. Excluding nurses and teachers,
some 35% of civil sevants are based in Maputo City, with a particuarly high degree of
centralization of 'specialists' Oicenciados). Surprisingly, those Ministries with mainly service
delivery fimctions are highly centralized, such as: Transport, Public Works and Sanitation (48%);
dustry, Fisheries and Commerce (41%); and Agriculture and krigation (25%). lbis is partdy a
reflectio of the unstable and dangerous conditions created by prolonged Insurgeny in the
countryside; however, with a return to political stability, a high priority for development will be
to build service delivery capacity in the tural areas.
33.          The recent development of the county's first reliable database on the staff  of
the civil service has provided some initua genderdisaggregated statistical tables indicating an
extremely low percentage of women (7%) in managerial and tecbnical positions. These
preliminay analys also indicate that there is no gender-based salary discrimination between
per0s at the same level of qualification. However, personnel reguations regarding m _daoy
tednment do discriminate against women, with the mandatoy retrement ages for male and
fe  civil servas being, respectively, 60 and 55 years of age. Since women often have a
soter dme in their careers than their male counterparts, due to family obligations, the
compusory rerement age further reduces women's ability to progress up the career ladder.
34.          Of the senior civil servants (management and upper level technical cadres), the
median age is about 40, with two-thirds of the staff falling in the 30-45 age group and only 12%
in the 26-30 age cohort. This relatively small proportion of staff under 30 poses a marked
problem for the future; in five years time, there will be only 211 senior civil servants to replace



20- 
the 451 curnty in the 31-35 age cohort. It is imporant that recruitment to eny level positions
is in ified. In addition, while few of the managerial and senior technical cadres wil reach
madatory retirement age over the next few years, 14% will be due to retire during 1994-2009.
It may be important for the Government to consider how they might retain experienced
individuals by such steps as raising the mandatory retirement age for females, by permStting
cotinued servieb after the normal retrmet age, and other actions aimed at discouragmng early
retirement.
35.          In terms of grade/pay levels, the hierarchical stmcture of the civil service
represents a very flat pyraid, in which a disproportionately small cadre of upper level staff sits
atop a large lower level staff that is predominantly constituted of individuals with minimal levels
of educational achievement or skills. Adjusting the total number of civil servants to exclude
nurses and teachers, the senioi Aanagement and technical grades represent less than 6% of total
civil sevants. The lowest pay level, comprising mainly unsilled manual labor, represents some
28% of the adjusted total, with basic level technical staff represendng a further 24%. This
suggests that there is overstaffing at the unskilled and basic level technical grades, a situation
probably enouraged by the lack of personnel to fill higher level positions. One of the key
measures for enhancing the capacity of the civil service would be an adjustment of the relative
proportions of lower-level and senior technical and managterial staff, and to ensure that structures
and staffing complements are appropriate for the vanous positions and grades witlin each
Ministry.
36.          BducaMI  Levels Available data on the educational leve's of senior civil
servants show that about two-hirds have only a secondary education or less. Less than 20% have
a university degree, while 16% have no formal schooling at all. At the local governmen level
the sitation is worse: of the 206 district directors surveyed recendy, only 74 had schooling
beyond the primary level, and none had attended the University. This situation has several
important consequences for capacity building. First, many of the higher level civil sevants
probably require additional training, either formally or through informal programs. Second, since
so few individuals possess post-secondary qualifications, these should not be a pre-requisite for
promotion to senior governm  posts. It does not appear that the need for a post-secondary
degree has been demonstaed through any analysis of the functional requirements of these top
jobs and the results of this insistence on formal qualifications are that the competiton for those
with lbgher level educaion is intensified, salaries are bid up, experience in service i
undevaued, and the skills of lower level managers and technicians are not adequately utilized or
nutued.
37.          Civil Serviee      The civil service pay struct4re was revised in arly 1991,
raising the mean monthly salary from a US$ equivalent of $22 as at November, 1990 to $34. At
the same time, salaries were raised proportionately more for senior officials, thus inreasig the
wag comptression ratio (highest to lowest) from 14:1 to 20:1, reflecting a conscious move to
provide minimal wage increases at tte lowest levels as a measure to encourage voluntary
separation where overstaffing is most evident. In May 1991, additional salary improvement for
university professors, teachers and nurses, together with bonuses for the holders of advanced
academic qualifications, were announced. With the application of these bonuses, which range
from 20% to 50% of basic salary, the emphasis on educational qualifications has again been
emphasized and the relationship of position responsibility and job perforance to remuneratio
further weakened.



-21 -
38.          Salaries in the civil service for medium and higher level staff have been shown to
be low as compared to the private sector and intaonal agencies (but not at present, to the
parstatal sector, although the latter are currently revising their salary schedules). For example,
following the May 1991 reforms, total gross private sector remuneration, for those holding
university degrees, is currently at least double that available within the civil service. The
difence In net-of-ax remunerat  are muh smaller, because of the tax-exempt status
accorded to both the salaries and various bonuses paid to civil servants. In terms of donor
agencies, the levels of remuneration offered to local staff far exceed thosm of both the civil service
and productive sectors, although there are wide variations between donors. Avaiable data
indicates that the base salary of senior admistrtve staff working for the donor agencies is about
five times that of the base salary of a National Director in the civil sevice. In addition, the
donor agencies usually offer a number of fringe benefits to their staff such as family and
education allowances, medical assistance and sometimes free transport. Despite expressed
concern by the donors over the distortions so created, litde has been done to agree common
policy rules for the recruitment of locw; staff.
39.          It is not clear whether the salary differentials between the civil service and other
sectors have had an impact on loss rates from the civil service as a whole, but it is apparent that
there has been a net loss of the most higbly qualified and skilled personnel. In addition,
mooalighting and absenteeim is common among middle and higher level civil servants. The
siation is exacerbated by a lack of salary incremens within grades, which restricts the mean of
achieving a higher civil service salary to either general pay awards or through queuing for
promotion.
40.          Another means that has been used by donors to try and attract and retain
experienced civi seants in po3itions associated with project implemention is the practice of
topping-up salaries. The topping up may be in the form of a cash payment, housing or vehicles.
The data available indicates that there are large variplons in donor practices, driven in part by
donor's own regulations and in part by competition for the services of the available, skilled
psonnel. Donors also have an impact on civil service remuneration through offering
conutancy fees to higher level staff, travel allowances for duty travel both domestic and abroad,
an  tning allowances. Again, there is no policy framework or even informal agreement
between donors to regulate the etent of such practices.
41.          The government is soon to approve a proposal for a Salary Incentive Fund, which
would provide salary top-offs in a transparent fashion to those most "at risk" of leaving the civil
service. ITis mechanism, described in detail in Appendix 1, would provide a coordinated
framework through which donors could finance the salaries of top-level civil sera, and thus
ensure that governm  staff in key positions would not continue to abandon public servlce in the
face of inadequate incentives. The salary inceative fund would be retroactive to June 1992, paid
in meticais, and adjusted automatically when government salary scales are adjusted. Selection
criteria are transparent Salary incentives would be based on a formula multiplying actual salary
by points obtained on a scale. In line with recommendations made-by the CVaci  Aing
AtorS udv points would be assigned not only on the basis of academic qualifications, but also
take into account length of service, level of responsibility and location of service. For example,
10 years of experience for a middle-level technician achieves the same number of points as an
enty-level licenciado, and public serva  outside of Maputo would receive at least 10 additional
points, out of a maximum of 82.5 points.

42.          lh. Rgulat fnit the Civil Serviee The process of creating a national civil
sevice in Mozambique has been ongoing since independeece In 1975. In 1986, central control of
the personmel process and provision of general management support to pesonnel management
became the responsibility of the newly-created Ministry of State A straton (MAE),
implementing policies approved by the National Civil Service Council. The most recent phase of
civil service reform has the objective of creatg a more inegrated systm for public sector
management in which differences among minlistries in structe and management systems ae
atioalized and simplified. Over the last few years, MAE, with the assistance of SIDA-funded
experts from FUNDAP (a Brazilian consulting agency), have achieved significant results. Among
the principal accomplishments of their work have been a sbarp reduction in the number of
diffrent job and position claifications, from more than 6000 to less than 1000 and the dfinition
of servicewide, common carmer structures for management, professional and technical personnel.
These reforms have been accompanied by the consolidation of a number of different pay and
grading classifications into a single table hat is applicable across the entire civil service.
43.          However, if the civil service is to be able to attract and retain qualified staff,
fiuther reform of both career strucues and schemes of service is required so that these do no
work to reduce commitment to a civil service career. Regulations covering the qualifications and
experience requirements for each level in the management career structure contain some serious
anomalies: in some cases, eligible prior positions are rated at a pay level superior to that of the
post for which they are a pre-qualification; in others, experience in a lower-level management
position is not required as a qualification for a more senior post. A more serious problem is that
the current management career stucture makes mobility between central, provincW and district-
level management posts vitually impossible. Career progressions and pay levels continue to be
determined by formal qualifications, with job experience so heavily discounted ta long-term
commitment to the civil service Is discouraged. Within the technical stream, there is a career
block between levels B and C and the time required for normal career progression is excessive.
44.          Responsibility for the implemetation of civil service employment policies and
regulaons rests with the human resource diectorates of each ministry and state secreat.
These central dirctrat  are responsible for the minstry personnel located at both the
headquaers and outside of Maputo; they also administer the competitive civi service
examinaions and t       programs. The specific functions, Internla organization, methods of
operation, and their reporting systems vary considerably. MAE, with the assistance of FUNDAP,
are currenty working on a program of assistance to the personnel units in the individual
Mistries to standardize their personnel procedures, with particular emphasis on the establishment
of improved personnel in ation systems.  ohe program is led by MAE and coordinatd by a
team represent  the personnel departments of the Ministries involved in the first phase of the
program. MAE offers both technical assistance and extensive training to the personnel staff of
the involved Ministries.
45.           riingj of CivIil & taS There is a serious shortage of managerial and
admin ve skills and expertise in Mozambique arising from the lack of pre-independence
education and training for indigenous people at all levels and from the post-independence exodus
of the Portuguese. Within the civil service, this problem is compounded by the lack of coherent
management syms for finace, personnel, procurement, etc. In addition, the necessary shift in
the role of Government as the county effects a transition from a command to a market economy
is requiring redefinition of the roles and responsibilities of civfl serwas, whilst the
implementation of the Government's plans for significant decentralization of authority to the



-23 -
provces and districts will place even greater strain on both manageent systems and the
m_ s  tbhmselves.
46.          At the same time, thee Is a general absence In Mozambique of insttutions
structured to meet the training needs of managers atid adm at   particularly at middle and
seor levels. in terms of oal education and training, the Facuty of Economics at tfie
Unverity currently offers a S-year business mangement degre course with a highly-compeve
annual iake of around 100. There has been considerable inteest over many years in the
development of an under-graduate course in public administation, but at present the Faculty is
facing severe problems and any expansion of courses or intakes will take some time to realize.
The techical schools and instites offer courses in basic administrative skills, but their
equivalence with the general education system means that the general education component of the
curdcula takes precedence over the vocational componen. The School of Administration and
Law, which is affiliated to MAE, prwides mid-level education and trainig in basic
adminisurave skills equivent to ta given by the technical instituw, but a lack of faculty,
hostl accommodation and budget has severely hampered its activides.
47.          A distance education program, funded by SIDA and leadi  to a Mastes Degree
In Economics, has provided a different model of professional education. The program was
established with the School of Orietal and African Studies at the University of London. Around
25 senior officers of the civil service and the prstal, who already had baccalaurea  degrees
I economics (previousy offered as a 3-yeat program  by UEM, but sbsequently witdrawn),
were selected to participate in the program. The course consists of part-ime study, supported by
written and audio-visual materials ad by a network of local tutors. 'Me program is conducted in
english, outsl(e of office hours, with participan recen intens  l ge traing prior to,
and durn, tie course. Approximly 20 participan  of the first batch remain in the progm
duing its third year ad SIDA are planning tD support a second intake. The advates of th
program are several: it provides high quaity instruction; It enables participan  to remain in their
Goverment posts durig their period of study; the network of local tators esues wat the
program materl Is related to the participants' working context; the english language training
fcilitates the participants' subsequent Interactions wit foreign consultants and the donr
community.
48.          Outside the formal education system, various training centers offer short-tem
courses in aspects of adminiostaton and mawngement. The Center for Loca Government
Trining, also affiliated to MAE and which was established in 1989 with EEC support, provides
two-month programs for provinci and district-mid-level managers and admistratve assistats.
Other vocational training centers focus on providing training within specific sectors or Miistries.
Notable examples of agencies that provide management training (as opposed to office
admin aon sills training) are the Centres.for Agricult Trainig and for Industri Trgning
- although the latte caters many for the commercial sector. Concerned at the loVJ level of
mam_ent experdse for project implementaton, donors often include management aning
components within their proJec' terms of reference. Another approach is that used by MAE,
wher in the am  of personnel management and with the assistan  of a SIDA-fmded technc
assistance tam, they have combined the reform and/or development of procedures and systems
wih innsive trinig in the implementi  and maint ce of these procedures and systems.
Tbis approach has the advantge of ening that  mnagemeat framework exists for individuals
to practice the skils leaned in the training. The program has also worked to establish a network
of tainers witin both MAE nd the sectoral Miistries involved, to enable a large body of



-24 -
people to be reached fister and at a lower costthan would be possible with a single, cenralized
taing unit.
49.          The pictu  that emerges, therefore, is one of a limited supply of pre-career
educatlonalltechnical training, where relevance and quality is questionable and a variety of In-
service, sectoral efforts to flll the obvious gaps. There is no comprehensive strategy for civil
service training, no stdardization of current programs or materials, no coordination between
mistries' training activities, and no formal link between training and career development within
the civil service schemes of service. Responsibility for the identification of training needs within
the public sector and for programming training to meet these needs, curreatly lies with MAE.
However, apart from the commedle efforts in persomel management, MAE has not yet been
able to fulfil this responsibility.
50.              S         a XsSit Cm*iSn    IS=  In summary, the capacity of
Mozambique's civil service to plan and manage the delivery of public services is severly
constained along several dimensions, each of which requires specl corrective measures:
(a)    a stmcural dimension, which includes ovestffn at some levels and
understafting at others, and the relative weakness of provincial and district
government. There is a need to review the roles and functions of the differnt
ministries and to ensure that both their organiional stncture and their staffing
levels are approprate for their responsibilities;
(b)    a supply dimension, related to the difficulties in attracting and retaining silled
personnel in the civil service. The Government needs to find ways to increase the
aractiveness of a civil service career relative to alterative oppunities. A
balance needs to be struck between adoptinj measures to attract qualified people
to entry-level positions and measures to retain more senior staff,
(c)    a 4uaWitative dimension, in which the poutvity of the operational systems of
goverament is low. There is a need to greatly increase the availability of relevant
training to upgrade managerial and technical skills, but this training needs to be
Integrated with the implementation of improved operating systems;
(d)    a motivaonal dimension, which covers disinentives such as limied promotion
opportunities and financial rewards, inefficient working conditions, etc.
51.           MAE is the lead ministry fof several major areas of significant reform. Rs
Directorae of Loa Administration is responsible for the process of decentrization, including
policies on the devolution of authority to local levels; design of local government structures,
staffing and administrative systems; and policies and procedures related to the delegation of fiscal
and financial matters to the local level. Its Direccao Nacional de Funcao Publica is responsible
for the reform of policies and procedures related to civil service employment, as well as for the
taing of civil sera. The newly-created Directorate of Public Service Organization is
responsible for reviewing the functions, stuctres, staffing complements and operating systems of
all minsies. Each of these areas of reform in themselves place a considerable burden on MAE.
Furthermore, their inter-dependence requires that the programs of the different Directorates, and
the various donors supportig these programs, are carefully coordinated. In addtion to the
above, MAE has also been given responsibility for coordnaing the Government's ctpacity
building program, requiring MAE to lead efforts in the development of the national capacity



-25 -
building strategy and implementation plan, and to coordinatethe progress of all the involved
ministries in Its implementation.
52.          In order to folfil all of these responsibilities, MAE's capacity to develop the
necessary long-term strateies, to fomlate appropriate policies in support of these strtegies, and
to manage and coordinate Implemention needs to be strengthened.

53.          The Goverament's stated priorides in the area of public administration are
threefold: (a) the decentralization of authority to the local level, together with associated reform
of the political process aimed at increFsed democr on with locally-elected representation.
Ths will involve the development of a clear policy framework and the formulation of strategies
for implemention of the policies; (b) the institutionalization of the reformed system of local
government through the development of appropriate structures, systems and operational policies;
and (c) strengthening the quality of the services provided by the state, to be achieved tbrough
improvements in orgaiational structures, the simplification and rationalization of administrtive
sysm  and procedures, and through the training of civil servants. MAE has a dual role in the
achievement of these goals; it has a 'sectoral" responsibility for the development of
decentralization policy, combined with its role as a central, coordinating ministry responsible for
leading a process of reform in civil service operations and the employment of civil servants.
54.          In addition, the Govermment has committed itself to the development of a long-
term, national strategy for capacity building. Efforts to strengthen the public services through a
program of civil service reform and humlan resource development, will constitute a major
component of the strategy. Again, MAE has a dual role in capacity building; that of codiaing
the various sectoral contributions for the development and implementation of the strategy, and that
of lead ministry for the reform of the policies, stucures, systems and human resource
development activities of the civil service aimed at improving the performance of the public
services.
55.          The process of civil service reform has been ongoing since independence in 1975.
In particular, since 1989, MAE has made significant strides towards the simplification and
unification of career and pay structures across the whole civil service. This has been
acoompanied by efforts to improve civil service personnel management systems and procedures,
including the development of a personnel information system to enable monitoring of staffing
levels and staff ch  cs. Through this work, MAE has established good working
relationhips with the human resource direcorates of the sectoral ministries, has developed
commiment to the proces of reform, and has created a strong base from which to launch the
next phase of reform.
56.          The next phase of civil service reform will take place in parallel to, and in close
coordination with, the program of reform of local government. The strengthening of human
resources at the local government level will be essential to the success of the decentralization
proces In recogniion of this need, a planning and policy unit Wi  be established within MAE,
with responslity for leading the strategy formulation and policy development process, for
developing mechanisms for the participation of all levels of the govenment in this process, for
coordinating the various programs within MAE as well as the coordination of donor programs.
Thi planning unit will thus form the focal point for the integration of Government programs for
capacity building, civil service reform and decentalization.

57.          Government priorities for the next phase of civil sevco reform include: (a) the
Implementation of an incentives scheme to raise the remuneration levels of civil servants in an
effort to stem the drain of staff to the private and donor sectors. The Government is soon to
approve a proposal for the establishment and operation of such a scheme, involving a package of
both financial and non-financial measures, and is curreny canvassig donors for future financiog.
Strong interest has already been expressed by Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden; (b) efforts to
stre n  gRen pm               within the civil service, by extending implementaion and
raing activities to additiona ministries at both central and local levels; (c) revision of civil
service caee stuctures and schemes of service with a view to improving retendon of staff,
Igng    local and central level career structures, and ensuring greater emphasis on staff
performance and skill development; (d) tarting a process of  reviews ithin sectoral
minsties with the objective of deflning their role and responsiblities, viz a viz other ministries
and within the context of the decentralization program, and reviewing their organizational
structure and staffing complements to ensure that these are appropriate for the defined
responsiities; (e) development of a srey  for a coordinated program of haininin
moan=  and publig adminhkaIign for civi servants.
58.                              SID Service Refonu SYA have been supporting MAE since the time it was
fist established. Iteir most recent program of assistance, covering the period 1989-1992, has
supported the creat  of a unified career and salary structure for the whole civil service which is
nowv reaching the final stages of implementation; the development of improved systems of
personne   dministration and their implementation within a number of sectoral ministries; and the
establishment of a database of personnel  ormation on civil servants. This work has been
sported by a technical assistance team from FUNDAP, a Brazilian consulting group.
59.          For the mxt phase of civil service refbrm, a joint program of assistance has been
agreed between SII)A and the World Bank in support of the Government's strategy (AppendIx 2).
This arrangement wili build upon the collaboration initiated with the Capacity Building study, will
se coordnaton of the inputs of the two 'asencies to MAE, and will simplify project
management for the public administration cminponent.
60.          liln  In PuWk Adminsru ad Mt  Current support in this
area is provided by the EC, who have been financing the operations of the Center for Lcal
Governmet Trainig; UNDP, who are developing and implementing training programs for
provinal and district level staff within the three northern provinces; and SIDA, who have been
supporting in.service training activities related to the implementation of the new systems of
personnel ad    on. SIDA have also been workling with the Mistry of Finance on the
development of in-ervice training programs for staff from the Ministry of Finance and finance
staff from the sectoral ministries, and is financing the MSc distance leaning program in
economics.
61.          Over thenext three yeas, SIDA wil condiue to support in-senice training for
finance staff and a second intake of pardt.pants to the MSc economics program. The Italian
Government is proposing to support the restucturing and revitalization of MAE's School of State
and Law. Pollowing an evlluation of the first phase of their support to the Center for Local
Government Taining, the EC plan to commence a second phase of assistance, supplemented by

63.          The objectives of tihe component are to create a group of competent lawyers
capable of desig     and implemeting a sophisticated legal and reglory framework
uderpinning a market-oriented system; and build a corps of lawyers, paralegals, Judges and court
offices to ensure the proper  ion  of jusdce.
64.          Ite component consists of activities in the areas of
(a)    design and imple ion of a long-term strategy and an action plan to strengthen
the legal profsion and the judiciary in Mozambique (US$800,000);
(b)   Improvent of the quality and efficiency of legal services, as well as training for
the lawyers and Judiciary (US$3.6 million);
(c)    Faciliaing the dissnatin of the law and the adminon of jusdte through
the dedgn of modern automated legal information systems; upgrading resources
and operations of law libraries; assisting the leg  reform pocess thu

65.           &Rink Fn    An in-depth assessment of the insution  framework
responsibe for legal services will be carried out with a two-fold objctve. First, it will define
policy and main objectives of legal trang and the role of the legal profession and the judiciary
in a society under           Second, it will provide the basis for a long-erm national
state and an acton plan aimed at strgening legal capabilities in Mozambique. To avoid the
Ongoing trend of undertaking isolated training activities which are not responsive to the needs of
the Mozambican society, comprehensive reviews of the main legal institons and the Law School
will be carried out. These reviews aim at assessing major structal weaknesses and tailoring the
training program to the growing responsibilities of the legal institutions under the Estdo
Dkoka established under the new Constitution and ftre instional and political development.

66.        . Specifically, the Project will support three workshops and studies. The workshops
will (a) review the capacity, scope of work, nsttitutiona arrngements, and safing of the main
lega instttons (eg., Ministy of Justice, Supreme Court, Attorney General's Office and the
Admintrative Tribunal); (b) recommend eventa adjustments to the functional, orIonal,
staffing, administrative, and professional aspects of the above-mentioned institutions and their
respective training programs. There will be three workshops held during the first, third and
fourth Project year. Ihe recommendations of the worksbhops will be discussed at the annua
Project implementation reviews in order to assess and adjust the sectora strateg and identify
other strategic activities. In addition, the Project will fund diagnostic studies of the Law School,
with a view to recommending a strategic approach in the design and implementation of its training
programs and the possibility of implementing other programs open to staff of other legal
instiutions. Areas to be inc!uded are, inter alia: an assessment of the quality of undergraduate
and graduate training, including relevance of its curriculum, the desip of comparative legal
terminology traing and teaching methodologies of the teaching corps. Consideration should be
given to the impact that the opening of a private Law School may have on the Law School's
curent capabilities. Terms of reference for the diagnostic studies will be prepared by the Law
School within six months of Project effectiveness and submitted to IDA for approval.
67.          By early 1996, a National Conference on the legal profession in Mozambique will
be held in order to provide a broad forum to discums the role of the legal profession and to
propose technical solutions to the main legal issues faced by Mozambican jurists. The Conference
wilI be attended by legal professionals in active practice, at al levels. Also included will be
lawyers from the Provinces, since these jurists, who seldom have an opportunity to exchange
views with their colleaues in Maputo, woud benefit from this nation-wide event. The
recommendations and technical papers presented at the Conference will be published and widely
distributed among government legal institutions, law professors, and private sector lawyers.
Resuts of relevant assessments sponsored by other donors wil be jointly reviewed.
68.          Finaly, the lgal institutions responsible for the implementation of the long term
strategy, and its updating throughout Project execution, will be strengthened through the exposure
to other legal systems and traditions. At the same time, a review mechanism is included to allow
for the periodic adjustment of the strategy. Credit fimds will finance short-term local seminars,
study-tours, intnahips and attendane to professional conferences - on an average of a one-month
period - for a maximum number of 30 training activities throughout project implementation. This
technical training will permit Mozambican lawyers, law professors, judges and paralegals to
become familiarized with other legal systems and training techniques, as well as English legal
terminology. Other donors, including the British Council, were requested to provide
complementary financing. The credit will also finance shortterm local consuiants' services
which will be employed X facilitate progress reviews and periodic adjustments to the strategy.
69.          L         and arale   Services The Project will stegthen legal services through
the provision of professional and in-service training to overcome the weaknesses of legal staff, at
all levels, in the following areas: international, financial, economic, tax, commercial, contract and
administrative. It will do so through a series of training activities for legal practitioners, law
teachers, judges, magistrt  and students, as well as by supporting the legal reform process.
Furtmore, the Project wil emphasize the local training apprch rather than sending people
abroad tr taiing. Reference is made to the taiing of judges which succe y started under
the U.S Government program for district court judges. The Ministry of Justice has also given
particular Importance to the design of local traing programs for staff and lawyers. Detailed
course programs for the first year and general descrptions of training programs are in the project
file.

twinng arrangement with relevant inte onal legal institions or through Individually
negotiaed contracts. It will indude, but not be limited to: (a) forign graduate trning at
Master's or Doctorate's degree level for law teaes (about 2 per year); (b) refreiher courses for
current law teachers and recemt graduts ftom socialist Law Schools in business, finance,
iternational, commercial law and legal framework for the development of the privat sector
(semias with an average of 30 trainees per seminar over a one-month period); (c) contracig of
foreign legal experts for short- to medium-term (two-month average) assignments in areas of the
law where there is no local exps available to assist in the carrying out of the training
specialized legal subjects (e.g. corporate law, mortgage law, international economic law,
environmental law, ternat dispute resolution and maritime law). The Project will also provide
logistical and adminive support to legal training activities carried out by UBM's Law School
in the provinces of Nampla and Sofala, including travel expense for teachers, audio and
videocttes and textbook reproduction. It is recoized that mily obligation may bar
otherwise qualified women from participating in some of these activities; to overcome this
barrier, the Project will provide supplemental payments, whea indicated, to such women to assist
them while abroad, with family or child care. In coordination with the University design, clear
guielines and institutionJ mechanisms for selection, training acid retaining of trainees who have
received training financed under the Project will be set up.
71.         bThe project will finance the design and implementation of a pre-service and in-
hi:ne gm e=for magistrates, court clerks, and staff at large of the Supreme Court,
Attormey General, Ministry of Jusdce and district courts. This will include: (a) follow-up phases
of the pilot program launched by the Ministry of Justice under US Government financing to
provide practical trn  to district court judges; (b) other refresher, preservice, and in-service
tning for magistrat. It is expected that the initial program will be extended to cover a
broader set of beneficiaries (an average of ten professional, 15 paraegal and 20 administrtve
staff of eah instion wiUl be trained per project year). Training abroad for magistrates will be
provkded through short-term stWdy visits (30 visits during Project imple on and support to
Ongoing and future twinnig arrangements). Consultants' services will be provided to assess the
isttional, financial and technical viability of the establishment of the Centro de Estudos
Judiciios and, depending on the results and recommendations of the feasibility study, the Project
will also finance essental start-up actions.
72.          To assist Mozambique in undaking its legam p m, which wiUl cover
all aspecs related to private setor development, the project will finance: (a) short-term highly
specaized consultants' services tO provide advice in pardcular areas of the Mozambican legal
framework needing urgent revison ad updaing and to streamline existing commercial, fincial,
adminstrative and enviromental law; (b) the strehening of contract negotiation and legal
draftig capabilities through the attendance of local lawyers to special seminars (two partcipans
per insdtutio per year will go abroad ad there will be two seminars in Maputo); (c) printing and
computerization of relevant standard contractual provisions to be made available to government
legal instittions and Bar Association, as well as other appropriate organizations, such as

(a)   the provision of a secretariat function to support the Capacity Buildiog Inter-
Misterial Committee, including the development of a phased plan for the
implementation of the National Capacity Building Strategy, and the coordination
and support of the implementation actvities of the imvolved minigtries;
(b)   the development of strategies and implementation plans for civil service reform,
recommending and draftg policy changes, and overseeing subsequent
implementation. Priority issues for attention will inciude the integration of
district, provincial and central levels within the management career structure;
revision of the civil service schemes of service to recognize the value of previous
experience and training, to ensure that district experience is required for
promotion to senior man ement positions at the center, and to remove anomalies
in the career progression regulations; the development of incentive policies to
improve the attractiveness of district posts; and the formulation of a strategy for
training in public service ad ration and management. Particular attention
will be paid to the development of policies that will promote the career
development of women within the civil service, including measures to increase
their ability to participate in training Ooth local and overseas). An agreed plan of
action for the key policy reform measures is given in the draft implemention
manual.
(c)   the coordiation of the programs implemented by the various directorates of
MAE, including the development of an institutional strategy and plan for MAE
itself. the coordination of donor inputs to this plan, to ensure that the impact of
policy and other reform measures on the different programs are positive, to avoid
duplication of effort, to ensure that donor support is effectively channelled; and to
provide an information center on donor-funded activities and reports.
82.          To support the planning unit, the project will provide 38 months of foreign
technical assistance, for either long-term or short-term advisors as dictated by the staffing plan to
be developed by MAE prior to negotiations. In addition, the project will contribute limited funds
for materis and supplies for the operation of the unit. Support for the implementation and
dissemination of the work of the unit, including the conduct of studies and analyses of civil
service reform, local seminars and workshops, and reproduction of reports and other materas
will be financed by the Credit. SIDA's contribution to the planning unit will include funds for
technical assistance (ocal and foreign), equipmert and supplies.
83.          Persond Manag nt  he first phase of the SIDA-supported program for
strengthening personnel administraon within the civil service involved five pilot ministries at the
central level. The program was coordinated and managed by the Directorate of Funcao Publico
within MAE, with technical assistance provided by FUNDAP. The second phase of the program
now about to begin, covers the extesion of the personnel systm to all other seal ministies at
both the central and provincal levels. This includes the r on  of the personnel units, the
training of trainers from the human resource directorates of the involved ministries; the training
of all personnel managers and staff in the new systems and procedures; and the establishment of a
persomel information system that will enable the routine monitoring and control of staff
establishments and provide details of the characteristics and qualifications (including training) of
the staff employed by each ministry at each level. In addition, the technical group established
during the first phase of the SIDA-funded program, with the assistance of FUNDAP, will provide
support to the sectoral ministries to complete the integration of all staff within the standardized
career structures and salary tables.

84.          New initiatives during the project will include: (a) the conduct of a training needs
assessment among managerial and senior technical-level civil servants to identify management
responsibilities and to compare these against the educational and trainig backgrounds of current
incumbents. This analysis will assist the policy and panning unit in the development of a strategy
for traiing in public administration and management; (b) an analysis of the current career
structures and career progression paterns within the civil service as a basis for rationalization of
structures across central, provincial and district levels and for the revision of the civil service
promotion regulations to take account of training, experience and job performance; (c) analyses of
the data already collected on senior level civil servants, including disaggregated gender analyses
to assist in the formulation of policies to increase the participation of women at senior levels.
85.          To support this work, the project will contribute 38 perceat (US$1.1 million) of
the technical assistance costs of FUNDAP, to provide both long- and shnrt-term advisors to
MAE's Directorate of Funcao Publico. The project will also finance the local costs for the
traning of sectoral ministry staff at cetal and provmincial levels, provide furniture and equipment
for the strengthening of the personnel units of these ministries, and fund the provision of the
necessary personnel forms, files and operations manuals. SIDA's contribution of US$2.1 million
to this component will include the balance of the technical assistance costs, together with the

86.                         l D           To supplement SIDA's program for the overall
strenghening of MAE, the project wiUl provide three categories of support: (a) to MAE's
Departm  of Administration and Finance; () the provision of scholarships; and (c) a
contriution to a local cost fund to support MAE's leadership and coordination role in retion to
ivi service reform and overall capacity building.
87.          The project will fitance the salaries, on a declining basis over five years, of three
additional staff for the DAP. An accountant will be recruited to take responsibility for donor
projects and to depuie for the Chief of the DAF. An assistant accountant will back up the
accountant and have particular responsibility for liaising with the Ministry of Pinace and with the.
MAE component managers on the capacity building project's financial plans and expenditures. A
supplies officer will head up the DAF's supplies section, including responsibility for all
proement under the IDA and SIDA projects within MAE. A computerized budgetary control
system wil be established within MAE's DAF, including the accounting for the IDA and SIDA
projects. To assist in the revision of DAF procedures, to develop the computrized system, to
train DAF and other MAE staff in the opein  and use of the system and the reports, and to
suevise overall implementation, the project wil finance a local advisor for a period of two
years, together with the necessary computer equipment and supplies. Short-term, local taning in
accunting, procurement and supplies management will also be provided for DAF staff.
88.          Over the five years of the project, a total of 12 person-years of oveMeas
fellowships will be provided by the project, for the provision of bachelors and masters-level
training in public  nisn and management for MAE staff at both the central and provinci
levels.
89. .        A total of US$500,000 will be provided by the project as a 38% contribution to
local operational costs for MAE, the balance to be provided by SIDA. These monies may be
used for local purchases of minor equipment and supplies, local technical assistance and tiing
costs, and for local travel and meetinglseminar costs associated with MAE's responsibilities for
civil service reform and capacity-building coordination.

any single sub-project will be a US$1 million equivalent, although the expected average sub-
project cost is $200,000.
91.          The Fund will be managed by the MAE plang unit. To be considered for
funding, a poposa must be developed for each sub-project and smted to the planning unit.
The planing unit will evaluate the proposal according to established criteria relatng to priority
witin the capacity building strategy, the creaton of local istitutional capacity, cost feciveness,
potentl Impact, sustainability, and the manugment capability of the Implemen tn agency. Full
details of eligibility, evaluatn and proment criteia, together with guidelines on proposal
format, are in Appendix 1.
92.          A mmber of sub-projects have already been idendfied as priorities for the fund.
Itese include: (a) tecbhical assistance to the Ministry of Labor for the development of a strategy
and plan, including specific proposals for donor support, for the development of new national
policies, progms and operating systems for employment reglation, labor market analysis and
vonal training ($200,000); (b) development of a core team of staff trained in accounting,
financial management and project appraisa from the Bank of Mozambique, Banco Popular de
Devolvimento and the Banco Standard Totta to promote the effective uiliaion of available
external resources as invement credits. The sub-project will also develop the institutonal
cqpcity of the Banks to continue traig beyond the life of the sub-project, and will conute
tward the salaries of consultans for the Business Advisory Units of the Instikute for the
Development of Local Industry ($750,000); a feasibility study on the development of a distance
learning program in public adminitration, following the model of the SOAS MSc Economics
program ($50,000). Descriptions of these prposals are in the project file.

Base costs are esmaed at US$13.7 million equpvalen and contingencies at US$3.8 million
quivalent (28% of base costs). Foreign exchange cost are estaed at US$11.2 mfllion or 81%
Of base costs. Taxes and duties included in project csts accon for aproximaely 7% of total
project costs, or US$1.3 million equivalent. All costs are based on April 1992 prices. Project
costs by component are summarized in Schedule A.
96.          Project costs by expendiure category are shown in Appendix 3. Capital costs for
fuiture, equipment, vehicles and supplies and materials account for 8% of base costs; training
for 56%; technical asistance for 30%; and incremental recurrent costs (salaries and allowances,
utlities a-d supplies, and operation and maintenance of equipment) for 4%.
97.          The tot project costs include an allowance of US$3.8 million equivalent for
coningencies. Physical contigencies are 10% for equipment, and furniture; 5% for supplies and
materials; nd 20% for technical assistance and training comprising US$1.8 million equivalent or
13% of base cost. Ptice contingencies have been esmated using Bank projections of
international and domestic inflation, and asume the annual rates of increase set out below. The

95% for vehicle operadng and main ance coss.
99.          Project costs include an esdmated US$1.3 million in indirect taxes on locally
pocured goods and on technical assistance fees. In addition to these taxes and duties embedded
in project costs, the Government imposes a series of taxes and duties primarily on the inportaton
of goods and equipment which have to be paid by the buyer seatly, eve if the buyer is a
goverment agency. Therefo, In additon to its contribution to the project costs, the
Government would have to set aside a total amount of US$1.1 million in duties and taxes, or
about US$180,000 per year which it has to make availabe to the implementing minises in order
to be paid back io general revenues. These duies and taxes have not baee included in total
project costs as they are not usualy embedded In the pries of goods and services. To include
tee taxes and duties in project pricin would artificially ie the project costs, as they are in
essence a tasfer payment from one branch of Government to the other. Given the Mozambican
legislative context, it is necesar to calculate the tax burden as the Ministry of Finance will have
to allocat funds to the approprhte line Misties so that the indicated levies to release imporotd

goods from customs, etc. will be -ald. Appendix 3 provides estimates of the tax burden
genrated by the project due to this kind of taxes and duties.
100.        The proposed project will reqie Incremental recurrent expenditures for loca
salaries for additional staff and operation and maintenance costs for equipment. During project
preparation and appraisal, every effort has been made to miimize the incremental recrrent costs
associated with the project. However, a cettain level of additional recurent spending is seen as
unaoidable, If project objectives are to be achieved. Annual incremental expenditures will
average about US$120,000 equivalent; US$81,000 for strenthening legal capabilities, and
US$34,000 for public  stration and management strengthening. Recurrent expenditures for
the legal component (computer and office equipment mateance, start-up support to the
Administative Tribunal and Center for Judicial Studies, and component management costs) would
be financed from the Government budget. For public administraton and development
management strengthening, maintenance and incemenl operating expenses will be financed from
Governmen's recurrent budget, while approximely MT5O million, or less thian US$25,000
equivalent, will be needed for the provision of incremental salaries for MAE DAF, to be financed
by credit funds on a declining basis.

101.      'he total project cost of US$17.5 million equivalen minus taxes and duties, will
be financed by the Goverment, and IDA (the financing plan is shown In Schedule A). The IDA
credit of US$15.5 million equivalent will cover 86% of total project cost and the equivalent of
100% of the foreign exchange cost and 40.2% of local costs. IThe Government contribution of
MTS.S billion (US$3.4 million equivalent) or 14% of the total, will finance the remaining 60% of
local costs, and 100% of the estat  US$1.3 million of taxes included in project costs.
102.        lhe proposed project is part of a larger program to build capacity in
Mozambique. Other efforts include a major SIDA-finaced public admisation reform project
(valuing approximatly US$6 million equivalent over the next five years and a salary incentive
fund for senior civil servans to be supported by Switzerland, Norway, SIDA and others,
amountg to US$50 million over the nen five years.
C.
103.         Procurement packages have been compiled with the aim of obtaining the most
economically efficient costs. When contracts are made up of more than one lot, the slice and
package approach will be used.
104.         Project-elated procurement &az.ngements are summarized in Schedule B. Items
finamced by IDA will be procured according to "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 and as elaborated in paras. 105 through
109 below. Where similar items are to be procured at different times during the project life or
are financed from different soures, the implementing agencies will ensure reasonable
standaizatim. Standard bidding documents for civil works and goods which have been
approved by IDA during past project negotiations will be used in the procement of these items.
Standard contracts for consultat' services have been cleared for approval by the Ministry of
Finance and will be sent to IDA for approval prior to project effectiveness.
105.             t        of Goods To the extent possible, bid packages for the procurement
of furiu, equipment, vehicles, supplies and maerls required under the project would be
grouped into homogenous packages in quamtities that would achieve economies of scale and timely

and effident delivery (and inllion). ICB procedures in accordance with the "Guidelines for
Procmment under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 would be
applied to all bid packages estmated to cost more than US$200,000 eqWuvalent eac, to an
aggregate of US$500,000, with the exception of legal materials, books, journals and software
which due to their highly technical content and the unique nature of the texs (e.g. civil codes of
counties) wil be prcred through direct contracting. Items or groups of items esdmated to cost
less than the equivalet of US$100,000 per contract, up to an agge    amount not to exceed the
equivalent of US$400,000 Oess whatever amouns are procured through direct contracting as
noted above) may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of price
quotations solicited from a list of at least three suppliers eligible under die Guidelines, In
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Association. Goods shall be exempted from pre-
shipment price inspection by a third-party inspection firm. In the procmement of goods in
accordance with the procedures described above, goods man   in Mozambique may be
grated a margin of preference in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of paragrhs
2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines and paragraphs I through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto.
106.          S      O     S   to be financed by IDA, including consultants for technical
and managerial assistance, and studies (US$4.3 milion equivalent), will be procured in
accordance with 'Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as an Executing Agency" of August 1981. Details for the technical assistance and
oudine terms of reference are given in Appendix 5 and are expanded in the implementation
manuals. The use of standard technical assistance contracts (see para. 104) should reduce the
delays of up to three months now being experienced in contract clearmce by the Ministry of
Fiae. The local consultancy market will be srnghened as the project will provide a number
of opportunities for local consultants.
107.        One tecical assistance contrct, to be financed jointy by SIDA, would be
procured via a sole-source conact with FUNDAP, the firm which is curreny providing
assistance to the ongoing Personnel Adminison program, and which was originally selected by
SIDA according-to ICB procedures acceptable to IDA. Total contract value, over the five years
of the project, amount to about US$3 million, of which IDA will finance rougWy 40%, or
US$1.2 million. Sole-source contracting is justified in this case as continu  is essentia to ensure
the success of this program, SIDA and IDA are jointy financing the contract, and the GOM has
explicitly requested that the FUNDAP team contiue their work at MAE. It bas been agreed with
SI)A and with the borrower hat the terms of the extension of this contract will be in accordance
with World Bank uidelines.
108.        TOM=  Training proposals to be submitted under the Management
Strgthening Fund (US$3 mfllion) would be reviewed on a case by case basis. Appendix I
shows the criteria established for the use of this fumd. Procurement under these approved sub-
projects would be done in accordance with IDA guidelines. Other training to be financed by IDA
,including local training courses, semiars, workshops, study tours, and fellowships (US$7.3
million equivalent) would be procured using regular Government procedures, subject to prior IDA
review and approval.
109.        IDA Review of Bid Psae and Contract Awards Bidding awards for goods
and conact valued at over US$150,000 equivalent will be subject to prior review by IDA, as
will all consultat conutr   and training proposas. This represents about 98% of IDA fiaing
for the project. Smaller packages will be subject to random post-awatd review by IDA. All
project units will therefore be required to keep fu proemi do eion tle for access
by IDA as requested.

110. lhe project management wit within the MiWstry of Justice and DAF within MAE
would be responsible for the procuring  g'oods, consultants' services and training activities for
their rvspecve components. Intensive training for key staff in IDA procurement procedu   will
be given durig a three day course in September, 1992, with follow-up taiig durn project
implementation as needed. Staff from all agencies pardtipated in an intrductory workshop on
IIDA proment guideli  given in May, 1992, shorty aftr project appraisal. During the
project launch workshop fiurher training on procurement guidelines would also be given by MDA.
l11.         Since the first ountry imple ion review, during which delays in
procurement decisions were brought forward as one of the major obstacles to efficient country
implementation, the following activities have been Iniated:
(a)   lTe Roads and Coasta Shipping project caried out a country procurement
asssment, co-financed by SIDA and staffed by ITC. The complete report is
expected by the end of FY93.
(b)   A review of cona approval thresholds and precedures was carried out during
1991/92. This review and standard contcs are to be submitted to IDA under
the agreed financi mangement plan of the Economic Recovery Credit.
(c)    Duing the mid-term reiew of the Economic and Financia Technical Assisa
Project (Credit No. 2066-MOZ) in July 1992, a proposal to strengthen the
department reviewing draft contracts in MINPIN would be considered.
(d)   Upon effectiveness of the Agriculul Services Project, scheduled to occur by
end-September, 1992, the Miistry of Finance will be obligated to reduce the
clearance period for draft contracts to a maximum of tirty days.

112.         Dibsm     fom the IDA credits will cover the percentage of total
expenditures as indicated in Schedule B.
113.         Ihe IDA credits will be disbursed over a period of about seven years (Schedule B)
and major invest    have been progmed for a period of five years. The project is expectd
to be completed on December 31, 1998, and the closing date is June 30, 1999. All applications
to withdraw proceeds from the IDA credits will be fully documented, except for (a) conracts,
purchas orders for goods and services or overseas training prgms valued at less than
US$25,000 equivalent, (b) local training programs; and, (c) force account and operating cost.
For these expenditures, disbu ntwfll be made against ceriied staments of expendiue

114.         Seed Aequnt In order to ensure that funds for the proje3 will be avalable
as needed, two Special Ptoject Accounts, one for each component, will be established by
Govemment with a commercial bank acceptable to the Asociation. Decenalization from the
Bank of Mozambique and by component will forestall unmeceary delays in di  of
fiuds. Component speciad accounts will receive deposits from the credit for finang eligible

projct expendiures (for item  described in the above section D). Maximum values for each
account have been esdmated on the basis of three months of expenditures during the highest
disburing semester: US$450,000 (Legal), and US$400,000 (MAE). However, experience shows
that such high values are unnecessary during the first year of the project. Therefo, Initial
amounts equal to onehldf the maximum value allowed will be deposited by IDA after receipt and
approval of withdrawal applications. Replenishment applications for the Special Accounts wi1l be
submitted monthly or as required by each implementing agency and will be accompanied by the
fll documeon except for items eligible for disbursement on the basis of certified st s
of expditure (SOE). Supporting documentation will be retained by project executing agencies
and will be available for review as requestd by the IDA supervision missions and project
auditors.
115.        Audit The Goveanment's performance in adii  project accouns in IDA
projects has not been generally satisary. Delays in carying out audits that were experienced
in the previous years of the projects are now being overcome as part of a larger effort to
eliminate the bacldog for all IDA projects in Mozambique. Assurances have been obined from
Government that all oject accounts and Sgecial Accou will be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA and that all audited accounts. together with the auditors' report will
be submitted IQ the ]IDA not latwr than nine months afte the end of each Government fiscal year.
In auditng project accounts, the auditors will provide a separate opinion on SOEs and on the
procedures and intnal controls involved in their preparation. Project special accounts will also
be audited. In the case of MAE, the audit may cover MAE's total program with SIDA and IDA,
and probably also other donors, in addtion to the normal IDA required audit. Similarly, the
Government has agreed to annual fincial and performance audits of the salary incentive fund.
If practical, a similar effort to incorporate other donors' programs with the WG institutions into
one audit might be organized.

116.        An I-Ministerial Committee (aC), established by the Prime Minister and
presided over by the Minister of State Admnstration, will be responsible for the coordination of
the Capacity Building Program in Mozambique, of which the proposed project and the companion
project, Capacity Building Human Resources Development, make up two elements. Co-presidents
of the Committee will be the Miniter of Planning and the Minister of Finance. Its members will
be the Minists of Educadon, Justice, and Labor. The Rector of UEM and the Attorney General
can be asked to join the IC. The IC will be responsible for formulation and coordination of the
Capacity Building Struegy and for ensuring consistency and strengthening linkages among the
four components of the two companion projects. Furthermore, the Committee will ensure that the
projects adequatey reflect and respond to the emerging policy changes m support of the caaciy
building process in Mozambique, particularly in the areas of incentives and housing. The
planning unit in MAE will act as the technical secretariat for the Committee, which proposes to
meet on a monthy basis, at least during the fis year of project implemention.
117.        In the spirit of building management capacity among the various instutions
nolved in project implementation, responsibility for implementation will be devolved as much as
possible, with the locus of management effort being close to the direct beneficiaries. In practice,
theefore, the Ministy of Justice and the UEM Law Faculty will take the lead in the executing of



- 40-
the leg  strengthening component; and the Mlinity of State Administration will oversee the
implementation of the public administaion and management improvement component.
118.         The MOJ is responsible for overall coordination and implementation of the 1"
component. The Working Group will oversee timely implementtion of project actvities. The
WO is chaired by the representative of MOW in his capacity as component manager and co-chaird
by the Dean of the Law School, as alternge component manager. Decisions of the WO and day
to day m    ent wi be arried out by Q) a Project Manager (5 yes); (ii) Deputy Poject
Mager/Acoountat (5 years); (Qii) Administrve Officer/Proceat (5 years) and (iv) a
bilingual secreuy (5 years). As a condition of projet effectiveness, tiis mersonnel woAld have
be  bired To assist the WG in identifying legal resources and consultants not available locally
and to coordinate with foreign legal institations and bilateral or multilateral donors, resident legal
advisory services wil be provided by an expert, group of exper, or a local firm on a retainer
basis to be selected by the WG in accordance with Bank guidelines for employment of
consultants. Selection of a project advisor is a condition of e1htjveness.
119.         Technical responsibility for management of the "ic an    component
will lie with the planning unit in MAE. The unk will be responsible for developing new policies
and programs for civil service reform, in the areas of pay and incenives, job grading, career
strctures and promotion, recruitment, etc. The unit wfll also manage the management training
fund to be established under the project. Day to day implementation responsibility will rest with
DAF. Credit funds will strengthen this already exting departnent within MAE. An accountant
will be recruited to take responsibility for donor projects and to deputize for the Chief of the
PAP. An assistant accountant will back up the accountant and have particular responsibility for
liaising with the MWistry of Finance and with the MAE component managers on the capacity
building project's financial plans and expenditures. A supplies officer will head up the DAP's
supplies section, including responsibility for all procurement under the IDA and SIDA projects
within MAE. A conmputerized budgetary control system wil be established within MAE's DAP,
iluding the accounting for the IDA and SIDA projects. To assist in the revision of PAP
procedures, to develop the computerized system, to train DAP and other MAE staff in the
opeon and use of the system and the reports, and to supervise overall implenion, the
project will finace a local advisor for a period of two years, together with the necessary
computer equipment and supplies. Short-term, local training in accoung, procurement and
supplies management will also be provided for DAP staff. As a condition of effecdveness for the
project two staff in the Wlicy unit will have been hired, as will the accounta  for DAp. MA's
planning unit has been estabished, and terms of reference have developed for its functions as for
the consultants assisting the u-nit The legal evidence of the creation of MAE's planning unit will
be furnished to IDA three months after effectiveness.

121.         For the two components, local project preparadon teams were formed in mid-1991
to develop proposals consonant with previous implementation experience and realistic
Implementation capability. Project design has reflect lessons learned from previous
Iplementation experience in Mozambique. This approach to preparation was also a leaning
experience for the local teams and helped to build a sense of ownership and motivation, which is



- 41 -
expected to carry on intD the lmplementation phase. Consequently, the various implementing
agencies are ready to st  up the project, with a mnmber of activities expected to go forward
during the pro-effectiveness period, utilizing PPF financing.
122.        IDA has granted a PPF advance of US$750,000, in February 1992, for project
preparatory acvities for both Capacity BuUding Projects.
123.    -     he MOJ and Law Facuty have used the PPF to sponsor a major planning
woop for the Ind atrtb         comonent, and key implementing persomnnel are expected to
attend short courses abroad during the pre-effectiveness period, as part of their triing and
orientation. A second worshop will be held prior to effectiveness to refine a detailed plan of
activities for the iniial year of project implemention. As long as appropriate technical
assistance is recruited in a timely manner, the WG wil be ready to start implementing the
component at effectiveness. II broad terms, during the first two years of the project, the WG
will refine its stregic approach and determine the role of the legal profession in the Mozmbican
context and update it on an anmual basis. During that period, lawyers will be exposed to other
legal systems through short-term training and conferences abroad. The framework tning
program. for lawyers, paraegals and staff of the legal instiions has been defined, and its
implementation wil start during the second year of project. The legal data-bases wiUl be in place
during the third year of the project. Support to the legal libraries will start during the first year
and coinue throughout. Support to legal reform and employment of highly specialized legal
services to assist the Law School will be provided periodically during implementation, as the need
anses.
124.        In the area of "ic adminision many of the proposed civil service reform
activities are already ongoing with SIDA fuding and major consultan inputs from FUNDAP,
and will simply continue or be augmented/accelerated with IDA support under the project. PPF
unds may be utilized by the Ministy of Labour to obtain assistance in defining a vocational
tri  sttegy. Regarin management training, severa discrete programs have already been
Idlenfied (e.g., short course on project fnacial appraisal, distance education degree program in
public adminitration), and are sufficiently advanced to get under way before, or coincident with,
project fectiveness. Other manageme  training will be identified and approved during the
implementation period, at the rate of approximately 2-3 new training activities per year, or a total
of 10-15 for the life of the project.
125.         While both components have advanced in the preparation of their first year plans,

126.         Agm ions. As a wndition gf negotiations, the Governmemt prepared and
revIewed joidy with IDA the draft Capacity Building Strategy. During   , it was
agreed witi Government ta (a) by October 31 of each year of project implementation, annual
progress reports on the disbursement profile, fincing plan, and fiscal consequences of the
proposed salary incentive fund would be submitted to IDA, accompanied by an audit report
prepared by independent auditors; (b) by the end of 1994, Government will complete and submit
to IDA the draft plan for revising civi service career structures to include provincial and disict
experience as promodon criteria; an incentive policy to improve attractiveness of district posu;
and that prompdy thereafter, approve said plan, taking into account the recommendations made by
IDA, and take all necary admnstative and instutonal measures to implement said plan; (c)
by Novmber 30 of each year of proJect implementation, together with IDA, conduct an annual
Project implementaton review, with annual progress reports furnished to IDA by October 31 of

each year; and (d) by no lrwher November 30 of 1995 cary out with IDA a mid-term Project
Implementataon review to update the Capacity Building Strategy and Capacity Building Action
Plan and review the Project objectives taking into account the updated Ste  and Action Plan.
liere are three condition gf eD&IM: (i) Key project implementation stare employed; (ii)
The Project Advisor for the legal componen has been selected, with experience and qualifications
satisfactory to the Association; and (di) tat Government has furnished documentary evidenca
satisfactory to the Association, certifying Government's formal approval of its Capacity Building
Action Plan. Conditions of diSbursWm for traiing will be the completion and approval by IDA
of traiinig programs for the first year of the Project, which shal include, inter alia, the
following: (i) type and number of trainees; (1i) location and instituon where trainig will be
received; (iii) objectives and length of taining activity; and (iv) estimated budget.
C. Moiodng. Roring. and  raluaton
127.         As mentioned in paras. 117-118 above, each componen lead agency has
designated a small group to serve as component manager, with responsibility for monitoring
implementation. As part of the project launch exercise in late 1992, these component
managers/management teams will develop clear indicators for monhtoring progress (input, process,
output, and impact indicators) on a six-moantly basis and will prepare trial formats for reporting
semi-nual implementation progress. These indicators should be closely linked to the
quanitative targets estblished for each component. Progress reports will also include
comprehensive financial statements covering actua and planned expenditures, and the stats of
IDA payments/reimbursements.
128.         Annual project implementation reviews will be conducted in order to facilitate
effective coordination of the project components and allow for mexible responses to changing
circusances in Mozambique. A    es were obained from the Borower duda
tx not later than October 31 from 1993 on. each component will nreoaen an  levaluation of
X39ect hV10101tho and ih?act to bes djM$sed dgthe auma proect mlnntio
ane. Evaluation wil take ino4 account indicators and crtera defined duriag the project launch
workshop. During each anmnal review, each component will refine detailed work plans for
activities programmed for the subsequent year. Partcular attention wfll be given to evaluatg the
impact of the salary incentive fimd's impact on civil service staffing and performance.
129.         To ensr dtt a complete stock-taking of project impl  n perfmance and
expected development impact is carried out during the project lifetime, the Government and IMA
(with likely partiipaton of other associated donor partners such as SIDA, DANIDA and USAID)
will conduct a mid-term evaluation of the project in the second semester of 1995. The results of
such an in-depth review will help to make mid-course improvement in implementation. 3]
Borrower Agreed dung negAtions tIat not later than November 30, 1995. an in depth-
9valuation of project implementation and impact will be prepared by each comonent as Ip  for
discussion during the mid-term project review. These reports, in addition to evauating the
indicators and criteria as defined above, should Include any proposals for reallocadon of credit
funds.
130.         A supervision plan, including mission scheduling and staffing needs, for IDA
supervision missions, is provVied in the Capacity Building Human Resources Development SAR
(port No. 10371, Annex V.7).

131.         The Governm  will prepare a project compledon report within six monts of the
completion date, based upon a fomat to be agreed with the IDA.
V. Benefits and Ush
132.         The                 component will enable Mozambique to better define and
stucture the legal profession and related instittions, and will expose senior legal practitioners to
other legal systems and teaching techniques which will be applied in Mozambique. The
compoe  will also improve the training and professional competence of lawyes, magistraes,
and other legal workers in the country: altogether, about 200 judges, 300 court clerks, and 600
administra   staff will receive training; roughly 70 law teachers will attend courses on legal
isrction; and 120 pracdcing lawyers will benefit from refreshe training on specialized legal
subjects.
133.         The Vblic ad ministoe component of the project wil contribute towards
improving the ability of the civil service to attract, retain, develop and effectively utlize qualified
and expeienced personel. Through spporfting policy and procedural reform i the areas of
caeer development, training and incentives, the project wiUl encourage long-term commitment to
a civil service career. The functional and staffng reviews and improvements  the personnel
administraton systems of sectoral ministries, will promote greater efficiency in the use of the
scarce human and financal resources. Ihe establishment of a Policy Unit within MAE wiUl
increase MAE's capacity to lead and direct a continuing program of civil service reform as well
a to coordinate the implementation of the Government's overall capaciy building strs.zv.
134.         As the need for legal expert  grows in Mozambique, the few active professionals
may gradually leave government agencies, addig to the burden of those who remain in the public
sector. Ihere s therefore a risk that the members of the WG for the     wll cange
frequently, undemining continy and adversely affectg project imple ion. To offset this
lsk, the parting institutions wil be required to sele repmt reprsentatives within a
spfied time period. In addidon, an agrment has been reached establishing full tme
management staff within MO0 to carry out the decisions of the Working Group.
135.         Similarly, the VW&            component facs the risJ that MAEs
responsibilIties for civil service reform, deentralization to local governments, and coordnatng
the govenmen's overall capacity building effort, will overburden the Ministy's limited capacity
and lead to delays in implemeon. Ihis has been taken into account in project design, by
developing a joint program with SIDA to ensure close coordination of activities and a single set of
objectves and priorities, and by establishing a MAE policy unit (bolstered by technical assistance
in the early years) to develop clear strategies to guide the public sector reform process and
coordit  donor actvites. Regading the implemention of the salay incentive fund it is
possible civil svice payscales may not be adjusted over tme to allow for the gradual
Incororation of incentives into regula salay streams. Another risk is that iuicient fimancing
wil be available from the donor community to ensure confinuy in the provision of nenives.
To mitigate these risks, the project will provide ta   assistance to monitor the performance of
the incentive fund and to coordinat its implemention with ongoing reforms in civil service
career structures. Regular donor coordination meetings will be held to help mobilize a steady
flow of resources;

1.           As a follow-p to the analysis and recommendations of the Public Py and
mNlWOM  Sector dy and the CsWci Bul  S M                GOM e.eveloped a proposal
for a salay incentive find for selected categories of staff in the public adrmistraion. The
proposal is based on a further study carried out in December 1991 by a working group consiting
of staff of MAE, CNP, MLdabour, and MinFin (with the assistae of a Norwegian consultan).
During this period over 400 staff were interviewed, and salaries and benefits in comparator
o rgani on collected.
2.           The study's recommendation divided the public admion staff by levels of
risk of losing them. Those most at risk, consist of the university trained (about 1600) and middle
level technicians with over 6 years of experience (some 400). In addition, there is a small but
crucial str c group (mimium some 30 staft) whose presence in government has to be
secured to enable the government to cotnue with economic and ocial policy development.
3.           The ntrview results show that a combination of monetary incentives and access
to housing would be the most motivating ones. For the strategic group, access to paid home and
study leave travel was also considered.
4.           The proposal calls for donor financing of US$10 million anmnally, but the
breakdown of the use of these funds for the differe  incentives is stUl approximate. Salary
Icentives for the at-riskw group would amount to maximum US$6.8 million; incentives to the
stategic gop  might amount to about US$1 million, and access to housing through
constructon of 50 to 100 houes in the provices only as well as some contingencies would make
up the remainder. More precise calculations on the last thrae lines in this US$10 million budget
are forthcoming.
5.           The salary incentive would be based on a formula multiplying actua salary by the
points obtained on a scae. Points are assigned for academic qualifications, length of service,
level of responsibilty and location of service. Those outside Maputo would receive at least 10
sdditioal points, out of a maximum of 82.5 points.
6.           This salay icentive would be retroactive to June 1992, paid in meticais, and
adjusted automaically when government salary cales are adjusted. The sectors with a high
cocnrto of staff who would benefit are, in descending order: education, health, agriculture,
watr and construcdon. Their staff make up about two-thirds of the staff 'at riskc and their
salaries would be doubled or in some categories tripled.
7.           Next se    GOM proposal was accepted by the National Commimion of Salaries
and Prices in June, 1992. GOM sent al interested donors a letter requesting responses to
commence the financing arrangements. Donors have requested (a) refining of cos esimates,
espeily on the distribution  between provincial and Maputo/Matola based staff; and (b)
aboration of an implementation mechanism in NFIN that is transparent, easy to audit
annually (one audit to seve all donors jointly), and ca accomodate donor budget support
allocatins fom differat sources. GOM will also have to organize its own budget support, e.g.
aountrvue from BOP, that would bame to be available regularly as donor flows might be
irregular at first

8.           The proposed salary incentive fund has been included as one of the actions to be
taken und,er the Capacity Building Strategy, Program and, this project. It Is shown as a project
activity which is fully co-financed by other donors, as IDA is unable to finance recurrent salary
expenditues which top up existing civil service staff. The inclusion of the salary incentive fund
In the project enables some donors to contribute to the fund outside their country frame using
multilateral trust fund arrangements. Other donors, such as Switzertand, could disburse part of
their balance of payment support through this project.
