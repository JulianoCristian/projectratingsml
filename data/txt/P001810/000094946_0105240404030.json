Despite the weaknesses of the project at entry,\n            because of the Bank's efforts to address difficult\n            issues in an innovative fashion, and the satisfactory\n            performance during supervision, the Bank's overall\n            performance is rated satisfactory. Overall Borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Lessons learned include the\n            following: Capacity constraints in Mozambique are severe;\n            the Bank should therefore guard against overestimating\n            Borrower capacity to implement by making implementation\n            arrangements simple and objectives and outputs practical.\n            Where coordination and leadership in the Government and the\n            implementing agencies is weak, managers at the technical\n            level are unlikely to commit themselves to a project beyond\n            its use in supporting activities in which they are already\n            engaged. Capacity building projects should be designed\n            within a framework of long-term Bank commitment (such as is\n            now possible with an APL). Where implementation capacity is\n            especially scarce, projects should ensure that local staff\n            have needed skills, and that dedicated personnel for the\n            project are identified and mbilized. Post-war reconstruction\n            projects should distinguish between emergency activities and\n            activities leading to long-term reform."}, "docdt": "2001-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
