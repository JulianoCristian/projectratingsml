Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Operations\n            Project were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            strength of the PRSC instrument in addressing a wide-range\n            of cross-cutting themes can also be its greatest weakness if\n            such a program needs to be prematurely terminated for any\n            reason. Government ownership is crucial for proper design,\n            implementation and results. Quality time and effort put into\n            project formulation and preparation can put a project on a\n            sound footing and minimize the need for mid-course\n            corrections. Resources committed to ESW can strongly\n            underpin project design and facilitate better\n            implementation, especially where data on baseline conditions\n            are inadequate to begin with. A project's scope and\n            content should be matched well with the commitment and\n            capacity displayed by the borrower. The Bank should retain\n            the option of reducing the quantum of a DPL prior to\n            effectiveness, if performance falls considerably short of\n            initially and mutually agreed levels. Finally, where reform\n            in vital area is slow, the Bank should continue to be\n            engaged and serve as a facilitator."}, "docdt": "2007-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
