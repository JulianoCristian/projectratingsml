                   a verifiable program of implementation.          The project is also
                   supporting the Government in improving planning and budgeting
                   processes in an increasingly inclusive and efficient manner. Further,
                   the project supports the decentralization process by adding to the pool
                   of funds available for timely and predictable fiscal support to local
                   governments.    Finally, PRSC preparation has reduced transaction
                   costs by accelerating donor harmonization aroundthe PRSPprocess.
Risks              Key risks to the program include those associated with the one-off
                   transitional costs of devolving to local woreda administrations,
                   implementing the private and financial sector reform agenda and
                   building private sector capacity, developing and retaining skilled
                   workers inthe absence of a viable public sector salariedwage policy,
                   weak enforcement of guidelines for resettlement/access to new land
                   program, continued reporting lags in actual expenditures at primary
                   service levels, congestion effects o f several programs involving local
                   service cadres (e.g. health extension workers, teachers, agriculture
                   extension agents), and the absence of demand-side pressures from
                   civil society and citizens. There are a number of risks that cannot be
                   readily mitigated by the Bank, including the potential for re-
                   emergence o f conflict relating to the EthiopiaEritrea border, drought,
                   and a lack o f availability of donor funds for Joint Budget Support,
                   which could affect the availability of financing from the Bank if IDA
                   grantresources are notavailable.

1.       The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board in April 2003 put
forward a series of annual Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSCs) as the key instrument
for the Bank to assist the Government of Ethiopia in implementing its PRSP, known as the
Sustainable Development and PovertyReduction Program (SDPRP). PRSC I(US$ 123 million
IDA grant), the first inthis series, was approved by the Bank's Executive Directors onFebruary
17, 2004 in conjunction with the Board's discussion of the first Annual Progress Report (APR)
of the SDPRP. This Program Document lays out the context, case for, and areas of policy
emphasis for the second PRSC inthis series, inthe amount ofUS$130million.

2.       Inthe early 1990safter anewregime tookover the reins ofGovernment, anambitious
structural and state transformation process commenced. Reforms were launched to stimulate
agricultural production and greater private sector participation in markets, and a new emphasis
was placed on the provision of primary education and health services inrural areas. Farm-gate
prices rose, productivity increased, production expanded, gross enrollment rates increased
rapidly, and infant mortality rates registered improvements. The state also moved decisively
towards a federal system, empowering first the Regional Governments and as of the last two
years, the woredas (districts) inthe four largest Regions andmunicipalities. A governance reform
program ranging across budgetary and human resource management systems was launched to
improve public sector efficiency and effectiveness at every level of the system of Government.
In2001the Government articulateditsstrategy for continuedreformandprogressinits SDPRP,
encompassing areas that are critical to the achievement of Ethiopia's goals for growth and
poverty reduction, andthe MDGs.

A.       Growth, PovertyandVulnerability

(i)      Growth, Poverty and HouseholdWell-Being

3.       Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world. Per capita incomes inEthiopia
are no higher today than they were 40 years ago (Figure 1). This reflects, and is also reflectedin,
very low levels of humanandphysical capital -for instance, health, education, roads, irrigation,
electricity, and marketing facilities - as well as low resilience to recurrent shocks.       While
average incomes have not risen much over the long term, growth rates have nonetheless varied
significantly over time in the face of policy and exogenous factors. The period of the Dergwas
particularly damaging for growth and human development. Incontrast impressive growth was
attained in the first half of the 199Os, although it slowed to only 1% by the latter part. Yet the
sources of growthduringthe 1990swere weak, dependent inpart onpublic sector expansion, and
particularly vulnerable to terms of trade, climatic and other shocks.

4.       According to the forthcoming Poverty Assessment, the evidence paints a picture of
limited decline in consumption poverty incidence since 1992. Rural poverty incidence
remained largely constantwith signs o f a 1to 2 percentagepoint decrease over the decade of the
1990s. The government estimated rural poverty incidence in 1999 at 45 percent. Overall,
consumption inequality inEthiopia remains low (Gini of 0.29), though inequality inurban areas
i s on the rise. There i s a growing consensus that poverty incidence inurbanareas i s increasing,
The reasonsbehind these broad trends are largely found inthe disappointing performanceof the
agricultural sector, which barely kept up with rural population growth. Whatever poverty
reduction occurred in rural areas probably resulted from improved access to services and
infrastructure. In urban areas, growth in the service sector, which was estimated at about 7
percent per year and which helled overall economic growth, was substantially erodedby urban
population growth (estimated at 4.7 percent) following rural-urban and small town-big town
migration. Moreover, only a small percentageo f the urban population appears to havebenefited
from      urban      economic
growth, as indicated by the                               Figure 2: Poverty Headcount
                                                                                               _I-_______

incidence     was    officially
estimated at 37 percent in
1999.    At current        rates,
Ethiopia i s far behind the
requirements for meetingthe

would take a sustainable
growth rate of about 5

5.       High vulnerability to shocks, persistent effect of shocks. Many people move in and
out o fpoverty, often intandemwith annualrainfall patterns.Moreover, there are clear signs that
the negative effect of severe rainfall shocks often persists over time. For example, 10 percent
lower rainfall was found to reduceconsumption growth ratesby 1percentfour to five years later.
Those areas where rainfall i s on average low also tend to experiencemuch more volatile rainfall
patterns, further exacerbating the effects o f low average rainfall. Harvest failure proves to be
especially harmful for child growth and female primary school enrolment, thereby permanently
damaging the earningprospects of the next generation. Despite the Government's and donors'
efforts to protect productive assets duringrepeateddroughts, many households may have fallen
into poverty traps from which it may take several years to recover. The 2004 Risk and
Vulnerability Assessment argues that more effective management of risk will require enhancing
rural growth by improving the functioning o f land, fertilizer and grain markets, rural credit and
saving, diversification of income sources, increasing public investments in roads, fighting
disease, expanding the coverage of the food security programs, protecting householdassets, and
increasing the productive elemento f safetynet transfers.

6.       The highlevelof vulnerability increases the challenge of meeting the MDGs. About
5 million people are chronically food insecure, and 10-15 million are at risk of starvation in
especially bad years. The Risk and Vulnerability study found that 70% o f the population has a
greater than 50% chance of falling into poverty. Complicating the situation further i s the fact
that risks tend to be covariate, meaning that they impact entire communities or networks of
individuals at the sametime, thus loweringthe population's ability to withstand shocks.

7.       Rapid population growth contributes to poverty. Ethiopia's population growth rate
during2000-2005 was 2.32% per annum, comparedto the East African average of 2.04 for the
sameperiod. Ithas apopulation density which is twice the averagefor Sub-SaharanAfrica. The
density is greatest in the highlands where, as a result, soil fertility is rapidly declining, and
average plot sizes have decreased in many cases below the minimum amount required for
subsistence. Ifthe rate o fpopulation growth does not decline inthe coming years, it i s expected
that the population of Ethiopia will double in about 25 years, affecting savings and capital
formation, andheighteningthe challengeo fachievingthe MDGs.

8.       Key indicators of household welfare and service delivery have risen rapidly in the
past decade, but the MDGswill be difficult to meet. Extreme stunting(height for age more
than 3 standard deviations from the mean) o f Ethiopian children below 5 years o f age, declined
from 44% to 31%inthe 1995 to 2000 period. The grossprimary enrollment rate nearly doubled
from 33% in 1990 to 62% in 2000. Under-5 mortality declined from 190 to 174 per 1,000
between 1990 and2000, a rate of decline that is nonethelessfar below that required to reach the
MDG. Under-5 mortality ratesvary widely, ranging from 148.6 per 1000inurbanareasto 192.5
inruralareas. The averagedistanceto animprovedwater sourcedroppedsharply from2.4 kmin
1995 to 0.8 km in 1999, while the distance to transport services declined only marginally from
17.2 kmto 16.2 kmover the same period. Despite the improvements, preliminary analysis bythe
Bank shows that at the current rate of progress, Ethiopia may only achieve 1 o fthe MDGtargets
(Table 1).

(ii) Long-runGrowth

9.      A durable reduction in poverty by 2015 requires high growth performance            ... The
forthcoming CEM has developed growth scenarios which indicate that when growth i s broad-
based (a growth elasticity o f poverty o f -1.8), poverty would be expected to fall from 42.3
percent in 2002 to 26.1 percent in 2015, which corresponds to a 40 percent reduction in the
number ofthe poor. However, with a narrower distribution ofthe benefits ofgrowth, where the
growth elasticity o f poverty is -0.5-close to the actual estimate for Ethiopia-the   povertyrate
falls by less than 6 percentage points. The CEM further finds that to significantly accelerate
poverty reduction,per capita GDP growthratesbetween2.3 to 3.8 percent per year arerequired.

10.     ...anda   balanced growth strategy. Inany scenario, agriculture will continue to play a
key role in Ethiopia's structural transformation given the large proportion o f Ethiopians whose
livelihoods depend an it. Reaching the goal o fhalving 1990poverty levels by 2015 will not be
possible, for example, without buoyant agricultural growth o f 4.6% per annum. The requisite
levels o f growth will necessitatedevelopment inboth highpotential and so-called low potential
areas. Agricultural growth, however, must be complementedby-and linked to-the            growth of
the urbanprivate sector andimproved export performance. The analysisbeing conductedas part
o f the PA, the CEM, and the forthcoming rural development strategy by the Bank (FY05), all
point to the importance o f balancing growth in farm and non-farm rural- and urban-economies;
raising productivity and in general raising the tradability o f all commodities by reducing
transaction costs; balance between supply push (improved service delivery and more efficient
inputdelivery)anddemandpull(generatingincomes,reducingmarketingcosts); needtopromote
large-scale commercial activities and smallholder productivity; and investing in irrigation
infrastructure but also addressing constraints in rain-fed agriculture (where the majority of the
poor live). A key element o fthe strategy to raise land and labor productivity is also to facilitate
factory mobility   - to allow people to voluntarily move to rural non-agricultural vocations, to
lowlands andother geographically attractive areas, to small towns andurbancenters.

11.     Commercializationof the ruraleconomy is, thus, at the core of the SDPRP, which i s
expected to energize rural growth and also stimulate urban growth via multiplier effects. The
principal challenge to achieving this i s increasing agricultural productivity-of both land and
labor. Public sector investments in capacity building (educational attainment in general, and
applied training in agriculture inparticular) for the rural population, in agricultural research, in
agricultural extension, inmarketing(inputs andoutputs), the developmento fcooperatives, andin
water and environmental management, are central to the Government's strategy to increase
productivity andpromote rural growth, bothon- andoff-farm.



                                                 6

12.        An important theme, developed in the forthcomingCEM, and connected with the
current strategy of "markefizing" agriculture,is to find ways to increase the urbadrural
linkages, partly by promotingthe growth of ruraltowns across the country, and investing
in high potential areas. In addition to targeted investments in economic infrastructure in
lowland areas, both the CEM and the Poverty Assessment note that key risks affecting these
areas include malaria and the prevalence of tse-tse fly borne disease lethal to livestock. Both
diseases need to be addressed as a means o funlockingthe potential for labor mobilityandprivate
investment inthese regions. Government policy to strengthen the investment climate byreducing
administrative transaction costs, reducing uncertainty in rural and urban land markets, and
improving credit availability will also be vital. Several regional governments have recently
moved forward on this agenda by passing legislation to enhance land tenure security in rural
areas. Even in the low potential areas-where                                food insecurity levels are high-there       is
significant scope to increase agricultural productivity by investing insoil and water conservation
activities to reverse environmental degradation; reducing risk for small farmers which would
enable greater use of fertilizer and improved seeds; public investment inroads and other market
infrastructure; and removingthe distortionary effects of emergency food aid by movingas much
as possible to predictable, productive andcash-based safety nets.

B.         Macroeconomic Developments

(i) RecentPerformance

13.        Ethiopia's GDP growth rebounded sharply in 2003/04. The real rate of growthrose
from -4.0 percent in2002/03 to 11.6 percent in2003/04, owing to a substantial recovery of the
agriculture sector, which grew by 18.9 percent. Evidence also points towards stronger private
sector growth, with large increases in credit extended to the private sector and an increase in
private investment as a share of GDP. This recovery follows two major consecutive negative

shocks, namely the worst drought intwenty years, and large declines inthe terms oftrade for key
commodities, particularly coffee.

14.     Despite the highly variable growth experienced and the exogenous shocks, the
Ethiopian Government has continued to maintain macroeconomic stability. The IMF's
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) remains on track all the quantitative indicators
and performance criteria under the PRGF for end-March, 2004, the structural performance
criteria for end-June, 2004, as well as all the benchmarks have been met. In particular, the
implementation ofthe CBErestructuring plan has progressed as planned. Inthe past six reviews,
there has been only one request for a waiver - which is an unusually good track record. Inthe
latest review of the program in September 2004, the Fund Board assessed the performance as
"good" (as opposed to satisfactory), thanks to the rebound in growth and progress on key
structural reforms.

15.     Annual average inflation declined from 15.1 percent in 2002/03 to 9.0 percent in
2003/04, a lesser improvement than the 5.5 percent, initially projected. This canbe traced to
three reasons associated with cereal prices. First, the Ethiopian Grain Trading Enterprise
(EGTE) announced floor prices for the cereal price support scheme, which probably had a
signaling impact on market prices. Second, some donor agencies have shifted fkom purchasing
imported to domestic cereals, which has likely increased domestic demand.               And third,
warehousing facilities have been introduced for farmers, which has enabled farmers to store a
portion of their harvests for sale when prices are no longer at post-harvest lows. Nonfood
inflation, at 4.2 percent in M a y 2004, is also higher than projected, largely because of a rise in
the price of imports anda nominal depreciation ofthe Birr.

16.      The Birr exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was fairly stable during 2003/04,but
recently depreciated by about 8% in nominal terms and 5% in real terms (figures as of March
2004), due to two reasons. First, thanks to a goodharvest, the National Bank of Ethiopia W E )
increasednet foreign assets above the planned level inorder to builda reserve cushion for future
shocks. Second, the NBE followed the dollar's slide against the euro and allowed a nominal
depreciation of the Birr. The real effective depreciation helped improve competitiveness, which
could have, contributed to the recovery. (IMF Staff Report, August 2004).

17.      Exports grew strongly. Export earnings in 2003/04 were $1,369 million, 20 percent
higher than inthe previous year, drivenby a large increase inexports ofnon-factor services anda
rebound in coffee earnings. Despite the increase in the value o f coffee exports' this year, the
share o f coffee in total export earnings has been steadily declining inrecent years-from     60-70
percent of the value o f merchandise exports in the mid-1990s to around 40 percent at present.
The importbillincreased by 21 percent over 2002/03, reflecting strong economic growth and the
increase inthe price of imports including fie1 and capital goods.

18.      Onthe fiscal front, the Government continuedto remain prudent. Basedon2003/04
outturns, the fiscal deficit (including grants) is estimated at 4.8 percent o f GDP, lower than the
programmed 7.1 percent of GDP. The lower than expected deficit performance was mostly due to
higher than expected revenues. Similarly, the deficit excluding grants, at about 12.6percent of
GDP, was lower than the programmed 14.1 percent of the GDP. Domestic revenue increased
thanks to strong import tax revenue, as import growth and improved customs administration,
more than offset the lower-than-expected outturn of direct, domestic indirect taxes and nontax

revenues .Overall the tax to GDPratio improved slightly, to 14.8 fromthe preceding year is 14.4
percent, although the target for 2003104 of 15.5 percent was not met As discussed further below
(paras 14-22), the Government also rationalized spending, by controlling defense expenditure
while maintainingthe commitment to increasepro poor sector spending.

(ii)     Financing Requirementsand Debt SustainabilityAnalysis

19.      Macroeconomic outlook. According to the revised PRGF program, GDP growth will
remain strong in the medium term, at 5.5 percent on average per year. Resource gaps, however,
will also remain large, despite some improvements. Interms ofthe domestic resourcegap, as the
investment to GDP ratio is expected to increase from 20.6 percent in 2003/04 to 22.2 percent in
2006/07, the domestic saving to GDP ratio is expected to improve from 1.3 percent 2003/04 to
6.7 percent inthe same period', yielding a gap inthe range of 19.4 - 15.5 percent for the period.
The external gap is expected to be between 13 - 15 percent, while thefiscd gap will remain at
around5 percent.

20.      A large shareof the investment requirements inthis medium-term framework will
need to be foreign aid-funded, supported by increased FDI. This would imply a sizable
increase inforeign aid, mostly inthe form of grants. Increased levels of foreign assistance canbe
effective in Ethiopia because the country has a reasonably good medium-term policy framework
and commitment to poverty reduction. The potential Dutch disease effects from increased aid
may be averted if the additional resources are translated into productive investments.
Concomitantly, FDI and private investment will need to be stimulated through further PSD-
relatedreforms andcomplementary efforts to increase investors' confidence inEthiopia.

21.      The fiscal gap for the 2004/05 budget entails some adjustments. The government
predicts a decline innon-grant revenue equal to 1.O% of GDP based on expected corporate profit
tax payments, indirect taxes on imports, and general non-tax revenue. At the same time, the
fiscal deficit is projected to increase by about 1.6% of GDP. The increase in the deficit can be
met througha combination ofnew grant financing           and/or compensatory fiscal measures aimed at
increasing revenues. While the government's target for monetary expansion would increase
credit to nongovernment and government sectors, inits most recent StaffReportthe IMFurged
that this target be lowered.

22.      In the face of increasing needs for external assistance, the MEFF for 2004/05 -
2006/07 shows a continuing increase in Counter Part Fund (CPF)-generating aid and
decreases in project aid. Much ofthe CPF aid will come inthe form of Direct Budget Support
(DBS) from the World Bank via the PRSC mechanism, along with aid from approximately 8
additional multilateral andbi-lateral DBS donors. As donor f h d s become more predictable, aid
effectiveness should increase. As most of the external aid disburses in the third quarter of the
fiscal year, remedial measures may still be needed to avoid bunching of aid releases in the last
quarter o f the fiscal year. This is one of the reasons why the proposed PRSC IIaims to disburse
withinthe second quartero fthe fiscal year.

23.      While Ethiopia's debt has been brought back to sustainable levels through HIPC
debt relief, Ethiopia remains a debt-vulnerable country. The Boards of the Bank and the

'  This expectedimprovement i s feasible ifthere i s progressonprivate sector and f i c i a l sector

Fund agreed on April 20, 2004 that Ethiopia had taken the necessary steps to reach its HIPC
Completion Point. In addition to making irrevocable the $1.3 billion of NPV debt relief
envisaged at Decision Point in November 2001, the Boards approved the topping-up o f debt
relief by an additional $0.7 billion in NPV terms.            The exceptional additional topping up
assistance was granted on account o f exogenous factors-particularly             changes in the discount
rate and exchange rate since the Decision Point-that            had fundamentally changed Ethiopia's
economic circumstances andthereby adversely affected its debt sustainability.

24.      Since the Completion Point, new macro data have become available for Ethiopia,
and the Bank and the IMF have proposed a new forward-looking framework for debt
sustainability for post-HIPC, low-income countries?                Using the proposed post-HIPC DSA
methodology and new macro data, the NPV o f debt as of end-FY 2003104 afier full delivery o f
topping-up assistance, is estimated at US$1,728 million, equivalent to 148 percent o f exports,
compared to the Completion Point forecast of 179percent. Despite this improvement, Ethiopia's
debt and debt service indicators remain particularly sensitive to the terms of new borrowing and
export shocks. Ethiopia's risk of debt distress, therefore, appears considerable, albeit not in the
immediate future. Such a situation calls for increased reliance on grant financing with prudent
new borrowingonhighlyconcessional terms.

25.      Itwillbevitalto develop mechanismsto ensurethat newborrowing doesnotreturn
Ethiopia to a situation where its debt is again considered unsustainable. Building on the
recent HIPC debt reduction, the Government has developed an "interim" debt management
strategy-pending       finalization of IDAlGwith a forward-looking set of aid and debt
management policies to ensure debt sustainability. The Bank is working with Government and
key partners including the UN and the IMF to assess the costs and macro implications for
Ethiopia of scaling up international assistance to attain the MDGs, and to develop a financing
package including grants from IDA and other donors, pending finalization of IDA14. This study
will inform the Govemment's PRSP update, the future macroeconomic framework, and will be
presented with a new Debt Sustainability Analysis @SA) inthe next CAS, spanning the IDA14
period.

C.       Public Expenditure Allocation

26.      Pro-poor spending hasbeen increasingsteadily since the adoption of the SDPRP by
Government. Pro-poor sector spending is defined as per the SDPRP to include agriculture and
natural resources, food security, health, education and roads. This now accounts for over 18
percent of GDP (including food security), and had risen in real terms from a base of 100 in
1999100to 255 in2004/5.

27.       Recent trends show that the share and composition ofbudget resourcesto pro-poor
sectors improved substantially. The share of the pro-poor budget increased from 41 percent in
2000/01 to more than 54 percent in 2004105. In the 2004/05 budget poverty-focused sectors
increase their allocation by more than 21 percent against 2002/03 outturns, while the defence
allocation was frozen in nominal terms. This pattern is expected to be sustained inthe medium-

term. Most notable among the changes in sectoral allocations is the large increase in rural
spending inthe last two years, reflectingthe Government's rollout o f the FoodSecurity Program.

28.       The consolidated 2004/05 FY budget stands at about 34.6 percent o f GDP (Table 3).
Compared to 2003104 FY, nominal spending will increase by about 16.4 percent , though it
remain the same as a share of GDP. Broadly, capital expenditure absorbs more than two-thirds
ofthe additionalbudget (primarily food security).

29.       The 2004105 FY budget is generally focused on service delivery in the pro-poor
sectors.      The agriculture and natural resources experienced the largest increases. However,
allocations for roads and health decline by about 12 percent and 1 percent, respectively, over
2003/04 levels. Lookingmore closely at the capital budget, which accounts for 40percent oftotal
spending, the food security program's share of total capital spending is substantial, and will
increase from 12.3 percent to 19 percent between 2003/04 and 2004/05. The education sector's
share of the capital budget will rise slightly from 16 percent to 22 percent. But the health share
falls from 6.4 to 5 percent, partly due to the sector's poor disbursement record. The capital



                                                            11

budget allocated to roads actually falls in absolute terms from 2003/04 reflecting governments'
concern about the predictability ofprogrammed international support.

30.      Pro-poor types of spending have risen very substantially since 1999/2000 in both
real terms and as a share of GDP. Table 2 shows that this is true for each o f the broad
categories of key social and economic development spending programs over the period as a
whole. The coming budget shows increasing emphasis on food security and education, whereas
there are real declines inroads budget for next year, as discussed further below.

31.      Despite these increases, per capita spending in social sectors in Ethiopia remains
amongst the lowest in the region. Especially for health services, despite increases over time
Ethiopia's total health expenditure remains dramatically low. Recently released National Health
Accounts data indicate that total per capita health expenditure (public and private) amounted to
only US$5.6 in 2000, drastically lower than the SSA average of US$42. Catch-up is proving
difficult. During the period 1995/96-2001/02, Ethiopia allocated, on average, only 4.7% of
public spending to health, while countries such as Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa and Zambia
achieved allocations closer to 10%ofpublic spending.

32.      A review of consolidated outturns shows that a high percentage of budgeted
resources are actually spent, although with wide within-year and between-year variations
across sectors. At an average of only 83 percent, disbursement of poverty-targeted capital
spending is generally below the target - except for education. Disbursement of recurrent
spending inpoverty-targeted sectors is better - averaging 92 percent - although only 82 percent
inthe healthsector.     Further analysis is needed to identifythe causes of under-spending inthe
poverty-related sectors, and the relative importance of, for example, absorption capacity
constraints, competing spending pressures and/or slow aid releases. There are also important
links to the financial management agenda in strengthening the budget process and reducing
fluctuations in spending during the year. Public sector management reforms underway aim to
improve the predictability and levels of spending for primary service delivery, as well as to
improve the accountability framework and local level capacity to translate these resources into
effective services for the poor.

33.      The Medium-term Expenditure and Fiscal Framework (MEFF) for 2004/05                      -
2006/07 provides for an increase in the resource envelope through improved domestic
resource mobilization. The MEFF shows continued restraint in defense spending, allowing
increased resources for discretionary expenditures. This increase in discretionary expenditures
will primarily be directed towards capital spending.       This leads to a question regarding the
balance between capital and recurrent spending, which i s part of the ongoingbudget dialogue as
notedinthe PER2003.

34.      The MEFF also indicates that treasury resources (including budget support and
HIPC) being transferred from the federal to the regional levels will continue to rise in
absolute terms. Given the past experience o f relatively higher utilization rates for treasury
resources versus project aid, this would represent an implicit increase in the predictability and
utilization rate o fresources allocated for primary services. The inter-governmental fiscal transfer
to sub-national tiers of government is substantially increased once specific purpose grants, in
particular food security, is included.

D.      Service Delivery in a DecentralizedContext

35.     Fiscal decentralization began in 1995/96 and is a central component of improving
the service delivery system. TheJirst phase, devolution of fiscal control and responsibilities to
the Regional level, has seen substantial progress. Regions now account for about a third o f
public spending, including 75% o f all health and education spending and a substantial share of
spending on agriculture, roads, and water. Most (70%) of regional budgets are financed by the
federal government via transfers, which are determined according to each region's population,
development status, and own-revenue effort. Inaddition, the federal government provides some
Specific Purpose Grants (SPG) for certain designated programs, though to date the SPG
mechanism has only been used for food security-related activities. In2003/04 the food security
SPG was funded at Birr 1 billion and this is projected to double in 2004/05.            Efforts are
underway to improve resource mobilization at the regional level, which should increase the share
of own revenue to about 38%. Phase two of decentralization has also begun, with some control
devolved to the woreda (district) municipal levels. A major shift of fiscal authority to the
woredas, which have on average about 100,000 people, took place in the four main Regions in
2002/03. The woredas now control approximately 45% of total Regional public expenditures.
The funds are transferred from the Regions to the woredas inblock grants have historically been
allocated on the basis of a formula modeled on the regional subsidy formula. However, some
regions have adopted an expenditure needs approach to the woreda block grant. In addition,
prototype municipal legislation has clarified the fiscal transfers to which municipalities or urban
centers are also entitled.

36.     The PER suggests that there are several potential benefits from decentralizationto
the local level, as well as several challenges. Potential benefits include better allocation o f
funds due to better understanding of local priorities, more efficient use of resources for the same
reason, and increased mobilization of local resources because of the more visible link between
revenues and service delivery.      Challenges include streamlining national and regional policy
goals and avoiding the risk of unfunded mandates from the federal government.          Also, given
fiscal constraints there is a danger that buildingmanagerial capacity at local levels comes at the
expense of higher spending on vital services. Finally, it is possible that woreda budgets will be
too small-and    toounpredictable year to year-to    allow for major capital investments.

37.     Itis early to determinethe effects ofworeda decentralizationon service delivery. A
recent review (draft budget update 2004) note some positive developments in service delivery.
Some educational staff in the S N "      Region, for example, have reported being able to respond
more effectively to local needs as a result of increased budgetary control. Also, there i s some
evidence of health facilities having an improved flow of operating funds. There are several
accounts that support the thesis that greater budget control has opened the way for local
providers to set local priorities inline withlocal needs and performance.

38.     Still, the rapid and monumental shift toward fiscal     decentralization naturally requires
adjustment, and bottlenecks need to be monitored and managed. One such bottleneck which has
emerged during the transition is the bureaucratic delay in the approval o f funds and locally
procured goods for health services as a result of pooling social sector (education and health)
resources under the capacity building offices.         Furthermore, the IMF reports that while
significant progress has been achieved on fiscal structural reforms, public expenditure
management needs further improvement at local levels. One critical priority area is inboosting



                                                  13

govemment capacity at the local level to implement the new mandates following devolution of
fiscal responsibility. Also, as the series of Public Expenditure Reviews note, the fundamental
lack of resources at all levels is a constraint that cannot be solved by adding flexibility in
spending at the margin. Recent assessmentsindicate that many woredas resort to soliciting funds
from local and international NGOs to supplement block grant resources from the Regions.
Finally, donor project processing requirements and the unpredictability of the actual release o f
donor funds despite commitments made, have been suggested as a major cause of low capital
budget execution rates, andneeds further analysis.

39.      The Institutional Governance Review (IGR) will provide an in-depth assessment of
governance reforms in Ethiopia that will encompass legal, intergovernmental fiscal relations,
budgeting and democratization processes. This will be complemented by a more detailed study
o f decentralized service delivery in the social sectors that will examine the current status of
service delivery, the promise, the constraints and needed reforms to improve services in the
evolving institutionalcontext.

40.      Improvements are being made in reaching the poor with basic services. While the
linkage between fiscal decentralization and service outcomes cannot be established, it is noted
that Government continues to make good progress in meeting basic service delivery targets,
especially in education.        Basic education gross enrollments exceeded targets by nearly 1.5
percent last year- a significant accomplishment inlight of continued rapidpopulation growthand
a base enrollment o f over 8 million students. This included a net increase inthe gross enrollment
rate (GER) of 18.5 percent for girls and 18.7 percent for boys over the past five years. Secondary
enrollment (Grades 9-10) increased from 512,000 to 586,000.            The Government has also
connected about 500 high schools in the country to the SchoolNet system which would provide
distance-learning capabilities via videoconference and internet access. Inthe health sector, the
Governmenthas launched a major initiative underthe HealthExtensionWorker program inorder
supplement the facility-based approach adopted thus far with a much stronger focus on
community and outreach-based services.

41.      Table 4 shows several o f the targets under the auspices of the SDPRP along with the
progress in2002103.

E.          ProgressinImprovingthe PublicFinanceSystem

42.         Fiduciary standards have continued to improve. According to the recently completed
IMF/World Bank HlpC Public Expenditure Assessment and Action Plan (AAP) on tracking
poverty-reducing spending, Ethiopia now meets 73 out o f 16 Public Expenditure Management
benchmarks compared with 6 in2001, and is close to meeting two more. Improvements intwo
areas are of special note. First, the comprehensiveness of budget formulation and fiscal reporting
has improved through the incorporation of extra-budgetary funds into consolidated general
government fiscal reports. Second, the classification o f expenditures has been strengthened
through the development and dissemination of a new, improvedchart of accounts.

43.        The AAP indicates, however, that the lack o f timely fiscal reporting is a key concern.
The delay in reporting actual spending (as opposed to estimates based on disbursements) is
having adverse effects on several aspects of PEM. First, it leads to long delays in auditing the
fiscal accounts andreportingthem to the Council of Peoples' Representatives (CPR). Secondly,
ithampers the management of fiscal policy withinthe year, owingto the absence oftimely data
on the evolution o f spending. Inthis context, delays inthe reporting of actual outlays for poverty-
reducing activities are of special concern. Fiscal decentralization has posed an additional strain
on the efforts to accelerate the pace of fiscal reporting. With the consolidation o f the
decentralization process now complete, and large scale capacity-building programs underway via
the Government's Expenditure Management and Control Program (EMCP) and Public Sector
Capacity-building Program (PSCAP), rapidprogress should be possible inthis area. Many ofthe
actions needed to improve fiduciary standards are supported by PRSC IT under the Public
Expenditure andInstitutionalPerformance theme of this document.

44.        There are a variety of other challenges related to the transition to the new system,
including the introduction of formula-based transfers that did not reflect pre-existing
commitments at the woreda level-i.e.           some woredas are overbudgeted, while others are
experiencing shortfalls. Also, the distribution o f responsibilities between Regions andworedas is
notyet entirely clear. Regular reportingmechanisms needto be implemented as partof anoverall
government effort to consolidate its general accounts and this is a central focus of the EMCP.
Regions are making efforts to address some of these different issues, for example inestablishing
legal andregulatory guidelines for assigning revenues and expenditures.

45.        Although devolution is intended to allow greater flexibility in spending at regional and
local levels, Regions/woredas do not have as much flexibility in practice. At the woreda level,
salary commitments often account for 85-90% of the annual public budget, leaving little
flexibility in discretionary allocations to non-salary items. Moreover, federal guidelines cover
many aspects of hiring, firing, and wage levels at the woreda level. The Government notes,
however, that the fiscal constraints at decentralized levels are a function of the overall fiscal
constraints facing Ethiopia.         Moreover, the aid resources being channeled directly to
healtldeducation sectors at local levels-but        not captured by the fiscal reporting system-
probably provide greater flexibility in spending by Regions/woredas than is immediately
apparent.



  The Government andthe AAP mission's assessmentsof an 8* indicator, that ofvariance of actual
spending relative to the budgeted amount (at aggregate andsectoral levels), differ. The Government's view
i s that this indicator has beenmet.



                                                   15

46.      There were important strides in tax and customs administration reforms in
2003/04, which are expectedto continue inthe current fiscal year. One area of improvement
is intax collection and enforcement procedures, where the government is implementing tools for
collecting tax arrears, such as applying liens on property and account balances, and preparing
auctions for seized property next year (the non-filingrate has dropped from more than 35% to
less than 20% o f taxpayers since these measures were implemented).            The VAT refund
mechanism still needs to be carefully reassessed inconjunction with other audit andenforcement
guidelines inorder to ensure that the tax environment does not constrain investment and growth.
Customs administration has been improved on several fronts: college graduates have been
recruited to work, training has been improved, and clearing procedures for goods have been
streamlined (IMF StaffReport).

F.       The Government Strategy and Programs

47.      The SDPRP, as the PRSP is known inEthiopia, has been under implementation for
nearly two years.      The overarching objective o f Ethiopia's Sustainable Development and
Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP) is to reduce povertyby enhancing rapid economic growth
while at the same time improvingservice delivery. Even as it stresses a strategy of Agricultural
Development-Led Industrialization (ADLI) to improve the lot of the rural poor who make up the
majority of the population, the SDPRP acknowledges the need for explicit efforts at private
sector development to put the economy on a higher growth trajectory. The strategy recognizes
that agriculture will require increasing technical progress, output diversification, and greater
market interaction and that industry and services must grow inconjunction with the expansion of
agriculture. The central goal is to go beyond subsistence farming to small-scale market oriented
agriculture.

48.      Generating empowerment and fostering democracy are the driving forces behind
the ongoing second wave efforts to decentralize decisions and management further down to
the woreda level. Woredas are now responsible for makingbudgetary decisions on all primary
services, in the context of a set of regional and national standards.         The instruments o f
decentralized transfers have become more sophisticated, with block grants being equityheeds
driven, capacity buildinggrants being needs andperformance driven, and for those woredas who
are chronically food insecure, affirmative action grants being provided with sunset clauses to
encourage graduation.      Inparallel, efforts are being devoted to improve the capacity and
motivation of the civil service at all levels to gear it to have a more pe$orinance and sewice
delivery orientation. These efforts will be supplemented by the implementation of a new wave
ofjudicial andlegalreforms, the strengthening of propertyrights, and strategic mainstreaming o f
gender issues.    The Government plans recognize the importance of building and nurturing
institutions that give voice to poor people, effectively addressing the needs of vulnerable groups
insociety andenforcing accountability at all levels.

49.      The key themes and sub-themes of the SDPRP are: (i)           Enhanced Rapid Economic
Growth(including private and financial sector development, rural development, vulnerability and
roads); (ii) Improved Human Development (including education, health, HIV/AIDS, water and
sanitation); (iii)Democratization and Governance (including decentralization, justice system
reform, and urban management); and (iv) Improved Public Sector Institutional Performance
(including civil service reform, tax reform and ICT). The Government increasingly sees the
SDPRP as the organizing framework for policies and programs. The Program is also seen by



                                                 16

Government and donors alike as the main instrument for coordinating international support
around a locally owned agenda across multiple themes. The SDPRP has strong ownership within
the Government and was prepared via policy discussions with civil society and donors. The
policy and results framework o fthe SDPRP may be visualized as follows inFigure 3.

50.     In Decemberof 2003 the Government held discussions on its first Annual Progress
Reporton SDPRP implementation. The objective o f the Annual ProgressReport (APR) is to
provide domestic and intemational stakeholders with a summary report on implementation of the
SDPRP including key results and challenges. Release of budget support is contingent on this
annual report. Itis also a key element inthe revisedGovernment fiscal calendar.

51.     In the view of the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the APR, the Government has
made a strong effort at SDPRP implementation despitethe major drought of the pastyear.
The JSA also noted, however, that progress towards addressing the weaknesses in the original
SDPRP identified by the PRSP JSA has been mixed and there were importantgaps inreporting
inthe first APR which need to be addressed inthe future. Insummary, the JSA for the APR
recommended that the next APR include more details on: measures to accelerate private sector
and financial sector development; progress with rural development, food security, population
policy and landreforms; efforts to rationalize the gaps between SDPRP program costs and likely
available financing (domestic and foreign), costs of new initiatives such as resettlement and
safety nets; and the decentralization strategy especially addressing the adequacy of the block
grants to sub-national levels o f Government relative to service delivery needs. Finally, the JSA
noted the importance of strengthening the monitoring and evaluation system to deepen




                                                17

participation by civil society and local Governments in the implementation of the SDPRP, as
well as to develop better linkages between sectoral policies andpoverty.

52.     Interim APR completed in September 2004. Given that the final APR is expected
only by December 2004/January 2005 in order to inform next year's budget cycle, the
Government agreed to prepare an "Interim" APR for discussion during the September 2004
Appraisal mission and did so. The I-APRprovided the key quantitative data needed for the full
APR for 2004, as well as for the Appraisal of the PSRC. The content of the "Interim" APR (I-
APR) included: a) an update on the macroeconomic framework; b) presentation of trends in
public expenditures-backward      and forward looking-at     a level of disaggregation consistent
with, andbased on, tables prepared for the Joint Budget and Aid Review (see below); c) update
on poverty and human development indicators drawn from the Poverty Assessment and other
recently available studies; and d) update o f the SDPRP matrix-policy     actions, indicators and
targets-drawing on existing and ongoingwork, including on decentralization, public financial
management and food security.

53.     The finalization of the full APR involves a process of consultation with
stakeholders. DuringAppraisal itwas notedthat the Government's APR team had already made
substantial progress towards the full APR through the I-APR exercise and the JBAR. The
Government confirmed that the APR will include the analysis of the JBAR data, the findings of
the MA, several studies the Government has itself conducted (e.g. macroeconomic growth
scenarios), the recently completed analybcal work by different partners (e.g. the Country Status
Reports for Education and Health by the World Bank), the MDGNeeds Assessment studies, and
available data from the sectors and different surveys. There was agreement that the findings of
the Joint Staff Assessment/Joint Partner Review o f the first APR in 2003 would be taken into
account inpreparing the upcoming APR. Itwas also agreed that the APR team will conduct the
analysis aroundselective key themes ofpriority to the Government. The draft APR is expected to
be available inDecember for discussion with donor and civil society partners and the final APR
presented in January 2005.       The MDG and APR analysis will provide the basis for the
formulation of SDPRP 11,which is expected bythe end of EFY 1997 (July 2005).


           111.     BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENTSTRATEGY

A.      Context

54.     The first two years ofthe SDPRP have witnessed tangible progress by the Government in
improving absorptive capacity and notable improvements in the policy framework.          Despite a
severe drought and concerns about debt and the border, this periodhas seen important shifts in
the Government's relations with the Bank and donors, and in the overall development effort.
Scaling up of ODA will be necessary to meet the MDGs since the expected financing needs are
far in excess o f the country's available resources-especially because the already high level of
domestic resource mobilization leaves little roomfor increasedtaxation. h a l y h c a l work carried
out under the CAS shows, for example, that recurrent expenditures on education will need to
double inorder for Ethiopia to meet the MDGs.

55.     The increased absorptive capacity, improving policy framework, high taxation, and
substantial resource requirements all argue for Ethiopia to receive an increased share of ODA.



                                                18

Indeed, the principle o f scaling up of assistance to Ethiopia has been supported by the Board, the
MDG Task Force, the OECD's MDGmeeting, indiscussions between the Bankand the EUand
DFID, and by the G-8 (inthe context of famine prevention). IDA'Ssupport under the CAS was
instrumental in shaping this progress, which has laid the foundation for a major scale-up of
Government efforts-and      donor assistance-to    meet MDG and SDPRP objectives. Inthe past
two years, ODA has increased from about $10 to $14 per capita, with much of the increase
coming through budget support o f sector support modalities. The situation is ripe for a sizable
improvement over the next several years in terms of the key challenges of the growth agenda,
governance, and vulnerability. In this context, the PRSC series is playing a central role in
deepening the policy dialogue around the SDPRP, harmonizingthe additional external support to
lowertransactions costs, and channeling it to the local level where services need to be expanded
most.

B.      Linkto CAS andRelationshipto OtherOperations

56.     The FY03-FY05 CAS for Ethiopia supports implementation of the SDPRP, thereby
assisting the country's efforts to reduce poverty and achieve the MDGs. The CAS focuses on
three key pillars of the SDPRP: pro-poor growth (urban and rural); institutional development
and capacity building; andreducing vulnerability. The CAS comprises a mixture of lending and
analytxal instruments which are designed to meet the evolving institutional structures of
Ethiopia and reflect lessons learned from previous experience.         While investment projects,
especially in infrastructure, remain an important part of the CAS, the strategy proposes a
measured shift away from such traditional project-based lendingtoward increasedprogrammatic
approaches such as Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSCs), supported by larger
investments inanalytical work. The proposed operation is a central component of the CAS, with
a program that cuts across themes to provide support for policy reforms and the financing of
essential investments and services.

57.     The CAS for FY06-08 is under preparation and will be synchronized with SDPRP II.
This CAS will be prepared inpartnership with several other agencies, including DFID, Afiican
Development Bank, and the UNagencies. The provision of predictable and performance-based
budget support via PRSCs will continue to be a central element of the new CAS, starting with
PRSC III.

58.     Beginning with this operation, the PRSC series is becoming the main vehicle for Bank
support inthe key sectors o f health and education, as envisioned inthe CAS. Delivery of basic
health and education support through the PRSCs allows for a better fit with the newly-
decentralized delivery of these services by woredas, which is financed by block grants from the
Federal government.

59.     The PRSCs and the associated donor budget support are being complemented by new
multi-sectoral, multi-donor initiatives. Ethiopia already has had several years' experience with
multi-donor single-sector approaches, such as the Health, Education, and Roads Sector
Development Programs. Buildingon the lessons of these programs, the Public Sector Capacity
BuildingProgram(PSCAP) offers a model for harmonization throughits Sector Wide Approach
(SWAP) to large scale, multi-sectoral investment support.            Unlike the traditional sector
development programs, PSCAP has been defined as a federal specific purpose program which
provides resources to regional in addition to their consolidated block grant or "subsidy."       In



                                                 19

addition, PSCAP resources-which      are allocated on the basis of need-are     disbursed on the
basis o f performance and reallocated on a semi-annual basis to high performers. Finally, this
particular SWAP i s aligned with the Government's planning and budgeting cycle and i s subject
to a single monitoring and evaluation framework with harmonized reporting and review
mechanisms. Severalmultilateral andbilateral donors havejoined the Bankinpoolingresources
through PSCAP, and the approach i s expected to be adopted by other programs including a
proposedconsolidate capital transfer that would also provide fiscal additionality to woredas and
municipalities to meet their servicedelivery investmentneeds.

60.     As noted below, lessons gained from past policy-based lendingpoint to the importance
ofprovidingstrongtechnical assistance on key areas o fthe policyreform agenda. Inresponseto
this finding, the Bank and other donors are working together to put inplace a series o f capacity-
building operations, starting with PSCAP, and to include a Private Sector Capacity Building
program (FYOS), Rural Capacity Buildingprogram (FY06), and Civil Society Capacity Building
program(FY06).

61.     The policy dialogue supported by the PRSC/JBS series has, moreover, helped to
accelerate progress inmajor reform areas and mobilize a harmonizeddonor response. One such
area is the reform o f the existing emergency relief system to a more development-oriented
productive safety net system. A consensus has now emerged amongpartners that the shift to a
new systemof safety nets warrants development financing ina SWAP-mode, to which the Bank
iscontributing via anAPL for the Productive SafetyNet program (FY05).

C.      DonorHarmonizationand Collaboration

62.     Inthe context of the overall harmonization agenda, substantialprogresshasbeenmade
inaligningthe Bank's programmatic support4elivered throughthe PRSCseries-with             donors'
budget support.     First, a programmatichudget support group-which         previously existed
informally-is   now integrated within the overall partnership architecture of the Development
Assistance Group (DAG) and liaises closely with DAG sector working groups. Second, PRSCs
and donors' budget support operations are prepared through a common process with
synchronized timetables and missions, and a common matrix of actions and indicators drawn
from the SDPRP. This process currently includes the World Bank, African Development Bank,
Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Germany, Ireland, and Sweden. Current
indications are that the amount o f programmatichudget support for 2004/05 could total $347
million, o fwhich US$130 million is proposedto be provided byIDA inthis operation, and $217
million from donor partners(see Annex 8).

63.     Framework for policy dialogue around "joint budget support" or JBS.                In the
secondyear of budget support, the focus i s on improving the predictability and effectiveness of
the process in a framework of mutual obligation between Government and its partners. While
recognizing the significant improvements already achieved in donor harmonization and shift
from projectized aid to sector program and JBS modes of aid delivery, the Government has
expressed the need for a clearer set of rules and responsibilities to support this transition and
reduce transaction costs. The clearer definition o f the "JBS group" as well as identification o f
the sub-set of the SDPRP policy matrix which constitutes the areas o f focus for budget support
purposes,i s expectedto help GovernmentandJBS donors alike instructuringthe policy dialogue
within a framework of mutual accountability.       Government has also asked JBS partners to



                                                20

provide to MOFED early, specific and firm commitments of JBS resource flows to enable the
Government to plan its budgets and service delivery on the basis of more predictable resource
flows. It was noted that while the architecture supporting JBS i s being better defined, the
discussionsduringthe joint budget supportmissionswould remain open to participationby non-
JBS donors.

64.     Memorandum of Understanding. The JBS partners and Government have been
working on a Memorandum of Understanding(MOW for budget support. The MOU would
codify lessonsdrawn from the frst and secondrounds of JBS andalso serve as a code ofconduct
for donors and the Government. A draft MOU has now been produced and is under revision.
Issues raised by Government during initial meetings include the importance o f donors making
multi-annual Commitments, the needfor donorsto align withthe financial calendar, as well as the
relation between the MOU and bilateral agreements between the development partner and
Government. On the latter point, Government emphasizedthat the M O Umight transform into a
less useful document if bilateral agreements continue to specify additional processes and
regulations inaddition to what is statedinthe MOU. JBS donors have provided a draft MOUto
the Governmentfor further discussionandfinalization in2005.

D.      LessonsLearned

65.     OED review of the PRS process. In 2003, the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED), the independentevaluationunit o fthe World Bank, initiated an evaluation o fthe Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS) process to assess whether it had, indeed, resulted ina transformation
inthe Bank's approachto developmentaidfor thepoorest. Ethiopiawas chosenasthe subjectof
abackgroundcase study for the review. The lessonsdrawnremainrelevant.

66.     The evaluation concluded that the ownership of the strategy by central government is
clear. OED found that the Bankprogram i s broadly aligned with the SDPRP. Progresshasbeen
madeintakingforward some key areas o fthe government's program. Tangible progresshas also
been made indonor alignment with the SDPRP. While the SDPRP was still inits infancy at the
time of the review, the evaluation uncovered some potentially divergentexpectations about the
process. The Government views the SDPRP as an important opportunity to articulate and
provide leadership to its longstanding development program to both internal and extemal
constituents. Manydonors view it as the first step on the roadto more responsiveandtransparent
government and a new context for aid relations. CSOs and NGOs view the PRSP approachina
moreradical light, hoping for amore fundamental shift inthe political economyo fpolicymaking
and the consideration of policy alternatives. These expectations are not necessarily in conflict
and indeed may be seen as promising signs of a policy environment where debate among
different parts of Ethiopian society is possible and encouraged. Policy-based programmatic
support via PRSCs and direct budget support will require development partners including the
Bank beingaware o f these differing expectations. It will also require that JBS partners find the
right balance between respect for country ownership-including      a recognition that there is a
specific political equilibrium shaping the policy space-and  providing intellectual and financial
support to the development andimplementationofpolicies.

67.     Transactions costs of project aid. An important constraint on Ethiopia's ability to
expand education and health services has been the transactions costs associated with utilization
of donor aid resources. Donor resources earmarked for education andhealth have largely been



                                               21

  used to support capital construction. A recent PER notes that under-spendingon the capital
  budget hasbeen apersistentproblem inthe health sector from budgetaryandaid-funded sources.
  ProcurementbottlenecksandUnpredictabilityAatenotification o f the level of capital fundingina
  given year have affected both sources of funds. The majority of under-spending, however, has
  been on the aid budget and can be linked to difficulty in complying with multiple sets of donor
  requirements for administering funds and contracting. The PER 2002/03 finds that while on
   average 82% o f the domestically-financedpart o f the capital budget was spent duringthe period
   1996/97-2000/01, only about 30% of the project-aid funded budget was spent inthe same time
  period. Furthermore, the un-utilized share o f donor resourcesfor educationhealth could not be
  easily re-allocated to financing much needed recurrent expenditures, given that the aid was
  project-basedrather thanbudget-support.

  68.      ICRs for recent adjustment lendinginEthiopia. DuringFYOl and FY02, following
  the conflict with Eritrea, IDA provided two single tranche adjustment credits (the Ethiopia
  Emergency Recovery Credit and the Ethiopia Structural Adjustment Credit) totaling $270
  million. These credits helped to stabilize the post-war economy, reallocate public spending to
  poverty targetedsectors, andkick-start public sector managementandprivate sector development
  reform agendas. The Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) o f these operations identified
   some keylessonsfor policy-basedlendingsupportbythe Bank.

   69.     First, technical assistance should accompany the adjustment program in Ethiopia to
  ensure institutions have the capacity to implementnew policies and legal frameworks. T h ~ was       s
   found to be especially true for second generationreforms such as competition policy, investment
   code, and privatization reforms. Second, an appropriate balance needs to be struck-especially
   inthe hmeworkofaPRSC-between rewarding the implementation ofgoodpolicies, signaling
   the need for better progress, and meeting urgent budgetary financing needs. Agreement on a
  medium-term framework, which distinguishes between policy reforms which are likely to be
   slow-moving and those where early action is feasible, i s essentialto avoid divergent expectations
   between the Government and its developmentpartners. Third, private sector development will
  take time in Ethiopia. There i s a tradition of mistrust between the private sector and the
   Government, overcoming which will require a more open dialogue betweenGovernmentand the
  private sector around a clearly defined medium-term reform agenda. The Bank should support
   this with a strong and flexible partnership, wide range o f analmcal work, continued in-depth
   dialogue, and strongmonitoringand superwsion o freforms. FinaZi'y, more attention i sneededto
   developing the public expenditure management agenda to allow a transparent dialogue around
   improved and more timely budgeting. I n sum, the conclusion appears to be that a medium-term
   outlook to policyreform is essentialinEthiopia andto "allow sufficient time for reforms".

   70.     Alignment to budget year vs. predictability. A further lesson learned has related to
I  the Government's preference for timing o f delivery o fbudget support/PRSC financing. MOFED
   has indicated that the precise alignment o f funds availability to the start o f the fiscal year i s less
   important than the predictability of the financing including approximate amounts. The spirit o f
   budget support is to avoid a stop-go approach to financing and policy dialogue while
   acknowledging that the exact amounts of budget support may vary depending on performance
   with respect to the reform program. The Government has indicated that as long as they have
   reasonable certainty regarding the donor's commitment of budget support, actual disbursements
   cantake placeup to the endo fthe secondquarter o fthe fiscal year i.e., before endo fDecember.

    E.      AnalyticalUnderpinnings

    71.     The proposed reform program supported by PRSC 11 relies on a strong analytical
    program (Box 1).


                               Box 1:AnalyticalUnderpinningsof PRSC11

           IV.      THE PROPOSEDPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORTGRANT

    A.      Rationale

    72.     Rationale for PRSC series. The proposed Operation is a core operation to support
    implementation of the SDPRP and the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).                The
    CAS for FY03-05 envisages a series of annual PRSCs. The relationship between the MDGs, the
    SDPRP, the PRSCs andthe capacity-building programs are presented ina schematic inAnnex 7.

    73.     The CAS noted that the initial country conditions for commencing use of a Programmatic
    financing instrument such as the PRSC were strong. First, the PRSP process is sound with a
    strategy that i s appropriate in terms of both growth and poverty reduction impact, grounded in
    the MDGs, backed by strong country-omership, and a credible implementation process. Second,
    the budget process is credible, with continuous efforts underway to improve the predictability of
    resource flows to sub-national levels responsible for primary service delivery and reduce the
    reporting lags on actual expenditures. Third, although decentralization has placed strains on the
    public financial management system, fiduciary performance is acceptable andmeasures are being
    implemented to address identified weaknesses.             Fourth, the Bank and other partners have
    supported a strong analytical program inEthiopia involving several PERs, a CFAA, CPAR, Risk
    and Vulnerability Assessment, poverty analyses, diagnostics in various sectors, etc. which
    identified key development constraints which are at the heart o fthe SDPRP's reformprogram.




                                                         23

74.      The underlying principles or motivation for embarking on PRSCs and Joint Budget
Support (JBS) were also compelling. First, given the decentralization o f fiscal decision-making
to the woreda level for primary service delivery across education, health, water, etc., the
wearmarked financing of the PRSCs was expected to facilitate woreda empowerment, re-
inforcing the woreda's ability to make appropriate choices. Second, the PRSC's programmatic
approachinvolves commitment to support the Government's medium-termreformprogram. This
commitment avoids the debilitating effects of both short-termism and a stop-go approach to
financing at a macro level, promoting more predictable financing for primary services. Third,
various PERs and evaluations o f Sector DevelopmentPrograms have documented the relatively
weak utilization rates o f capital budgets financed through project aid, while capital budget
utilization rates under the public budget were higher. This feature is largely thought to be driven
by Government capacity constraints in managingmultiple donor financing and reporting rules
characterizingproject aid. PRSC and donor Joint BudgetSupport (JBS) instruments address this
constraint by harmonizing around, utilizing, and enhancing the Government's own fiscal and
financial management systems. Fourth, given the large fiscal needs in terms o f both recurrent
and capital financing at local levels, the PRSC/JBSwould enable flexibility in addressingboth
types o fresourceneedsinabalancedway. FinulZy, the PRSC/JBSfocuseson alignment withthe
Government's planning and financing cycles, as well as promoting a common policy agenda
across multiple development partners. This is expected to help translate the harmonization
agenda into simplifiedproceduresandreducedtransactionscosts for the Government.

75.      Rationale for PRSC II.The proposed operation would be the second in this PRSC
series. The rationale for continuing Bank support to the SDPRP in a second PRSC remains
strong as the Govemment has made good progress inimplementingand extending its policy and
institutional reform agenda, and has devoted an increasing share o f public spending to poverty-
reducingareas ineacho fthe past severalyears.

76.      Additionally, over the course of the last year, the collaborative, policy- and results-
focused preparation process o f the PRSCs and donor JBS operations has played a key catalyhc
role in consolidating and operationalizing a harmonized approach to policy dialogue and public
financing. Evidenceto this effect includesthe following. First, as input into the annualdialogue
and decision-making process on PRSC/JBS, a common framework for monitoring public
expenditure issues has been agreedvia a Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR)and a review of
public financial management systems through an Annual Fiduciary Assessment (AFA). Second,
since the approval o f PRSC Iinmid-February 2004, Government and PRSC/JBS partners have
made further clarifications on the alignment of the JBS/PRSC cycles to the SDPRP/Ethiopian
budget cycles. Sector review mechanismsineducation and health have also been re-aligned to
ensure better feedback loops with the newly introduced financial calendar (see Annex 11).
Third, the first cycle o f PRSC/JBS preparation realized the potential for reduced transactions
costs for Government o fexternal resourcemobilization. A large amount o fJoint Budget Support
from other donors has been leveragedby the PRSC and its associatedcollaborative preparation
process utilizinga unified PRSC/JBS policy matrix drawn from the SDPRP. PRSC Idisbursed
approximately USD 123 million in March 2004; Joint Budget Support from other partners is
estimatedto have generatedintotal an additional $135 million inthe first round. Inthe second
round of PRSC/JBS support, the JBS amount leveraged by the joint PRSC/JBS framework i s
significantly higher (see Annex 8 for details).

B.       PRSCSeries ProgramObjectives and Themes

77.      Given the formidable challenges on all fronts-growth,         vulnerability and service
delivery-Ethiopia's      PRSC series is conceived with a wide coverage of cross-cutting and
sectoral reform issues to help achieve simultaneous progress across multiple areas towards the
SDPRP goals/MDGs (see Annex 7). While the reform program supported under the PRSC/JBS
series is expected to make steady and demonstrable progress each year on all the important
fionts, the state and structural transformation agenda Ethiopia has embarked uponis expected to
require several years to hlly unfold. The development objectives of each annual PRSC are thus
linked within a rolling, programmatic series which jointly aims to consolidate progress in
implementation of the SDPRP's multi-faceted reform program; support progress on the
harmonization and financing alignment agendas; and develop the policy matrix to update and
extend the rollingthree-year planning framework to include the outer year.

78.      The policy actions andindicators inthe program matrix are organized into four "thematic
areas" of the PRSC series drawn from the SDPRP. They are: (i)        private and financial sector
development; (ii)   rural development and vulnerability; (iii) development; and (iv) public
                                                             human
expenditure and institutional perf~rmance.~Actions across the themes are expected to re-inforce
each other to achieve results. Given the broad coverage of these themes, PRSC 11does not
involve sharp swings in the policy matrix developed duringPRSC I.It was agreed during Pre-
Appraisal of PRSC 11, however, that policy dimensions of water and sanitation, and roads are
already part of the SDPRP, have or are developing Sector Wide Approaches and will be fully
incorporated into the PRSCIJBS programby the thirdround.

C.       Operation Description

79.      PRSC11developmentobjective. The development objective o f PRSC 11is to support
improvements in: (i)     the investment climate, (ii) governance and service delivery, and (iii)
vulnerability, by continuing to support the Government's medium-term reform program. In
addition, support is provided to the implementation of the Joint Budget andAid Review (JBAR),
the Annual Fiduciary Assessment (MA), the ongoing Sector Reviews, and the SDPRP M&E
Action Plan.

80.      PRSC IIalignment to budget cycle. It was originally planned that PRSC 11would
continue the strategy outlined in the Program Document of PRSC Iof gradually shifting the
timingofPRSC support inorder to be better alignedwiththe Government budget cycle byPRSC
N. To accomplish this, PRSC 11would have been expected to disburse its fhds around
NovemberDecember 2004; PRSC IIIaround September 2005; and PRSC N around July 2006.
However, inthe most recent discussions the Government has indicated its preference to stabilize
the timing of the PRSCs, and budget support in general, as it currently stands for PRSC 11
(presentation to the Board and Effectiveness by NovemberDecember).             The reasoning is
twofold: a) in the interest of predictability of resource flows within any given Ethiopian Fiscal
Year, disbursements wouldbe desirable within the second quarter of the EFY since public sector
cash flow requirements tend to peak following the second quarter; andb) the current schedule is



  The first two PRSC themes are drawn fiomthe SDPRP's EnhancedRapidEconomic Growth theme, the
thirdis drawnfromthe ImprovedHumanDevelopment theme, andthe fourthis drawnfiomthe Improved
Public Sector Institutional Performance theme.


                                                 25

consistent with allowing the APR's diagnostics and discussions on policy directions to occur at
the beginning of the annual Poverty Reduction Strategy (PH), budgeting, and budget support
cycles in January rather thanat the endofthese cycles.

81,     It should be noted that inorder to make progresson the alignment of the PRSC to this
timeline, the preparation period for PRSC 11has been relatively short. Since the steady-stateof
PRSC alignment would already have been achievedwith PRSC 11, however, the preparation of
PRSCIIIwillbe ableto draw on a fullyear.

82.     PRSC IIprior actions. As a programmatic adjustment operation, PRSC-11financing
will be provided based on the up-fi-ont completion before Board approval o f a set of priority
reformmeasures ("prior actions") that demonstratesatisfactoryprogresswith the reform agenda
insupportofthe SDPRP. As mentionedearlier, these actionsare drawnfi-om Ethiopia's SDPRP
matrix. Apart from these "bolded" actions in the program, there are several additional actions
which are important elements o f the Government's program and are reflected inthe full PRSC
policy matrix in Annex 2. The prior actions which the Government has agreed upon and
implementedbefore the presentationof PRSC11to the Executive Board are presentedin Table 5.
The table also illustrates the relationshp between the themes o fPRSC11,the objectives, and the
prior actions, drawing out the complementaritiesandcross-cuttingaspectso fthe program.

83.     Proposedtriggers for PRSCIII. IIIi s anticipatedto continue to provide support
                                            PRSC
to the broad-rangingprogramo freforms initiated under the SDPRP andexpectedto be continued
inSDPRP11,duebythe endofFY05. Inkeepingwiththe approachadoptedfor PRSCIand11
o f supporting medium-tem reforms which require multipleyears to unfold infull, PRSC111will
not introduce large shifts in program coverage. An increased focus is expected, however, on
rural growth, private sector development, and the financial sector. The actions which the
Government has committed to as key indicators for moving to the next operation in the
programmatic series, PRSC111,arepresentedinTable 6.

D.       GrantAmount andTranching

84.      The operation is expected to take the form of an IDA grant in the amount o f US$130
million, to be disbursed ina single tranche uponproject effectiveness.

85.      Reward structurefor PRSC series. The approach taken inthis PRSC series is as follows:
the World Bank announces a range for the size of the PRSC when the Government budget is
fmalized (here US$120 to US$lSO million), which the World Bank commits to disburse around
the second quarter of the EFY if the overall performance under the PRSC is judged to be
satisfactory. The exact amount is determined based on performance. This approach allows the
World Bank disbursements to be more predictable interms of timing, while at the same time
providingincentives for goodperformance. Applyingthis principle, PRSC Iprovided a US$120
millionIDA grantversus a potentialamount ofUS$lSO million.

86.      PRSC I1has adopted this principle oflinking the size ofthe grant to performance as well.
It is the assessment of the Bank's staff that overall performance under the PRSC 11program is
satisfactory,  especially on governance and decentralization,          social services, reducing
vulnerability, and in,some areas related to private sector and rural growth (such as actions on
privatization, urban land, andrural credit). However, actions to foster rural growthhave not been
as fast as expected, andthe telecom action plan-which    PRSC Ihad envisaged as a bolded action
for this operation-is   inadequate: it is comprehensive and technically detailed, but there is no
financing plan or policy moves to help sustain the very ambitious goals, nor are there policies
planned to attract largerfinancing from the private sector.

87.      In view of this evaluation, the PRSC 11amount proposed is US$130 million. The
allocation also intends to signal in strong terms the World Bank's assessment that the telecom
strategy, as expressed inthe Letter of Communication Policy, is inadequate.

E.       DueDiligence

88.      The SDPRP M&Esystem and several key reviews underlie the ability ofthe Government
andits development partners to assess performance inimplementingthe SDPRP program. These
mechanisms are outlined below and also elaborated in subsequent sections of this Program
Document.

89.      Monitoring and Evaluation system. The WorldBank and other JBS partners has worked
closely with Government on a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Action Plan aimed at
strengthening the Government's SDPRP M&E system.                Main elements of the plan are
summarized inAnnex 10.

90.      Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR). The government has confirmed its commitment to
introducing a Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR) as a key element of the ongoing planning
and budget cycle.     This is the instrument that is intended to replace the series of Public
Expenditure Reviews that had traditionally been undertaken by the World Bank which, together
with the proposed AFAs (see below), assume larger importance in the context of the shift in
development assistance to programmatichudget support. The JBAR's primary objective is to
review budget allocations - at the sectoral, sub-sectoral, regional and local levels - in terms of
the links to national growth, poverty andhumandevelopment outcomes as laid out inthe SDPRP.
More specifically, the objectives of the JBAR would be to: improve information and


                                                29

predictability on expected resource flows to sector agencies and lower levels o f government; give
decision-makers a better sense of where money is going, and that money i s being spent on
intended uses; and provide better information on overall fiscal aggregates and how this is
financed, to better informmacro-level discussions. Further details of the scope of the JBAR are
presentediqAnnex 9.

91.      A first roundof the JBAR discussions took place in May 2004, focusing on the MEFF
and Federal level draft budget for FY2004/05. The second andmuchmore detailed roundof the
JBARdiscussionstookplace duringthe September 2004 Appraisal o fthe PRSC/JBS.

92.      Annual Fiduciary Assessments (AFAs). Fiduciary review processes are being adapted to
the new environment of woreda decentralization andthe shift to programmatic/ budget supportin
an increasingly harmonized environment. MOFED has agreed with JBS donors and the Bank
that a joint fiduciary assessment-the    first in a series o f annualized fiduciary assessments or
AFAs-will be carried out as part of the Institutional Governance Review (IGR) andwill serve
as a key input into the Joint Budget Support decision cycle. AFAs are intended to consolidate
and replace the vaned reviews of expenditure management systems in Ethiopia, including the
aspects of the PER related to institutional and inter-governmental fiscal design issues, as well as
the Country Financial Accountability Assessments (CFAAs) and Country Procurement
Assessment Reports (CPARs). The AFAs will be key inputs into the Joint Budget Support
decision cycle and serve as the vehicle for due diligence on financial accountability and
procurement procedures. The first of the AFAs has started and will be completed by the end of
2004. Fiduciary aspects are discussed further as part of the Public Expenditure and Institutional
Performance theme (see below inSection IVF(iv)).

93.      Sector reviews. The existing semi-annual sector review mechanisms (e.g. in health,
education, PSCAP, Roads) are expected to continue to improve their efforts to better align with
the budget support cycle. This will facilitate assessment of whether satisfactory, unsatisfactory,
or highly satisfactory progress has been made with respect to the sectoral indicators and actions
for eachround of PRSC/JBS. Efforts are ongoingto explore ways inwhich to further streamline
and deepen the relationship between the sector development groups andbudget support.

94.       SDPRP AP&. In addition, the Government is preparing an Interim Annual Progress
Reportto shift the timingofGovernment-donor APR discussions andbudget support to earlier in
the budget cycle inorder to ensure timely feedback into the policy-making process. The Interim
APR will be a streamlined version o f the regular APR, aligned with the result-based monitoring
 framework of the SDPRF', and reporting on the status of all the indicators and targets identified
inthat framework.

 F.       Policy Areas

 (i)      Theme 1: Private Sector and Financial Sector Development

 Overview

 95.      There is agreement between Government and its partners on the strategic options and the
 associated package of institutional and policy reforms needed to increase the market orientation
 of the economy. There is also broad agreement that the private sector needs cultivation, notjust
 liberalization. At present the key question is the pace of implementation. The Government


                                                 30

prefers a paced and targeted strategy that ensures a reputation of non-reversal once political
decisions are made. Therefore, the nature of the engagement in PSD in Ethiopia, while slow
compared to experience inother countries, does exhibit characteristics that pointto its likelihood
of being more sustainable and generating a strong private sector response inthis changed global
environment.

96.      Investment Climate. The investment climate has improved duringthe first two years of
the SDPW-the        Economic Freedom Index, published annually by the Heritage Foundation,
noted in 2004 that Ethiopia offered the second-most-improved business environment in the
world. One sign of the improvement is the sharp rise in investment licenses, due to the reduced
cost and time required to register a business. Private investment as a share of GDP increased
from 9 to 10.7 percent between 2001/02 and 20021'03.       New FDIincreased from $105 millionin
2001/02 to $189 million in2002/03. Promising new sectors such as horticulture are taking off.
The Government has completed the Diagnostic Trade and Integration Study @TIS), the first step
of the Integrated Framework (IF) program. The DTIS findings have been discussed with the
private sector and are being incorporated into the Government's reformagenda.

97.      Despite many positive developments, important constraints to the growth of Ethiopian
business remain. While manyofthese constraints are structural-such          as the hightransport costs
due to geography, low domestic demand, the legacy of socialism, andthe relative infancy of the
private sector-others relate to policies and institutions. The recent update of the Investment
Climate Assessment identified that progress has been achieved inthe past two years inthe areas
ofbusiness registration, telecom services, customs clearances, andlabor relations. However, key
policy and institutional constraints remain. The main constraints relate to problems of access to
and cost of finance, and weak capacity inthe private sector (both, firms and institutions). Other
constraints include the high cost o f urban land, inadequate physical infrastructure, presumptive
taxation, and lack of a competition policy. In addition, the dominance of public enterprises in
key economic sectors and the slow pace of the privatization program over the past two years,
further impede the private sector participation ineconomic activities andgrowth.

98.       Financial sector development. Lack of access to financing remains a critical constraint
to private sector development, and ultimately to Ethiopia's economic growth and poverty
alleviation. At the same time, there is significant excess liquidity inthe bankingsystem, roughly
between 45 to 50 % o f deposits. Progress has been achieved on competition, and on improving
the financial sustainability of the system. There are at present six small private banks competing
with the State owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Development Bank of Ethiopia and
Construction and Business Bank, the latter three institutions accounting for almost 80 percent of
deposits. CBE has faced difficulties for some time and has a large amount of Non-performing
loans (35 percent in2004, down fkom 50 percent in2003). Deposits inprivate banks as a share
o f total deposits increased from 17 to 22 percent between 2001/02 and 2003/04, and the share of
credit extended by the private banks rose fiom 13 to 20 percent of total credit. But beyond
traditional loans from the abovementioned development bank, no specific medium or long-term
financing is available, as no leasing, long termdebt or equity markets exist inthe country. Rural
financing instruments also remain limited -- although microfinance institutions (MFIs) are
growing fast (50 percent growth in lending volumes in 2003-04), the volume of operations of
these relativelynew institutions is still quite low as a proportion o f financing needs.




                                                  31

99.      Telecommunications. Inthe last two years, some progress has been made inthe telecom
sector in terms of reduced pricing, network expansion, investments in infi-astmcture (including
fiber-optics), and corporate restructuring within the Ethiopia Telecommunications Corporation
(ETC), the sole public monopoly operator. Progress includes the expansion of ETC's mobile
network by approximately 100,000 subscribers, and the commissioning of the "Schoolnet" and
"Woredanet"     networks. These investments have led to an increase intotal teledensity from 0.6
lines per 100 inhabitants in 2002 to 0.95 in M a y 2004. While this increase represents an
improvement, Ethiopia's tele-density level is still among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa,
where average tele-density was 5.47 lines per 100inhabitants in20035.

GovernmentStrategy

100.     Privatization. After experiencing a significant slowdown of the privatization program,
the Government is now committed to re-energizing the process. The reasons for the slowing
down have been analyzed at lengthby the Government with support from the World Bank and
other partners. There is agreement on the main causes, which include relatively cumbersome
procedures and processes for the tendering and sale of public enterprises6, ineffective marketing
of enterprises being offered for sale, and perceived difficulties for buyers inresolving post-sale
issues relating to land titles and labor restructuring.              Based on this understanding, the
Government has prepared a Privatization Action Plan to address these and other issues and
provide a way forward that will lead to successful implementation and an acceleration o f the
privatization program.

101.     K e y features of the Action Planare (i)     institutional reforms, leading to finalization of the
mergerbetween EPAand PESA, which will eliminate duplication ofefforts andallow for a more
efficient divestiture process, making use of different modalities (asset sale, concessions, leasing,
etc.). (ii)a streamlining of divestiture procedures, so as to enable transactions to be closed as far
as possible on the first tender andnegotiations. To achieve this, the biddingprocess wouldneed
to generate prices most closely approximating the market valuation of enterprises. This inturn
wouldrequire (a) more vigorous, professional marketing ofpublic enterprises beingtendered for
sale7, and an open, competitive and transparent bidding process; (b) the divestiture process to
encompass different modalities (sale, leasing, partnership); and (c) the sale package to address
the issue ofredundant labor. As regards the latter, to make transactions more attractive to buyers
and extract the best possible price, buyers would be supported by the Government when they
decide to restructure the workforces of the enterprises they acquire by implementing a menu of
options that facilitate labor retrenchment andmitigate its social impact.

102.     Comuetition. The Government of Ethiopia has recently initiated implementation o f an
effective policy to increase domestic competition, based on The Trade Practices Proclamation
which came into force in 2003 and established rules on anti-competitive practices such as price
collusion, abuse of market dominance, anti-dumpingand consumer protection. The Government
is committed to implement the Proclamation, and has undertaken extensive dissemination and
consultations withthe private sector and civil society.

103.     Trade and Integration. The Government expressed its commitment to increase the
integration of the Ethiopian economy into the regional and international economy through
attaining membership inthe WTO. WTO accession has also emerged as a top priority inthe IF
follow-up consultations. Ethiopia is currently holding observer status in WTO. The
Memorandum on the Foreign Trade Regime has been finalized and submitted to the Council of
Ministers for approval. After this, the Office o f the Prime Minister will formally submit the
Memorandum to the WTO, which will launch the accession process. Further, recognizing the
size of the challenge ahead, the GOE has decided to create a well-staffed department devoted to
this task within MoTI. This process is still ongoing and will be assisted by the public sector
reformprogram.

104.     Enterurise Skills and Institutional Su~wrt PSD. Inaddition to the public sector, the
                                                     to
Government is focusing part of its capacity building effort on the institutions servicing the
private sector, andhas hadnotable successes inimprovingthe time requiredto clear customs, tax
management, availability o f land for business and industry inurbanareas, reducing the cost and
time requiredto register a business, andimprovingthe environmentfor SMEs.

105.     Telecommunications.     The government's current strategy is to maintain ETC's state-
owned monopoly over the telecommunications backbone, and to allow private sector
participation indownstream retail activity. The speed at which private sector participation inthe
mobile service sector would occur will be determined by the speed at which regulatory capacity
can be broughtup to the necessary standard. Governmentalso wants to ensure that ETC will be
strong enough to compete against newly licensed operators following the opening of the market.
The Government has developed a strategy for the telecom sector in the form of a Letter of
Communication Sector Policy (LCSP). Itaims to increase its fixed line capacity annually by 150
thousand subscribers andits mobile lines by 300,000 per year. The overall targets includedinthe
proposed strategy are necessary from a growth and MDG perspective. The coverage goals are
planned to rise from the current tele-density of about 1% (fixed andmobiles combined) to about
4% infixed lines and 5% inmobile by 2010, which should allow Ethiopia to reach the African
averages. The strategy also proposes to liberalize the downstream services, resale, ISPs, andrural
telecom, while retaining monopolyover the backbone andinternational inall segments -mobile,
fixed, data, andinternet.

 106.    These goals are very ambitious given the low starting base, and are unlikely to be met in
the Bank`s view, unless some reasonable ways are rapidly found to attract the associated huge
financing needs. By Bank staff estimates, the proposed goals wouldrequire between US$1.5 and
US$2 billion in financing over the next six years. The LCSP, however, does not include a
financing strategy. While recognizing that the rate of retum on these investments can be high,
both socially and financially, the Government has to identi@ how the sector can attract such
large resources, in view of domestic and international borrowing constraints, including by
leveraging private sector capacity andfinancial resources.

 107.    Financial sector develoDment. The policy agenda in the PRSP includes: strengthening
the credit environment and broadening access to financial services; reducing the existing debt
 overhang of the banking system while preserving viable firms; increasing the efficiency of the
banking sector through measures to improve contestability; introducing new financial products
 (e.g. rural credit, credit to SMEs, and leasing) and finding ways to get the long term finance and
 equity finance markets started. The results of the Government's financial sector strategy are



                                                  33

expected to lead to: commercial banking being modernized and competition increased as
measuredby growth inmarket size o fprivatebanksandreducednon-performingloans; increased
access to fmancial services for small holders, entrepreneurs and traders, home-owners, and
farmers; anddevelopmentoffinancial markets.

this stage is predominantly on improving CBE's performance. Regardingmeasures to strengthen
competition inthe bankingsector, the Governmenthas indicated that itwill continue its efforts to
enhance efficiency and competition inthe financial sector, inorder to preparethe ground for the
progressive integration o f the Ethiopian financial sector into the global financial market. IMF
andBankstaff continueto encouragethe Governmentto allow the entry offoreign banksintothe
financial sector over time, initially by encouraging international management contracts for
domestic banks. The Government considers that priority should first be given to strengthening
the financial sector andenhancingsupervisory capacity o fthe central bank. Inthe opinion o fthe
staff, satisfactory progresshas been made in the implementation o f the CBE restructuring plan,
and support for the restructuring o f DBE and the privatization of CBB will be provided under
PRSCID.

109.     The Government has issueda Rural andMicrofinance Strategy and developedan action
plan to improve the operations o fthe sector and encouragefaster growth. Main features include
strengthening the regulation and the supervision of MFIs, improving the governance of MFIs,
promoting the developmento f MFIs' institutional capacities, providingMFIs with effective loan
recovery mechanisms similar to those currently available to banks, and encouraging MFIs to
upgrade their accountingandmanagement information systems. The planalso envisagesto study
andinclude betterrisk sharingmechanismsinrural financial instrumentsinthe future.

the Government in designing innovative risk-sharingapproaches to foster rural finance, and is
considering investments that can promote the expansiono f micro-enterprises by increasingtheir
access to financial services and to information. The Bankhas completed an Investment Climate
Survey. Finally, IFC and MIGA are attempting to get more involved in supporting particular
investments such as in leasing and the privatization of the Ethiopia-Djibouti railway and the
CBB.

Implementation Progress

112.    Measures supported under PRSC I.Inaddition to a number o f non-bolded actions, the
Government implemented the following prior actions for PRSC-I: (a) it has approved and
commenced implementation of the CBE restructuring plan; (b) it has substantially reduced the
cost (from $425 to $65) andtime (from 44 to 8 days) of registration; and(c) it has submitted its
application for WTOaccession.

113.    Measuresto be supported under the proposed PRSC II.The reformprogram supported
under PRSC 11in this thematic area is based on analysis of key constraints, the Government's
strategy as described above, and following on from the reforms undertaken with support from
PRSC I.Inaddition to a number o f non-bolded actions, the Government has implemented the
following bolded actions prior to PRSC 11: (i)    Finalization of a Privatization Action Plan and
commence implementation of agreed measures for accelerating privatization program; (ii)
adoption of revised telecommunications policy allowing for partial liberalization of the
telecommunications sector; and (iii)      reviewing the micro- and rural finance strategy and
developing an actionplanto improve accessto micro- andrural finance.

114.    Progressinimplementingreforms supportedby PRSC II.        Since PRSC I, Government
                                                                                  the
has introduced several new measures to improve the business environment. Progress has been
made in drafting a WTO memorandum for final submission to the WTO Secretariat and in
preparation andapproval o f a new law on standards to be approvedby the Council o fMinisters.
To ensure a level playing field for all the economic agents, moreover, the Government has
commenced the implementation o f the Competition Law, which was passed last year. The
Investigating Commission and the Secretariat have been established within the MoTI and the
members for the former body have been recently appointed, including representatives o f the
public and private sectors. The Ministry plans to utilize the Domestic Trade Department as the
secretariat for the Competition Commission. With the support o f the PRSC process, and in
collaboration with the IMF, the Government i s undertakinga restructuring o f the        to bring
its NpLs below 20% over a four-year period. Indications are that the implementation o f the
restructuring plan is on track. The concertedefforts o f the NBEhave resulted inthe design of a
credit reporting system (sharing o f information on borrowers) that is now fully functional, well
ahead of the original schedule, and i s being actively used by the financial institutions in their
loan analysis process. Another area where good progress was made concems the initiative to
allow foreim exchangeaccounts for non-residentEthiopians inthe Diaspora.

115.     Regardingthe prior action for PRSC11onprivatization, the Governmenthaspreparedits

revitalization of the privatization effort. Regardingthe prior action on rural and micro-finance,
staff consider the Government's action planand initial actions implementedto provide a strong
basis for the strengthening o f the MFIs and laying the ground for the hture growth o fthe sector.



                                                 35

Regarding the pnor action on adoption of a revised telecommunications policy allowing for
partial liberalization of the telecommunications sector, as discussed earlier, while the
Government has issued a Letter o f Communication Sector Policy, in the opinion of the Bank
staff, the Government's policy statement is inadequate givenits lack of a financing plan or policy
moves to help sustain the very ambitious goals; nor are there policies planned to attract larger
financing from the private sector. The Bank will continue its dialogue with the Government in
this important area, particularly via technical and analytical assistance exploring financing
options and fiscal analysis.

116.     Measures to be supported under the Drowsed PRSC III.The proposed reform program
to be supported under PRSC 111inthis thematic area is based on analysis ofkey constraints, the
Government's strategy as described above, and following on from the reforms undertaken with
support from PRSC II.In addition to a number of non-bolded actions, the Government has
committed itself to implement the following (bolded) actions prior to PRSC 111: (i)       ensure that
the new privatization plan is under full implementation; (ii)effective implementation of
competition policy; (iii)  complete the business process re-engineering o f DBE and initiate an
action plan(HR, top management, financing, products); and (iv) offer CBB for sale.

(ii)     Theme11: RuralDevelopmentand Vulnerability

Overview

117.     Ethiopian agriculture remains low-input, low value and subsistence oriented. The basic
challenges are increasing agricultural productivity, facilitating efforts to intensify the use of high
potential lands under production (including through increased irrigation), supporting the
development of markets for agricultural products, and promoting the commercialization o f
smallholder farming. Supporting 85% of Ethiopia's population, agriculture represents just under
45% of GDP. The aggregate figures mask large regional variations: people in some high
potential areas do better, while inthe chronically food insecure regions, incomes are lower and
more volatile as a result of which up to 10% of Ethiopia's population needs annual income or
food aid in order to survive. The rural sector (comprised primarily of small private sector
enterprises - e.g.,   farms and small businesses) stands to benefit substantially from an
improvement in the overall investment climate to be generated through approaches outlined
above.

118.     The use of fertilizers expanded quickly in the early 1990s.            However, despite a
significant increase in 2003/04 following the end of the drought, fertilizer use is still low, with
the average use below that for other SSA countries. Among the critical factors affecting the use
and effectiveness of fertilizers are lack of advisory services on the optimal use o f fertilizers, an
inefficient and noncompetitive delivery system, lack of access to finance for purchase, and risk-
aversion on the part of farmers in face of weather induced uncertainty. To address some of these
concerns, the extension service is starting to extricate itself from delivery of credit and fertilizers
to allow it to focus on the delivery o f technological know-how. Towards this end, farmers'
training centers are beingbuilt, and the training of extension workers is well advanced (15,000 in
school). However, market-oriented distribution systems for fertilizers and other inputs remains
to be established, and the extension system needs to become more demand driven and its advice
adapted to local ago-climatic conditions. Microfinance institutions (MF1s)-including           savings
and loans cooperatives-are     expanding rapidly under an improved regulatory framework. To



                                                 36

promote lending for agncultural inputs and productivity enhancing investments, there remains a
needto develop instruments to sharerisks, particularly weather relatedrisks.

119.     Rapid land degradationremains a critical issue for enhancing and sustainingagricultural
productivity. Soilnutrient depletion and environmental degradationappear substantial. The most
important source o f cooking fuel is firewood, used by almost 75 percent of households. About
one in six householdsuses mainly dung cakes, resulting ina continuous depletion of the soil at
alarming rates. Estimates suggest a negative effect from environmental degradationinthe order
of magnitude o f a 3-5% decline of in agricultural productionper year due to soil and nutrient
loss. This points to the strongpotential growth effects o fconservationmeasures.

120.     The commercialization agenda has been initiated, but has a long way to go: functioning
and efficient input and output markets are essentialto provide the farmers the right incentives to
respond.    The investment climate agenda outlined above i s critically important for the
development o f competitive markets andprivate sector participation. Inaddition, there i s a need
for proactive public sector role, to invest in market infkastructure and market institutions to
reduce transaction costs, piloting and scaling up the warehousereceipts system, more systematic
compilation and publication of price and market intelligence, and the expansion o f the role o f
the rural non-farm sector and linkages with urban towns to facilitate inputloutput marketing and
adding value to agricultural products. This is a large and important agenda that needs to be
prioritizedandimplementedwith a sense o furgency.

121.     An important lacuna in the understanding of the working of the rural economy and the
effectiveness o f public investment and expenditures is the poor aualitv of information available.
While the CSA efficiently produces an Annual Agricultural Sample Survey, it remains difficult
to monitor progress for many of the rural development indicators in the SDPRP matrix since
these are neither part o f the surveys nor the Ministry o f Agriculture and Rural Development's
own sector information systems. As part o f the PRSC WJBS dialogue it was agreed that the
would work systematically with the multi-sector initiative spearheadedby MOFED to strengthen
M&Egovernment-wideinorder to harmonizewithoverall governmentsystems andto strengthen
the capacity to monitor andmanagepublic programs for the agricultural sector and food security.
Similarly, detailed public expenditure data for agricultural programs (including information on
donor commitments) are quite difficult to obtain, especially o f the Food Seurity Program.
MOARD (and MOFED) have agreed that a public expenditure review for rural development
programswill beconductedto be available as soonas possible.

122.     Food insecurity and vulnerability to shocks. Vulnerability in present-day Ethiopia is
highwith almost 50% ofthe population consideredchronically poor, an additional 27% moving
in and out of poverty, and almost 14% who are not poor now but have a highprobability of
falling intopoverty inthe future with a single large shock, suchas drought. The problem o f food
insecurity has become worse inrecent years. The average population inneed o f food aid inthe
past 3 years (2001-2004) has been higher than the historical average 7 years prior (1994-2000,
Figure 4).   Moreover, even these higher recent trends do not capture the severity o f food
insecurity in exceptional years, such as 2003, when over 13 million people required emergency
food aid. The major causes o f food insecurity inEthiopia include land degradation, reliance on
rainfed agriculture, recurrent drought, poor and inadequate management o f risk, population
pressureandsubsistenceagricultural practices characterizedby low-input andlow-output.

123.    The Government has a multi-pronged and balanced rural development strategy.              It
encourages exploration and expansion onto new lands while also focusing on raising the
productivity of existing farms (through continued focus on technology generation and transfer,,
soil and water conservation, and the intensification and commercialization of smallholder
agriculture).   It calls for expanded production of food crops but also promotes commercial and
export oriented production. Diversification of livelihoods and exports via increased livestock
production i s also part of the strategy. And it has ambitious proposals for irrigation development
butalso maintains a central andstrategic focus onrainfedfarming (not least since that is goingto
continue to be the dominantfarmtype for the foreseeable future).

124.    Over the last decade, the Government has undertaken initiatives to pursue this strategy,
through liberalizing input and output markets, and investing heavily in the generation and
adoption of improved technological packages. These efforts yielded positive but overall limited
results. Further reforms to commodity markets are still needed, as is the development o f basic
market infrastructure.        Several regional governments have passed legislation to improve
perceptions of land tenure security and enhance transferability of land inrural areas, which are
expected to lay the basis for increased investments in land. Progress on land certification and
cadastral systems has been slower. Also a priority is the development of institutions to enable
the emergence of financial markets and provide support for private sector investments in rural
areas. Public sector investments in capacity building (applied training in agriculture) for the
rural population, in agricultural research, and in agricultural extension are cornerstones o f the
Government's strategy to increase productivity and profitability in the farm sector.          Public
investments in water management and conservation are also central to the Government's
intended investments in the sector. Overcrowding on arable lands under cultivation has led the

Government to develop programs to assist farmers in moving to new unused lands (see the
paragraph below onresettlement) andindiversifylng intonon-farm livelihoods.

125.     Despite recent progress, in general, market-oriented agricultural inputs supply systems
are far from being in place and functioning in Ethiopia. Fertilizer supply, in particular, is
dominated by a few (three in2003/04) large fertilizer importer/wholesalers and cooperatives; and
extension agents continue to devote a substantial amount o f their time and effort in facilitating
fertilizer supply and administering state guaranteed credit. This crowds out other suppliers,
particularly the small and medium scale traders and retailers, from the fertilizer trade - limiting
competition and efficiency, and the potential gains through reduced farmgate prices and timely
delivery. Over the past two years the Government has started to disengage its extension agents in
the direct distribution of fertilizedinputs and this general policy direction is a welcome
development. Inthe view of the JBS partners, however, progress has been slow and there is
scope to intensify and accelerate the pace o f disengagement. Existing studies having identified a
number of areas where actions can be taken to improve the market-orientation and functioning of
fertilizer markets.    An important additional point to note is that the growth in access to
alternative credit sources from MFIs will enable a smooth phase-out of the regional government
credit guarantees fix fertilizer.   The available evidence suggests that this growth has been
positive and i s not likely to be constraining the pace of the phase out of the guarantee, although
more development is needed of MFIproducts that can bear weather-related risks. Ins u ~ m a r y ,
therefore, the Bank's assessment is that while the Government's strategic direction is indeed
market-oriented, the pace of implementation performance can be andneeds to be improved. The
continuing dialogue will also focus on developing a clear set of measurable indicators and agree
on definitions, such as for disengagement by agricultural extension workers from fertilizer
distribution.

126.     Food Security Prorrram. To address many of these issues, the Government has recently
revitalized a Food Security Program with several components, including voluntary resettlement
to new land, and the shift away fromreliance on annualized emergency appeals to a more stable,
predictable and development-oriented safety net programfinanced via cash.


   0     Resettlement. Regarding the resettlement initiative, after the initial phase of 2002/03,
         2003/04 saw the continued implementation of the program inAmhara, Oromiya, Tigray
         and SNNPR regions. A numberof field assessments of this year's experience (by DPPC,
         UN agencies, donors, and NGOs) revealed mixed results, both between and within
         regions. A recent World Bank mission concluded that the resettlement program is well
         designed, and with minor modifications can become consistent with World Bank
         acceptable standards on resettlement. Implementation in many sites, however, shows
         departures from design guidelines. In some sites this has led to crisis situations for
         resettled households. The mission identified three broad actions, which would address
         this gap between design and implementation. FirxtZy, Government capacity (and related
         financing) needs to be enhanced through training, increased deployment of staff on the
         ground and identification of partners. Secondly, more fully elaborated manuals and
         materials should be made available to regional and local officials responsible for
         implementation and monitoring.          ThirdZy, checklists should be built into the
         implementation process to assure that all conditions are inplace for successful transition
         fromone phaseto the next.

   0    Productive Safetv Net.       Regarding the new Productive Safety Net program, the
        Government plans to start implementation in 262 chronically food insecure woredas
        from January 2005.      The reform involves various aspects of the current system for
        providing support to chronically food insecure households, including: (a) improving
        guidelines for the transparent identification of beneficiaries, and providingcommunities
        with training in these guidelines to ensure their effective application; (b)using
        participatory planning approaches to promote community planning as the basis for
        prioritizing public works projects; (c) placing a strong emphasis on integrating activities
        into public works with a critical watershed management framework; (d) ensuring the
        availability of appropriate technical support from local andregional government to make
        certain that the assets created are adequately designed; (e) providingcritical non-transfer
        costs (capital inputs and program overheads) to ensure that the public works program
        creates assets as well as provides transfers; and (f) ensuring that the safety net is scalable
        so that intimes of increasedneed, the safety netprogramcan expand to cover that need,
        without automatically resorting to an international emergency appeal. Different agencies
        have agreed to work in a harmonized approach within a common safety net framework
        led by the Government using coordinated resource channels-food                    and cash,
        Governmentandnon-Govemment. Measures are also beingdiscussedto identifyhowto
        improve synergies between cash/food aid-based safety nets andmarket development.

WorldBank Support

127.    Existing investment proiects, pipeline projects. and AAA. As a cornerstone of the
SDPRP, the rural growthand vulnerability agenda is supported by the Bankthrough a number of
instruments. The PRSC series provides the focal point for the Bank's dialogue with Government
on rural and vulnerability-related policy issues. In FY03, IDA delivered an Energy Access
Credit ($132.7 million) to support electrification of new (mostly rural) areas covering nearly a
million people, and to improve management of biomass energy.             The Pastoral Community
Development Project ($30 million grant), also delivered in FY03, aims to empower pastoral
communities to better manage local development, improve infrastructure, increase and diversifjr
incomes, increase access to public services, and reduce the risk from drought and other natural
disasters. A FoodSecurity Project (FY03) to support household asset development inchronically
food insecure areas is under implementation. A Rural Development Review, currently under
preparation, aims to contribute towards a better understanding of the factors affecting
agricultural productivity and the development of more effective agricultural markets. It will
identify an agenda of actions to contribute to productivity growth as well as better functioning
markets. It will also investigate the feasibility of weather-based or other insurance mechanisms.
An IDAAPL has beenprepared as a complement to PRSC 11(FY05) to support the transition to
and consolidation of the Productive Safety Net, and to ensure its linkages to the other
interventions inthe Food Secuirty Program. The CAS had identified a Rural Capacity Building
project and a Decentralized Infrastructure Fund to support rural growth inFY05; however, these
projects have had to be deferred until the next CAS due to the unavailability of funds under IDA-

security and a directive to establish appropriate land administration institutions in four major
regions; increasing the percentage of extension staff with no responsibility for delivery of inputs
and credit and reducingregonal government guarantees for input credits; completion o f the risk
mitigation plan for access to new land and adoption of guidelines; and passage o f the
environmental legislation.

129.    Measures to be supported under the uroDosed PRSC II.Inaddition to a number of non-
bolded actions, the Government has implemented the following (bolded) action prior to PRSC II:
(i) institutionalarrangements,implementationmodalitiesandmonitoringmechanismsfor
   Define
a system ofmulti-annual productive safety nets andbegin implementation.

130.    Progress in implementing. reforms supported bv PRSC II. Fertilizer sales through
regional credit guarantees is still an important unresolved issue and the subject of continued
dialogue. It was agreed in the PRSC Ipolicy matrix that the volume of fertilizer sold with
regional credit guarantees would be reduced from 200,000 MT to 100,000 MT in2003/04. The
Government's position in this regard is that considering the increasing volume of fertilizer
supply for the year 2003/04, it is unrealistic that 314th of this total supply will be distributed
without credit guarantees. Thus, sale of fertilizer through regional state credit guarantees was
maintained at 200,000 MT for the just ended fiscal year (2003/04).       The Government stresses
that given this increase in total fertilizer volume, the 200,000 MT which has received credit
guarantees does constitute a smaller share o f total fertilizer sales as compared to the previous
year and represents progress. During the Appraisal mission the Government has proposed a
revised schedule to phase out fertilizer credit guarantees. Another importantunresolved issue is
the extent of disengagement of extension staff from other activities, namely input delivery and
credit administration, so that they can concentrate on delivering advisory services to farmers.
The government agreed that by PRSC It, the extension agents would be l l l y relieved of these
responsibilities, but progress inthis direction has so far been limited. The government had also
planned an in-depthreview o f the current fertilizer marketing system with a view to developing
an action plan to reform the sector and promote competition and efficiency at all levels o f the
supply chain. The study has been delayed but terms of reference have now been developed and
the study is scheduled to be completed in EFY 1997.            The completion o f the study and
development of a fertilizer policy based on the recommendations is an agreed action to be
completed prior to PRSC III.Preparations for piloting the warehouse receipts system have been
completed and the pilot is ready for implementation and evaluation inthe context of the coming
harvest.

131.    On resettlement guidelines, a circular has been issued to the regions by MoFED stating
that access to the Federal Food Security Grant would be contingent on achieving minimum
standards outlined in the risk mitigation guidelines. The June 2004 mission led by a safeguards
team from the World Bank to review the current guidelines and implementation experience,
made recommendations on ways to strengthen and enforce the safeguards for the next stage of
implementation.    The mission recommended revisions to the December 2003 guidelines.
Revised guidelines incorporating environmental and social risk mitigation measures have also
been prepared with guidance from the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA). In order to
ensure better success of the program, dissemination and widespread application of these revised
guidelines needs to be prioritized, together with adequate awareness and capacity-building
measures undertaken at local implementation levels.




                                                41

132.    The Government has moved with speed over the last year to reform the existing
emergency mechanism to respond to chronic household food insecurity towards establishing a
more productive andefficient safety net svstem. Towards this end, the Government has issueda
parliamentary proclamation shiftingthe mandate for responding to chronic food insecurity from
the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) to the Food Security Program.
The DPPC will focus on response to acute food insecurity (i.e., genuineemergencies) as well as
providing logistic support to the safety net under the FSP. The Government has also prepareda
detailed Program Implementation Manual laying out procedures and institutional arrangements
for the Productive Safety Net program, and has launched an extensive awareness creation and
training cascade for the new program.

133.    Measuresto be suuuortedunder the urouosedPRSC III.Inaddition to a number ofnon-
bolded actions, the Governmenthas agreed to implement the following (bolded) actions prior to
PRSC 111, in support o f its rural development program: (i) Capacity-building program for rural
development defined and developed, finalized, and implementation initiated; and (ii)    Conduct
study to explore the options for reformingthe market structure for the important anddistribution
segments o f the fertilizer market; and adopt and implement policy to reform the fertilizer
marketing system, basedionthe study's recommendations.



(iii)   Theme   m: HumanDevelopment          Outcomes

Overview

134.     Sincethe advent o fthe newregime in 1991, Ethiopia has escalatedits public spending in
the social sectors and has seen significant progress in key social indicators, especially in
education. Yet, recent analysis indicates that progress needs to be sharply accelerated if the
MDGs are to be met. Issuesconstrainingprimary service delivery ineducation and health are
related to sectoral policies and also weaknesses inthe cross-cutting areas o f public expenditure
management systems. As such, much of the reforms highlightedunder the Public Expenditure
and Institutional Performancetheme (see below) have a direct bearing on the predictability and
effectiveness of public spending in the social sectors. In addition, sector-specific actions are
required, which are discussedbelow.

 135.    Education, ne    very           of    Figure 5: Gross Primary Enrollment (percent)
the expansion in coverage o f primary
education (see earlier and also Figure 5)
casts light on growing problems-proxy          80
measures for education quality are             70
moving inthe wrong direction, including
pupil-teacher ratios, student- textbook
ratios, class size, availability of non-
salary recurrent budgets for instructional     30 -
materials, and continued low enrolment         20 -
rates in many rural and most pastoral
areas.    Despite the recent progress,
Ethiopia's low primary completion rates
are symptomatic o f a delivery system



                                                42

that is marked by: highwastage inthe form of low school completion rates; over-crowding and
lack of instructional materials; insufficient numbers o f qualified teachers, especially at the
secondary level; and infrastructure inadequacies and highconstruction costs.

136.     First, given that conditions widely vary between rural and urban areas, different time-
bound targets for urban and rural areas is a practical necessity. Inurban areas most children
enter grade 1 and reach grade 8. By contrast, giventhat less than half the rural children ineach
age cohort enter grade 1, and of those who do, only 55 percent survive to grade 4 and only 19%
to grade 8, a phased approach to universalizing 8 years of basic education may be the only
feasible approach.

137.     Second, the highdropout rates, especially prior to Grade 5 mean that manystudents leave
school before they are filly literate or numerate. Providing quality education is critical to
reducing repetition and dropout and to ensuring desired learning outcomes from the schooling
process.   Unless over-crowding is reduced in the most-egregious cases to a maximum of 75
students per section and textbooks and other learning aids are available to each student and
present in each classroom, student performance will lag behind enrollment increases, ultimately
lowering the returns to individuals and society and contributing to investment "wastage".
Strategies for defining and delivering minimal "instructional packages" and incentives for
ensuring acceptable learning conditions in classrooms are required before enrollment increases
can be translated intolearning outcomes.

138.     Third, with a base of nearly 9 million primary students, even a marginal increase in
enrollmenthas profoundimplications for the size ofthe teaching force, especially inlight ofthe
desire to reduce the number o f classrooms with section sizes in excess of pedagogically sound
limits. For the foreseeable future, teacher supply will fall short of the numbers required for
enrollmentincreases. More flexibilityinteacher certificationandhiringpolicies will berequired
by authorities at the regional and woreda levels ifmediumtermgoals are to be met. A review o f
teacher certification procedures at national, regional and local authority levels may berequired if
fiscal resources are to be used more creatively and with greater flexibility during a rapidperiod
of expansion.     The increased use of alternative basic education delivery system, facilitators,
multi-grade teaching and small schools in order to reach children in the most remote rural
localities are being considered.

139.     FindZy, with unit costs for school construction averaging          $16,000 per classroom
block-well     above Sub-Saharan Africa norms-more          attention needs to be paid to school
locations andnew, lower cost designs for facilities.

140.     Health. The health sector inEthiopia is characterized by low levels of per capita public
fundingandlow levels of coverage of the population. Inequities exist interms of outcomes and
utilization rates between rural-urban areas, income levels, andregions. Althoughutilization rates
of health services vary based on income levels, absolute utilization rates are still low across all
income quintiles. While coverage of PHC and first-level referral facilities have expanded in
recent years, with the potential health coverage of Government health facilities increasing to
61%, utilization rates have only marginally increased from 0.25 in 1996 to 0.29 in 2002/03
(MOHRPD 2002/03)-slightly         less than a thirdof the Health Sector Development Program goal
for 2004/05 o f one annual visit per person. Increases inthe number of health facilities have not
generated the expected improvement in utilization rates. Poor coverage and utilization rates



                                                  43

suggest that facility expansion would need to be accompanied by both quality improvements and
demand side interventions. Recent analybcal work via the Country Status Report for Health
indicate that a large impact on reducing infant and child mortality rates of small marginal
expenditure increases on outreach, prevention, andbehavior change programs can be expected.

141.    The analysis also indicates
the need to identify and address the        Figure 6: Trends inGrowthofHealthProfessionals,
                                                                1996/97-2001/02
determinants   of the     scarcity of
trained health workers at various
levels. There is a severe human             14,000

resource constraint     especially of
highly skilled health personnel such        10,000
as physicians (Figure 6). The dearth        8,000
of health workers       is intimately       6,000
related   to high attrition      rates
prevailing among health personnel,          4,000

especially in m a l locations, gven a       2.000

weak incentive structure to retain              0

qualified personnel.    Moreover the
analysis also identifies a gap in the
existing human resource strategy in
relation to personnel who are able to      Source: MOH/PPD. Health and Health RelatedIndicators. FMOH,
                                           2no2/0.3
perform skilled deliveries and other
slightly more complex clinical functions. Althoughthe HealthExtension Package (HEP) program
when combined with the community extension services is expected to reduce child and infant
mortality rates, as well as the number of women dying through a reduction in number of
pregnancies, it would only have a limited impact on the maternal mortality ratio, i.e. the
proportionof women dyingbecause ofpregnancy related causes. Reducingthis ratio will require
an increase in the availability o f skilled health professionals who can performclinical services,
particularly skilled deliveries but also basic emergency obstetrical care.            Actions would also
needto be taken to improve abortion safety.

142.    Untilrecently there was no clear institutional framework for multi-sectoral coordination
ofnutritionactivities. While the FMOHnotes that a purely health sector interventionwill not be
sufficient to achieve better nutrition outcomes, the lack of clear institutional leadership for a
framework to address malnutrition has been seen by many as a binding constraint to making
progress. It has now been confirmed by MOFED, however, that the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development has been given this mandate. Giventhe very high child malnutritionlevels
in Ethiopia, MOARD's coordination of food availability, child health services, and nutrition-
related education services will play an important role.

143.     The contraceptive prevalence rate has substantially increased from a low 4% inthe early
1990s to 21.4 % in 2003, but the increase has been much slower in rural areas and hides
significant regional variation. Knowledge of modern methods and women's approval o f the
advantages of family planningare very higheven inrural areas (85% for married women). It is
striking that the level of unmet need, i.e. the proportion of women who want to space (22%) or
limit (14%) births yet do not do it, is extremely large at 36% nationally. Tackling the supply of
family planninginthe highfertilityrural areas o fthese regions appears to be a priority agenda.



                                                   44

144.    HIV/AIDS. The prevalence of HIV increased rapidly duringthe 199Os, and Ethiopia is
currently classified as a country with a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic. By the end o f 2001,
there were 2.1 millionchildren and adults inEthiopia livingwith HIV/AIDS. About 6.6 percent
of the adult population in2001 was estimated to be affected by HIV/AIDS. AlthoughEthiopia
constitutes only 1 percent of the world's population, it contributes 7 percent of the world's
HIV/AIDS cases, and interms of the number of infectedpersons, Ethiopia ranksfifth after South
Afiica, Nigeria, Kenya and Zimbabwe in SSA. It is also estimated that 1 million out of an
estimated 3 million orphans in Ethiopia are the result of AIDS-related adult deaths.
Antiretroviral therapies are being introduced inthe country andare expected to rapidly expand to
cover more AIDS cases with financing fromthe Global Fundandthe U.S. President's Emergency
Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR), with NO0 million in grants expected over five years. Another
sign of progress is the expansion inthe number o f voluntary counseling andtesting centers from
less than 10 in,1999/00 to about 175 at present; this number is expected to increase rapidly with
the scale-up ofARV treatment.

145.    While the SDPRP recognizes the importance of addressing HIV/AIDS in a
comprehensive way, the staff considers that there is a lack of a clear M&E system to assess
progress. A fifth "AIDS in Ethiopia" report made public in mid-October, 2004 states that the
estimated national adult prevalence in2003 is 4.4%, withurbanprevalence rate at 12.6 % andthe
rural rate being 2.6 %. The report notes that the analysis and estimates of the different derived
variables on the National Sentinel Survey (NSS) show that the national HIV prevalence as well
as the absolute numbers are lowerthanthose of 2001. Itis difficult to establish how much ofthis
change is due to the expanded database particularly inrural sites and also due to the use o f more
robust analytical soft ware (EPP), andhowmuch is an actual decline.

146.    Water and sanitation. Access to services such as water and sanitation is limited. Only
15 percent of Ethiopians have access to improved sanitation compared to the SSA average of
54.8 percent. Access to clean drinkingwater is slightly better at 24 percent, but it is still much
lower than the SSA average of 55.4 percent. Twenty percent of childmortalityis due to diarrhea,
mostly because of the lack of access to clean water. While it is clear that access to clean
drinkingwater and sanitation services is very low inrural areas andis likely to be an important
factor in constraining better health, nutrition, and education outcomes, this area does not appear
tohavereceived sufficient attention fromthe donor community.

GovernmentStrategy

147.    Performance with respect to key human development indicators point to the need for
evaluating trade-offs in policy reforms. In both education and health sectors, new tools have
been made available to government at the federal level to help policy-makers assess financing
trade-offs and choices. It is expected that these policy tools will be of critical importance inthe
coming twelve months, when Governmentwill develop and finalize their next 3-5 year education
and health strategies.   The PRSC policy matrix is expected to be intimately linked to the
objectives andpolicy directions contained inthese strategies.

148.     Education. According to the Ministry of Education's WOE) estimates for achieving the
MDGs, based on the World Bank-MOE simulation model, the recurrent expenditures on
education will need to double from 3 to 6 percent of GDP at present levels of unit cost and under
the current system structure inorder to meet the MDGs. With this inmind, Government is now



                                                 45

considering taking several measures to reduce education costs. In particular, options under
consideration include eliminating the teacher specialization between grades 4-8 and focusing
community schools built with low-cost designs in order to improve demand in marginalized
areas. Due to wide variations in population concentrations across and within regions, most
notably inpastoralist areas, increaseduse o fmulti-grade schools andmore flexible assignment of
teachers are under consideration to provide access to the most underserved-and              often the
poorest-segments     ofsociety.

149.    Considerable effort has been invested inthe secondary level ICT instructional innovation
program but delays inimplementation prevent an analysis of its effectiveness untilnext year. An
unprecedented number of in-depth studies, including the Education Country Status Report
prepared by a World Bank-Ministry of Education team and subsequent development of the
related Education Policy Simulation Model by the team, have helped to consolidate information
about the system, both its characteristics and its forthcoming challenges, and options for
expansion of the education system in a fiscally viable and pedagogically sound manner. These
data and findings will help to illuminate policy discussions that will form the basis for the policy
directions to be outlined in the Education Sector Development Program HI- the National
Education Strategy (2005-2008). These efforts, and others, are significant accomplishments,
especially considering that they have taken place during a period of broad-scale and rapid
decentralization.

150.    Health.   Given the findings regarding determinants of access to health services, the
Government has decided to institute a mobile, community-based "health extension worker" cadre
of female workers. The objectives of this new cadre is to increase the focus on prevention,
improve the fhctions of the Health Posts-the      lowest tier of the facility-based care system-and
expand community-based outreach services. The introduction of the health extension program
should to some extent alleviate the staff shortage, particularly in rural areas. Other incentives,
however, are needed to attract and retain highly skilled health personnel. For example, SNNPR
has been providing additional allowances to staff working in remote areas and has also been
crediting a year o f service inthese areas as two years of service.

151.    Previous Government policy on providingreproductive health services including family
planning through fixed points was insufficient to address the need for family planningservices
(PER 2003). Inthis regard, the Health Extension Program, which complements facility- based
care using a cadre o f female extension workers, can also serve as the major instrument or channel
for providing both MCH and FP/reproductive health services.               Experience in neighboring
countries (mainly Tanzania but also Mozambique ) shows that a decrease of 30% inUnder Five
Mortality has been observed with an additional US$0.5 per capita invested at district level on
high-impact outreach activities. However, other strategies to improve access to clinical services
inorder to addressmaternal mortalityare needed. Forexample, providingin-service training in
phases to qualified HEWScould be considered as a possible option. There are also goodpractices
in the regions from which lessons can be derived. For example, the Tigray RHE3 has been
collaborating with Mekele University and regional hospitals to providing additional training to
healthofficers so that they can performsome surgical procedures inhealth centers.

152.    A key outstanding issue relates to actual public spending levels on basic health. In
HSDP n, MOB had a target to increase the health sector share of the public budget to 8.2% by
2004/05. A review o f data available for 2003/04 and previous years indicate that while the



                                                 46

allocations are heading in the right direction and have regularly increased, actual expenditures
are less than budgeted amounts; the gap is particularly significant inthe case of regional capital
expenditures. This pattern of apparent underspending needs to be investigated further by a public
expenditure tracking analysis, including the ability of the financial system to track disaggregated
sub-sectoral expenditures. It needs to be noted, however, that HSDP divides the health program
into 8 sub-sector components, while the financial system does not allow reporting of
expenditures by these sub-sectors. It is therefore dificult to determine if activities identified
under HSDP are financed at levels plannedjointly by Government and donors.

153.    There is also concern regarding the continued slow progress in the development o f a
comprehensive Human Resource Development policy and strategy for HSDP ID and IV
particularly with consideration of the proposed significant expansion o f humanresources in the
context of the Health Extension Program and inplanningfor the MDGs.

154.    While decentralization is meant to foster local ownership and management of
government services,      there are practical challenges that are inherent in Ethiopia's
implementation of its decentralization policy. These encompass, but also go beyond, the health
sector andit wouldbe importantto identifyways to motivate the woredas to focus their attention
onhealthpriorities. What mechanisms can be usedto motivate and influence local planningand
implementation? For example, S N " has started piloting performance-based contracts with its
woreda officers and Tigray has also embarked onperformance based agreements and it wouldbe
importantto learnfromthese andother regional experiences.

155.    Finally, in order to better assess sector performance, improvement in the health M I S is
also needed. During the HSDP Annual Review, there was general agreement that there is an
urgent need for more simplified formats inorder to improve timeliness and quality o freporting.

156.    HIV/AIDS.       Performance of the Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS program continues to
improve, and greater collaboration with NGOs and civil society is apparent but needs further
strengthening. Antiretroviral therapies are being introduced in the country and are expected to
rapidly expand to cover more AIDS cases with financing from the Global Fundand PEPFAR,
with WOO million ingrants expected over five years. Another sign of progress is the expansion
inthe number ofVoluntaryCounseling andTesting (VCT) centers fromless than 10in1999/00
to about 175 at present; this number is expected to increase rapidly with the scale-up o f ARV
treatment. As antiretroviral therapies are being introduced in the country and are expected to
rapidly expand to cover all declared AIDS cases, there is also the need to assess the impact o f
ART expansion onthe public health system andidentify the requiredinputsto address the added
burden on the service delivery structures. An important recent development, moreover, is a
marked shift from awareness creation to emphasis onBahavioral Change Communication PCC).
Similarly muchmore emphasis is given to interventions that target the youth.

 157.   HIV sentinel surveillance data for 2003104 is being analyzed and should be available
soon. This round relies on a significantly increased number of sites included in the analysis
together with a greater urbadrural balance and improved sample size. Preliminary unofficial
reports indicate that the prevalence rate may be lower than the rate for the previous year. This,
however, does not necessarily imply reduction in prevalence of HIV but may merely be a
reflection o f changes in the composition of sentinel sites from year to year and changing of
methodologies for the calculation of incidence andprevalence rates.

World Bank Support

158.    Existing investment projects, pipeline uroiects, and AAA. Consistent with the CAS, the
Bank's main vehicle for providingfinancial support to the education sector is the PRSC series
following the recent closing of the Education Sector Development Program credit. The Bankhas
also completed a comprehensive analysis of determinants and policy trade-offs related to basic
education outcomes via its AAA, the Education Country Status Report. Inaddition, buildingon
the findings of the Higher Education Study, a Post-Secondary Education credit (FY05 for $40
million) will be presented to the Boardin September 2004. The project is designed to improve
quality and standards of non-agricultural technical and vocational training and improve the
management and quality of instruction of universities. Similar to the evolution of Bank support
to the education sector, IDA support to the health sector is being shifted from a sector-wide
approach to the PRSC instrument. The Bank is supporting the Government in strengthening the
analyhcal basis for policy-making and reforms through the Health Country Status Report that
will be completed inearly FY05. IDA continues to provide support through the Multisectoral
HIV/AIDS project, and has worked with the Government and municipalities to strengthen
outreach efforts to youth. Work is also continuing to increase the mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS
interventions across the Bank's portfolio of operations, and the roads and education sectors are
best practices inthis regard.

Implementation Progress

159.    Measures supported under PRSC I.Inaddition to a number of non-bolded actions, as a
prior action for PRSC-I, the Government adopted guidelines defining the minimumpackage of
services at woreda level including the health extension program andrelatedroles for healthposts
andhealth centers.

160.    Measures to be sumorted under the proposed PRSC II.The PRSC series builds on the
Bank's prior support to the heath and education sector programs.* In addition to a number of
non-bolded actions, the Government has implemented the following (bolded) action prior to
PRSC 11: (i) design options and guidelines for primary school construction with lower
              Federal
unitcosts andcommunityparticipation are validated andadoptedbyallRegions.

161.    Progress in implementing reforms sumorted by PRSC II.A robust analysis of multi-
sector determinants and costing; of MDGs has commenced.             The Government, UNDP, the
Development Assistance Group (DAG), the Millenium Project, and the World Bank are all
contributing towards developing this analysis, which is expected to be includedwithinthe APR.

162.    In education, over the course of the past few months the Government has developed
school construction designs for primary schools to reduce the unit costs o f construction, and to
enable communities to build schools closer to villages, with greater involvement of community
members themselves. Government has also agreed to undertake a detailed supplydemand study
of teacher production and medium term impact on the wage bill. A program is also being
implemented to revise and strengthen both pre- and in-service teacher training.        MOE has
undertaken a second LearningAssessment at Grades 4 and 8 andthe data is being analyzed. The

                                               48

assessment is expected to yield its first results in a few months and will help to measure the
qualityo finstructioninclassrooms andto target more effectivelyresources and technical inputs.

163.      The Government's Health Extension Program has started providing training. The
responsibilities and linkage o f the workers to the nearest health institutions, the strategy for their
deployment and the possible fiscal congestion implications of the cadre-all           continue to be
major topics of discussion as part of PRSC IIprogramdialogue. It should be noted that while the
HEP has been defined, there have been repeated delays in fmalization of the minimumservice
delivery standards for all four tiers inhealth service delivery. Regarding other areas, the HSDP
review calendar has also been synchronized with the SDPRP calendar, whereby the semi-annual
HSDP review meetings will be regularly scheduled for June and September each year. It is also
encouraging to note that of the three SDPRP output indicators two o f the three are ahead of the
stated targets for 2002/2003, CPR 21.46% achieved vs target of 20%, EPI 50.24% vs target of
50%. However in relation to the third indicator, percentage of deliveries attended by skilled
attendants, the target has not been reached 9.01 vs target of 15% and there is a need for
clarification of the baseline, an understanding of the underachievement and possible revision of
the targets for 2004-2005.        Finally, regarding developing a strategy for human resource
development within the health sector, the Government has conducted a nursing study in
collaboration with IC"and is designing a labour market survey in conjunction with the World
Bank which should contribute to the body of knowledge necessary for the completion of the
sectoral humanresources development strategy.

164.      In order to strengthen the estimates and understanding of HIV/AIDS prevalence in
Ethiopia, the Government has now established a task force to conduct a national biological
survey, which is expected to generate a muchmore reliable HIV prevalence rate.

165.       Measures to be suuuorted under the prouosed PRSC III.The Government is currently in
the process of preparing its policy framework and 5-year strategy for bothEducation and Health
sectors via the preparation of ESDP 111and HSDP III.In addition to a number of non-bolded
actions, the Government has agreed to implement the following (bolded) action prior to PRSC
III,insupportofitshumandevelopmentprogram:                  (i) 111andHSDP111prepared,

consultations heldwith stakeholders, finalized, and implementation begun.

(iv)       Theme IV: Public Expenditure andInstitutional Performance

Overview

166.       In its third and current phase of state transformation, launched since 2003, the
Government has deepened its efforts to runa range of parallel public sector reform programs to
r e a d e r state-society relations including (i) woreda (district level) decentralization program
                                                 a
that rapidly transferred delivery responsibilities with substantial fiscal and administrative
authority to ruraljurisdictions; (ii)  municipal reform efforts designed to restructure and empower
urban centers; (iii)   reformulated civil service reforms focused increasingly on strengthening the
public sector fiduciary framework and service delivery results on the ground; (iv) bold nation-
wide initiatives to enhance connectivity and develop e-government applications such as the
woreda- and school-net projects; (v) efforts to strengthen formal checks and balances and
accountability mechanisms throughreformof the justice system including the courts, law making
and law enforcement institutions, and the legislative process; and (vi) reform o f urban land
legislations, systems and institutions to facilitate the emergence o f well-functioning landmarkets


                                                   49

in the medium to long term and, in the interim, concrete efforts to improve firms' and
households' ability to obtain land for business and housing; and (vii) an ongoing tax systems
reform program that continues to align tax policy and administration at the federal and regional
level withthe demands of Ethiopia's evolving macro-fiscal policies.

167.     Over this period, and specifically within the past year of the SDPRP cycle, the
Government's public sector reformpriorities have shifted--from    stabilizing public management
systems following rapid decentralization (such as the efforts supported under PRSC1) to
promoting peg?omance across tiers of government. The emerging performance orientation in
Ethiopia's capacity building efforts is relevant to three broad sets of prevailing public
managemtent constraints on SDPRP goals. These are (i)    the need for adequate fiscal instruments
and incentives to meet the investment and recurrent needs of decentralized service delivery in
municipalities and woredas; (ii)    organizational performance barriers that weaken the formal
private sector investment climate, and (iii) the need to maintainthe integrity of public financial
management systems and manage emerging fiduciary risks. Inthe third aand final year of the
current SDPRP cycle, it is envisaged that the focus ofpublic sector reform efforts will increasing
focus on accountability and governance issues, while consolidating gains in performance
orientation.

168.     Adeauacv of fiscal instruments and incentives to meet the investment and recurrent
needs of decentralized service delivery. Over the past decade, significant progress has been
made indeveloping the legal and fiscal -framework for regional states andmore recently, woredas
and municipalities within regions. Ethiopia's intergovernmental system, however, remains a
work-in-progress. While the assignment of regional responsibilities were clarified over the mid-
to late-l990s, the expenditure andrevenue assignments for woredas and municipalitiesinregions
urgently require further clarification and codification.   In addition, the federal-regional and
regional-local system of transfers require further consolidation; fiscal additionality to ensure
predictability and adequacy; alignment with actual expenditure needs; and enforcement of access
rules that provide incentives to performance. Furthermore, it appears that the full costs of the
rapid decentralization process have not been adequately financed.      The consolidated woreda
block grants are at risk of being utilized in part to cover logistics and infrastructure costs of
creating local governments rather than financing the recurrent and investement needs of
particular sectors. Also, under the woreda block grant system, the policy levers to achieve
specific sectoral standards and goals need be strengthened, particularly for priority sectors
funded under the block grant.         Finally, there remain differences between woredas and
municipalities in fiscal rules for the same function. The harmonization of the fiscal instruments
for financing state and own-source functions across rural woredas and urban centers, thus,
remains a priority.

169.     Clearing organizational performance barriers that weaken the formal Drivate sector
investment climate.   Since early 2003, the Government has acknowledged that organizational
bottlenecks, lack of transparency, and inadequate client orientation in Ministries, Authorities,
and Bureaus (MABs) involved directly in providing services to the private sector can
significantly weaken the enabling environment for the formal private sector. At the federal level,
these services include the issuance of investment and other business licenses, customs
administration,  public sector procurement,        revenue administration,   as well as court
administration. Equally important are local level services in urban centers such as issuance of




                                                50

documents related to "vital statistics" and other notary services, land administration and land
development, anda range ofmunicipal services such as water and sanitation, roads, andmarkets.

170.     Maintaining the integrity of public financial manapement svstems and managing
fiduciarv risks. Improvingthe quality o f financial management has been an overridingpriority
for the Government. Advances have been made, butreforms remain a work-in-progress inareas
such as the timeliness of fiscal reporting(especially on outlays o f poverty-reducing spending by
woredas), audit backlogs, and internal control systems. At the federal level for the past two years
MOFEDhas conducted itsbudgeting cycle incompliance withthe financial calendar, issuing the
MEFFandits indicative planningfigures to sub-national levels as abasis for integratedandmore
transparent medium-term planning as per the calendar. In regions fiscal decentralization has
added pressure for bureaudworedas to bringtheir accounts up-todate, roll out the new chart of
accounts and accounting procedures, develop planning modalities, and strengthen other functions
critical for service delivery such as procurement. Especially SNNP Region has demonstrated
significant progress, and has developed its own financial calendar and MEFF. Similar efforts in
urban areas are part o f the unfinished business of municipal reform including in the two city
administrations, Addis Ababa andDire Dawa.

GovernmentStrategy

171.     Over the 2000-2003 period, Ethiopia deepened its state transformation agenda through
the establishment of a capacity buildingsystem (headed by a Ministry of Capacity Buildingand
counterpart institutions across Government tiers) and the implementation o f several public sector
reform programs designed to radically re-order the machinery of the state and its relationship to
society. These programs included (i)     woreda decentralization; (ii) municipal reform; (iii)   civil
service reform; (iv) nation-wide ICT initiatives; (v) reform of the justice system and the
legislative process; and (vi) tax systems reform. InM a y 2003, the Government announced its
intention to rapidly scale up support for the six core public sector reform programs under a
consolidated five-year federal program called the Public Sector Capacity Building Program or
PSCAP. In the months that followed, several bilateral donors, inclose collaboration with IDA,
have responded favorably with commitments to support the SWAP approach and the poolingof
finds around a single design solution. Along with these efforts, the Government continued to
develop new approaches for developing intergovernmental fiscal relations between federal,
regional, andlocal levels o f government.

172.     Intergovernmental fiscal reforms to s u ~ m rdecentralized service delivery. Three critical
                                                       t
elements of Ethiopia's evolving system of fiscal federalism are (i)the federal-regional
relationship, (ii)the regional fiscal stance to municipalities, and (iii) clarity onthe role of
                                                                        greater
the woreda block grant vis-&-vis other possible transfer and revenue sharing arrangements to
meet basic service delivery needs. Progress inall three areas, described below, bode well for the
Government's strategic objective of ensuring adequate, predictable, needs-based, and
increasingly performance-oriented resource flows to local governments to meet the delivery
goals established under the SDPRP. The rules of the game governing PSCAP-based              primarily
on equity oriented drawing rights and performance based disbursements, followed by semi-
annual and annual reallocation of rights-represents     a shift inthe federal-regional relations, and
potentially a model for the development of other multisectoral federal transfers, for example,
withregards to local investment andfederal safety nets. Itisnotedthat the effectiveness ofthese
new or enhanced fiscal instruments depends inpart on the extent to which regions can engage in



                                                 51

a structured negotiation, established within the financial calendar, as well as more concerted
efforts to explain the objectives and mechanisms behind these new instruments to regional
officials.

173.     An equally important development is the preparation of prototype municipal finance
legislation, which inter alia defines various fiscal instruments-specific purpose transfers, block
grants, and other mechanisms-that      are available to regions. It would be equally important for
prototype strategies (inclusive of the fiscal dimension of decentralization) to be developed for
woredas. While in some regions, the woreda block grant has gone through some innovations
(e.g., the adoptionof an expenditure needs approach inSNNP andTigray), the role ofthe woreda
block grant vi&-vis   other instruments that could potentially help finance local service delivery
needs in a sustainable manner, needs to be defined more systematically. Based on the progress
described above, regions and their local governments are now better placed than any other time
during the past decade to meet the dual SDPRP objectives of improved service delivery and
enhanced local autonomy. While much more in terms of fiscal innovation remains to be done,
future development of the fiscal framework in Ethiopia depends on the capacity of sub-national
authorities-and   particularly regional and woreda finance officials-to  take full advantage of the
fiscal autonomy that they already enjoy. Inother woreds, regions and local governments should
be prepared to make effective decisions regarding instrument choice (for e.g., the design of
various transfers) as well as their implementation (for e.g., monitoringof fiscal transfers).

174.     In the opinion of staff, the Government has taken an important step towards this
objective by preparinga Fiscal Decentralization Strategy (FDS) in October 2004. Overall, the
FDS paper provides the first comprehensive and clear articulation of the objectives and goals of
fiscal decentralization, the fiscal instruments that the Government has employed over the past
few years to further these objectives, and some of the forward-lookingchallenges associated with
creating an accountable local government tier in urban and rural areas. Moreover, it includes
several elements that we have discussed earlier including (i)     an update of the federal-regional
fiscal framework including a reiteration of the role of the regional subsidy vis-&vis other
transfers such as PSCAP and food security; (ii) update on regional-local fiscal relations
                                                       an
including the role and management of the consolidated woreda block grant as well as municipal
finance legislation.   Issues related to budgeting are mentioned including the importance of
creating a unified, modern public financial management system to manage the risks associated
withrapidfiscal decentralization.

175.     Following discussions with the Bank and other partners, the Government further
strengthened the FDS to lay out the objectives of fiscal decentralization, the target audience for
the strategy, a balance between transfers and own revenue mobilization, a forward looking
agendafor capital funding, approach to addressing the transitional costs of decentralization,
and the links to medium-termplanning andFnancia1 management. These aspects will help it to
serve as a guide for federal, regional, and local finance officials to make better choices in
utilizingthe existing andnew fiscal instruments to further SDPRP objectives of improved service
delivery and empowerment. Finally, It is encouraging that MOFED intends to discuss broadly
with BOFEDs, select local officials, as well as otherrelevant sectoral institutions and donors, the
implications of the strategy and implementation modalities. Inaddition, several existing review
processes, for example, quarterly meetings of MOFED and BOFEDs or multisectoral reviews
between MOFED, MFA, and MCB (inthe context o f the IGR) would gain by being codified in
the future.



                                                 52

176.     Strengthening the .public sector fiduciary framework.          Critical to the provision of
harmonized budget support inan annual basis is the ability o f JBS partners to verify systematic
improvement in the public sector fiduciary framework.              Several assessments have been
undertakeninrecent years including the recent 2004 HIPC Annual Assessment Report. Itnoted
that these efforts carried out under the Expenditure Management and Control Program were
bearing fruit including enhanced comprehensivenesso f budget formulation and fiscal reporting
as a result o f the incorporation of extra-budgetary funds into consolidated general government
fiscal reports, as well as more robust classification of expendituresas aresult o fthe development
and dissemination of a new and improved chart of accounts. However, reform efforts remain a
work-in-progress andrequire much stronger strategic focus andmore aggressivepacing.

177.     At the federal level, there is a widely acknowledgedneedto ensure compliancewith the
financial calendar; strengthen political ownership of the MEFF and its indicative planning
figures as a basis for integrated, medium term planning; develop a medium term planning
framework linkingthe budget systemto ongoing efforts to introduceperformancemanagementin
the civil service; strengthen intemal and external audit systems; improve budget monitoring and
fiscal reporting (including reducing delays andmovingtowards cost-centerbudgeting); reconcile
fiscal andmonetary accounts; reducethe federal accounts and audit backlogs; andensure greater
transparency o f the annual budgeting process for regions, woredas, and municipalities. Within
regions, fiscal decentralization has added pressure for bureaus and woredas to bring their
accounts up-to-date, roll out of the new chart o f accounts and accounting procedures, develop
planningmodalities, and strengthen other critical functions such as procurement and auditing.
Similar efforts inurbanjurisdictions remainpart of the unfinished business o fmunicipal reform
inall the reformingregionsaswellasAddisAbabaandDireDawa.

178.     Public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS) or PETS-like instruments including the
woreda and municipal benchmarking surveys are to be launched shortly. Ongoing legislative
reforms o f the public procurement and municipal financial systems are plannedas well. The
large-scale implementation and capacitybuildingsupport for these andlonger term efforts under
the Government's Expenditure Management and Control Program (EMCP) are financed by
Treasury resources, and existing donor-financed operations such as the CBDSD Project, as well
as the multi-donor consolidatedPSCAP fund. There is need for the MOFED to play a stronger
role in setting the strategic direction for the use o f the rollout o f reforms. The strategic plan of
EMCP has been revised and submitted to the Ministry o f Capacity Building, along with an
annualizedEMCP actionplan. However this hasnotbeen approvedbyMCB as yet, although it is
an action for EFY 97. It is critical that approval is granted and the planis put into action as soon
as possible to allow progress in the area o f PFM reform to be properly co-coordinated, tracked
andmonitored. This isanareathat has seensome slippage inthepast.

179.     Planning and budgeting: A key element of the planningand budgeting system is robust
compliance with the fiscal calendar to ensure predictability and transparency of resource flows.
There has beenconsiderableprogressindefmingandimplementinganew financial calendar. As
noted duringthe JBSRRSC Icycle, two critical elements worth including inthe calendar are (i)
fiscal reporting requirements as a basis for improving the quality o f fiscal data, and (ii)       an
institutionalized role for regions indeterminingthe overall vertical division o fthe resourcepool
for the regional subsidy (similar to the approachtaken duringpreparation for the PSCAP specific
purpose program). Furthermore, there is need for a Government-wide position on how best to




                                                  53

integrate the newly developed strategic planning manual a key component o f its overall
expenditure management cycle.

180.     Financial management. Overall, achievements of the Government's "campaign"                        to
assess and eliminate the accounts backlogs across regions are encouraging. Notwithstanding
these early efforts, the existing benchmark to reduce the accounts backlog to a year in 8 regions
may notbe achievable by the end o f this fiscal year. Actual targets will need to be adjustedbased
on the findings of the backlog assessment. There is need to move quickly with this work
including a submission of the workplan over the next two months for completion of this work.
Sufficient technical assistance has been provided by USAID, the World Bank, the EC and other
donors. Much more vigorous coordination will be requiredon the part o f Govemment, however,
to reduce the accountsbacklogto less thana year in6 regions prior to PRSC III.

181.     In addition to eliminating backlogs, the roll-out of the modified cash, double entry
accounting system represents an important step towards improving the financial management
system. The Government has decided to roll out a modified cash basis double entry accounting
system and BDA3 to all federal budgetary institutions inthe next fiscal year. New clarity on the
role of BDA3 as the interim solution for the Federal Govemment in anticipation of a more
sophisticated IFMIS is an encouraging sign (see discussion on ICT).

182.     Procurement. Key procurement reform activities are proceeding with a high degree of
political and technical support by the Government. A high level Steering Committee has been
established, chaired by the Minister of Finance and including 3 MOFED State Ministers; State
Minister for Capacity Building; and departmental heads from MOFEDand MCB. Inaddition, a
Technical Committee consisting of the 7 heads of department in the MOFED support the
procurement reform agenda. The progress to date (described below) can be largely attributable
to the institutional implementing mechanismsthat are inplace.

183.     Specifically, the first draft Procurement Bill has been revised to incorporate comments
from the Bank and various in-country stakeholders including concerns about the proposed
regulatory framework for public procurement. The Government has take a decision to establish
the regulatory body at arms-length (i.e., independent and autonomous for the Ministry) in order
to provide oversight of the public procurement function in Ethiopia.              Several concrete steps
have already been taken in anticipation of the regulatory body's establishment such as the
preparation o f an organization structure; andpreparation ofjob descriptions.

184.     Inaddition, the Government has indicated that procurement directives at the federal
level, which are required for the Procurement proclamation to be effective, would be completed
rapidly followingthe approval of the proclamation.

 185.    Auditing. MOFED, inclose cooperation with the Federal Auditor General, prepared and
issued an Internal Audit Manual to be used by all government internal auditors. The awareness
creation workshop for higher government officials, including people from the regions, was
conducted in April 2004 for five days. The next step for MOFED in this area is to provide
intensive training for all intemal auditors on the actual implementation of the manual. Progress

has also been made regarding CFAA recommendations to review the role of the Inspection
Department at MOFED and BOFEDs and the Internal Audit Units at the various budgetary
institutions. The Inspection Departments will now act as a regulatory body for the intemal
auditors by issuing manuals, providing training andreviewing the works of the intemal auditors.
The action plan to issue standardized internal audit reports by all federal budgetary units has,
however, movedto FY2004-05.

186.     ICT. The establishment o f ICTA has paved the way for the near finalization of the
Government's     ICT policy, which identifies the following priority areas: government
administration and service delivery, community access and service delivery, sector program
development (including education, health and agriculture),           private sector development,
knowledge economy development and regulatory frameworks and standards.              The Bank has
analyzed the abridged national action plan and notes that it is extremely comprehensive: e-
government strategy, ICTs in education, e-commerce strategy, sectoral development including
agriculture, services and industry development, health and ICTs incommunity, capacity building
including infrastructure, humanresource, R&D and enabling environment facilitation including
FDI, national security and legal, regulatory and institutional development. Work is ongoing in
terms of identifymgresource requirements andtimetables for implementation of the action plan.

187.     While the government has in fact embarked on a national ICT strategy, the current
version of the action plan does not make specific reference to the applications that were
identified for the applications road-map viz. financial management, revenue and expenditure,
humanresources and land management. Additionally, the national ICT action plan reads more
like a vision, work is still needed to identifl strategies that will be used to realize this vision,
including the action plan for their implementation.       The Government information systems
strategy with applications roadmap needs to define for all applications resource implications and
timetable for implementation including prioritizationof initiatives. Inlight of the PSCAP project,
in particular, the roadmap should focus on priority areas of financial management, land and
humanresources(already agreedtobeinplacebyPRSCII).

188.     Integrated Financial Management Systems (IFMS). The EUhas provided support for the
design and installation o f the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS), a system
designed to provide comprehensive, regular, sufficient and timely supply of information to
stakeholders on government's financial transactions. The design andinstallation ofthe IFMS will
be piloted in selected government agencies in areas of core budget and accounting functions. If
successful, the system will be expanded to the rest of the federal government institutions and
regions. The Government has indicated that it wishes to move faster with the roll-out and that it
wants to consider its own financial management system, instead of a new software system to be
procured under the EUprogram. These positive developments may, however, contribute to the
delays inthe implementation of the IFMS.

189.     Public sector performance initiatives and the private sector enabling environment. Over
the past year, the Government's Civil Service Reform Program has sought to address
performance problems in strategic Ministries, Authorities, and Bureaus (MABs) that have
historically posed constraints on private investment. At the federal level, these services include
the issuance of investment and other business licenses, customs administration, public sector
procurement, revenue administration, as well as court administration. Equally important are
local level services in urban centers such as issuance of documents related to "vital statistics"



                                                55

and other notary services, land administration and land development, and a range of municipal
services such as water and sanitation, roads, and markets.

190.     PSIP implementation infederal bodies: Inaddressing performance problems in these
critical areas, the Government has used the Performance and Service Delivery Improvement
Program under the C S W as its primary instrument for introducing performance management
within civil service institutions including participative review of performance problems,
restructuring andre-tooling, andthe introduction o f client andoutput-orientedstrategic planning.
Similar efforts are underway in the federal courts in order to improve the efficiency ofjudicial
and legal services. The initial wave of performance management initiatives at the federal level
has focused on the Customs Authority and Federal InlandRevenue Authority inthe Ministry of
Inland Revenues, the Ethiopian Investment Commission as well as the Trade and Licensing
Department underthe Ministry of Trade and Industry, and the Treasury and Central Procurement
Departments inthe Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. Similarly, the Registration
and LandManagement Departments inAddis Ababa City Administration have proceededwith an
initial baseline survey, business process reviews, review of restructuring proposals, and in some
cases, the preparation of medium-term strategic plans andthe installation of IT-based automation
solutions. More advanced M A B s including the EthiopianInvestment Commission have initiated
the implementationof performance management and capacity building initiatives including the
development of automated service delivery improvement systems.             Similarly, the Federal
Supreme Court has completed a court administration reform with an emphasis on reducing the
processing time for caseload management in courts inter alia through business process
reengineering and automation.       At the same time, strategic restructuring and performance
improvement efforts inreform towns identified under the UrbanManagement Capacity Building
Program are proceeding.

191.     Urban land management and development: Starting several years ago, the government
has committed itself to improving the h c t i o n i n g of urban land markets by reforming the
legislative and institutional framework for urban land development. It has also commenced
initiatives to review andenhance the operational performance of municipal landagencies intheir
task of delivering serviced urban land and establishing an adequate land management system.
These efforts are expected to bothhelp improve the investment climate for firms andreduce the
housing backlog for households. The government has identified four priority actions for the next
one-two years. First, is the refinement of the legal framework at the regional level and issuance
ofrevised urban land lease regulations inat least four regions. These regionalregulations will be
complemented by the issuance of "compensation law/regulations" applicable in cases of land
acquisition by government for public purposes. Second, municipal land agencies are working
improvingdelivery of land to households and f m s . They are aiming to increase the quantity
delivered, improve the process by making it shorter, transparent and predictable, and
reviewhevise pricingmechanisms to enhance efficiency and affordability. Third, municipal land
agencies are registering and titling an increasing number of land andbuildings and have started
regularization of units in informal settlements. Fourth, MOFA, regional governments and city
administrations are developing options for dealing with quality and ownership issues in rental
housing owned by municipal authorities-referred     to as "kebele housing"--because   this stock is
invery poor conditionandishome to large proportionofthe urbanpoor. Addis Ababa isleading
the regions in all of these reforms and establishing prototypes for regional capitals and other
major towns inthe country.




                                                56

192.     On the legdative side, the government had commissioned work related to the review of
the federal urbanlandlease legislation. Based onthis review the govemment has concluded that
a revision of the federal law in not required. Instead, the federal govemment has developed a
prototype legislation for regional govemments and is supporting the issuance of revised urban
landlease regulations at the regional level. With respect to content, urban landreforms need to
address issues such as the tradability of leases; standardization of lease periods; guarantees of
compensation in case of non-renewal; modification in requirements regarding completion of
works within three years; absence ofrules governingconversion ofrural to urbanland, or permit
houses to lease; rules governing selling of kebele housing to occupants to be held by lease; and
lack of standard format for registering land rights.      In addition, there are issues related to
managing the risk o f speculation and making the lease pricing mechanism more transparent and
better linkedto the actual cost of land development.

WorldBank Support

193.     Existing investment proiects, pipeline uroiects. and AAA. The first phase of the Bank's
support for decentralization, the Capacity Buildingfor Decentralized Delivery Project (CBDSD,
$26.2 million) has aimed to enhance decentralized service delivery performance by initiating
long-termpublic sector capacity buildingat the federal, regional, and local levels. The CBDSD
is directly supporting several initiatives inthe area of urban land management and development.
More recently, CBDSD has been supporting initiatives in the housingsector such as a study o f
options for addressing quality and ownership issues in "kebele housing" as well as preparation
and/or financing for city-wide slum upgrading action plans. At a broader level, CBDSD has laid
the foundation for the delivery of the Bank's $100 million flagship PSCAP support project,
approved inM a y 2004. PSCAP supports Govemment's efforts to improve state-society relations
inthree ways-improving      the scale, efficiency, and responsiveness of public service delivery at
the federal, regional, and local level; empowering citizens to participate more effectively in
shaping their own development; and promoting good govemance and accountability.                An
Information and Communications Technology-Assisted Development project ($25 million), with
the objective of assisting Government and communities to utilize appropriate information and
communication technologies to facilitate increased access to markets, development information,
and public services, is also expected to be approved in September 2004. The IGR will be the
Bank's key analyhcal instrument to support the Government's state transformation process with
benchmarking surveys and a focus on M&E o f the performance of the overall public sector
reformprogram.

Implementation Ppogress

194.     Measures sumorted under PRSC I.Inaddition to a number of non-bolded actions, ,the
prior actions under PRSC-I consisted of: (a) MoFED issuance of directive on financial calendar;
and implementation oftwo actions (Cabinet approval ofMacro-Economic andFiscalFramework
for 2004/05-2006/07and MOFED issuance of indicative planning figures for Federal regional
subsidy andFederal specific purpose grants); (b) adoption of new chart of accounts by Regional
Cabinets of four regions; (c) issuance of circular on devolution of procurement responsibilities
from MoFED to federal budgetary institutions; and (d) enactment of enabling municipal
legislation clarifymg the mandate, powers and service delivery responsibilities of municipalities
in4regionsandAddis Ababa.




                                                  57

195.     Measuresto be supportedunder the proposedPRSCII.The proposedreformprogramto
be supported under PRSC IIinthis thematic area is based on the analysis presentedabove. In
addition to a number o f non-bolded actions, the Government has implemented the following
(bolded) actions prior to PRSC 11: (i)  MOFED issuanceo f Fiscal Decentralization Strategy; (ii)
Revise the financial calendar and issue a directive on strategic planning management, consistent
with MEFF, PIPPEP, and annual budgeting cycle; (iii)Revised urban land lease regulation
adopted in Addis Ababa; complemented by adoption of a directive for the management and
regularization o f informal settlements; and regularization under implementation; (iv) Reduction
o f the audits backlog for the federal Treasury accounts to one year by closing the accounts and
submissiono f the accounts to the Auditor General; and (v) Cabinet clearanceand submissionto
Parliamento fdraftProcurementProclamation for approval.

196.     Proeressinimplementingreforms sumortedbvPRSCII.Interms o fthe federal-regional
framework, in the last six months the Government has made progress in moving towards an
expenditure needs or fiscal gap approach inthe implementation o f the regional subsidy. While
the demands of this system in terms o f its data requirementsare worth noting, the transition to
the fiscal gap approach signals the Government's desire to develop a more realistic and
accountable subsidy mechanism. Equally important is the completion o f design o f PSCAP as a
performance based federal specific purpose transfer, additional to the regional subsidy. A
continuing concernisthe needto cover the one-off logistics andinfrastructure (civil works) costs
associatedwithworeda andmunicipal decentralization. These costs, ifnot covered, constitute an
unfunded mandate and may be financed through the woreda block grant (which should finance
the investment and recurrent requirements of actual service delivery). It was confirmed that
PSCAP would pay for several o f the one-off logistical costs such as equipment including
generators and computers, etc., although not the civil works requirements o f newly empowered
jurisdictions. The Bank and other development partnershave emphasizedthe needto determine
the scale o f both the civil works and logistics components of the transitional costs, as well a s
appropriate fiscal sources for financing the former in a manner that does not pose a service
delivery risk. These costs will be assessed via a study being undertaken as part of the
Institutional andGovemanceReview or IGR. The Governmentis seekingto address these issues
including clarifyingitspolicy stance through its FiscalDecentralization Stratem Pam.

 197.    Delays in the timeliness o f fiscal reporting (including on outlays o f poverty-reducing
spending), audit backlogs, and pressures on internal control systems are still evident and are
partially relatedto woreda decentralization. At the same time, recentreports identified severalo f
the remaining challenges that will require continued attention. The Bank/JBS partners have
confirmed that the Government's short term strategy for roll out o f the budget and accounts
reforms and associated training at the regional and woreda level involves the launch o f a
"campaign" to assess and clear the accounts and audit backlog across tiers o f government, and
rapid reduction in the audit backlog. Since the most reliable source of information for the
comparisono f the actual expenditure with the budget i s the regular and annualreports produced
by the Central Accounting Department (CAD) of MOFED, the timely closure of the federal
accountsi s crucial for all JBS donors.

 198.    Reduction of the audit backlog to one year is a boldedprior action for PRSC II.Unless
the accounts are closed and submitted to the Office of the Federal Auditor-General (OFAG), the
auditors cannotperform the audit. Regarding outstandingaudits o f Federal accounts, OFAG will
have completed the audit for FY 2001 by early-November 2004. MOFED has closed the



                                                58

accounts for FY 2002 and submittedit to OFAG for audit. While the audit for FY 2002 hasnot
been completed, the Bank and other partnersnote significant progresshas indeedbeenmadeby
MOFED inthe pastyear interms ofacceleratingclosing o faccounts for submissionto OFAG for
auditing. Since government has addressed the bottleneck causing the audits backlog, i.e. the
delays in closing the accounts, the staff consider that the Government has substantially
completedthe prior action andthat the closing of accounts and submissionto OFAG constitutes
achievement o f the action. MOFED has also indicated that it i s confident that the closure of
accounts for FY 2003 and 2004 can be expectedby PRSC IlI,      thereby eliminating the accounts
backlogat that point.

199.     A critical arearelating to the statutoryframework isthe nonexistence ofatime limit for
closure o f federal government accounts and submission to OFAG for audit. Finance
Administration Proclamation no. 157/1996 does not have such a time limit (although there are
statutory requirements for the Auditor Generalto report within four months of receipt o f closed
accounts) nor are there MOFED directives to this effect. The issuance of such a MOFED
directive hasbeenagreedas aboldedprior action for PRSC      m.

200.     At the subnational level, the JBS grouphasconfmedprogressinrolling out the budget
and accounts reforms to five regions, Oromiya, Addis Ababa, SNPPR, Tigray and A",
though Oromia has been implementing only the budget reform. This FY, the roll out has been
started in Beneshangul and Dire-Dawa. The roll out includes the introduction o f new chart o f
accountsfor budgeting andreporting, use o fcomputerizedBudget Information System (BIS) and
Budget, Disbursement and Accounting System 3 (BDA 3) and the use o f modified cash basis
double entry accounting system. The roll out o f the budget and accounts reforms will improve
the financial reporting capacity of government agencies and hence help them to close their
accounts ina timely manner. Though the roll out is being implementedinthe aboveregons and
federal institutions, the pace of implementation varies from region to region. Since the
introduction o f the new system requires extensive training and capacity buildingexercises, the
implementation of the roll out takestime.

201.     Regarding procurement reform, the most critical action in the reform process i s the
enactment o f the procurement law by Parliament. The Govemment has confirmed that this has
been cleared by Cabinet and submitted to Parliament, and that it i s on track for approval by
Parliament in November 2004. Also, tender committees and procurement units have been
createdinall federal ministries. This action was enabledunder the Financial andAdministrative
Proclamation. This benchmark has been fully met. Inaddition, the Governmenthas organized a
number of procurementworkshops to train membersof the ProcurementCommitteesandUnits.
A total staffof390 from 108federalpublic bodieshasbeentrained.

202.     The Government plans further roll out of performance improvement initiatives beyond
the intial wave o f h4ABs and also to additional reform towns or municipalities. Dialogue on this
issue has focused on the need to more systematically measure the results of these efforts,
particularly from thepointo fview ofclients.

203.     In accordance with the agreed prior action for PRSC II,Addis Ababa City
Administration issued a revised urban land lease legislation in 2003, developed guidelines and
institutional arrangements that are necessary for its implementation, and is implementing the
legislation.   In addition, the Addis Ababa City Administration has issued a directive for



                                                 59

regularization of informal settlements and has commenced implementation. A related prior
action for PRSC 11was the review and revision of Federal Urban Land Lease Law. During
Appraisal the government c o n f m e d that the relevant federal law was reviewedthoroughly andit
was decided that a revision of the federal law is not required. Instead, this law needs to be
complemented by compensation lawshegulations andregional-level urbanlandlease regulations.
Accordingly, botha draft compensation law and a prototype regional urban landlease regulation
have been prepared. The compensation law will ensure compensation to affected parties in the
event of acquisition of property by government; it is aimed at strengthening property rights and
constitutes a major step in the creation of a well-functioning land market. The adoption of
compensation lawsh-egulations and the issuance of new urban land lease regulations by 2-4
regions or city administration are agreed prior actions for PRSC III.

204.    Measures to be suuported under the urouosed PRSC III.Inaddition to a number of non-
bolded actions, the Government has agreed to implement the following (bolded) actions prior to
PRSC III, support of its program of fiscal decentralization, public finance management, civil
           in
service reform, andurbanl a n d (i)   MOFEDshall issue a directive setting a date for closure of
the Federal Government's accounts submission of same to OFAG and circulate the directive to
federal budgetary institutions for compliance; MOFED will also send the directive issued as a
prototype to Regions for their consideration and adoption; (ii)   Federal Civil Service Commission
issuance of a white paper on remuneration policy for Federal level; (iii)    Issuance of new urban
land lease regulations in 2-4 Regionshty administrations; clearance by the Cabinet and
submission to Parliament of compensation laws applicable incases of acquisition ofproperty for
public purposes.


                       V.       OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

A.      Povertyand SocialImpacts

205.    The Bank's extensive analyixal work conducted via, for example, the Health/Education
Country Status Reports, the Poverty Assessment, the Country Economic Memorandum, the
update o f the PER, and the background work done as part of the preparation o f the Productive
Safety Net program, have established the importance of the range of Government reforms being
supported by PRSC II.The proposed PRSC IIprogram is expected to contribute significantly to,
interalia:


    0   accelerated and broad-based growth,          through greater access to micro-finance,
        communications infrastructure, and an investment climate that is more suited to private
        sector development (micro-finance action plan, privatization program,           urban land
        reform, telecommunications liberalization)


    0   continued strengthening of the legislative and fiscal framework underpinning the
        decentralization strategy (fiscal decentralization strategy)


    0   greater predictability in financing for basic services, as well as service provision with
        lower unit costs, higher coverage and better quality (financial calendar and strategic
        performance management reforms, new lower cost construction options for schools)




                                                  60

    0   reduced vulnerability o f chronically food insecure households andenhancedresilience to
        economic shocks. (safety net programimplementation, access to micro-finance)

206.    Inaddition to the measures above, PRSCIIIwill take upanincreased focus ongender
issues. Manyindicators inthe SDPRP matrix are assessedfrom the gender equity aspect already.
Moreover, a national Gender Action Plan is under preparation and is scheduled for completion in
EFY 1997. Progress inpreparation and implementation of the action plan will be monitoredas
partofthe PRSC series.

207.    Other areas have been identified where particular care is required to avoid negative
distributional or social consequences.

        One such area is with respect to the privatization program and the risk of large-scale
        redundancies and hardship for labor. The enterprise sale process is expected to allow
        and support the successful bidder flexibility to restructure the labor force of the
        enterprise. To mitigate the social impact of possible redundancies that may result, the
        Government, with assistance from the Bank, is undertakingto introduce a separation
        package that is more generous than the legally mandated package. Inorder to address
        concerns of potential investors related to labor issues, such a package would be offered
        by the Government to be utilized by the investor within a specified period of time from
        the initial sale (e.g., 6 months). The package would be on a voluntary basis with the
        investor retaining the option of vetoing particular cases. It would be tailored to the
        Ethiopian context and would offer a menu of options (e.g., retraining, counseling, early
        retirement, cash option related to seniority, etc.). The mechanism of delivery could
        include a matching grant approach whereby the Government matches expenses of the
        new investor on this account. The confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions is very
         supportive of such a program.


    0   A second area noted during the Appraisal discussions on the Joint Budget and Aid
        Review is with respect to the apparent underspending/reporting/financingfor health
        expenditures.     The Government has agreed to prioritize analysis of health sector
        expenditures to determine where the problems lie and .the course of action to be
         followed.

        Another area where close monitoringwill be undertakenis with respect to the start-up of
        the safety net program in 262 woredas to ensure that implementation difficulties are
         identified promptly and a rapid response is undertaken to avoid any disruption of
        assistance to vulnerable households while supporting the woreda in implementing a
         quality program. The Federal Food Security Coordination Burerau is inthe process o f
         finalizing a "rapid response system" which is capable of promptly identifylng
         implementation problems and providingtargeted support to help resolve the problem.

 208.    Inaddition to these specific measures, the Bankandother JBSpartnerswill continue to
 engage with the Government on the JBAR and the SDPRP M&E system to monitor the
 adequacy and effectiveness of public expenditure allocations to pro-poor programs, plus the
 timeliness, adequacy and modalities of aid and its impact on service delivery. Several major
 studies, such as the MDG Needs Assessment studies, the Institutional and Governance Review
 (IGR), and the Decentralized Service Delivery study, will also be undertaken by the



                                                61

 Government, the Bank and other partners to assess progress in and preliminary impact of key
 reformmeasures inthe Govemment's program.

B.       Supervision

209.     The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development will be responsible for overall
implementation of the proposed operation and for reporting progress and coordinating actions
among other concerned ministries andagencies.

210.     The Government, the Bank and JBS donor partners have agreed to a semi-annual set of
"joint budget support" missions inMarch and September of eachyear, duringwhich progress in
implementation of, and follow-up to, agreed policy actions will be monitored.         Inaddition,
technical groups in each sector will engage in continuous technical dialogue according to
schedules that are appropriate to the sector. The periodic PRSC/JBS assessment of progress in
program implementation is expected to draw on the findings of these sector reviews and
dialogue, rather thanto duplicate these processes.

C.       MonitoringAnd Evaluation

211.     The policy-based nature of PRSC/JBS support necessitates a results framework that
assesses progress towards SDPRP goals over the medium-term on the one hand, and annually
monitorable policy actions and output indicators on the other. There are four dimensions to the
results framework on which work is ongoing: (i)      strengthening of the M&E system throughout
Government; (ii)   accountability framework for service delivery; (iii) "opening up the matrix" to
sub-national tiers; and (iv) a reward structure for the PRSC/JBS. Each o fthese areas is discussed
inbriefbelow.

212.     M&EAction Plan. The Governmentismovingto strengthenits capacity for monitoring
and evaluation. The Governmentpresented a "Strengthening SDPRP Monitoring and Evaluation
Action Plan" to donors and civil society in a M a y 2004 workshop. Elements of the planinclude
hiring and training staff in the relevant MOFED units, increasing participatory aspects of
monitoring and evaluation (initially through a Participatory Poverty Assessment), creating an
Integrated Management Information System at the Welfare Monitoring Unit in MOFED,
strengthening statistical capacity in the Central Statistical Authority (CSA)            including
establishment of a Socio-Economic Database, strengthening the results framework of the
SDPRP, and improving reporting on SDPRP indicators in APRs.               The Bank (through an
Institutional Development Fund Grant) and other donors-including            the United Kingdom,
Ireland, Canada, UNDP, andthe EU-have         committed resources to support the plan. Efforts are
also underway to upgrade the M&E systems in individual sectors. The newly formed Poverty
Action Network (PAN)has brought together a range of civil society representatives to assess the
quality of public service delivery and discuss how CSOs and NGOs can work with the
Government to reach the MDGs.          Further details of the M&E system for the SDPRP are
discussed inAnnex 10.

213.     Accountabilityframeworkfor service delivery. As mentioned earlier, the bulkofprimary
service delivery is at the sub-national,        and even sub-regional level by woredas and

which has specific functions assigned to each tier. Inaddition, work has begun under the Civil

Society Capacity Building operation under preparation, on building accountability and
information feedback loops at the local service providerlcommunity levels to improve primary
service delivery for educationandhealth. The PAN, with support fiomUNDPhas also launched
a Citizen's Report Card exercise where approximately 2000 households will be interviewedto
solicit their perceptions of effectiveness of services in primary education, primary health, and
water.

D.       DisbursementandAuditing

214.     The 2001 IMFreport (stage two) on the SafeguardAssessments of the National Bank of
Ethiopia indicated that a number o f safeguards are already in place or have been initiated to
mitigate some ofthe findings o fthe Stage One report.The report (stage two) statedthat the NBE
managementembarkedon a strategic restructuringo f the bank's functions andoperationsduring
2001, aimed at bringingthe NBE in line with recognizedbest practices, including a number of
proposed improvements that overlap with safeguards assessments. Subsequent reviews by the
Fundconfirmed that almost all the recommendationsunderthe safeguardassessmentshavebeen
implemented. The suggestion to strengthen the internal control system is planned to be
completed as part o f the overall organizational restructuring, in particular, o f the internal audit
department.

215.     As aresult o fthe strength o f the findings from the Fund's SafeguardsAssessments, IDA
will disburse the grant proceeds into an account that forms part ofthe country's official foreign
exchange reservesheldby NBE. An amount equivalent to the grant proceedswill be credited to
an account of the Central Treasury available to finance budgeted expenditures. The Borrower
will provide a confirmation to IDA that the amount ofthe grant hasbeencredited to the Central
Treasury account(including the date, name, andnumber ofthe account).

E.       EnvironmentalAspects

216.     The designofPRSC11draws uponrecentanalytical work on the environment carried out
by the Bank in Ethiopia, especially the recently completed Country Environmental Analysis
(CEA). O fthe prior actions supportedbyPRSC11,eight-including passage o fthe Procurement
Proclamation, financial calendar and performance budgeting, reduction o f the audits backlog,
urban land reforms, school construction design options, and the telecommunications, fiscal
decentralization , and rural and micro-finance strategies-are      expected to have no negative
environmental impact. Further, there are no existing environmental problems that are expected
to be exacerbatedbythese reforms.

217.     Possible environmental risks associatedwith the prior action on privatization supported
by PRSC IIwill be addressed through a mitigation planthat would include the categorization of
public enterprises slated for privatization based on the potential environmental impact o f their
transfer to private ownership. The Bank, as part o f the preparation of the proposed Private
SectorDevelopmentCapacity Buildingproject, is assistingthe Governmentinthis process.

218.     The Productive Safety Nets program, a prior action for PRSC 11, includes a community
`public works' component aimed at developing communal infiastructure and assets in areas o f
chronic food shortage. The Program is expected to serve around 262 woredas, in which public
works will be conducted over a five-year period. The public works activities may include, for



                                                  63

example, hillside terracing, soil and water conservation, landreclamation, improvement of roads
or bridges, improvedaccess to water, or repair o fhealth facilities. Inthe case ofpastoralist areas,
it is to be expected that projects may include development ofwater points, rehabilitating pasture
lands, building access roads, build market sites, agroforestry, or initiatives related to livestock.
While it is acknowledged that many of the public works will themselves be intended to
rehabilitate the natural resource base, it is equally important that such projects be well designed
and executed to ensure that undesirable environmental impacts are avoided or mitigated. CIDA
and the World Bank have assisted the Government in the production of a global Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for the Program that sets out in simple terms
guidelines for avoiding environmentally problematic project designs or locations, and gives a list
ofmeasures to mitigate risks.

219.     Ethiopia's capacity to manage the environmental risks and enhance the positive effects
of the two prior actions listed above, as well as other non-bolded actions listed in the PRSC 11
matrix, was assessed recently in the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA). The CEA was
launched in April 2003 by the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in close
collaboration with the World Bank and DFID. The aim of the study was to assess Ethiopia's
institutional capacity for sustainable natural resource and environmental management in support
of the SDPRP, identify key constraints on achieving good environmental performance, and
identify areas for capacity building. Key focus areas included the following: a review of the
institutional h m e w o r k for mainstreaming environmental issues; an assessment of the
implications o f various policies and reforms, especially decentralization, and the ongoing
capacity buildingprograms, for environmentalmanagement; an evaluation of the effectiveness
of EIA in protecting environmental resources; and identification of key areas for capacity
buildingandinstitutional development. The study teambuiltonexistingreports andevaluations,
conducted a literature review, and carried out extensive field research covering government and
civil society, at over sixty sites throughout the country, at federal, regional, woreda and
community levels.      The CEA contains recommendations for actions to improve Ethiopia's
environmentalpolicyandcapacity to implement programs, includingthe following:

220.     At the federaZ level: (i)Operationalize the EPC such that it acts as a champion for
environmental management thus increasing the likelihood that environmental management is
integrated into key development policies, such as the SDPRP, the NCBP and PSCAP. (ii)
Develop the capacity of the EPA, including the EIS, EIA capacity, and other environmental
management activities; improve the EPA's capacity to network with and support other agencies.
(iii) theresponsibilities ofotheragenciesanddeveloptheircapacitiesfordischarging
      Identify
these responsibilities by developing environmental units, raising awareness, and improving
understanding of environmental issues through a revised EPE relevant to the decentralized
situation.

221.     At the regiona2 level: (i) political support for environmental management. (ii)
                                     Build
Raise public awareness throughrevised, action-oriented RCSs. (iii) and develop capacity
                                                                       Adjust
in government institutions, especially through the development of environmental coordination
capacity, EIA and EIS procedures, and improved environmental sensitivity within agencies. (iv)
Developregional environmental legislation.

222.      At the woreda level: (i)Mainstream environment into development planning activities at
this level, using appropriate and participatory methods.         (ii)Engage local communities in



                                                 64

environmental managementprocesses anddiscussions, with local pilot activities. (iii) and Adjust
develop capacity in government institutions to achieve coordination at the woredu level on
environmental issues, with better awareness o f environment among govemment and private
sector actors.

223.     With respect to civil society, NGOs, and the private sector: (i) their greater
                                                                             Promote
involvement in the coordination o f environment matters and recognize their potential
contributions. (ii)Foster sharing of environmental experience and skills, as well as buildingon
local knowledge and institutions in communities, and scaling up of positive experiences. (iii)
Buildcapacity inall aspects of environmental management, includingthe ability to improve self-
assessmentof their environmental impacts andsensitivity.

224.     In response to the CEA recommendations, the Government has made progress to
strengthen the institutional capacity for environmental management, including enactment of
environmental proclamation and implementation guidelines and standards at the federal level on
environmental protection institutions, environmental impact assessment, and pollution control.
Two Regions, Oromiya andAmhara, have passed similar laws at the regional level. Inaddition,
all Regons have established institutions for environmental management.


                     VI.     POTENTIALM S K S AND MITIGATION

The major risks, andmeasures expected to mitigate these risks, relate to:

225.     Weak enforcement of guidelines for resettlement/access to new land program.
Recent assessments of the program have found implementation problems in some regions. In
order to mitigate against an unintended worsening of food insecurity inrural areas, Government
and development partners have discussed how to make the safeguards stronger, includingbetter
information flows to and among the re-settlers, an early warning system including independent
monitoringto detect cases where the standards are not adhered to, enhanced Government ability
to service these new areas, and fiscal andor law enforcement consequences for those authorities
who do not adhere to the programguidelines.

226.     One-off transitional costs of devolving to local woreda administrations.
Decentralization in Ethiopia, as elsewhere, involves the establishment of new local government
institutional structures to manage the devolved service delivery responsibilities.    Each of these
newly established roles and responsibilities impose 'one-off' logistical and infrastructure costs
on woredas and municipalities.     There is a risk, however, that if these one-off costs are funded
through the block grants, there will not be sufficient funds for the recurrent costs of decentralized
structures and for basic service delivery. While equipment costs are expected to be financed by
PSCAP, it is still not clear how one-time civil works and personnel costs would be funded. To
mitigate this risk, work is being carried out by the Joint Government-Donor IGWAFA team to
assess the transitional costs of decentralization and suggest institutional structures to deal with
such costs.

227.     Implementing the private and financial sector reform agenda and building private
sector capacity.     Ethiopia's private and financial sector reform agenda has become quite
comprehensive, with multiple policy reforms in train. The country's private sector is still in its
infancy, and the ongoing and envisaged reforms are vital to promote its growth. Ifthese reforms


                                                 65

are not implemented-or their implementation is significantly delayed-there         would be a large
negative impact on Ethiopia's future growth potential. This risk will be mitigated through the
PSD capacity building project currently under implementation, as well as through
Government/donorBank dialogue on privatization and competition policy.                  Given that
Government alone will not be able to marshal the resources necessary for Ethiopia's
development, it will also be crucial for the private sector to build its capacity to contribute
increasingly more to growth andpoverty reduction. The PSD capacity buildingproject will also
be designed to mitigate this risk.

228.    Developing and retaining skilled workers. The Government is leveraging a large
amount of financing for capacity buildingand related activities across a wide range of sectors.
For the Government to continue to make progress in scaling up its capacity, there must be an
increased focus on improving incentives for public sector employment. Unless systematic efforts
are made to effect a structural reformofthe pay and employment system, there is a riskthat these
capacity building resources will feed the exodus of skilled and semi-skilled personnel to the
private sector, donor sector, or out of the country. The Government has indicated that it intends
to review its incentive system and remuneration policy once the results are clear of the Civil
Service Reform efforts geared to improve the productivity, performance, and service orientation
of civil servants. Towards this end, a white paper onFederal remunerationpolicy is expected in
2005. Moreover, efforts are ongoing to improve management and quality of education at the
university level. The Post-Secondary Education project will enable the Government to fund the
necessary improvements in the higher education system, without reducing efforts on primary
education. PSCAP, the m a l development capacity-building program, the private sector capacity
buildingprogram, etc. are all gearedto enhance performance.

229.     Continued reportinglags inactualexpenditures at primary service levels. Due to the
rapid pace of decentralization, systems for expenditure reportingremain underdeveloped at the
local level. This has hampered the Government's ability to monitor the effects of decentralization
on service delivery, and to be aware of where service delivery bottlenecks may have emerged.
Although the Government has developed an action plan to improve its public expenditure
management systems in this regard, it is possible that progress will still be limited. Inorder to
mitigate this possibility, the IFA and other review instruments will directly address this problem.
The possibility o f highlightingthis issue as part of the policy matrix will also be explored during
PRSC IIpreparation.

230.     Congestion effects of several programs involving local service cadres (e.g. health
extension workers, teachers, agriculture extension agents). Several sector programs have
embarked on guidelines, and in some cases, training, to expand the cadres for service delivery at
the local level. Yet the fiscal space for expanding staffing on several fronts simultaneously is
limited. As a mitigating measure, it is expected that these expenditure issues will be highlighted
inboththe MDGcosting study and as part ofthejoint budget dialogue. Moreover, appropriate
redeployment o f existing cadres inline with newly decentralized services and their capacity will
be handled through restructuring and performance management efforts under the civil service
reform, urbanmanagement, and district level decentralization subprograms of PSCAP. The skill
level of all existing staff at the local level, bothcore administrators and frontline staff, are being
handled by various training efforts which will need to continue into the future. The fiscal risk in
terms o f the aggregate numbers is expected to be built up in lock-step with the own-revenue
potential of local authorities as well. Local and community organizations such as school Parent-



                                                   66

Teacher Associations are also expected to assist in supervising quality o f personnelhervices and
inprioritizingdeployment of resources. Finally, in some cases, frontline staff inthese'sectors
willneedto be addressedinpartby allowing the capacityto bebuiltoutside the public sector.

231.     Absence of demand-side pressures from civil society and citizens (especially outside
of purely Government organized fora) on the public sector in the delivery of services,
empowerment, and governance. A risk for all our programs within this CAS andthe future CAS
is the risk that unmediateddemand side responses at the facility level, local government level, as
well as at the regional and national levels will not be forthcoming. The civil society program
does potentially address this but its benefits may not accrue for some time. While there maybe
no easy answers for this, there is need to flag the importance o f creating space for public
discourse o fvarious types (preferably non-partisan space) inEthiopia. This was a key findingo f
the social assessmentundertakenfor PSCAP.

232.     There are a number o f other risks that cannot be readily mitigated by the Bank, including
the potential for re-emergence o f conflict relating to the EthiopiaEritrea border, drought, and a
lack o f availability of donor funds for Joint Budget Support, which could affect the availability
o f financing fiomthe BankifIDAgrant resources are not available.

                                                                               September 13,2004
The Executive Board o f the Intemational Monetary Fund(IMF)has completed the sixth and final
review o f Ethiopia's performance under an SDR 100.28 million (about US$147 million)
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 01/11 and
NewsBrief No.02/23$. This decision enables Ethiopia to receive the final disbursement o f
SDR 10.4 (about U S 1 5 million).

After the Executive Board's discussion on Ethiopia, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing
Director andActing Chair, issuedthe following statement:

"Ethiopia's performance under the three-year PRGF-supported program has been good. Real
GDP growthhas rebounded strongly, price stability has been maintained, andprogress has been
made with key structural reforms. However, Ethiopia remains highly vulnerable to external
shocks, notably drought and export prices, while poverty indicators continue to be among the
highest inthe world.

"The main challenges going forward are to achieve faster growth and the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs),to increase the economy's resilience to shocks, and to ensure debt
sustainability. This will require bothhigher levels of external aid and improvements inEthiopia's
capacity to absorb and use such assistance more effectively. Continued prudent macroeconomic
policies and more ambitious structural reforms in key areas, especially inthe agricultural, fiscal,
andfinancial sectors, will beessentialfor reachingthese objectives.

"Fiscal policy is expected to continue to focus on strengthening expenditure management and
enhancing revenues, while containing inflationary domestic financing and reducing the public
debt burden. Improvingpublic expenditure management also remains a critical priority for the
govemment, especially for bolstering the capacity of local governments, given their new
expenditure mandates following fiscal decentralization.

"A significant increase inexternal assistance to Ethiopia wouldneedto be largely inthe form o f
grants if public debt sustainability is to be maintained. The authorities are developing a
comprehensive and prudent public debt management strategy to clarify the rules for containing
future domestic and external borrowing to sustainable levels. The plans to develop their own
fiscal scenarios aimed at achieving the MDGs are also welcome. In this context, it will be
important to work with realistic assumptions, identify challenges early, and mitigate any
potential adverse effects onthe broader macroeconomic framework.

"Monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to focus on achieving the inflation and
international reserve targets. Safeguarding external competitiveness requires implementing
structural reforms that improve productivity and efficiency, while the exchange rate should be
fully market-determined.

"Inorder to lay firm foundations for achieving a significant andsustained increaseinlong-term
growth, it is essential to press ahead with structural reforms, focusing on agriculture, food
security, capacity building, export promotion, privatization, and strengthening the legal and
regulatory framework. Attention will also need to be paid to strengthening the financial sector



                                                95

and promoting competition within that sector. In this regard, full implementation of the
restructuring plan for the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and enhancement o f the central bank's
independence andits supervisory capacity remainhighpriorities," Mr.Kat0 said.

The PRGFis the IMF's concessional facility for qualifymg low-income countries. The purpose o f
the PRGF is to support programs to strengthen substantially and in a sustainable manner a
country's balance of payments position and to foster durable growth, leading to higher living
standards and a reduction in poverty. PRGF-supported programs are based on country-owned
poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and
development partners andarticulatedina PovertyReductionStrategy Paper (PRSP). PRGF loans
carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5%-year grace
period.

and the budget allocation process. The JBAR's p r i m objective is to review budget allocations
-atthesectoral, sub-sectoral,regionalandlocallevels-intermsofthelinkstonationalgrowth,
poverty andhumandevelopment objectives as laid out inthe SDPRP.

The 2004/05 JBAR was specifically aimed at informing the Government-donor dialogue on the
budget duringthe joint PRSC II/DBS Appraisal. The findings o f the review, and the subsequent
dialogue, will contribute to the second Annual Progress Report (APR) on the implementationo f
the SDPRP, as well as the 2005/06 - 2007/08 FY Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework
(MEFF)andthe 2005106AnnualFiscalPlan.

 The proposed 2004/2005 JBAR hasthree broadcomponents:

         1) assessingrecent trends and patterns in public expenditure, so as to, a) draw lessons
        fromthe SDPRP (2002/03-2004/05) medium termexpenditure management experience,
        andb) analyze the out-turn for 2003/04 FY andthe consolidated budget for 2004/05 FY,
        to informwithin-year budget managementandthe next annual plan.

        2) reporting on the status o f the PFM system based on 12 o f the 28 Public Expenditure
        and Financial Accountability PEFA indicators, focusing on the planningand reporting
        aspects o f the system. This, along with the 14 indicators covered under the Annual
        FiduciaryAssessment, informs the extent o f fiduciary risk for budget support.

         3) examine the scope for reaching national objectives with regard to the MDGs within
        the present fiscal system. Specifically, the analysis focuses on budget allocation trends to
        primaryservice delivery at the regional level, andits effectiveness inbenefitingthe poor.

TheContext

Overview

The SDPRP, adopted in August 2002, indicates that the MDGs are long-term goals for the
overarching objective o f poverty reduction. Moreover, the MDGs represent the key indicators
and benchmarks for monitoring progress, as well as serve as a basis for dialogue between the
Government and external partners. The SDPRP aims to achieve broad-based growth, reduced
economic vulnerability, as well as substantial improvement in coverage and quality of service
delivery. In the past ten years, Ethiopia has made impressive progress in terms of maintaining
fiscal discipline, improving domestic and foreign resource mobilization. Moreover, there was
also a significant reduction in unproductive spending (except for the conflict years), while



                                                103

substantially increasing resources to pro-poor sectors and sub-national administrations.      The
challenge o f reaching the MDGs for Ethiopiaremains nevertheless a daunting task. Particularly,
advances in pro-poor service delivery are contingent on a number o f factors, including
improving the absorptive capacity o f govemment and the quality of public spending, and
strengthening ofthe public expenditure tracking system.

Implementation ofthe SDPRP

For the first time, the SDPRP provided an opportunity to consider results-based public
expenditure management through the introductiono f a medium term expenditure framework. The
SDPRP made use o f available sector planning frameworks to develop PEP for pro-poor sector
development programmes, and indicative resource gaps between need and likely availability o f
financing for the SDPRP. As a matter o fpriority, the framework requires improvementto ensure
a credible linkbetweenpolicy andpriorities, and operational budgets.

The SDPRP is now in its final year o f implementation and i s expected to be followed by the
secondmedium-term framework, "SDPRP T.Thus, the 2004 JBAR will look at the experience
inplanningandmanagingthe medium-term expenditure framework anddraw lessonfor "SDPRP
II".Thefocuswillbeonissuesidentifiedinrecentreviews,includingthe2002and2003JSA,
the 2003 PER, as well as the healthandeducation sector reports.

Issuesto be looked at include; policy/programmecosting, managemento fmacrorisk, the issue o f
balancing recurrent and capital spending, and regional versus federal budget. All o f these will be
looked at within the context ofpro-poor sector spending.

Decentralization andpro-poor service delivery

Ethiopia follows a decentralized Federal system o f administration. Recently, the Government
decided to deepen this process by devolving decision makingto the lowest administrative level,
i.e. the Woreda. The Ethiopian fiscal system i s highly devolved with more than two-thirds o f
general govemment expenditure beingmanagedby sub-national administrations. Excluding debt
and defense, regionalbudget accounts for 58 per cent o f consolidated general government budget
in2004/05 FY. Interms ofregionallyexecutedresources (includingthe food securitygrant), the
regional share exceeds 70 percent. Inline with their functional assignments, the lion's share o f
regional resources is expected to be allocated to pro-poor sectors, including agriculture, natural
resource and food security, water sector development, primary and secondary education, as well
as primary health services.

Givenlimitedrevenue raisingpower at the regional level, the current fiscal arrangements entail
vertical imbalance between the revenue collection power o f the Federal Govemment and the
expenditure responsibility of the regions. This imbalance is addressedthrough Federaltransfers
inthe form ofblock andspecific purpose grants. At present, Federal transfers cover more than
75 per cent o fplannedregional spending.

Regions are empowered to set their own expenditure priorities. Inthe context o f financing pro-
poor sector development, decisions at regional level are key in influencing the coverage and
quality o f service delivery, andhence the poor's access to, andutilization ofpublic services.




                                                104

Thus, Ethiopia's progress towards the MDGs will be affected by the allocative choices o f sub-
national administrations. This factor i s critical given, i)the diversity of regions intheir level of
development and capacity to manage public resources, ii)the limited private participation in
primary service delivery at regional level, and iii)the neutrality o f the Federal block grant
transfer system ininfluencingregional allocation choices.

Financing theSDPRP;Aid, and recentpatterns in aid delivery

The SDPRP is likely under-costed and also under-financed. To reach the MDGs, Ethiopia
requires, among other factors, improved availability and quality of aid. The issue o f scaling up
aid is currently being addressed through an MDG costing exercise supported by the UNDP and
World Bank. Equally important, the mechanism for aid delivery is crucial in determining the
predictability o fresourcesand the absorptive capacity o f government.

The SDPRP marks a major-break through in the development partnership architecture between
the Government and extemal donors. The Consultative Group meeting held inDecember 2002
was instrumentalinendorsing the SDPRP as providing a sound basis for working towards scaling
up support andaligning donor assistancewiththe government planningandbudgetingsystem.

There have been severalpositive developments on this front since the adoption ofthe SDPRP; (i)
almost all donors have committed to align their support with the SDPRP, (ii) 10 donors
                                                                                   about
representing 30% o f aid have committed to aligning budget support with the government budget
cycle, (iii)an informal DBS group was established with the aim o f creatinga coordinated system
for budget support, by providing information on DBS commitments and plans, and adopting
operating principles aimedat reducing transaction costs for government.

Giventhe relative size of aid inthe budget; financing a thirdof the total budget andmore than
60 percent o f the capital budget, significant progress yet to be made to redress problems
associated with the unpredictability in the pattem and flow o f funds. Moreover, fragmented
project aid using different disbursement rules still contributes to high transaction costs for the
government, and givenlimitedgovernment capacity, low absorption o f aid.

Scope of the 2004 JBAR

The JBAR i s expected to ensure continuous, up-to-date information flow so as to monitor and
evaluate progress in public financial management. The JBAR will also compliment on going
initiatives including, MDG costing, the IFA, the IGR, etc. Future JBAR exercises will benefit
from other complimentarywork including a Woreda benchmarkingsurvey.

Part I :Development inpublic expenditure

A regular review o f public expenditure at an aggregate, functionalhectoral and administrative
level focusing on, a) the medium term financing experience o f the SDPRP, b) the out-turn o f
2003/04 FY and 2004105 FY consolidated budget, and c) a review o f the availability and quality
o f aid inthe budget.

At an aggregate level, the focus shall be the adequacy and credibility o f the financial plan
including domestic revenue estimates, as well as the realism o f external resource projections, the



                                                 105

qualityof aid delivery and its implication onpredictability andeffective utilization. Moreover, it
will look at financing for new initiatives including food security, and the implication o fthe gap
between programcosts estimated inthe SDPRP and availability andpredictability o fresources.

Regarding allocation, emphasis shall be given to the current year budget and estimated outturn
for the preceding year by sector/functional (within and across sectors), economic, and
territoriaVadministrative classifications. As much as data allow, the assessment will look at, i)
the link between resource allocatiodflow, target and out turn in terms o f primary service
delivery, ii)the inter-government fiscal transfer system in the context o f balancing functional
assignment and resource availability, iii)progress in efficiency and effectiveness o f resource
allocation andutilizationinkey sectors .

With respect to aid in general and DBS in particular, the JBAR will cover areas including, i)
relaxing macro constraints, ii)improvement in resource predictability at sub-national, and
sectoral level, ii)implicit incentives to increase allocation in favour o f poor-poor sectors, iii)
improved aid absorption, iv) the scope for redressingrecurrent vs. capital balance, and v) better
planning, reporting,andmonitoringandevaluation.

Part 11:P F Msystem up-date

A regularized fiduciary assessment basedon the PEFA framework is expected to be part of the
BAR. There are 12 PFM quality assessment indicators covered under the JBAR (see box
below). The HIPC tracking AAP report, recently produced, will form the basis for review in
2004.

Part III Realizing MDGgoals in a decentralizedenvironment

A section inthe JBAR will be devotedto understandingthe nationalobjective ofmeetingMDGs
withinadecentralized framework. Focusingon social servicesacrossregons, the section looksat
resource allocation; for primary service delivery relative to service coveragerate inthe respective
regions, the effectiveness o f poor households in accessing and utilizing facilities and hence the
effectiveness o f sector spending in benefiting the poor, as well as the marginal benefit of
additional spending accrue to the various groups of households. Apart from regional level
expenditure data by sector, level o f poverty and service coverage from welfare monitoring
surveys and household income consumption expenditure survey will be utilized. Indicators and
measurements used include; share and pre capita spending, as well as Average and Marginal
Spending Incidence Analysis.

Approach

Ina steady state, the JBARwill be a government ledjoint exercise involvingthe Bankandother
DBSdonors. Inlightofthe presentlimitedcapacity withinthe Government, andthe absence ofa
clear mechanism to institutionalize the process, the preparation of the 2004 JBAR shall be ledby
the World Bank. The existing government PER counterpart team ledby MoFED, shall steer the
process, while other DBSdonors shall contribute technically, andfinancially.

Given the extensive fiscal data requirements at sub-national and programme level, a team
composed o f Bank staff, experts from selected DBS donor and the MoFED, as well as, local
consultants will travel to regions to, i)closely understand the evolving planning and budgeting
system andprocess, ii)the progress indevolving fiscal power to Woredas, and the fiscal relation
between Municipalities and various administrative hierarchies, iii)Available information on
expenditure, and financing at regional, Zonal and Woreda level, as well as selected outputs in
education, healthagriculture andfood security, ruralroad andwater.

Data generated for the May, 2004 light PER, sector studies and sectoral JRMs shall be used to
inform the JBAR. At micro level, data base built for the recent Poverty Assessment PA shall be
used and, ifneeded, enhanced for poverty and social impact analysis. For the fiduciary part, the
JBARwill updatethe recentHPCAAP reportproducedbythe IMFandthe WorldBank.

      ANNEX 10: ACTION PLANTO STRENGTaENSDPFWMONITORINGAND
                                   EVALUATIONSYSTEM
Background

The Government of Ethiopia established a Welfare Monitoring System (WMS) in 1996 to
monitor the effect of economic policy on social outcomes. Key institutions are the Welfare
MonitoringUnitinMoFED, the Central Statistical Authority and several line ministries.

The Welfare Monitoring Unit 0,             which i s part o f the Economic Policy and Planning
Department inthe Ministry o f Finance and Economic Development (MOFED) is entrusted with
the coordination of the M&E system. The WMU is responsible for compiling and analyzing data
collectedby other institutions inorder to provideperformance reports on SDPRP implementation
and for the commissioningo f relevant research andthe dissemination o f findings. The Economic
Planningand Policy Departmentis responsible for drafting the SDPRP Annual Progress Report,
which lays out the annual progress made in the implementation of the SDPRP. The WMU i s
responsible for ensuring that the relevant data are collected for monitoring purposes. As part o f
the plans to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation o f the SDPRP, the Welfare Monitoring
Unit is absorbing new responsibilities,    spearheading the national agenda for monitoring and
evaluation across government and in collaboration with a number o f non-governmental actors
(academic, civil and international). The increased responsibility will be matched by an increase
initstechnical andfinancialcapacity (see sectiononInstitutionalCapacity).

The Central Statistical Authority (CSA) is the main data collection authority inEthiopia. For the
last fifteen years, it has carried out a complex plan o f surveys and censuses, including the
population and agricultural censuses, the Household Income Consumption and Expenditure
Survey (HICES), the Welfare Monitoring Survey (WMS), the Health and Nutrition Survey and
the Labor Force Survey. It has recently completed its second Medium TermNational Statistical
Program (MTSNP) (2003-2008) and is currently in the middle of a process o f institutional
strengthening.

Alongside the CSA, several ministries collect socioeconomic data, mainly from administrative
sources, relevant for the monitoring o f SDPRP implementation. Several line ministries,
especially those with articulated sector programs, runtheir own monitoring systems. The sectors
whose information systems are most relevant for the monitoring o f the SDPRP are education,
health and HIV/Aids, water, roads, agriculture, food security and vulnerability, public sector
managementand capacity building, private sector development, andmacroeconomic and finance.
The level o f development of sector-specific information systems differ significantly from sector
to sector. As a result some sector are able to deliver facility level data (e.g. education), while
others can only make available databyregion (e.g. health).

The monitoring and evaluation action plan has been developed as part o f the PRSC 11
preparation, incollaboration with other donors, to support the implementation andmonitoring o f
the SDPRP. A strong M&E system will deliver accurate and timely information on the
achievement of the agreed set o f prior actions and targets that will trigger the release of annual
budget support funds by donors.




                                               108

Objective

The objective o f the monitoring and evaluation system is to provide the Government with a
reliable mechanism to measure the efficiency o f government and the effectiveness of public
policies inachieving the objectives statedinthe SDPRP.

Design

The M&E system for the SDPRP takes into account the multi-sector approach to achieving
national growth and poverty reduction objectives, as well as the newly implemented
decentralized structure o f intergovernmental responsibilities. Itis designedto:


     a) Monitor input and process indicators across levels o f government (e.g. public
        expenditure, adoptiono freforms) as a measure o f implementation.
     b) Monitor output indicators (e.g. education, health, infrastructure) at various levels o f
        aggregation (household, woreda, national) as a measure o f institutional efficiency.
     c) Monitor developmental outcomesand final objectives to track overall progress.
     d) Relate performance to indicators of reform processes for decentralization, capacity
        building and civil service reform to provide information on the effectiveness of the
        reformprocess inimprovingoutcomes.
     e) Evaluate impact to determine the effectiveness o f key government policies andprograms
        inreachingdesiredobjectives.

Components

Resultsframework and reporting mechanisms

The SDPRP works within a results framework matrix, which forms the basis for
intergovernmental agreementso f major outputs and outcomes to be achieved, and for the design
o f the M&E system. However the quality of the SDPRP matrix will need to be strengthened in
the followingareas:

     a. Analytrcal linkages between government policies and programs, allocated inputs,
        expected outputs, and desired developmental outcomes needed to achieve the overall
        objectives o fthe government program.
     b. Definitions ofindicatorsincludingbaseline values andmedium-termtargets, and
     c. Sources o f data andresponsibility for monitoring..

The current SDPRP reporting mechanisms are weak. The government plans to strengthen
reporting on SDPRPprogress, andregularize dialogue withdonors. Specifically, itplansto:

     a. Strengthen the structure and content o f the SDPRP Annual Progress Report, ensuring
        close linkages withthe result-basedmonitoring framework.
     b. Establish a regular consultative process with donors and civil society including a series
        of M&E workshops. An initial workshop held on May 21 2004 brought together a cross
        section o f government agencies (WMU, CSA and sector ministries) responsible for M&E
        implementation with several non-governmental stakeholders for the government to
        present its M&E strategy and obtain overall endorsement and feedback on key areas o f


                                                109

          implementation. Follow up events will provide the opportunity for consultation and in-
          depthdiscussiononkeyimplementationchallenges.

Improve data quality and availability

The Government proposal for "Strengthening data collection, analysis and dissemination on
poverty monitoring and the Millennium Development Goals", which has received funding
support from the Development Assistance Group, develops a comprehensive strategy to improve
the quality o f poverty data and analysis, and for their use and dissemination. The proposal
focuses on the activities by the Central Statistical Authority and the Welfare Monitoring Unit
that will (a) create the necessary qualitative and quantitative evidence on welfare outcomes at
low levels o f aggregation, and (b) to enhance the broad and timely dissemination o f data to all
stakeholders.

Central Statistical Authority. The CSA proposes to collect the necessary data on welfare
outcomes, via new household surveys conducted at low levels of aggregation (including the
HouseholdIncome andConsumption Expenditure Survey for 2003/04, bi-annualCWIQ surveys),
and a more effective organization o f the available data in the form o f a Socio-Economic
Database. The CSA would also improveusageo f data collectedbythe CSA via the development
o f a far reaching dissemination strategy.

The Ethiopian Socioeconomic Database. The aim o f the database would be to ensure the
availability o f all quantitative evidence relevant for poverty monitoring and evaluation in an
integrated manner. The CSA will develop an integrated electronic database o f all available
survey data, and other data, and all relevant documentation in an appropriate format, both for
internal purposes within the CSA as for other government departments and all other stakeholders.

Welfare Monitoring Unit. To ensure the availability of the necessary evidence from
quantitative and qualitative sources on poverty and welfare outcomes and inputs, the WMU
would: (1) coordinate the collection of participatory and qualitative data on poverty via a
participatory poverty assessment (PPA); (2) construct a poverty map o f Ethiopia, including
poverty estimates at woreda level, using advanced techniques exploiting the census and HICES
data; and (3) establish an Integrated Administrative Management Information System, combining
administrative, budgetary and socio-economic data to monitor progress in SDPRP and other
purposes.

Integrated Administrative Management Information System. The aim o f an integrated M I S i s to
collect and organize all relevant data (including administrative data, budgetary data and all
relevant socio-economic data) for policy planning and monitoring, at levels o f disaggregation
relevant for decentralized policy making. The availability of an integrated data management
system will facilitate the timely and opportune delivery to, andprocessing of, information by the
WMU for trackingprogressinthe implementationo fthe SDPW.

The integrated data management systemwill include administrative information from all relevant
sectors at the woreda, regional and national levels to strengthen the Government's ability to
identifyproblemareasandlowperformers, andoverall to improveperformance.




                                                110

The design of the overall system and installation in MoFED is being financed under the DAG
proposal. The Bank support, via its IDFgrant, will attend to the institutional development inkey
sector ministries including education, health, HIV/AIDS, water, roads, agriculture, food security,
public sector reform and capacity building, private sector, and macroeconomic and budget
sectors to:

    a. Determine indicators for each sector MIS required for SDPRP monitoring,
    b. Design andimplementmodules o fthe I-MIS for each sector,
    c. Design reportingmechanisms fiom local to central government, and
    d. Design action plans for addressing capacity buildingrequirements to improve data flows
        fromlocal governments (woreda) to central ministries.

Developingand building capacity to implement theSDPRP medium-term research agenda

Poor analysis of public policy was identifiedinthe Government action planas one of the reasons
why efforts onthe data collection andmonitoringdonottranslate inbetter results-based decision
making. As part of its harmonization strategy, the Government developed a medium-term
research agenda in consultation with interested partners and with the support of the Ethiopian
research community. The objective o f the agenda is to establish the effectiveness of policies to
deliver expected results in priority areas and provide early feedback in case of failure. It will
include policy analysis and impact evaluation studies geared towards validating the effectiveness
ofkey government policies andprograms inreaching desired objectives.

The Bank, throughan IDF grant, will support the strengthening o f MOFED's capacity for M&E
through technical assistance and training on methods and tools. Impact analysis of altemative
policies and programs will focus on key SDPRP areas including agriculture, water, and
decentralization. The capacity building efforts will take place in close collaboration with
international and national researchers in govemment, research institutes, and universities to
harness world class expertise inthis area. Partnerships with Ethiopianuniversities and research
institutes will be established to enable staff of the MOFED to benefit from analytical expertise
and to strengthenlinks between data collection, policy analysis, and policy formulation.

The following activities will be required:

    a. Design and implement mechanisms for consultation and feedback with the research
         community. Developroster o f analysts and researchers, and website.
    b. Develop a medium-term researchagenda through consultative process withresearchand
         donor communities.
    c. Buildanalytical capacity inMOFED,through training and technical assistance, and fund
         priority evaluation analysis.
    d. Undertake analysis ofkey SDPRP policies.

This is expected to help the Government improve its analysis on the effectiveness ofpolicies and
programs in delivering results, and feed information into the budget process to strengthen the
overall effectiveness ofpublic spending.




                                                111

Strengthen the environmentfor performance-based decision making

International experience shows that it is very difficult to operationalize feedback from the
monitoring and evaluation system into the planning and budgetingprocess. For this reason, the
Government will pay special attention to developing clear mechanisms to link planning,
budgeting andmonitoring andevaluation, Activities will include:

    a) identifjmg key ministries and organizations that are, or will be, involved inmonitoring
        performance,
    b) developingandimplementingatrainingplanonM&E tools andbestpractices
    c) developing mechanisms to link planning and budgeting processes to monitoring and
        evaluation results
    d) Designing and implementing mechanisms to widely disseminate monitoring and
        evaluation results to program managers, policy-makers, communities and other civil
        society organizations.

Participatory monitoring

The Governmenthas not been very receptive to the implementationo f a policy for openaccess to
public information. On the participatory monitoring side, civil society has made someprogress to
reorganize underthe recently established umbrella group calledPoverty Action Network (PAN).
The network has brought together arange ofcivil society organizations andnarroweddown some
areas where these organizations think they can contribute to monitoring implementation of the
SDPRP, namely, expenditure tracking and monitoring the quality of public service delivery. The
Government is moving consciously in its relations with civil society, waiting for PAN to
demonstrate its ability to deliver.

Strengthen institutional capacity

Strengthening SDPRP monitoring and evaluation will require the Welfare Monitoring Unit to
play a critical role in managing and spearheading the monitoring and evaluation agenda o f the
Government, one that cannot be accomplished without a very significant strengthening o f the
W M U s capacity. New responsibilities include managing the integrated data management system;
leading the implementation o f govemment wide M&E action plan across levels and sectors o f
govemment, ensure M&E standards, and support M&Eneeds assessment and capacity building;
heading the SDPRP annual review process, coordinating the sector reviews, and drafting the
SDPRP Annual Progress Report; coordinating the national research agenda, liaising with non-
govemmental institutions; developing protocols for horizontal (sector to sector) sharing o f
knowledge and information within the government; and liaising with other organizations
(academic, international and non governmental) to strengthen the ability o f the government to
leverage on outside resources.

The govemment has already approved the expansion o f the WMU staff and donor resourceshave
already been allocated to expand technical capacity andthe quality o fhumanresources.
