About this Report
      The IndependentEvaluationGroupassesses the programs and activitiesof theWorld Bank for two purposes:
first,to ensurethe integrityof the Banks self-evaluationprocessand to verifythat the Bankswork is producingthe
expected results, and second, to helpdevelop improved directions,policies,and proceduresthroughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWBannually assesses about 25 percentof
the Banks lendingoperationsthroughfieldwork. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceisgivento those
that are innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations; thosefor
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;andthosethat are likelyto generate
important lessons.
      To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examine project files and other
documents,interviewoperational staff, visit the borrowingcountry to discussthe operationwith the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff bothat headquartersand
in local offices as appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subjectto internalIEGWBpeer review, Panel review, and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commentedon by the responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe commentsas
relevant.The completedPPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers'commentsare attached to
the documentthat is sent to the Bank's Board of ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has beensent to
the Board,it is disclosedto the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multipleevaluationmethodsoffers both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibilityto adapt to
lendinginstrument,projectdesign,or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluatorsall applythe same basic methodto
arrive at their projectratings. Following is the definitionand ratingscale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional informationis available on the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectiveswere achieved,or are expectedto
be achieved, efficiently.The rating has three dimensions: relevance,efficacy,and efficiency.Relevance includes
relevanceof objectivesand relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistentwith the country'scurrent developmentpriorities and with current Bank country and
sectoralassistance strategies and corporategoals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers,Country
Assistance Strategies,SectorStrategy Papers,Operational Policies). Relevanceof design is the extent to which
the project'sdesign is consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved,taking intoaccount their relative importance.Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the opportunity cost of capital
and benefitsat least cost comparedto alternatives.The efficiency dimensiongenerally is not appliedto adjustment
operations.Possible ratings for Outcome: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation,that developmentoutcomes (or
expected outcomes)will not be maintained(or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operationand supportedeffectiveimplementationthrough appropriatesupervision (includingensuring adequate
transitionarrangementsfor regular operationof supported activities after loankredit closing, towardthe
achievementof developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (includingthe government and implementing
agency or agencies)ensured quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and
agreements,toward the achievementof developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions:government
performanceand implementingagency(ies)performance.Possible ratings for BorrowerPerformance: Highly
Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory, ModeratelyUnsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This is the Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) for the Ethiopia
Economic Rehabilitation Support Credit (P072890; Credit: C3512); the Economic
Structural Adjustment Credit (P074585; Loadcredit C3666); First Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (P074014; Loadcredit H0730) andthe SecondPoverty Reduction
Support Credit (P077749; Loan: JPN 51119, IDA H1350, JPN 5380). These four
operationswere undertakenwithinaperiod of less than four years. The first two credits
were independentoperationswhichwere intendedto prepare for a seriesof Poverty
ReductionSupport Credits (PRSCs), andthe last two operationswere part of aprojected
series ofthree PRSC operations.

        The Economic Rehabilitation Support Credit (ERSC) of $150 million was
approvedby the Bank's Board on June 5,2001. Itwas associatedwithan IMFthree-year
ESAF arrangementapproved inDecember 2000 for $111million. The Economic
Structural Adjustment Credit (ESAC) of $120 million was approvedby the Bank's Board
on June 18,2002. Likethe ERSC, the ESAC hadboth stabilization andreformobjectives.

        The FirstPoverty ReductionSupport Credit (PRSC I)  of $120 million was
approvedon February 17,2004 to supportthe 2003/04 budget for Ethiopia. The Second
Poverty ReductionCredit (PRSC 11)of $130million was approved onNovember 30,
2004 to support the 2004/05 budget. The PRSCprogram was suspended after PRSC I1
because of governanceconcerns on the part ofthe Bank and other developmentpartners
inthe wake ofthe 2005 elections.

        This PPAR is basedon the relevant documents for the four operationsreviewed
by the Bank's Board, and other documentsrelevant for understandingthe context ofthe
operationsreviewed. They include the Country Assistance Strategies(CASs), the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), IMFreports, and Economic and Sector Work
(ESW) reports. The PPAR is also based on interviews conductedduring a missionto
EthiopiainFebruary, 2007, with governmentofficials andmembers ofcivil societywho
were knowledgeable of Bank support inthe areas reviewed; with Bank staff at
headquartersand inthe Addis Ababa office; with IMF staff; and with staff ofthe resident
offices of some ofthe developmentpartnersactive inEthiopia.

        Comments from the Bank's Regional Managementhave been incorporated. The

Summary

        Since the end o fthe 1998-2000 war with Eritrea, Ethiopia has undertaken
reconstruction, stabilizedthe economy, andrestarted structural reforms beguninthe
1990s. Despite a severe drought in2002/03, economic growth averaged 6 percent per
annumfrom 2000/01through 2005/06 accordingto official statistics. Macroeconomic
management has beenprudentduring most o fthis period, andpro-poor budget spending
rose from 11.7 percent o f GDP in2001/02 to about 16percent in2005/06.

        Economic and social progress inrecent years is hardto assess because o fthe
weak and inconsistent statistical base. Official estimates show average growth o f 6
percent since the end o fthe war, with growth rates o f 10percent per annuminrecent
years. The official poverty headcount estimate also shows a decline from 44.2 percent in
2000 to 40 percent in2005. But these estimates are inconsistent with other indicators,
especially with studies casting doubt on the reliability o f agricultural growth estimates.
Social indicatorshavemostly, but not uniformly, improved. Access to education
expanded dramatically, but at some cost to quality. Infantmortality declined, but average
life expectancy has declined inrecent years because o f HIV/AIDS.

        The four operations under reviewwere all critical elements o fthe Bank's country
assistance strategy (CAS), andthe CAS itselfwas aligned with Ethiopia's evolving
poverty reduction strategy. The Government prepared an InterimPoverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) inlate 2000 outlining reconstructionneeds and a program of
structural reforms to promote private investment, increase competitiveness inagricultural
inputs, andstreamline public development expenditure, particularly inhealthand
education. The Bank's InterimSupport Strategy (ISS) inNovember 2000 focused on
post-war reconstruction andeconomic and social rehabilitation. Two o fthe operations
reviewedinthis report, the Ethiopian Economic Rehabilitation Support Credit (ERSC)
andthe Economic StructuralAdjustment Credit (ESAC) grew out o fthe ISS.

        In2002 Ethiopiaprepared afull PRSP, knownas the Sustainable Development
andPovertyReductionProgram (SDPRP). The SDPRP was built on four pillars:(1)
Agricultural Development Led Industrialization(ADLI) and food security; (2)
governance, decentralization, and empowerment; (3) reform of thejustice systemandthe
civil service; and (4) capacity building. The Bank's CAS approved inMarch2003 had
three thematic objectives meant to support the SDPRP: enhancingpro-poor growth;
enhancinghumandevelopment outcomes by improvinggovernance; and reducing
vulnerability. Enhancingpro-poor growth was to be promotedthrough two sub-
objectives: private sector development(PSD) and rural growth. The main instrument
proposedfor promotingthe Bank's objectives was a series o f multi-sector budgetsupport
operations: Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). Three PRSC operations were
programmed but only two were completed. The third PRSC was suspended in2005,
along with direct budget support from other donors, becauseo f governance issues.

        Inthe first two Operations, stabilizationwas the main objective. Emphasis varied
over time, but a number o freform objectives or components were common to all four
operations: public expenditurepolicy and management; private sector development; and

                                            xiv


humandevelopment through increasedpro-poor spending andbetter service delivery. In
ERSC and ESAC public sector management reform was an objective. PRSC operations
includedrural development as an important objective.

        The ERSC operation was highly successful inpromoting its primary objective of
stabilization. Inconjunction withthe Fund's PRGF program, ERSC helpedset the stage
for sound macroeconomic management for several years inthe face o f difficult external
conditions. The operation also achieved its secondary macro objective o f reallocating the
budgettowards poverty-reducing expenditures. Achievement o fthe operation's reform
objectives was negligible, however. There was little short-term impact andthe
benchmarks for future action were vague and un-prioritized, and-as became
subsequently clear -meantdifferent things to the Bank and the Government. Indeed, the
attempt to introducereform elements inthis operation antagonized the Government
(which believedEthiopia hadbeen promised unconditionalrehabilitation assistance) and
may have set back reform inthe longer term by hardeningpositions prematurely on both
sides. Overall outcome is ratedmoderately satisfactory.

        Likethe ERSC, the ESAChadboth stabilizationandreformobjectives. Design
was flawed because stabilization and reform became competing priorities under time
pressure created by the urgency o fprojectedbalance o fpayments needs. Inthe event,
stabilization was achieved, but not because o f ESAC funding. Effectiveness was
inexplicably delayed for more than five months after Board approval. O nthe reform
side, ESAC accomplished more than ERSC but outcomes continued to be mixed. There
was inadequate linkage between the actions under ESAC andthe previous operation.
Expected follow-up actions were downplayed or left out (fertilizer policy, telecom sector
policy, privatization), butthere was progress insome areas (liberalization o fthe air cargo
market, approval of a new civil service law, andinitial steps to addressproblems of land
access and competition policy). Overall outcome i s ratedmoderately satisfactory.

        The PRSC program was meant to be a series o fthree single-tranche operations
withina medium-term framework. Other donors providedparallel budget support. Each
PRSC operation outlined proposed actions andtriggers for the next, with the amount
varying between $120 millionto $150 million dependingon performance. The PRSC
was complemented by a major capacity-building project (PSCAP) and investment
projects inother areas, but budget support through the PRSC would gradually replace
SWAPSinhealth and education. Direct budgetsupport was expected to reduce
transaction costs, ensure timely donor support, and ensure predictable federal transfers to
encourage planningat lower levels. An unspoken aim o f direct budget support was to
permit"scaling up" o fthe level o f assistance, an objective o fthe Africa Region for which
PRSCs were seen as an important instrument.

        Although emphasis varied, each operation had similar areas o f focus: public
institutionalperformance, rural development and vulnerability, private sector
development (PSD), and humandevelopment. It became apparent early on that the Bank
andthe Government had inconsistent expectations. All ofthe rural development and
PSD issues hadbeen on the agenda o f either ERSC or ESAC, and the Bank had hoped to
be able to agreeto further actions inmost ofthese areasunder the PRSC program. The
SDPRP had also foreshadowed reforms inthese areas. But it was not possible to reach

                                            xv


agreement with the Government on the nature o f specific actions. Because o f
disagreements, particularly over telecom sector reforms, the Bank reduced the amount o f
PRSC Ifrom $150 million to $120 million. Similarly, the Bank reduced the amount o f
PRSC I1to $130 million because o f inadequate progress on PSD andrural development.

        The outcome of PRSC Iwas moderately satisfactory. There was progress in
strengthening planningand budgetingand inimproving institutional performance, and
also inexpandingbudget support and improving governance of service delivery for
humandevelopment. Butoutcomes were unsatisfactory for promotingprivate and
financial sector development, and for rural development and vulnerability.

        The objectives and design o f PRSC I1were less relevant thanPRSC I.
Insufficient account was taken o fthe lack o fprogress on private sector development and
policy actions were relatively un-ambitious. Achievement o f objectives (efficacy) was
also less thanunder PRSC I.   Negligible progress was made inimproving the investment
climate. Progress on public institutional performance slowed andthe human
development component was mixed. The vulnerability objective, encompassing the rural
development and vulnerability component, is also ratedmodest. The overall outcome
rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

        The main conclusion is that, while the PRSC instrument was a useful instrument
insome areas, inEthiopiathere was too muchbudget support too soon. The overall
outcome o fthe PRSC program i s rated moderately unsatisfactory. Specific findings are:

        The Bank moved too quickly into direct budget support through the PRSC
        program. Direct budget support for human development was premature. Despite
        considerable ESW on PSD, not enough policy dialogue hadtaken place to
        develop a shared understandingand compatible expectations between the Bank
        andthe government.
        The Bank also relied too heavily on direct budget support (too much as well as
        too soon). Heavy reliance on this instrument increased the risk o fprogram failure
        andledto programs that were too broadandill-focused to be effective in
        promoting policy change and institutional development as opposed to resource
        transfer.
        The complementary PSCAP program increasedthe effectiveness o fthe PRSC in
        public expenditure management. Effectiveness inrural development and
        education suffered because o fthe lack o f complementaryprojects and programs.
        The PRSC improvedcoordinationand alignment, but itprovedno more flexible
        thanother forms ofaid. Theprogramwas cut, butnotenough, whenitturnedout
        that Government support for PSD and rural development was weak. When a
        major dispute on governance arose, the entire program was terminated.

The mainlessons o fthe revieware that:

        Budgetsupport and other program assistanceneedto beundertakenwithina
        medium-termpolicy framework. This lesson was learned from the first two
        operations prior to the PRSC program.

Complementary investment or capacity buildingprojects may be critical to the
effectiveness o f direct budget support through a PRSC.
Successful programmatic budget support through PRSCs requires careful
preparation. Prior analytical work andpolicy dialogue are neededto prevent
misunderstandings and inconsistent expectations.
Direct budget support i s high-risk. Itis vulnerable to sudden loss o fpolitical
support fiom bilateral donors and i s no less subject to sudden terminationthan
policy-based lending.

1.BACKGROUND

1.1     After the overthrow o fthe Dergregime in 1991,the new EthiopianGovernment
introduced economic reforms and stabilization measures that reversedeconomic decline
andraisedthe average growthrate to 6.9 percent duringthe period 1992-97. The war with
Eritrea from 1998-2000 disrupted the Government's development and reform program and
the Bank's lending. Withthe ceasefire inMay 2000, the Bank and other development
partners resumedsupport andthe Government seemed ready to focus on rehabilitation and
development and to resume the economic reform program o fthe mid-90s.

1.2     The Government prepared an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP)
inlate2000. The I-PRSP stressedthe needto finance emergencyrehabilitation
programs, provide foreign exchange for immediate import needs, andreduce domestic
borrowing. Stabilization requireda sharp reduction inmilitaryspending and access to
significant foreign financing. The I-PRSPalso outlined structural reforms to promote
private investment, increase competitiveness inagricultural inputs, and streamline public
developmentexpenditure, particularly inhealth and education. In2002 Ethiopia
prepared a full PRSP, known as the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction
Program (SDPRP). The SDPRP was built on four pillars: (1) Agricultural Development
Led Industrialization(ADLI)and food security; (2) governance, decentralization, and
empowerment; (3) reform o fthejustice system andthe civil service; and (4) capacity
building.

1.3     The Bank's country assistance strategy was aligned with Ethiopia's evolving
poverty reduction strategy. The Bank's Interim Support Strategy (ISS) inNovember
2000 focused on post-war reconstruction and economic and social rehabilitation. It
proposed an emergency assistanceprogram o f four operations amounting to $700 million
over two years, plusinvestmentlendingo f about $200 million. Two o fthe operations
reviewedinthis report, the EthiopianEconomic Rehabilitation SupportCredit (ERSC)
and the Economic Structural Adjustment Credit (ESAC) grew out ofthe ISS. The Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy approved inMarch 2003 endorsedthe four pillars ofthe
SDPRP. Bank strategywas summarizedinthree thematic objectives: enhancing pro-poor
growth; enhancing humandevelopment outcomes by improvinggovernance; and
reducingvulnerability. Enhancingpro-poor growth was to be promotedthrough two sub-
objectives: private sector development (PSD) and rural growth. The maininstrument
proposedfor promoting the Bank's objectives was a series ofmulti-sector budgetsupport
operations: PovertyReductionSupport Credits (PRSCs), two o f which are under review
here.

1.4     A numberofcore objectives or components were common to all four operations:
publicexpenditure policy andmanagement;private sector development; andhuman
development through increased pro-poor spending and better service delivery. Table 1
summarizes the maincomponentsof the operations.

       Overview of Economic and Social Progress

       Growth and economic management
        1.5          Ethiopia continued its traditional prudent macroeconomic management during
      most o fthe period since the end o fthe war. Performance under an IMF PRGFfacility
       during2001-4 was good. All the quantitative andstructural performance criteria required
       for completion were achieved. Ethiopia also reached the completionpoint for the HIPC
      Initiative inApril 2004, which reduced external debt and brought scheduled debt service
       obligations to more manageable levels. During2005, following the electoral crisis,
       external assistancewas reduced and macroeconomic management beganto deteriorate.
      By early 2007 inflationwas runningat about 17percent, the trade deficit had reached
       about one-fourth o f GDP, and foreign exchange reserves were less thantwo months o f
       imports. Table 2 shows selected macroeconomic and performance indicators for the past
       several years.

        1.6          According to official statistics, growth o f GDP has averaged nearly 6 percent per
      year during 1998199-2005/06. Inper capita terms this implies annual average growth o f
       about 3 percent, an increase of about one-fourth over the entire eight-year period. Inthe
      past three years overall growth has averaged 10percent.

        1.7          There are reasonsto believe that growth rates inrecent years have been
       overestimated, however, particularly for agriculture.'

                     Despite highgrowth estimates for agriculture, food prices have increased at
                     double-digit levels. This is unusual inperiods o frecovery from drought.2



       I       Some resident staff fiom other developmentpartner agencies estimatedthat total GDPgrowth inthe past
      three years may have beenmore on the order of 6-7 percentper year rather than 10percent. This i s only an
      "informed guess", however, and is not based on survey data. The IMF staffreport on Article IV
      consultationsin2007 notedthat, "The data provided to the Fundare adequatefor surveillancepurposes, but
      major weaknesses persist and further steps shouldbe takento address the shortcomings inreal, fiscal, and
      balanceofpayments statistics without delay."
      2        The Africa Regionhas commented: "there are numerousstudies beingcarried out by academics in
      Ethiopia and Bank staff to precisely understandthis unusualphenomenon-not                                                                                                                                   one of them has found that
     the cause is exaggeratedproduction numbers... some independentsources (e.g., FAO)have found that
      cereal production has increasedfaster than what the government statistics (Le. Central Statistical Agency-
      CSA) show, and others (e.g., Bellmon) have found the opposite. A Bank report on `food price inflation,'

                                                       3


         Agricultural production figures are based not on sample surveys but on estimatesgiven
         by local officials who have an incentiveto report good results.
          Growth ofvalue added inagriculture (the relevant concept for GDP) has not kept upwith
          growth of agricultural output. Taking account of inputcosts, net farm income has not
          grown commensurately with gross income. The Bank's draft report on Policiesfor Pro-
         Poor Agricultural Growth (February 2007) shows that, basedon currently usage patterns,
          fertilizer use does not appear to be profitable; farmers are losing money.3




sharedthe concernthat CSA's methodology does suffer fromnon-samplingerrors, but concludedthat it is
neverthelessthe most accurate, timely and cost-effectivetechnique for estimatingcrop productionin
Ethiopiaon a regular basis.
3The Africa Regionhas commentedthat "what has been left unstatedis that farmers inEthiopiadon't pay
market pricesfor inputs-there is considerable subsidy involvedinvarious forms. Second, various studies
on `food price inflation' havefoundthat farmers are now more organizedthroughcooperativesand are able
to better bargainwith the factor suppliers as well as the buyers oftheir produce. Independentfield surveys,
commissionedby the Bank, have shownsignificantincreases infarmer welfare, indiverse regions,
consistentwith officially reportedgrowth. The evidencethus suggests that farmers' margins are improving
andnot falling inEthiopia." This comment is not relevantto the argument about GDP growth, but it has
significantimplicationsfor poverty. Subsides are consistent with low value added and low value added
meansthat GDP growthwouldbe overestimated. Indeed, ifthere is negativevalue added (value
subtracted), growthofgross output would actuallylower GDP. But ifinputs are subsidized andmargins
are improving, then gross output growth shouldreducepoverty.

      1.8                                    One significant achievement was the reallocation o fthe budgettowards pro-poor
    sectors. (InEthiopia, the pro-poor sectors are defined as: education, health, agriculture
    and food security, roads, andwater and sanitation.) Pro-poor spendingas a share of GDP
    rose from 11.7 percent in2001/02,the first year after the war with Eritrea, to about 16
    percent in2005/06.

   Poverty Reduction
     1.9                                    Just as there i s uncertainty over the growth rate, so is there uncertainty over
   poverty trends. The Bank's Poverty Assessment (Well-Beingand Poverty inEthiopia)
    estimated that poverty incidence inEthiopia (usinga national poverty line equivalent to
    $1.50 per day in 1993 PPP) declined only marginally between 1990 and 2004 - from 38.4
   percent to 36.2 percent. Overall, poverty incidence has been volatile with no discernible
   trend duringthe entire period. Since poverty incidence was almost identical in 1990 and
     1999,a similar marginal decline (from 38.5 percent to 36.2 percent) occurred during
    1999- 2004.

1.10    Household survey data, however, show a more substantial drop inthe p V                 rtY
headcount from 44.2 percent of the population in 1999/2000 to 38.7 percent in2004/2005
(See Table 2.). The methodology has not yet been verified, but ifa decline o fthis
magnitude did take place and i s sustained, it would be a significant accomplishment.
Evidence from other sources is mixed. An ongoing panel study done for the Bank4
shows a decline inthe rural poverty headcount from 50 percent to 43 percent between
2000 and 2004, and a drop inthe urbanpoverty headcount from 45.2 percent to 40.0
percent duringthe same period. A participatory poverty assessment' commissionedby
the Government and undertaken duringthe same period as the household survey does not
point to substantial improvements. A rural survey done by the Bank in2006 found that
rural households reporting changes inincome inthe past year (whenagricultural growth
was over 11percent) were about equally dividedamong those reporting an increase,
those reporting a decrease, and those reporting no change.

1.11 There are several reasonswhy poverty reduction may have been limited.6

        Harvest failure in2003 threatened about 14 million people with famine. This not
        only caused a spike inthe incidence o fpoverty inthat year, but also had longer-
        term effects becauseo f loss o f livestock and other assets.
        Growth has been disproportionately drivenby the service sector. According to
        the Bank's Poverty Assessment, real annual per capita growth inservices from
        1992-2004 was 6.8 percent vs. -0.25 percent inagriculture. Within services,

6The Africa Regionhas commentedthat "of the four reports {mentioned)-Bank's Poverty Assessment;
GoE's householdsurvey results; Bigstenand Shimeles; and Ellisand Woldehanna-two foundthat the
povertyheadcountratiohas fallen significantlywhile the other two found that the declinehas beenmuch
moremodest."

        government services (public administration, health, education, and defense) grew
        mostrapidly (10.2 percent per capita from 1992-2004), and upto 2000, military
        expendituregrew especially rapidly. Since 2000, defense expenditure has
        declined while poverty-reducing spending has increased. This shouldbe more
        favorable for long-term growth, but there are still issues about the effectiveness o f
        poverty-reducingexpenditure, e.g. the share going to expansion o f government
        employment and recurrent expenditure ("Public Sector Reform, Decentralization
        and Governance inEthiopia", backgroundpaper for Country Assistance
        Evaluation). Government services have continuedto be the fastest-growing
        sector, contributing 13 percent o f incremental GDP during 1998/9-2005/6. If
        agricultural growthproves to be overestimated, the government services share o f
        incremental growth would be even higher.7
        Lack o f rural-urbanmobility has restricted opportunities for income
        diversification for the 85 percent o f Ethiopians who live inrural areas.
        Diversification andoff-farm income growth have beenthe main way out o f
        poverty for rural households inmost o fthe world. InEthiopia, too, the share of
        off-farm income i s negatively associated withpoverty incidence (see Ellis and
        Woldehanna), butthe government's landtenure policy has created a sense of
        insecurity which deters diversification andrural-urban mobility.

1.12    Ultimately, the extent to which overty was reducedmay depend inlarge part on
how fast agriculture has been growing.         B

Social indicators
1.13     Social indicators have mostly, butnot uniformly, improved inrecent years. In
education, access has improved substantially,but the pupil/teacher ratio has increased
(Table 3). Inhealth, infantmortality andmaternalmortality have bothdeclined (Table
4), but life expectancy first increased from the 1997 baseline of 52 years to 54 years in
2001/02, and then droppedto 48 in2005. Access to improved sources o f water declined
from23 percent in1990to 22 percent in2006, and per capita water consumption in
Addis Ababa fell by 25 percentbetween 1998 and 2005.




7The Afica Regionhas commentedthat the argument above is misleading: "First, not all educationand
health servicesinEthiopiaare publicly funded. Second, rapidgrowthofeducationaland health services,
whether publicly or privately funded, are neither a badthing nor are they completely devoidof any impact
on poverty. Third, the share of government consumption(correctly defined) to nationalGDP inEthiopia
has been steadily falling and not risingas claimedby PPAR. Fourth, severalyears of double digit growth
andrelativelyequitable distributionare fully consistentwith significantpovertydeclines."

2. ECONOMICREHABILITATIONSUPPORT
    CREDIT

Background

2.1     Near the end o fthe 1998-2000 Ethiopian-Eritrean War, the President o fthe Bank,
Mr.WolfensohnmetwithPrimeMinister Meles Zenawito discuss possible Bank
assistancefor post-war reconstruction. The talks were informal, but a "gentlemen's
agreement" was reachedthat the Bankwould provide $700 million o f fast-disbursing
assistanceafter the war ended. The amount discussed was very specific, according to
Country Team membersina positionto know. Discussiono fpost-war policy was vague
and less conclusive.

2.2      The Bank's InterimSupport Strategy (ISS) o fNovember 2000 proposeda $700
millionemergency post-conflict support package whichwas to become effective when a
peace agreement was signed on December 12,2000. Includedinthe package were four
lending operations: Emergency Demobilization andReintegration Project ($170 million,
approved November 2000); Emergency Recovery Program ($230 million, approved
November 2000); Fertilizer Supplemental ($55 million, approved June 14,2001) and
Emergency Support Credit (proposed to be $250 million). Duringand after Board
discussion o fthe ISS a number o f executive directors expressed their preference for making
the Emergency Support Credit (ESC) apolicy-based rather than an emergency operation.
At the concept reviewmeetinginJanuary 2001 for the proposed ESC, it was decided to
change the operation from emergency to policy-based andto split it into two single-tranche
credits extendingover a longer period o f 12-18 months. The rationale for these changes
was that they would provide urgently-needed assistance inthe short-term and give time to
reach agreement on and begin implementinga medium-termprogramof structural reform.
The two single-tranche credits that finally emergedwere the ERSC ($150 million,
approved June 5,2001, andthe ESAC ($120 million, approvedJune 18,2002).

2.3      The changes did not take place smoothly. The Governmentfelt that it was
prematureto define a structural reformprogramso soon after the war and while
preparations for a full PRSP were ongoing and, furthermore, believedthat the Bank was
acting inbadfaith inseeking to impose conditionality for what it regarded as an
agreementto provide $700millionof emergencyfunding. The Regionconcludedthat the
programthat emerged after appraisal was too weak to be considered a policy-based loan
andrecommended that the ERSC be classifiedas a rehabilitationcredit rather thanan
adjustment operation. But the operation did include some policy reforms and indications
offuture reforms, and the Region saw the ERSC as a bridgeto future policy-based
lending.g




9At the time, the Regionexpectedto move straight onto a PRSCprogramfollowing afull PRSP and CAS
to be completedinFY 02.

Objectives and Components

2.4      The objectives o fthe ERSC were:

         Stabilization. The President's Report statedthat the credit supported "the
         Government's efforts instabilizing the economy and movingback to a sustainable
         path o f growth, as a necessary condition for poverty reduction." This included as
         a secondary objective for reallocation o fpublic spendingtowards poverty-
         reducing expenditure.
         Support reforms in(i) sector management; (ii) expenditure policy
                                public                          public
         andmanagement; and (iii) sector development (PSD) andexport
                                    private
         competitiveness.

2.5      The reform measures supported underERSC were meant to complement reforms
under the IMFPRGF. The PRGFincluded modest reforms inthe trade and foreign
exchange regimes, the financial sector, andtax policy and administration. The policy
matrix from the ERSC President's Report (report number P7441-ETYApril 30,2001) is
included as Annex A. Thepublic sector management sub-objective o fthe ERSC
supported the Government's civil service reform program and included components on:
strengthening the legal framework; performance incentives; improving service delivery;
and enhancing the transparency o fpersonnel management systems. Thepublic
expenditurepolicy and management sub-objective included components to support the
Government's ExpenditureManagement and Control Program, andto strengthen social
service delivery. The PSD and export competitiveness sub-objective included
components to remove regulatory constraints on investment; promote exports; continue
privatization o fparastatals; and increase agricultural productivity by reforming fertilizer
policy. Several issues were identified for future action: removing the banon exports o f
hidesand skins, taking steps to attract direct foreign investment; enhancing the regulatory
framework and competition for utilities (including telecommunications); and improving
the urbanlandmarket.

Relevance of Objectives and Design

2.6      The operation was highlyrelevant to the stabilization objectives. Bank funding
exceeded that o fthe IMF andbecame more important for meetingEthiopia's financing
gap than projectedbecause o f a fall incoffee prices. Relevance o f designwas ensured by
IMFmonitoring withina three-year macro framework under the PRGF. The operation
and its design were also relevantto the secondary objective o freallocating public
expendituretowards poverty-reducing sectors. The project bothprovided significant
resources for budgetplanning and sought to improve budgetmanagement.

2.7      Stabilizationwas the dominant, and certainly the most urgent, objective. The
economy was recovering from a drought and a sharp deteriorationinterms o ftrade, as
well as suffering from destructionand dislocation from war. The IMFhad approved a
three-year arrangementunder PRGF inDecember 2000. This provided fundingo f $111
million and established an agreed macroeconomic framework for which the $150 million
o f fast-disbursing assistance from the Bank was a critical part o fthe financing plan. The
ERSC was intended to help the Government reduce domestic financing o f the deficit and

rebuildforeign exchangereserves, andwould finance increasedprivate sector imports in
line withthe removal o frestrictions inthe foreign exchange market.

2.8     Poverty-targeted expenditures hadbeen crowded out duringthe war. Reallocation
dependedmainlyon reduceddefense spendingwhichwas scheduledto fall from 13.3
percent o f GDP in 1999/2000 to 7.3 percent in2000/01,while poverty-targeted spending
was scheduled to rise from 8.6 percent o f GDPto 12.1 percent inthe same period. The
ERSC was to support this reallocation by helpingto increase the overall resource
envelope andby usingprojections o f further increases insubsequent years as benchmarks
for future operations.

2.9     Relevance to reform objectives was more mixed. The operation supported some
concrete policy measures that could plausibly be expected to support PSDandincrease
exports (including privatization, duty exemptions for exports, enhanced export credit
guarantees, and reductioninexport regulations). It also included as a prior action
adoption o fa draft Civil Service Law to support better public sector management through
civil service reform. But manyprior actions were to initiate studies, develop action
plans, or set up committees. These could helpidentify important areas andinitiate a
process for future reform, but the nature of future actions often remainedto be defined.
Benchmarks for actions also remainedvague, with a few exceptions such as the
benchmark to allow foreign private sector participation inthe Ethiopian
Telecommunications Corporation before the end o f 2002/03. With 43 benchmarks for
2001/02 and 28 for 2002/03, the indicative future program was broad and un-prioritized.

2.10    The overall rating o f relevance o f objectives and design is substantial.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)

Stabilization:
2.11    The operation made an important contribution towards its primary objective o f
stabilizing the economy. The credit became effective and disbursedthe full $150 million
on July 5,2001,one day before the end o f the fiscal year, thus helpingto reduce domestic
financing from 8.4 percent o f GDP in 1999to 0.9 percent in2000/01. The volume o f
imports decreased only 1.9 percent (compared to a fall of 17.9 percent the previous year)
despitecontinued deterioration inthe terms o ftrade and a degree ofimport liberalization.
GDP growth increased and consumer prices actually fell, mainly due to a goodharvest
and food aid imports, but also due inpartto sustained import levels for the non-
agricultural sector. Reserves did not increase as planned, but rather fell slightly to only 2
months of imports. Finally, there was a significant budget reallocation towards poverty-
targetedexpenditures which rose from 8.2 percent o f GDP in 1999/2000 to 11.7 percent
in2000/01, slightly short ofthe target of 12.1 percent. Support for stabilizationwas both
effective andtimely, and overall progress inachieving the stabilization objective was
high.

                                               12


Reform
2.12     The broad reform objectives underlying the ERSC were both to support actions
which might have a significant short-term impact and to help define an agenda for further
reforms insubsequent operations over the medium term. Neither objective was met.

2.13    Public sector management. The Government adopted a new civil service law and
approved a national service delivery policy as agreed prior actions. Both o f these were
useful steps that were followed up inESAC and the PRSC program. But the Government
undermineda planto restructure civil service salaries by raising the pay o fthe lowest
salary grades. A major program o f decentralization was also launched in2001. This
significantly increased the complexity o fpublic sector management ando f public
expenditure management.

2.14    Public expenditure management. The ICR for ERSC and ESAC (report number
27570, December 19,2003, p.13) concluded: "This component i s rated unsatisfactory for
both credits becausethe intento fthe component has not been advanced despite the
eventual compliance with most o fthe credits' prior actions. Whereas ERSC appraisal
identified a number o f critical measuresto achieve the strategic aim o f linkingplanning
andbudgetingto policy choices, these measures were not taken up as prior actions under
either credit, but were left for future years. Three full budget cycles on, the key ones -
adherence to the financial calendar and development o f an action planfor the public
expenditure program (PEP) -have still not started." Essentially, the Government andthe
Bank started afreshto try to addresspublic expenditure management issues underthe
PRSC.

2.15    Promoting PSD and export competitiveness. The one area inwhich measures
were taken that might have been expected to produce quick economic benefitswas export
promotion. As it turned out, there was little short-term supply response or significant
longer-term impact. A bonded warehouse scheme was introducedbut produced almost
no response (one firm inthree years). Under an export credit guarantee scheme, the
National Bank o f Ethiopia issuedonly 17 guarantees, o fwhich 5 defaulted, and only 10
supplier's credits were issued. A quality certificate for exports continued to berequired,
contrary to conditionality. Inthe case o f PSD, the privatization program slowed and then
stalled for several years rather thanprogressing as planned. This was partly due to poor
designand implementationbut also reflectedGovernment ambivalence. Finally, the
proposed measuresto increase private participation infertilizer marketing, which were
meantto reverse trends under the failed National Fertilizer project, also failed to take
place.

2.16     Overall efficacy o fthe reform objective was negligible. Based on the dominance
o f the stabilization objective and the separate ratings for stabilization and reform, overall
efficacy i s rated substantial.

Outcome

2.17    The ERSC operation was highly successful inpromoting its primaryobjective o f
stabilization. Inconjunction with the IMF's PRGFprogram, ERSC helpedset the stage
for sound macroeconomic management for several years inthe face o f difficult external

                                              13


conditions. The operation also achieved its secondary macro objective o f reallocating the
budgettowards poverty-reducing expenditures. Achievement o fthe operation's reform
objectives was negligible, however. There was little short-term impact andthe
benchmarks for future action were vague and un-prioritized, and- as became
subsequently clear -meant different things to the Bank and the Government. Indeed, the
attempt to introduce reform elements inthis operation antagonized the Government and
may have set back reform inthe longer term by hardeningpositions prematurely on both
sides. Overall outcome i s ratedmoderately satisfactory.

R I S K S TO DEVELOPMENT    OUTCOMES
2.18      The President's Report identified four risks: economic shocks such as further
deterioration inthe terms o ftrade; resumption o fhostilities with Eritrea; weak capacity in
the public and private sectors; and a weakening commitment to reform. Three o fthese
adverse developments took place: the terms o ftrade continued to deteriorate until
2004/05, andmore importantly, a severe drought took place in2002/03, capacity proved
to be an obstacle to progress on improving public expenditure management andreforms
such as privatization; andcommitment to some reforms provedto be weaker than
anticipated by the Bank. The macroeconomic management accomplishments turned out
to be quite robust inthe face o f economic shocks. Ethiopiacompleted the PRGFprogram
and continued sound macro management for about four years. More recently (since late
2005) the IMFhas expressed some concerns about the effectiveness o f management. The
shifttowards poverty-reducing expenditure seems well-entrenched, thoughthere are
issues about the effectiveness o f such expenditure. The risk to development outcomes for
stabilization and macro management are moderate.

2.19      On the reform side, little was accomplished inthis operation to be placedat risk,
but ifthe focus is placedonthe riskthat development outcomes will not be realized(and
notjust maintained), thenrisk to development outcomes for reforms should be rated
signiJicant.

2.20      Giventhe heavy weight o fthe stabilization objective, the overall riskto
development outcomes is rated moderate.

Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

2.21 Design. Macro indicatorswere conventionaland well-established. The definition
o fpoverty-targeted expenditure (health, education, agriculture, and roads) was simple
andunderstandable, ifbroad, butthe indicator was only an input. Indicators o freform
were mostly outputs, and some o fthe outputs were ill-defined. Overall, the design was
modest.

2.22      Implementation. Ineffect, implementation o f macro monitoring was done by the
IMFthrough reviews o fthe PRGFprogram. Prior actions underthe operation included
the launch of a study o f poverty incidence and trends and the launch o f a work program
to analyze the impact o f Government policies and programs on the poor. Little attention
seems to have beengivento creating a results framework for reform components. Given
the overall focus on stabilization andbudget allocation, implementation is rated
substantial.

                                              14


2.23    Utilization. The IMF clearly usedmacro indicators to update and adjust the
macro program o f PRGF. The Bank continued to focus on interpretation o f compliance
withreformoutput indicators. UseofM&E for preparationofthe nextoperationwas
minimal because o f inadequate design o f indicators. Rating: modest.

2.24    The overall rating for M&Eis modest.

BankPerformance

2.25    The Bankwas under considerable pressure to move quickly during preparationof
ERSC because o furgent financial needs. The decision to create a smaller one-tranche
operation was driven partlyby time pressure. The decision to try to incorporate policy
elements into the operationcomplicatedpreparation, dialogue with the Government, and
coordinationwith other donors. IEGagreeswith the ICR assessment: "The Bank should
have explicitly recognizedthat ERSC could not be a policy reform credit." Because o f
thisdecision, andthe poor design o freform elements, quality at entry isratedmoderately
satisfactory.

2.26    The supervision mission identified some delays inimplementationthat were
attributed to lack o f capacity and lack o fhigh-level attention. This was partly correct, but
the missionseems to havemisjudgedthe extentto which the Government was committed
to reforms insome areas. Quality o f supervision i s ratedmoderately satisfactory.
Overall Bank performance i s rated moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance

2.27    The Government resistedboththe decision to split the originally planned
operation into two single-tranche credits and the decisionto incorporate policy
conditions, and the Government delayed some important decisions until late inthe
processing cycle. Implementationo fthe macro program, including reallocation towards
poverty-reducing expenditure, was strong and continued to be sustained after the
operation. Implementationo fthe agreed reform program was mixed. The Government
complied withmost prior actions, though often with some delays. Overall borrower
performance is ratedsatisfactory.

3. ETHIOPIASTRUCTURALADJUSTMENT
    CREDIT

Background

3.1     The ESAC was presented to the Board about one year after the ERSC, and
provided the last installment from the $700 million emergency assistance envisioned in
the ISS. Macromanagementhadbeen sound and Ethiopia continuedto meetthe program
targets andbenchmarks under the PRGF arrangement with the Fund, butthe amount o f
the ESAC was increased fiom the originally-planned $100 millionto $120 million to help
offset a projected increase inthe external deficit due to the more difficult international
environment after the events o f September 11,2001.

3.2     The PRSP hadnot been completed so there was no CAS inplace as had originally
beenhoped, and therefore there was no possibility o f introducing a Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) program at this stage. Preparations for the PRSP were well-
advanced, but it hadbeen delayed due to an extensive consultation process and a struggle
within the rulingparty over the direction o feconomic policy. At aparty conference in
September 2001the reform faction ledby the Prime Minister gained the upper handand
the Government seemedset to introduce aprogram o fgradual but extensive reforms. In
the Bank's view there was no question but that the ESAC shouldbe policy-based. The
Government still resisted conditionality andthere were delays inreaching agreement on
some issues. Because o f the urgency o fprojected financing needs, the approach o fthe
end of the fiscal year for boththe Bank and the Government, anda closing window for
allocation o f IDA, the Bank's bargainingposition on policy issues was weak. It came as
a surprise, therefore, that after Boardapproval on June 18,2002, the Government delayed
taking steps to makethe credit effective untilNovember28,2002, more thanfive months
later.

Objectives

3.3     Like the ERSC, the ESAC had both stabilization and reform objectives.
According to the President's Report (Number P7521-ETYMay 15,2002): "The proposed
Credit supports Government's efforts instabilizing the economy and achieving a
sustained path o f growth.. . The ESAC focuses on economy-wide reforms aimed at
improving the investmentclimate for the private sector, insupport o fthe Government's
pro-poorgrowthstrategy; deepening civil service reforms and strengthening public
expendituremanagement to improvethe quality ofpublic services delivery."

3.4     The policy matrix set out the objectives andtheir maincomponents or prior
actions as follows (see Annex B):

        Maintaining Poverty-Focused Macroeconomic Policies. This includedprior
        actions to

                                                16

         -
         9   Sustain good macro performance
             Make further increases inallocations to poverty-targeted sectors inthe
             2002/03 draft budget
             Prepare a full draft PRSP


         Promoting Private Sector Development through various actions to
         .   Improve the business environment
             Reduce transactions costs
             Increase export competitiveness
         Improving Public Sector Management and Service Delivery through components
         aimed at
         .   Strengthening the legal framework for civil service reform
             Improving expenditure management
             Enhancingperformance incentives
             Improving fiscal monitoring and accountability
3.5      As inthe ERSC, the reform objectives includedbothprior actions and indications
o f future directions. "Future operations will emphasize the deepening o f these [PSD and
public sector management] reforms, inthe areas o f further private sector growth,
decentralization and empowerment, capacity building, infrastructure and human
development."

Relevance of Objectives and Design

3.6      The stabilization objectives o fthe operation appeared as relevant as under ERSC.
The Government hadmade progress on stabilization but the situation was fragile because
o fthe external environment. ESAC was intendedto helpkeep macro management on
track inconjunction with IMFmonitoring under the PRGF. Support for continued
increases inbudget allocations towards poverty-targeted sectors also remainedrelevant.

3.7      Reform objectives were also mainly relevant inthe sense that Ethiopia needed to
restart and extend reform inareas addressed inESAC inorder to achieve a sustained path
o f growth inthe medium-term. But design was flawed because stabilization and reform
became competing priorities under time pressure. The perceived urgency o fproviding
financing for stabilization left too little time to agree on a properly prioritized and
sequencedreform framework. Although ESAC was supposed to support the continuation
o f reforms begununder ERSC and the policy matrix headings were similar, prior actions
for ESAC did not include several important actions identified under ERSC to be taken
before the end o f 2001/02. These included fertilizer marketingreform, elimination o f
case by case screening o f investments, elimination o f a banon exports o f hidesand skins,
allowing foreign private sector participation inthe Ethiopia Telecommunications
Corporation, and some areas o fpublic expenditure management reform. Prior actions
were included on two key issues identified inERSC, however - competition policy and
urban landpolicy.

3.8      A two-stage reviewo fquality at entryby an internal review panel(QAG) rated
quality at entry as marginally satisfactory. The main criticisms o f design were:

                                                   17


    e    Inadequatelinkage betweenthe actions under ESAC and the previous operation. Despite
         beingbilled as the secondtranche ofERSC, there were no clear priorities for follow-on
         action ofthe ESAC from ERSC. Nor were there triggers for onward linkage to the
         PRSCs.
    e    Lack of a medium-termframework that sets out the logic and sequencing o f measures
         from one operation to another.
    e    Weak prior actions.
    a    Unclear implementation arrangements, e.g. the absence o f baseline indicators and interim
         benchmarks for M&E.
    e    Inadequateassessmentandmitigation of risks, particularly interms o f capacity for
         implementation of reforms.

3.9      These criticisms were largelyjustified andreflect the competing priorities o f
stabilization vs. reform, and the time pressure the former generated. Priorities and
implementation arrangements were left to be definedinthe PRSP which was still under
preparation. Under these circumstances it mighthave been better to have focused on a
smaller numbero fprior actions with more immediate economic impact." Overall
relevance is rated modest.

Achievementof Objectives(Efficacy)

Stabilization
3.10     Objectives such as an increase inreserves (from2 months o f imports to 3.2
months)and inpro-poor spending (up from 11.7 percent o f GDPin2000/01 to 14.6
percent in2002/03) were exceeded in2001/02, but could not be attributed to ESAC. The
long and inexplicable delay ineffectiveness meantthat the ESAC didnot disburse until
mid-waythrough the 2002/03 fiscal year.l1Fundingwas still useful at that point since
Ethiopia faced another severe drought in2002/03, but ESAC did not provide the quick
finance whichhadbeenintended. Despite the delay ineffectiveness, overall efficacy o f
stabilization under ESAC was substantial.

Improving the investment climatefor theprivate sector
3.11 The component on business environment addressed some important new issues.
As aprior action, the Governmentissueda Trade Practices Proclamationcreating a
Competition Commission and establishing rules on anti-competitive practices, abuse o f
marketdominance, andconsumer protection. The rules still allowed for applicationo f
discretionto any enterprise designated an exception by the Government, and did not
addressthe still contentious issue o fprivately owned butparty-affiliated enterprises (the
"party-statals"), but it was a step forward inan importantarea. A newUrbanLandLaw
was also approved by Parliament. Again, this was a useful step forward intrying to
resolve a major (and still unresolvedthough somewhat improved) constraint on PSD.



10Tenprior actions were legallybinding. (These are indicated inbold face inthe policy matrix reproduced
inAnnex C.) These were notnecessarilythe most importantactions interms ofeconomic improvement
nor hadthey all beenidentifiedby the ERSC for early implementation.
11The Governmentmay haverealizedby the time ofapprovalthat financing was no longerurgentdue to
higher thananticipatedgrants and debt reliefreceived.

                                              18


Finally, the investment code was revisedunder ESAC to help promote foreign
investment, though the code only allowed investors to formjoint ventures with the
Government telecom services and at first still required investors to obtain investment
permits.

3.12     The component on transaction costs required the Ethiopian Shipping Lines to
reduce tariffs but didnot end its monopoly status. Butthe EthiopianAirlines' protection
inthe cargo marketwas abolished, resultinginsubstantial reductionsinshippingcosts
and giving a significant boost to emerging horticultural exports.

3.13     The component on export competitiveness supported further steps on creating a
bonded warehouse and improving export finance, though as noted inthe discussion o f
ERSC above, there were few concrete results. Studies o f coffee marketing and
restrictions on hides and skins were undertakenbut implementationwas delayed, and the
ERSC prior action to waive the requirement for quality certificates for exports was still
not implemented.

3.14     As noted above, some reforms begununder ERSC for which further action was
slated in2001/02 were downplayed or left out (fertilizer policy, telecom sector policy,
privatization), but startingto engage on competitionpolicy and landaccess was an
important step, and the liberalizationo fthe air cargo market had a direct andbeneficial
impact on exports. Overall progress on improving the investment climate is rated
modest.

Deepening civil service reform and improvingpublic sector management
3.15     The civil service reform (strengthening the civil service strategic and legal
framework) component continuedto make some progress under ESAC. A new Civil
Service Law was approved by Parliament inDecember 2001and the Council o f Ministers
approved a civil service grievance system. Onthepublic sector management component
the negative assessmentquoted fromthe ICRapplied bothto ERSC andESAC: there was
formal compliance with conditionality but little real progress. For example, the Council
o f Ministers approved a Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework (MEFF)and issued
indicative planningfigures, but only late inthe fiscal year for two years running.
Integration o f federal and regional recurrent and capital budgets was also not
accomplished. Inthe remaining sub-components, ajob classification and grading scheme
was completed but remainedto be implemented; a draft remunerationpolicy was
developed, but was not used; and about two-thirds o fpersonnel records were automated.
Overall progress on this objective i s rated modest.

3.16     Onthe basis o fthe above, the overall efficacy o fESAC is ratedmodest.

Outcome

3.17     ESAC was only partly successful inachieving its stabilization objective.
Although relevance remainedhigh, implementation was weakened because o fthe delay
ineffectiveness. Ethiopiamet most o fthe stabilizationtargets and exceededthe target
for reallocationtowards poverty-reducing expenditures without Bank support in2001/02,
butthe fast-disbursing funds provided important support in2002/03 as a drought

                                               19


developed. Onthe reform side, ESAC accomplished more thanERSC but outcomes
continued to be mixed. Overall outcome i s ratedmoderately satisfactory.

R I S K S TO DEVELOPMENT        OUTCOMES

3.18     The President's Report notedthat while the risk ofrenewedconflict with Eritrea
had diminished since the previous operation, vulnerability to economic shocks remained
high. The Bankalso emphasized the risks from institutional and fiduciary weaknesses.
The ESAC itself could do little to mitigate capacity risks inthe short run, but a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment
Review (CPAR) were under way and the Bank and Government were discussing a
capacity buildingproject for the medium-term. The President's Report also noted that
the lack o f immediateresults mightweaken political commitment. As discussed above
for the ERSC, the Government's commitment to sound macro management and
reallocationtowards poverty-reducing sectors has proved to be strong inthe face o f
economic shocks. With respect to reforms, capacity and commitment continue to pose
significant risks to outcomes. Overall, the risk to developmentoutcomes is ratedmodest.

Monitoring & Evaluation

Design
3.19     Designo f M&E of the macro framework was satisfactory because o f its links to
the PRGF. Onthe reform side, the (QAG) review panelo fquality at entry summarized
the weaknesses: "the operation does not incorporate adequateM&Earrangements,
including baseline indicators and interimbenchmarks. For that reason, it is unclear what
is the causal chain or sequence o f actions and performancethat will leadto the desired,
thoughnot clearly articulated, outcomes or results ofthis operation." The rating for
designis modest.

Implementationand utilization
3.20     The strengths and weaknesses of designcarried over into implementationand
utilization. As with ERSC, M&Eof reforms tended to focus on output and compliance
with output indicators. The rating for bothelements andthe overall rating for M&Eis
modest.

BankPerformance

3.21     Preparation for ESAC was technically stronger than for ERSC. Preparationand
appraisal benefited from the availability o f a new Investment Climate Assessment, and
from a slightly more relaxedschedule. Nevertheless, as the QAG assessmentemphasized
(see paragraph 3.08 above), there were many designflaws. IEG concurs with the QAG
rating o f quality at entry - moderately satisfactory.

3.22     Supervision ofthe public sector managementcomponent o f ESAC benefited from
the relocation to Addis Ababa of a public sector specialist. There seems to have been
little follow-up on the delay ineffectiveness. The only project status report is dated

                                           20


December 30,2002, a month after effectiveness, and it does not appear to have been
based on a mission. Supervision i s ratedmoderately satisfactory.

3.23   The overall rating ismoderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance

3.24   The Government formally complied with most of the agreedprior actions inthe
policy matrix but frequently with shortcomings (such as inthe case o fthe Public
InvestmentLaw) or with delays (as inthe casewiththe approvalfor the MEFF)that
underminedthe spirito fthe undertakings. The delay ineffectiveness was due to delays
bythe Government. The delay may havebeenfor a soundreason (less urgencyinthe
need for balance o fpayments finance), but this is not entirely clear. The overall rating is
moderately satisfactory.

4. FIRSTPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT
    OPERATION(PRSC I)

Background

4.1     The SDPRP (Ethiopia's PRSP) was completed in2002. The Joint Staff
Assessment by the Bank and the Fundendorsedthe SDPRP but had several suggestions
for improvement: need for alternative macroeconomic scenarios; better agricultural and
PSD strategies; an evaluation of early experience with decentralization; better costing o f
programs; anddevelopmentof a strategy to manage and reducevulnerability.

4.2     A newBank CAS (March 2003) was aligned withthe SDPRP. As noted inthe
Introduction,the CAS hadthree thematic objectives: enhancingpro-poor growththrough
supporting PSD and rural growth; enhancinghumandevelopment by improving
governance; andreducing vulnerability.

4.3     The main instrument for implementing CAS objectives was direct budget support
through aprogram of PRSC operations. The PRSCprogram was to be a series o fthree
single-tranche operations within a medium-termframework. Other donors would provide
parallel budget support. Each PRSC operation would outline proposedactions and
triggers for the next, with the amount varying between $120 million to $150 million
dependingon performance. The PRSCwas complementedby a major capacity-building
project (PSCAP), investmentprojects inother areas, andby a CFAA and CPAR to help
improve financial managementand accountability. Budget supportthrough the PRSC
would gradually replace SWAPSinhealth and education becausethese were viewedas
ineffective incoordinating strategy andassistance ina decentralized system inwhich
expenditure decisions were to be devolvedto regions and woredas (districts). Direct
budget support was expectedto achieve three important goals: reduce transaction costs;
ensure timely donor support; and ensure predictable federal transfers to encourage
planning at lower levels. An unspokenobjective of direct budget support was to permit
"scaling up" ofthe level of assistance, anobjective ofthe Africa Region for which
PRSCswere seen as animportant instrument.

4.4     PRSC Iwas approved on February 17,2004, to support the 2003/04 budget, and
PRSC I1was approvedonNovember 30,2004, insupport ofthe 2004/05 budget. The
PRSC program was suspendedafter PRSC I1because of governanceconcerns on the part
ofthe Bank and other donors inthe wake of the 2005 elections. PRSC I11was replaced
by amore limitedProtection of Basic Services Project.

Objectivesand Components

4.5     The objectives of PRSC Iwere to support implementation ofthe SDPRP by:

        Strengtheningthe focus on planning and budgeting processes includingthrough
        theprovision ofa framework withinwhichinterestedmulti-sectoral program and
        budget support donors can participate.

                                              22


        Stabilizing the public sector during a period o f rapid state transformation inorder
        to maintainpro-poor expenditures.
    0   Improving the investment climate (including for the rural sector).

4.6     The main sub-objectives and components o fthe operation were (see Annex D
which gives the Policy Matrix):

*:* Public institutionalperformance

        Clarify the planningandbudgeting cycle
        Improve public financial management
        Informationtechnology and systems

        Legal framework for functional assignment inworedas and municipalities
        Support intergovernmental fiscal transition through capacity building
        Introduceresults-oriented performance evaluation (ROPE)
        Introduceregional and ministerial pilots to improve performance management
        Improve M&Eby issuing guidelines for release and access to data

*:* Rural development andvulnerability

        Improve agricultural research and focus o f extension staff

        Develop design options for lower-cost school construction
        Adopt guidelines for health extension program
        EstablishHIV/AIDS committee to pilot survey

4.7     Altogether there were 29 actions inthe agreed policy matrix, o fwhich 16 were
prior actions. Nearly half o f all actions (14 o f 29) and o fprior actions (7 o f 16) were
related to public institutionalperformance. The rural development objective accounted
for 6 total and 5 prior actions; PSD for 5 total and 3 prior actions; and human
development for 4 total and 1prior action.

4.8     The Bank originally had even more ambitious objectives for PRSC I.Inaddition
to the components included inPRSC I, policy matrix flagged several additional issues
                                          the
to be addressed inPRSC 11:

                                                 23


    e   Agricultural marketing(fertilizer policy reform)
    e   Privatization
    e   Urbanland
    e   Telecommunications
    e   Education sector performance
    e   Health sector performance
    e   Nutrition

4.9     All o fthe ruraldevelopment andPSD flagged items hadbeen onthe agenda o f
either ERSC or ESAC, andthe Bankhad hoped to be able to agree to further actions in
most o fthese areas under PRSC I.Moreover, the Bankthought that the SDPRP had
foreshadowed reforms inthese areas, but it was not possible to reachagreement withthe
Government onthe nature o f specific actions. This was an example o fthe `inconsistent
expectations" found by OED inits review of Poverty Reduction Strategies12Because o f
disagreements, particularly over telecom sector reforms, the Bank reduced the amount o f
PRSC Ifrom $150 million to $120 million.

Relevanceof Objectivesand Design

4.10    Project objectives were largely relevant. The objectives of the PRSC series were
aligned with the SDPRP and were fully consistent with the CAS. Stabilization was no
longer a pressingissue, but substantial medium-term resource transfer was needed, along
withreformsandinstitutionaldevelopment inanumberofareas. ThePRSC series was,
as mentioned earlier, the main instrument o f Bank strategy underthe 2003 CAS.

4.11 Program design underthe PRSC was also relevant inthe sensethat there was a
linkbetweenproject fundingandkeyoutputs such asbudgetsupport for social service
delivery, and a link between time-bound actions (such as establishing budget timetables)
and some outputs. Butthere were also shortcomings that made project design less
relevant.

        The program started quickly, and although a great deal o f analytical work was
        nearing completion and informed Bank proposals, policy dialogue with the
        Government hadnot always taken place or was at an early stage.13 This meant
        that the results matrix was weightedtoward processes, studies, and action
        programs to be defined later.

ESWproductscompletedprior to the Board date. Parallelwork on PSCAPpreparationprovided
substantialknowledge on government systems, and a Strategic Partnershipfor Africa mission inwhich the
Bank participated was a key input intomany ofthe budget cycle relatedactions. The Investment Climate
Assessment was available intime for preparationofthe PRSC IPSD component and the last Public
ExpenditureReview ina long series focused on socialexpendituresand their effectiveness. Finally, several
backgroundstudies underpinneda November2002 rural sector workshop attendedby the Prime Minister
and key Cabinetmembersat which land tenure insecurity was discussed.

         The PRSC was large inrelation to total lendingand was meant to supplant rather
         thancomplement investmentprojectsand SWAPSinsectors such as healthand
         education. Putting so many o fthe eggs inone basketjeopardized Bank support if
         direct budget support were to be suspended (as it was duringpreparation o f PRSC
         111)and also reduced opportunities for sector dialogue accordingto some country
         team sector specialists.
         The Bankhad a two-front strategy to promote poverty reduction: (1) promoting
         pro-poor growth by improving the investment climate (including for rural
         development) and (2) improving delivery of social services. The PRSC program
         was meantto advance on both fronts, but though PRSCs were well-designed to
         fund social services, they provedto be a weak instrumentfor improving the
         investment climate or promotingprivate sector development inEthiopia because
         o fweak government commitment. Unfortunately, expanding social services
         without a foundation o f growth is unsustainable.
         The Bankoverestimated the commitment o fthe Government to private sector
         development so that little progress was made on fundamental issues o f telecom
         reform, privatization, andlandpolicy. The Bank recognized the Government's
         ambivalence, but chose to adopt PSD reforms as a "stretch" goal. Itwould have
         beenbetter for the Bank to have been less ambitious on the PSD objectives andto
         have scaled back the size o fthe operation accordingly. (See Annex G for a more
         detailed account o f constraints and changes inPSD.)

Relevance o f objectives and design i s ratedsubstantial.

Achievement of Objectives(Efficacy)

4.12     Itis difficult to map some objectives to components and actions inthe policy
matrix. The links are clear enough for the first objective: strengthening planningand
budgetingprocesses. That objective is clearly linkedto the public institutional
performance sub-objective. Similarly, the objective o f improving the investmentclimate
(including for the rural sector) maps directly to the sub-objective on PSD and rural
development andvulnerability. But the second objective - stabilizing the public sector
duringa period o frapid state transformation inorder to maintainpro-poor expenditures -
i s problematic. The links to components are obscure. The objective seems to imply a
concern with pro-poor budget allocations (as inERSC and ESAC), but no condition or
indicator i s included inthe operation. There is, however, an indicator for "increased
resources focused on service delivery at regional level and below", which suggests that
the objective is linkedto the public institutionalperformance sub-objective. Butthen the
human development component has no obvious linkto any stated project objective.
Because o fthis ambiguity, this report will treat humandevelopment as a sub-objective o f
objective number two and will rate all sub-objectives separately before also rating
achievement o fthe objectives themselves.

Public institutionalperformance
4.13     The operation supported measuresto improve planning andbudgeting, financial
management, and definition o f intergovernmental fiscal relationships. This was the most
important component o fthe operation as measured by number o f actions taken. In

                                              25


planningandbudgetingthe Bankandthe Government sought to start afreshinanarea
which had few results under ERSC and ESAC. Prior actions (bolded inthe annex tables)
included: Cabinet approval o f a 3-year Macro-Economic andFiscal Framework (MEFF);
issuance o f a financial calendar and indicative planningfigures for subsidies and grants to
the regions; adoption o f a new chart o f accounts infour regions; issuance o f a circular on
devolutiono f procurement responsibilities; enabling legislationto assign expenditure and
revenue responsibilities to municipalities infour regions and Addis Ababa; initiation o f
public sector delivery improvement policies (PSIP) inselected municipalities and
ministries; and issuance o f guidelines and standards for release o f statistical data. These
were mostly non-controversialfirst steps, butthey were necessary for improvement over
the longer term andwere well-implemented. Implementation o f other measures (not
boldedinthe annex tables) proved more challenging. Targets to reduce regional accounts
backlogs and federal audits backlogs were only partly achieved or achieved after a delay.
All federal institutions adopted aResults OrientedPerformance Evaluation (ROPE)
system, but the components for a meaningful evaluation are still not inplace. In
summary, the first operationmade a strong beginning. The rating for this component is
substantial.

Rural development and vulnerability
4.14    The mainmeasures to be taken were inthe areas o f extension, fertilizer policy,
landtenure security, andthe environment. The Government agreedto increase the
numberof extension staff relievedo fresponsibility for delivering inputs. There was
some increase inthe number o f such staff, but the number i s unknown, and the target may
not have been met. Inan attempt to increase competitiveness andthe role o fthe private
sector infertilizer marketing (andto reverse the failure o f a previous fertilizer sector loan
to achieve similar aims), the Bankrequested the Government to reduce the amount o f
annual fertilizer sales with regional government guarantees to 200,000 tons. This target
was not reached andthe Government now arguesthat the target was unrealistic inview o f
a large increase infertilizer demand. To promote landtenure security (all landi s publicly
owned), the Government agreed to issue Rural LandProclamations and a directive to
establish appropriate landadministration institutions infour major regions. The
proclamations were issued but only two communities inone region have reached the
stage o f issuinggeo-referenced certificates with maps. On the environment, the
Government agreed to issue a circular confirming that access to grants for food security
will require compliance with guidelines for mitigating social and environmental riskand
to secure Parliamentary approval o fproclamations for environmental protection organs
and environmentalimpact assessments. These actions were taken butthe impact is
unknown. The rating for the rural development and vulnerability sub-objective is
negligible.

Privatesector development
4.15    Telecom sector reform was meantto be the central feature o f PSD support inthis
operation, but at the negotiations stage it became clear that no agreement was possible.
No action on the telecom sector was included inthe results matrix for PRSC I.The main
accomplishments under the operation were submission o f Ethiopia's application for
accession to WTO; approval by MoFED o f a restructuringplanfor the main state-owned
bank, andreductioninthe cost ofregisteringnew businessesfrom $425 to $65 andthe

                                             26


time o fregistrationfrom 44 days to 8 days. This last, rather dramatic, result was
achieved by eliminating a requiremento f a newspaper announcement. Inthe area o f
competition policy, critical becauseo fthe special privileges o f state-owned andparty-
owned enterprises, the Government agreed to appoint members o f a Competition
Commission andto establish a Competition Secretariat. The Government failed to
appoint private sector and civil society members o fthe Commission, however, andhas
not adequately staffed the Secretariat. The rating for the PSD sub-objective is negligible.

Human development
4.16    A major objective o fthis operation was to help stabilize the public sector duringa
period o frapidtransformation inorder to maintain pro-poor expenditure. Pro-poor
spending (education, health, water, agriculture andnaturalresources, and roads) did
increase between 2002/03 and 2005/06 by 28.8 percent inreal terms per capita (compared
to 22.8 percent for total public expenditure). Educationspending grew particularly fast,
roads less so, andrealper capita health expenditure fell, but overall the operation
achieved the resource transfer objective. Specific measures supported inthe results
matrix were to complete preparation o f low-cost primary school buildingdesign options;
adoption o f guidelines defining a minimumpackage o f services at the woreda level with
associated staffing requirements; completing a design and implementation schedule for
national learningassessments; and establishing a committee to facilitate piloting an
HIV/AIDS survey. These were mostly achieved with some delay. The rating i s
substantial.

Objective1:Strengthening thefocus onplanning and budgeting
4.17    Substantial progress was made instrengthening the focus on planningand
budgetingprocesses, as indicatedabove. Inaddition to the improvements inthe
Government's planningand budgeting, donors were pleased with the improvements in
donor coordination under the PRSC program. The rating i s substantial.



Objective2: Stabilizing thepublic sector to maintain pro-poor expenditures
4.18    Substantial progress was also made instabilizing the public sector. The most
important indicators are that both total and pro-poor public expenditure grew inreal
terms during and since the operation. Some progress was also made in addressing service
delivery. The rating is substantial.

Objective3: Improving the investment climate (includingfor the rural sector)
4.19    Negligible progress was made inimproving the investment climate (including for
the rural sector), for reasons givenabove. The rating is negligible.

4.20    Despite significant shortcomings inachievements o f some objectives and sub-
objectives, overall efficacy i s ratedsubstantial.

                                               27


Outcome

4.21     PRSC Iachieved satisfactory outcomes instrengthening planningand budgeting
andinimproving institutionalperformance, and inexpandingbudget support and
improving governance o f service delivery for humandevelopment. Outcomes were
unsatisfactory for promoting private andfinancial sector development, and for rural
development andvulnerability. The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory.

R I S K S TO DEVELOPMENT          OUTCOMES
4.22     The mainriskto the outcome rating i s that poor governance or renewedconflict
could undermineprogress inpublic expenditure/institutional performance and inservice
delivery. Systemic and institutional improvements inplanningand budgeting have been
greater at the central government level, partlybecause o f lower capacity at lower levels
o f government. Politicization o f decentralization could bothprovoke conflict and lead to
loss o f donor support. Furthermore, unless the investment climate (including prospects
for rural development) improves, sustainableprogress inhumandevelopment will be
difficult. The overall risk i s rated significant.

Monitoring and EvaluationDesign, Implementation,and Utilization

4.23     Considerable effort was made to devise monitorable indicators of outputs and
outcomes o fthe SDPRP. M&E was handicappedby lack o f good baseline data. More
could have beendone to define outcome indicators for public institutional performance
and governance, as well as specific elements ofthe investmentclimate (competition,
efficiency, risk). Too many o fthe indicators measure "outputs" or "actions taken". The
PRSC program andthe associated PSCAP supported the introduction o f systems and
technology to collect and improve the timeliness o f expenditurereporting and o f
education and health indicators, but data and indicators from lower levels were not
always reported. Overall there was only modest progress indeveloping M&E from a
poor base. The overall rating for M&Eis modest.

BankPerformance

4.24     Quality at entry o f PRSC Iwas only moderatelysatisfactory for the reasons given
inthe above discussion onrelevance ofobjectives. Reducing credit size inresponseto
unsatisfactory performance was the right thing to do, and was fully inline with the
rationalethat budget support operations shoulduse an "up-down switch" rather thanthe
"on-off switch" o f structural adjustment loans, but this could not overcome the
disadvantages o f overestimating the Government's commitment to private sector
development and rural development.

4.25     Supervision was conducted mainly informally or inthe context o fpre-appraisal
andappraisal o fPRSC 11. An important innovation ofPRSC Iwas the introduction o fa
Joint Budgetand Aid Review (JBAR) to discuss budgetcoordination andpolicy issues
between the Government and donors. This is viewed by boththe Government and most
donors as an improvement over the PERs that the JBAR replaced. Boththe Government

                                             28


anddonor partners criticizedthe Bankfor not puttingthe task team leader o f such an
important program inthe field. Quality o f supervisioni s rated satisfactory.

4.26    Overall rating o f Bank performance is satisfactory.

Borrower Performance

4.27   Borrower performance was primarilydetermined by the commitment, or lack
thereof, to particular objectives or approaches. Where commitment was high-public
expenditure and institutional performance, and humandevelopment -performance was
satisfactory. Where commitment was low or the Government's approach was at odds
withthat ofthe Bank, as inprivate sector development andrural development,
performance was unsatisfactory. Performance was also affected by capacity. Federal
agencies generally performed better thanthose at lower levels. Overall Borrower
performance is ratedmoderately satisfactory.

5. SECONDPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT
    OPERATION(PRSC 11)

Background

5.1     Preparation o f PRSC I1followed on immediately after disbursement o f PRSC I.
The schedule was, infact, advanced to align better with the Ethiopianbudget cycle to
enable disbursementto take place earlier inthe fiscal year. PRSC Iwas approved
February 17,2004, and was effective on March23,2004. Pre-appraisal o f PRSC I1took
place inMay, 2004, appraisal inSeptember/October, and Board approval was November
20,2004.

5.2     PRSC I1was intendedto continue and deepen reforms inall the areas covered by
PRSC I,but with greater emphasis on PSD and rural development. Progress inthese two
areas was limited, however, and once again the size o fthe operation was cut from an
originally scheduledamount o f $150 millionto $130 million. According to the PRSC I1
Program Document (Number 29772-ETYNovember 1,2004, p. 29), "actions to foster
rural growth have not been as fast as expected, andthe telecom action plan-which
PRSC Ienvisaged as a prior action for the operation- i s inadequate: it is comprehensive
andtechnically detailed, butthere is no financing planor policy movesto help sustain the
very ambitious goals, nor are there policies plannedto attract larger financing from the
private sector". The document goes on to say: "In view of this evaluation, the PRSC I1
amount proposed is US$130 million. The allocation also intends to signal instrongterms
the World Bank's assessmentthat the telecom strategy, as expressed inthe Letter of
Communication Policy, i s inadequate."

5.3     Like PRSC I,PRSC I1identified actions for the next planned operation (PRSC
111) inthe policy matrix (see Annex E). But PRSC I11didnot take place. Elections in
May 2005 were disputedandwere followed by demonstrations, arrests ofjournalists and
opposition leaders, andprolongedcivil unrest. After student demonstratorswere killed in
November 2005, the Bank and other development partners suspended direct budget
support for Ethiopia even though preparations for PRSC I11were well-advanced. Inthe
following months, the Bank decided to replace PRSC I11with a project for Protectionof
Basic Services (PBS). Some other donors also supported PBS. Although classified as an
investmentproject rather thana development policy operation, PBS ineffect provided
budgetfunds for social sectors, and could be viewed either as a multi-sector SWAP or as
partial budget support.

Objectives and Components

5.4     The objectives o fPRSC I1were to continue to supportthe Government's
medium-termreform programto secure improvementsin:

        The investmentclimate.
        Governance and service delivery.
        Vulnerability.

                                             30


5.5    The sub-objectives o f PRSC I1were the same as those o f PRSC I.Components
included all o f those inthe previous operation and more, although some o fthe new
components hadbeen flagged inthe PRSC Ipolicy matrix, together with many o f the
policy actions. The main sub-objectives and components were:

*:* Public Institutional Performance
    e  Improve the planningand budgeting cycle
    e  Implement Sector Wide Approach for PSCAP
    e  Improve public financial management by reducing audit and accounts backlog

       Implement planto train health extension workers
       Develop a reproductive health strategy
       Start HIV/AIDS biological survey
       Start to develop National Action Plan on Gender

5.6    There were far more actions inthe policy matrix thanunder PRSC I(53 vs. 29),
butfewer prior actions (10 vs. 16). By sub-objective the numbers o ftotal actions (prior
actions) were:

                                            31


        Public institutional performance: 17 (4)
        Rural development and vulnerability: 12 (1)
        PSD: 15 (4)
        Humandevelopment: 9 (1)

Relevance of Objectives and Design

5.7     Some o fthe same comments on PRSC Iare applicable to PRSC 11. Project
objectives were relevant inthe sense that they were aligned with SDPRP and were
consistent with the CAS. The objectives and components also dealt with important
issues, but with the experience accumulated under the three preceding operations (PRSC
I,ESAC,andERSC),itmighthavebeenwisetohavere-examinedwhetherdirectbudget
support was the best instrument for pursuing some o fthese objectives. The PRSC I
ProgramDocument (Number 27644-ETYJanuary 20,2004, p. 24) hadnoted that technical
assistance missionshadbeen fielded inseveral areas andthat "these missions have
providedthe primary vehicle for re-engaging with the Government on areas where the
overall policy dialogue had reached a standstill (e.g. inthe financial sector or
telecommunications reform). These missions have allowed the areas o fre-engagement to
be identified without any expectations regardingfollow-on activities." [emphasis added]
Withthe additional experience o fthe telecom sector duringappraisal, a more drastic cut
inthe scope andamount ofPRSCI1(or, at the very least, ofPRSC 111)shouldhavebeen
considered. Stretched goals may sometimes be appropriate, but not after repeated
setbacks. They are perhaps better suited to floating-tranche structural adjustment
operations thanto direct budget support.

5.8     Project design was better inone respect that PRSC I.There was more analytical
work available and more time to discuss previous work with the Government. But the
additional policy dialogue didnot lead to a scaling back o f the operation. Rather, the
project became even broader thanthe previous operation, with manymore actions in
manymore areas. Itwas commonly observed, too (for example ina QAGprogram
review), that project conditions for PRSC I1were weak. Overall, the objectives and
design o f PRSC I1failed to respond to changing circumstances and were less relevant
thanPRSCI.Relevance ofPRSCI1objectives anddesign is ratedmodest.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)

5.9     The links between objectives and sub-objectives were much clearer andmore
straightforwardthan under PRSC I.Since much o fthe program is defined by the
components, separateratings are again given for each sub-objective and each objective.

5.10    By definition, prior actions were completed(or substantially completed) before
effectiveness, but many o f the steps taken were procedural and not always clearly linked
to the desired outcomes. Actions supported inone operation often depended for success
on further definition and implementationunder subsequent operations - including under
PRSC I11which did not take place.

                                                  32


Public Institutional Performance
5.11      Improving public institutionalperformance was a sub-objective o f governance
and service delivery. Most measuresto improve public sector institutionalperformance
were meant to advance initiatives begununder PRSC I.Measures to extend the chart o f
accounts to more regions, reduce regional account backlogs, improve information
technology and systems, enact a procurement strategy, and issue a fiscal strategy and a
decentralization strategy were all achieved. Inother areas there has been less progress.
The Government agreed to revise the Financial Calendar and issue adirective on strategic
planningconsistent with MEFF, PIPPEP, andthe annual budgeting cycle. The Financial
Calendar was issued, though there are still some coordination problems betweenthe
federal budget andtransfers to lower levels. The directive, though much needed, has still
not beenproducedand implemented. Audit backlogs for federal accounts were to have
been reduced to one year. Some progress has beenmade but the backlog as o f February
2007 was two years. A plannedremunerationpolicy for federal and regional levels has
fallen short o f expectations. It is less a policy than a salary scale, which so far has only
beenadopted at the central government level. Ingeneral, more was attempted under this
operation, but implementation slowed as complexities increased. The overall rating i s
substantial.

Rural Development and Vulnerability
5.12      PRSC I1continued and extended measures beguninthe previous operation inthe
areas o f extension, fertilizer policy, landtenure, and the environment. Inaddition, this
operation supported measuresto reduce vulnerability. The targets for the percentage o f
extension staff free o f responsibility for delivering inputs was raised to 85 percent and the
target for government-guaranteed fertilizer sales was reduced to 100,000 tons. Once
again, neither target was met. The Government also agreed to conduct a study o f options
for reformingthe market structure for fertilizer imports and distribution. The study was
completed. On landtenure, the Government agreed to review and harmonize Regional
LandProclamations andto identifybest practices. This has beenpartially achieved. In
the environmentalarea, the Government agreed to establish guidelines for selected sector
environmentalprograms, social impact assessments, and resettlement; to establish
regional environmental protection units, and to conduct a national workshop on
implementation o fthe guidelines. All o fthese measures were completed. To try to
reduce vulnerability, the Government agreed to define institutional arrangements,
implementation modalities, anda monitoring mechanismfor a system o f multi-annual
productive safety nets. The institutional structure has beenset up and a manual for M&E
has been prepared. As noted inparagraph 5.2, the Bank reduced the amount o f PRSC I1
partlybecauseo flimited progress onrural development. Overall progress on rural
development and vulnerability i s rated negligible to modest.

Private Sector Development
5.13      The primaryobjective o fthis operation was intendedto be private and financial sector
development, but inthe event little progress was made in some o fthe most critical areas. An
agreed prior action to adopt a revised telecom sector policy allowing for partial liberalization o f
the sector was not satisfactorily achieved. The Government finalized a Privatization Action Plan
and began implementingit. Though this improved procedures and made it possible to revive
sales o f public enterprises, privatization remains largely limited to small and medium enterprises.

                                             33


Key sectors o fthe economy remainmonopolized or dominated by state-owned
enterprises and the net number o f state enterprises continues to expand. The results
matrix repeated the measures on competition policy that were not delivered under PRSC
I, thesewereagainnotachieved. Someprogresswasmadeinrevisingurbanland
  but
leasing policy, but access to landremains one o fthe main constraints on PSD. A
Memorandumo f ForeignTrade Regime was submitted to WTO after a major delay (four
years after the application for accession and two years after the date agreed as a prior
action for this operation). Negotiations for membership still have to take place, but if
Ethiopiabecomes a memberthis will be significant because it commits the Government
to introduce additional reforms such as opening up the financial sector to foreign
participation after a specifiedtime. The only unambiguous achievement under the results
matrix was the reviewo f strategy and the development o f an action planto improve
access to micro and rural finance. The rating for the PSD sub-objective is negligible.

Human Development
5.14    Humandevelopment is a sub-objective ofthe PRSC I1 objective to improve
governance and service delivery. Several specific measures were supported and fully
achieved (sometimes with a delay): satisfactory implementation progress under the 2004
education sector review; commencement o f a survey o f education inputs and achievement
results; initiation o f an HIV/AIDSsurvey; completion ofthe national learningassessment
and development ofrecommendations; development o f a reproductive health survey; and
initiation o f a national action planon gender. Other measures supported but only partly
achieved were: development and adoption by all regions o f guidelines for lower-cost
school construction; implementation o f a health extension package including training o f
workers; completion o f a health worker study with follow-up implementation o f
recommendations; and establishment o f a multi-sector coordination structure for nutrition
and development o fa nutrition strategy. The overall ratingfor this component is
substantial.

Objective 1: TheInvestment Climate
5.15    Negligible progress was made inimprovingthe investment climate, for reasons
givenabove inthe discussion o fthe private sector development sub-objective.

Objective2: Governanceand ServiceDelivery
5.16    Progress ingovernance and service delivery was mixed. Governance inthis
context mainly referredto budget and financial management, and inthese areas progress
was substantial. Service delivery outcome indicators improved with respect to health and
education enrollment, but education quality deteriorated. Overall, progress was modest

Objective3: Vulnerability
5.17    The Bank program as a whole has made substantial progress inaddressing the
severe problem o f vulnerability, mainly through the Productive Safety Net Program
(PSNP) which is funded separately. Establishment o fthe PSNP was a prior action under
PRSC 11. Achievement o fthe broader rural development component under the
vulnerability objective was negligible to modest, as detailed above. The overall rating is
modest.

                                              34


5.18     Overall efficacy i s rated modest.

Outcome

5.19     The relevance o fobjectives anddesign o fPRSC I1was less thanunderPRSC I.
Insufficient account was takeno fthe lack o fprogress on private sector development and
policy actions were relatively unambitious. Achievement o f objectives (efficacy) was
also less thanunder PRSC I.     Negligible progress was made inimproving the investment
climate. Ingovernance and service delivery, progress on the public institutional
performance component slowed andthe humandevelopment component was mixed,
yielding an overall rating o f modest. The vulnerability objective, encompassing the rural
development and vulnerability component, i s also ratedmodest. The overall outcome
rating i s moderately unsatisfactory.

R I S K S TO DEVELOPMENT          OUTCOMES
5.20     All the risks outlined for PRSC Iremain important: risks o frenewedconflict,
weak capacity, politicization o f decentralization, and the failure to improve the
investment climate for PSDandrural development. The PAD identified some o fthese
and a numbero fother more specific risks (p.2): "the one-off transitional costs o f
devolving to local woreda administrations, implementingthe private and financial sector
reform agenda andbuildingprivate sector capacity, developing andretaining skilled
workers inthe absence o f a viable public sector salariedwage policy, weak enforcement
o f guidelinesfor resettlement/access to new landprogram, continued reporting lags in
actual expendituresat primary service levels, congestion effects o f several programs
involving local service cadres (e.g. health extension workers, teachers, agriculture
extension agents), and the absence o f demand-side pressures from civil society and
citizens." Taken together, this i s a worrying list o f concerns about the capacity and
willingnesso fthe Ethiopian Government to carry out the PRSC program.

5.21     The overallriskto development outcomes is ratedsignificant.

Monitoring and EvaluationDesign, Implementation, and Utilization

5.22     Little additional progress on M&E designwas achieved under PRSC 11. Most
design elements hadbeen put inplace under PRSC Iand remainedunchanged. The
Results Matrix (see Annex F) includes some outcome measures with plausible links to
PRSC actions, but it also includes others (such as agricultural growth) for which the links
withPRSC actions is tenuous. Definitions of indicators including baseline values and
medium-termtargets needto be strengthened. Implementationand utilization continued
to be hindered by lack o f reporting from lower levels.

5.23     The overall rating is modest.

Bank Performance

5.24     Quality at entrywas moderately satisfactory. As discussed above under relevance
o fobjectives anddesign, the decisionto cut the size o fthe operation because o f lack o f
progress on the rural and PSD agenda was commendable as far as it went, but there was

                                           35


an increasing case for more fundamental rethinking o fthe design andsize o fthe PRSC
program. The risks cited by the Region (see above) reinforce the view that the program
riskedbeing ineffective becauseo f problems o f capacity and willingness to take actions
insome importantareas.

5.25   There was no formal supervision, butthe JBAR process put inplace for the PRSC
program seems to have been fairly successful infocusing attention on key
implementation issues, though not always successful ingetting action (e.g. reporting from
lower levels remained inadequate). The Government andmost donors felt the JBAR was
much more useful andrelevantthat the annual PER series it replaced. Quality o f
supervision was satisfactory.

5.26   The overall rating o f Bank performance is moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance

5.27   As underPRSC I,borrowerperformance was highlyvariable. Where
commitment was high, performance was satisfactory. Inareas where the Government
disagreed with the Bank, performance was unsatisfactory. Capacity also affected
performance with higher levels o fperformance at the central government level. The
overall rating o f Borrower performance is moderately satisfactory.

6. OVERALLPRSCPROGRAM

6.1     This section attempts a brief summary evaluation o fthe PRSC program as a
whole by examininga different and somewhat broader set o f questions than inprevious
sections. What were the strengths andweaknesses o fthe PRSC program -what worked,
what did not, and why? Was direct budget support the right instrument (or was it usedin
the right combination with other instruments) to achieve particular objectives? Didthe
PRSC program avoid the most common pitfalls o f direct budget support: undermining
export performance through "Dutch disease"; underminingtax effort; failing to reach
intended targets because of budget fungibility; andweakening commitment to reform and
development?

What Worked and What Didn't

6.2     The overall objectives o f the PRSC were very ambitious. The CAS in2003 listed
the PRSC as a major instrument inachieving every single objective o fthe country
assistance strategy: enhancing pro-poor growth (through PSD and rural growth); reaching
the MDGs(by improving humandevelopment and improving governance); and reducing
vulnerability. The objectives and maincomponents o f the PRSC program were to
improve: public institutionalperformance; rural development and vulnerability; private
sector development; and humandevelopment. Additional benefits expected from direct
budget support through PRSC were: better coordinationamong donors; better alignment
o f aid with Government objectives andthe Ethiopian budgetcycle; reduced transactions
costs; and improvedmedium-termplanningbecause o f greater predictability o f support.
Although rarelymentioned as an objective, many also expected direct budget support to
enable aid to be scaled up.

6.3     Process objectives. Untilit was suspended, the PRSC program inEthiopia did
help achieve manyo fthe process objectives o f coordination, alignment, and
predictability. Most development partners reportedthat coordination improved under
PRSC and their complementary programs o fbudget support. Development partners who
didnotprovide budgetsupport were also included indiscussions andgenerally felt that
coordination improved. Replacement o f annual public expenditurereviews with more
frequent and less formal JBAR discussions was seen as a distinct improvement, though
some development partners noted that dialogue with the Government was still focused
largely on budget allocation rather than onthe broader agenda o f growth andpolicy
reform. The PRSC program reduced transaction costs for the Government, butnot
necessarily for development partners because o fthe elaborate coordinationmechanisms
which were set up. The Government reportedthat the PRSC improved predictability o f
aid flows, thereby enabling a better balance between capital and recurrent expenditure.
Coordination within the Government was also said to have improved inresponse to the
need to implementagreed actions inthe policy matrix and to participate inJBAR
discussions. Buttransparency and accountability for spending was weak. Inparticular, it
was never possible to track expenditures at the woreda level. Correcting this became an
important objective o fthe PBS project that replaced PRSC I1after suspension o f the
program.

                                             38


6.4     Progress on specific objectives and components o f the PRSC program was
variable. Broadly speaking, progress on public institutional performance and human
development was moderately satisfactory, but little was achieved on rural development
andprivate sector development.

6.5     Public institutionalperformance. Over the course o fthe two PRSC operations
the planningandbudgetingframework improved, butdirectives on integrationo f
different budgets remainto be worked out. The fiscal decentralization strategy i s a good
start, but leaves unresolved important issues related to the distribution o f responsibilities
among differentlevels o f government, determinationo fresources to be transferred
downward, or own resources for woredas. Resources for regions were expanded rapidly
but so were expenditure responsibilities.

6.6     Rural development and vulnerability. Fertilizer policy and landtenure security
are both critical issues for rural development, but the Ethiopia CAE (2008) found that
little overall progress has been made on these issues, mainly because o f government
reluctance to encourage private sector participation inmarketing or to reduce government
control o f land. Unlike fertilizer and landpolicy, the Bank and the Government are in
broad agreement on the strategy to protect the vulnerable and inthis area there has been
progress. There i s also broad agreement on the environment. Various environmental
agencies have been established and guidelines issued as agreed, but environmental
protection agencies are generally regarded as weak and the Bankhas been criticized by
other development partners for neglectingto follow through inits supervision o f
environmental issues.

6.7     Private sector development. Despite modest improvements inprivatization, the
financial sector, business regulation, and access to land, there was no or little progress on
the key issues o ftelecom sector reform or competitionpolicy. The share o fprivate
investment inGDP showed no trend between 2001/02 and2005/06 (see Table 2). For a
more detailed discussion o fthe investment climate and private sector development, see
Annex G.Overall, the improvement inthe investment climate hasnot yet helpedto
resolve the most bindingconstraints facing the private sector, including barriers to entry.

6.8     Human development. Overall, substantial progress was made, particularly in
education, on funding service delivery and developing data, processes, and institutions.
Healthfared less well and education quality remains poor, though enrollment and
completion rates have increased. Under the program some progress was made in
addressing issues o f education quality, reproductivehealth, and gender.

Choice of Instrument

6.9     Was PRSC the right instrument,or was it properly coordinated with other
instruments,to achieve particular objectives?

6.10    The PRSCwas appropriate for promotingbetter institutionalperformance, for two
reasons. First, public expenditure management was directly related to budget support, so
there was a strong focus on this component and strong incentive for progress. Second,
capacity buildingunder the PSCAP program complemented the PRSC. PSCAP provided

                                               39


not only needed training and facilities but also essential information on operational
strengths and weaknesses. Improvements ininstitutional performance may be more
attributable to PSCAP thanto PRSC, butthe two programs working together achieved
more than either working alone.

6.11    Itseemedreasonable to expect that PRSCwould also be appropriate for
supporting humandevelopment. Increasing pro-poor expenditure hadbeen an objective
o fprevious operations, and inthe health and education sectors, SWAps had been
operating but were becoming less relevant as social expenditure decisions were being
decentralized. Budget support through PRSC was expected to replace all project and
sector lendinginhealthand education inEthiopia. This could be prematured. The
emerging problems inthe social sectors inEthiopiawere not quantity but quality (in
education), and not expanding facilities but makinguse o f existing facilities (inhealth).
A background paper for the Ethiopia CAE14concludedthat, ineducation, `the choice o f
the PRSC instrumentas the sole provider ofassistancedoes not seemto sufficiently
adjust Bank assistance for targetingquality issue.' While ESDP [the education SWAP]
offered leverage to pursue a quality focus insector dialogue andbuildingcapacity inthe
implementing institutions, the PRSC by its nature and motivation was much less likely to
deliveronthese counts, particularly onregionallevel. Itwas, however, potentially well
suitedto pursue quality issues through policy advances and adjustments on federal level.
Incombinationthe two types o fproject mighthave complementedeach other. Inhealth,
the closingdate ofthe existing HSDP was extended becauseo f disbursement delays and
so continued inparallel with the PRSC, butthe HSDP itself failed to come to grips with
underutilization o f facilities inthe health sector15-- nor was the PRSC effectively used to
advance the dialogue on healthpolicy.

6.12    Inrural development, the Banktriedto usethe PRSCto promote change in
fertilizer policy, andto a lesser extent, landpolicy, without much success ineither case.
According to sector staff, one reason for the lack o f success was that the Bank had no
investment projects through which it could keepintouch with what was happeningon the
ground. Again, there was too much reliance on the PRSC and too little use o f
complementary projects. Butthe PRSC was usedto facilitate the introduction o fthe
Productive Safety Nets Project through a prior action under PRSC 11.

6.13    The PRSC also was o flimited use inpromoting PSD. This was not due to lack o f
complementary projects -there i s an ongoing Private Sector Capacity Buildingproject -
butrather to lack o fagreement on major policy issues. Itis unlikely that any lending
instrument could have been effective under such conditions. Because o f limited success
inpromoting PSDthrough PRSC andother lendinginstruments,the Bankhas
increasingly shiftedto a more indirect approach to promoting dialogue andpolicy change
through analytic and advisory activities (AAA). On issues such as telecom policy, the
government and the Bank have agreed to disagree, though they still discuss sector issues.
The Bank's strategy is to seek entrypoints for PSD dialogue by addressing specific
concerns o fthe government, such as export promotion.

Avoiding Pitfallsof Direct Budget Support

6.14    There are a number o f common concerns about the possible adverse
macroeconomic or incentive effects o fbudget support These include effects on export
competitiveness (Dutch disease), tax effort, expenditure diversion, and commitment to
reform. InEthiopiathe effects seem to have been mixed.

6.15    The effect o f foreign finance on export competitiveness depends mainly on how it
i s used. Ifused to fund non-traded goods, foreign finance can leadto an appreciationo f
the exchange rate and a decline inexport competitiveness. Inprinciple direct budget
support i s no differentfrom any other form o f aid inthis respect, but the danger is that a
higher share will beusedfor expenditure on government salaries and other non-traded
goods. Analysis o fpotential Dutch disease generally requires a detailed econometric
study. One encouraging indicator is that the export/GDP ratio rose from 12.6 percent in
2001/02 to 15.8 percent in2005/06 (see Table 2), with a substantial contribution coming
from non-traditional exports. Butthere is a dangerthat increased financing o frecurrent
expenditurecould undermineexport competitiveness andgrowth. This is an issue that
requires further study and close monitoring.

6.16    The evidence on tax effort is less encouraging. The SDPRP aimed to raise the
revenue/GDP ratio by about one percentage point per year. Itis difficult to arrive at an
assessmenton this because o f data deficiencies. Based on official data, there has been no
discernible trendbetween 2001/02 and 2005/06 (see Table 2). On the other hand,, ifGDP
growth has been overestimated as manyobservers believe, the revenue/GDP ratio would
have risen (since revenue estimates are more reliable).

6.17    Fungibility ofresources always provides scope for intendedincreases inresources
for particular purposes. There i s little evidence that this has happened inEthiopia at the
broad level o f pro-poor vs. other spending, but within categories there is a concern that
too much spending has gone toward setting up administrative infrastructureunder
decentralization, that there may be an imbalance betweendifferent categories o f spending
(for example inthe health sector), and that money at the local level may be diverted from
development to political purposes. The real problem i s that the expenditure tracking
system was inadequate to monitor the extent to which budget support under PRSC was
usedfor its intendedpurpose.

6.18    There is little evidence that budget support through the PRSC program has
weakened Government commitment to reform. But it became evident early inthe
program that the Bank had overestimated the initial commitment ofthe Government to
PSD. Under PRSC Ithe Banktook appropriate action by cutting the size o fthe operation
by 20 percent. When disagreements continued, the Bank cut PRSC I1as well, but only by
13.3 percent. At that point the program should have been cut much more sharply to
reflect poor prospects for progress inPSD and rural development.

Summary Findingsand Rating

6.19    The mainfindings arethat, while the PRSC instrumentwas a useful instrumentin
some areas, inEthiopia there was too much budget support too soon.

                                          41


   0 The Bankmovedtoo quickly into direct budget support through the PRSC
     program. Direct budget support for humandevelopment was premature. Despite
     considerable ESW on PSD, not enoughpolicy dialogue had taken place to
     develop a sharedunderstandingand compatible expectations betweenthe Bank
     andthe government.
   0 The Bank also relied too heavily on direct budget support (too much as well as
     too soon). Heavy reliance on this instrument increasedthe risk o fprogram failure
     andledto programs that were too broad and ill-focused to be effective in
     promoting policy change and institutional development as opposed to resource
     transfer.
   e The complementary PSCAP program increased the effectiveness o fthe PRSC in
     public expenditure management. Effectiveness inrural development and
     education suffered because o fthe lack o f complementary projects andprograms.
   0 The mainmacro andmotivational pitfalls o fdirect budget support were avoided
     inthe PRSCprogram.
   0 The PRSC improved coordination and alignment, but it proved no more flexible
     thanother forms ofaid. Theprogramwas cut, butnotenough, when itturnedout
     that Government support for PSD andrural development was weak. When a
     major dispute on governance arose, the entire program was terminated.

6.20 The outcome rating for the entire PRSC program i s moderately unsatisfactory.

Lessons

     Budget support and other program assistance needs to be undertaken within a
     medium-termpolicy framework. This was one o fthe mainlessons learnedas a
     result o fthe first two operations under review, and it was applied to the design o f
     the PRSC program.
   0 Complementary investment or capacity-building projects may be critical to the
     effectiveness o f direct budget support through a PRSC. Complementary capacity-
     buildingunder PSCAP were important for the progress made instrengthening
     public institutionalperformance under the PRSC program. The absence o f
     complementary investment projects inagriculture limitedthe effectiveness o f
     PRSC inrural development because o fthe lack o f information on the part o fthe
     Bank on activities close to the ground.
   0 Successful programmatic budget support through PRSCs requires careful
     preparation. Prior analytical work and policy dialogue are needed to prevent
     misunderstandings and inconsistent expectations, like those that arose for the
     private sector development program under PRSC I.
     Direct budget support is high-risk. It i s vulnerable to sudden loss o fpolitical
     support from bilateral donors and i s no less subject to sudden termination than
     policy-basedlending.

Annex G:The InvestmentClimate and PrivateSector
DevelopmentinEthiopia

Background

  1.        Ethiopia i s one ofthe poorest countries inthe world. Average incomes may have beenno
  higher at the turnofthe 21'` century than forty years earlier. This dismal recordreflects anumber
  o f structural, exogenous, and self-inflicted factors. Geography i s a major handicap. Ruggedterrain
  makes provision of roads and other infrastructure costly, while poverty compounds the effect of
  geography, limitingboth supply (finance for investment) and demand (market for infrastructure
  services). Periodic droughts have put upto 15 million people (more than 20percent o fthe
  population) at risk o f starvation-compared to the "normal" number of 5-7 million chronically
  hungry. Recurrent external and internalconflicts have set back development efforts anddamaged
  the investmentclimate. Finally, Ethiopia's development strategy andpolicieshave undermined
  growth andpoverty reduction, especially the period o f socialist policies under the Dergregime
  (1974- 1991).

  2.        Ethiopia i s extremely poorly servedwith infrastructure.

         Road density was 28 kmper 1000km2 in2002, one ofthe lowest inthe world and little more
         that halfthe Sub-SaharanAfrican average (50 km per 1000km2).
         Power. Only 11percent ofthe populationhave access to electricity (are close enough to a
         source to be connected). Many with potential access cannot afford electricity; only 6 percent
         of the population in2002 were connected. Most power is from hydro sources, which has
         reduced reliability. On average, there are 5.5 outages per month, reducingoutput by over 5
         percent. Connection times average 114 days.
          Telecommunications. As with roads and electricity, Ethiopia's telecom density is one ofthe
         lowest inthe world: 3.6 fixed phone lines per thousand in 2000 compared to 14.2 for Sub-
          SaharanAfrica. Average waiting time for a business connection in2002 was 204 days
         compared to 16 days inChina and 48 days inPakistan. Mobile phone service is available and
          is now expanding after a slow start.

  3.        Externaland internalconflicts have been enormously damaging to the investment climate.
  The war with Eritrea (1998-2000) undermined investor confidence, sidetracked reform, and
  divertedresourcesfrom infrastructure and other economically productive activities. Internal
  conflicts, especially the arrest o f opposition leaders after the 2005 elections, further reduced
  investor confidence and antagonized several donors. Foreign investment fell from a higho f $288
  million in 1997to $20 million in2001 (0.2 percent of the total for Sub-SaharanAfrica).16
  Decentralizationto ethnically-based regions also affects the investment climate, though the effects
  are complicated and it is difficult to know whether the net balance is positive or negative.




  In FY05foreign investmentwas $150 millionand in FY07it was $404 million. The Africa Regionhas noted
that pre-implementationagreementsrose sharply in 2005. It remainsto be seen how many of these will become
operational.

ANNEXG                                             84


 4.        Many o f the institutions associated with a favorable investment climate and with growth are
 weak -public administration (tax, customs, regulatory agencies, andjudiciary), financial services,
 accounting and auditing. This weakness reflects low skills and a legacy from the period o f socialist
 policies during 1974-91. After the overthrow o f the Derg in 1991, the new government embarked
 on a programo fmacro stabilization and liberalizationo f prices, imports, andthe exchange rate. A
 new Agricultural Development Led Industrialization(ADLI) strategy was announced. Private
 sector development was also encouraged, along with privatization o f small scale enterprises, but the
 state continued to dominate large-scale activities. Inbanking, power, telecom, and transport, the
 role o fthe private sector remained limited. Government regulatory and other policies tend to favor
 state-owned enterprises. Inaddition, there is unfair competition from "foundation companies"
 (party-related f m s ) which have captured some business areas.

 5.        Infactthegovernmenthasbeenhighlyambivalent abouttheroleoftheprivatesector. This
 i s reflected in statements by the Prime Minister distinguishingbetween the rent-seeking and the
 value-creating private sector that seem to imply that the dominant tendency inthe Ethiopian private
 sector i s rent-seeking. The government's ambivalent attitude also became evident early on in slow
 progress on privatizationand indifferences between the Bank and the government on issues such as
 telecommunications and landpolicy. Ambivalence is heightened by the mixingof politics and
 business. The rulingparty owns a number o f important businesses. These "party-statals" are
 resented by private business because oftheir perceived privileges. A large section o fthe business
 community (and much o f the Ethiopian Diaspora) also support the opposition parties, which
 contributes to rulingparty suspicions o f business motives.

Changes inthe investmentclimate

 6.        An Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) carried out in2002 identifiedthe obstacles
 perceived by Ethiopian business at that time (see Figure 1). The main obstacles were:

         Tcucrates and administration. The most frequent complaintwas that tax rates are too high
         and unpredictable. Tax officials visit firms periodically to assess taxes, sometimes for upto
         three years inthe past. This i s mainly presumptive taxation as many firms are unable to keep
         acceptable accounts, but firms complainedthat tax officials do not listento their explanations.
         The problem i s not corruption but arbitrary and unpredictable taxation.
         Access to land. All land inEthiopiacontinues to be owned by the state. Leases rangingfrom
         50-99 years are available with rents set by regional governments. Access to urban land
         constrains business operation and expansion: the supply o f new leasehold land is limited;
         rents are high(25 percent o f average sales inAddis); waiting time for allocation o f plots is
         lengthy; and firms are unable to use land leases as collateral for credit.
         Access to credit. Credit access and cost (including highcollateral requirements) were seen as
         major to very severe obstacles by many firms, especially young firms and those outside Addis
         Ababa. The financial system is dominated by the publicly-owned Commercial Bank o f
         Ethiopia which has an extensive branch network but which made very few loans outside
         Addis inthe years immediately preceding 2002.

 7.         A new Investment Climate Assessment was conducted in2006 (ICA-2006). The numbers
 inthe two surveys are not directly comparable because o fdifferent coverage and aggregations, but
 ICA-2006 shows a similar set o f concerns to those in ICA-2002 (see Figure 2). Access to financing
 has moved upthe list o f constraints, but taxes and access to land are still perceived as major
 constraints. The most striking difference is that "anti-competitive or informal practices" has
 emerged as the most frequently cited constraint. It is not clear what practices are included in this
 category. An informal note from the Region interprets this as competitive pressure from the less-
 regulated informal sector. "Informal enterprises extend well beyond small-scale service and retail
 establishments, and include small manufacturers exceeding 10 employees. This is why in an over-
 burdened regulatory environment, it's considered as the worst problem for those firms that are
 trying to operate under the legal framework, complying withthe heavy regulatory regime."

 8.         The Africa Region has provided an alternative comparison (see Figure 3) o f the
 results of the two investment climate assessments, but it is not clear whether the samples

  10.        Overallthere appears to have been little progress inPSD and the investment climate since
  1998, in part because political factors have offset any modest improvements inpolicy. There have
 been improvements inthe ease o f business registration and licensing, customs clearance, the overall
 tax regime, labor regulations, and other business regulations, but there has been little apparent
 progress on privatization, telecommunications policy, competition policy, access to land, or access
 to power and water. Changes inparticular aspects o f investment climate and PSDare reviewed
 below. Progress has been mixed.

  11.        Role of theprivate sector. Private investment as a share o f GDP has remained around 12
 percent for several years (see Table 1inmain report). About 200 (mostly small) enterprises have

                                                     87                                                     ANNEXG


 been privatized since 1994but another 130 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) remain, 100 o fwhich
 are to be privatized. Privatizationhas pickedup inthe past two years butremains                           Key
  sectors-finance, telecom, power, transport, wholesale and retail distribution-are dominated or
 monopolizedby SOEs and/or are protected from foreign investment. Direct foreign investment in
 Ethiopia i s about 1percent of GDP, well below the Sub-Saharan Africa average, though there has
 been some increaseinforeign investment inroses, tourism, and construction.

  12.      Competitionpolicy is closely related to the role o fthe private sector. The government has
 established a competitionpolicy, including a secretariat to administer it, butthe secretariat is under-
 funded, not autonomous, andthe law itself contains too many exceptions to be useful. The
  government recently agreedto revise the law. The government has rejected any suggestion that
 policies toward party-related enterprises should be changed.

  13.      Regulatoryframework. The most dramatic improvement inIC is the reduction intime and
  cost to register a business -from 40 days and $400 to 16 days and $70. This was largely achieved
  bythe simple step o fdroppinga requirement to post a notice inthe newspaper o f intentto register.
  The time taken to clear customs for imports and exports has also beenreduced andhiringand firing
  regulations for labor have been reduced. Regulationo f ongoing business operations remains
  cumbersome.

  14.       Taxregime. The presumptivetax regime affecting smaller firms has been substantially
  reformedto make it less arbitrary. Interviewswith local firms confirmed that an improvementhas
 taken place. The introduction of a VAT has complicated operations for SMEs, however.

  15.      Access to land remains a major constraint on business expansion. Leasesare costly,
 registrationis slow, leasedland cannot be usedas collateralfor loans, and disputes over leasehold
 rights are common.

  16.      Access toJinunce also remains a major problem for all but the largest businesses. The
  financial sector i s weak and uncompetitive. Non-performing loans have been reduced (from around
  50 percent) butremain at about 20 percent. Domestic private banks are allowed, but foreign banks
  are not, and the state-ownedCommercial Bank of Ethiopia still dominates the banking sector (75
 percent of market share).

  17.      Infiustructure. Roaddensity has increased from a very low level (27 kmper 1000km2 in
 2000/01to 30.8 in2003/04), but is still well below the African average. The core functions o fthe
 telecom sector are a government monopoly but some peripheral activities are open to the private
  sector and mobile phone access has been expanding rapidly. Coststo business remain very high.
 Access to water and power remains problematic.




17.TheAfrica Regionhas commented(emphasis in original): "In March 2006, the Bank's supervisionmission for the PSD
Capacity building project concluded that the pace of enterprise divestiture was consistent with agreements between the
Government and World Bank at the outset ofthe project. PPESAmade commendableprogress over the six months prior to
March2006, duringwhich 18 divestitureshadbeenconcluded;8 by directsales, 3 byrestitutionsand7 throughpublic-private
partnerships. Tenders for 8 companies had to be closed by March 9, 2006 which would introduce another active list for
completionby endJune 2006. In2007, the rateofprivatizationincreasedeven more quickly."

      ANNEXG                                                           88


          18.        Tradepolicy has improved somewhat since 2005. Ethiopiahas submitted a Memorandum
          of ForeignTrade to the WTO after a long delay. The weighted averagetariff rate dropped from
          19.5 percentto 17.5 percent, export taxes have been abolished, and a duty drawback system has
         beenput inplace. Export and import clearanceprocedureshave improved, butEthiopia still ranks
         very low (150 out of 178countries) ontrade facilitation.

          19.        Governance. Table 2 shows governance indicators from both external organizations
          (International Country RiskGuide and Transparency International) and the World Bank (CPIA
         ratings and WBI Governance Indicators). Despitebig differences indefinitions and methodology,
         the sources show that Ethiopiagenerally ranks poorly comparedto other countries (inthe lowest

         20.         Institutional development. Tax administration, customs, the Ethiopian Investment
         Commission, andthe privatization agency have all shown modest progress ininstitutional
         development. Butthere has been less success in the development of financial institutions, the
         judicial system, land administration, and competition regulation. A scorecardapproach suggests
         that institutionaldevelopment was modest with respectto IC and PSD.

21.      But steppingbackto look at the broader picture, it is unclearwhether on balanceEthiopia
has experienced institutional development or institutional decay. Decline in governance indicators
reflects a general failure to build independent institutionscapable of withstanding political
interference or state capture. Patronage inpublic administrationand politicization o fthe
bureaucracy have reportedly risen since 2005. The line between party and state i s indistinct,
particularly at the woreda level. Failure to strengthen institutional checks and balances has hurtthe
investment climate and limited prospects for robust private sector development.
