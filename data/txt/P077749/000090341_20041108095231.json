First, the\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process is sound\n            with a strategy that is appropriate in terms of both growth\n            and poverty reduction impact, grounded in the MDGs, backed\n            by strong country-ownership, and a credible implementation\n            process. Second, the budget process is credible, with\n            continuous efforts underway to improve the predictability of\n            resource flows to sub-national levels responsible for\n            primary service delivery and reduce the reporting lags on\n            actual expenditures. Third, although decentralization has\n            placed strains on the public financial management system,\n            fiduciary performance is acceptable and measures are being\n            implemented to address identified weaknesses. Fourth, the\n            Bank and other partners have supported a strong analytical\n            program in Ethiopia involving several Public Expenditure\n            Reviews (PERs), a Country Financial Accountability\n            Assessment (CFAA), Country Procurement Assessment Report\n            (CPAR), Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, poverty analyses,\n            diagnostics in various sectors, etc. which identified key\n            development constraints which are at the heart of the\n            Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program's\n            (SDPRP's) reform program."}, "docdt": "2004-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
