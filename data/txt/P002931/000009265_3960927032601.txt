34.AORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO UGANDA
FOR A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Uganda for SDR 17.1 million (USS 22.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA ternms vith 40 years maturity and help finance a fourth
education project.
2.        Background.  Over the last seventeen years IDA has had a
continuing dialogue with the Ministry of Education in Uganda and has made
three credits to the sector based on an overall strategy aimed at achieving
a balanced and comprehensive education sector which in turn matches the
manpower needs of the country. The First Education Credit concentrated on
the expansion of secondary education, the Second Education Credit aimed to
increase the supply of technical specialists and the Third Education Credit
assisted in the rehabilitation of facilities and the provision of
educational materials. But two decades of economic stagnation, political
instability and civil insurgence have left the education system, although
expanded and operating, at a much lower level of quality at all levels.
Some of the most acute symptoms of decline in educational quality include:
the almost total absence of textbooks and instructional materials; a
deteriorating teacher morale and productivity; an exodus of senior
experienced teachers, inspectors and headmasters towards better employment
opportunities inside or outside the country; and a general lack of school
maintenance. These symptoms can be related to a number of critical issues
which need to be addressed on a sector wide basis. To name a few: (a) poor
management and financial control as evidenced by large discrepancies
between the number of teachers actually on post and those on the payroll;
(b) excessively high unit recurrent costs, particularly in secondary
schools, teacher training colleges, and technical institutions; (c) gross
inefficiencies at all levels as evidenced by small and unviable
institutions that do not allow for economies of scale in their operations;
(d) declining real incomes of the teaching force; and (e) absence of clear
policy and strategy for the controlled expansion and the qualitative
improvement of the sector.
3.        Revitalization of the system requires a combination of measures:
(a) improvement of quality; (b) greater cost-effectiveness and improved
financial controls; (c) improved staff morale; and (d) certain increases in
parental and community financial support, hopefully combined with a greater
voice over the efficiency of the institutions' operation. These measures
are more than Government can undertake without external financial
assistance. The proposed strategy, to be supported by this project, would
consist of external assistance to non-salary expenses (textbooks, supplies,
equipment, school maintenance and rehabilitation), together with support
for upgrading of key functions (pedagogical advice, management
capabilities). This would help restore morale in the teaching force and a
will to manage at all levels, which in turn could be reinforced by shared
oversight of the operation of particular facilities coupled with provision



-2-
of additional parental or community financial contributions. In parallel,
studies to improve cost-effectiveness would be carried out; and the
!esulting actions plans would be launched over the next few years. Once
these measures are implemented, the system would have a sound basis from
whlch to expand. The proposed strategy would also pave the way for a
future sector adjustment operation, hopefully to be supported by IDA and
other donors.
4.        Project objective.  The objectives of the project are to:
(a) maintain the momentum of the Government's educational rehabilitation
efforts at the primary education level and ensure their sustainability;
(b) assist the Government in initiating, on a limited (pilot) basis, a
revolving Textbook Fund (TF) for the replenishment of instructional
materials on a permanent basis; (c) strengthen key institutions under the
Ministry of Education (MOE) involved in improving and monitoring
educational quality and in project implementation; and (d) help prepare a
sector loan to implement the Government's emerging educational strategy.
5.        Proiect description.  The proposed project has three components:
(a) provision of textbooks and instructional materials to approximately
3,400 primary schools not assisted under the Third Education Project
(Cr. 1329-UG); (b) assistance for institutional and policy development,
including (i) the setting up of a pilot textbook fund financed by
contributions from parents and from MOE and intended to replenish textbooks
in self-selected areas which had benefited from the Third project;
(ii) strengthening of the inspectorate (training, technical assistance,
transportation, vehicle maintenance); (iii) support for the National
Curriculum Development Center and the Science and Technolegy Equipment and
Production Unit (technical assistance, training, initial operating costs);
(iv) strengthening of the Project Implementation Unit; (v) support to the
Education Policy Review Commission to help finalize its work and organize a
follow-up donors' conference; and (c) the carrying out of studies primarily
to complenent ongoing policy work on cost-effectiveness. The project, to
be disbursed over a five-year period has an estimated total cost of $27.9
million equivalent, 67Z of which is foreign exchange. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group Operations in Uganda are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7387-UG dated October 19,
1988, is attached. A map is also attached.
6.        Rationale for IDA involvement.  The proposed project is primarily
a follow up on the Third Education Project to continue the rehabilitation
of primary schools and supply them with didactic materials and textbooks.
It would also build upon IDA's sector work in education finance to prepare
the groundwork for a more extensive sector operation aimed at system-wide
improvements. IDA's comparative advantage is primarily one of providing
continuitys regarding project concept, procurement and distribution
mechanisms, and overall management. It also is one of building upon the
Sub-Saharan Africa report on education to help attract donor support to the
sector.



-3-
7.        Agreed Actions.  During Negotiations, Government provided IDA
with names of the districts selected according to agreed criteria for
participation into the TF and provided assurances that participation of
schools from those districts will be c.1 a voluntary basis. Government also
agreed to present for IDA's review by May 31, 1989 a detailed plan for the
operation of the TF, including (a) specific arrangements for the collection
of TF funds, (b) arrangements for the provision of adequate foreign
exchange for the acquisition of educational materials with TF funds, (c)
detailed criteria for monitoring and evaluating the TF scheme with a view
of making appropriate recommendation regarding the replicability of the
scheme nation-wide, and (d) the level of the Government's contribution to
the TF. Other agreements reached during negotiations for improving the
quality and cost-effectiveness of the educational system include
preparation of action plans to (a) eliminate discrepancies between the
number of teachers paid and those actually teaching (by December 31, 1989),
(b) to bring teacher training and technical institutions to more economical
size (by December 31, 1990), and (c) to improve the relation between school
size and curriculum offerings (by December 31, 1990). Other covenants
relate to provision of semi-annual reports; adherence to acceptable LCB
procedures; estaklishment of a special account; and auditing arrangements.
As a condition of disbursement for operating costs related to the
Inspectorate, the Government agreed to provide a three-year annual program
(updated annually) and an annual performance report for the Inspectorate.
8.        Benefits.  The proposed project would extend the benefits of the
Third Education Project to another 3,400 primary schools; introduce a
realistic textbook funding mechanism; strengthen the institutional and
policy capability of the Ministry of Education and improve the morale of
the teaching force, headmasters and inspectors; and pave the way for a
longer term adjustment and revitalization of the education system.
9.        Risks.  Regarding the textbook component, since procurement,
distribution and other implementation arrangements under the Third Project
(Cr. 1329-UG) are expected to be retained, the principal risk concerns the
medium term: i.e.. sustainability of the mechanisms to purchase and
f.nance textbooks and instructional materials. The proposed pilot TF
scheme is intended to put in place an affordable cost-sharing mechanism
building upon the long tradition of community and parent participation in
primary education. It would also encourage sustained Government budgetary
contribution. Regarding security conditions which have improved
considerably, experience under the previous project has demonstrated that
considerable obstacles can be overcome by committed staff and parents.
There are no special risks related to the other project components.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
