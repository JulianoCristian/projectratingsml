Its two main objectives are a) to\n            maintain the momentum of the Government's educational\n            rehabilitation efforts and ensure sustainability and b) to\n            help prepare a sector credit for the implementation of an\n            educational strategy.  For these purposes, the project will\n            finance the procurement and distribution of instructional\n            materials to primary schools requiring assistance and\n            establish a revolving textbook fund on a limited pilot basis\n            in order to test the possibility of a permanent\n            replenishment of textbooks.  The project will further assist\n            key departments / units in the Ministry of Education having\n            an active role in the formulation and improvement of\n            policies regarding instructional quality and project\n            implementation. Finally, it will finance preinvestment\n            studies and related activities for the preparation of a\n            broad sector wide operation which will be identified and\n            agreed upon during the implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "1988-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
