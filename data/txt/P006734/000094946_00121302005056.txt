INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME TWO
1.01      This volume is restricted to information specific to the indivi-
dual projects and their respective beneficiaries. An identical sequence of
presentation has been followed for each of the seven projects and an index
letter, corresponding to the first letter of the name of the city, identifies
each page and appendix.
1.02      An explanation of the overall policy behind the proposed loan, the
role of INSFOPAL, and the justification for the projects will be found in
Volume I. For ease of reference, two tables have been reproduced below from
Volume I. They give the principal data for each of the seven projects and
the proposed amounts of the loans, including the proportions of foreign and
local costs. All other information on procurement and disbursement is in
Volume I only.
1.03      The seven projects are expected to remedy present shortcomings in
water supply and sewerage in their respective cities. The engineering
aspects are in all cases straightforward. Organizational and financial
aspects need more detailed discussion, particularly in those cases where
the beneficiaries operate services more remunerative than water supply and
sewerage, and the latter have to be placed in perspective with them.
1.04      The seven beneficiaries are:

aMPRESAS PUBLICAS DE ARMENIA
I.  EXISTING WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES
1.01      Armenia is an important center of Colombia's coffee industry and
the capital of the Department of Quindio. Its population is estimated at
170,000. Situated on the banks of the Quindio River, at 1,400 m above sea
level on the western slope of the central chain of the Colombian Andes and
about 160 km north of Cali, the city has a temperate climate with an average
annual temperature of 220C. Water supply and sewerage are provided by the
Empresas Publicas de Armenia, which is also responsible for electric power,
telephone and various other public services (see paragraph 3.01).
1.02      About 80% of the population is served by the water system through
about 15,000 house connections. Of these, 13,000 have meters, with about
1,000 inoperative and many more malfunctioning. There is no meter mainten-
ance program.
1.03      Armenia's water source is the Quindio River (see Map 3789), which
originates 35 km northeast of the city in a forested watershed controlled
by the Empresas and the Coffee Growers' Association; the watershed is prac-
tically uninhabited above the raw water intake. The river has a minimum
flow of 4.4 m3/sec -- about 1.5 times the city's estimated water consumption
in the year 2000. A 14-km canal conducts the water to the treatment plant
(see Appendix A-1 for details on the plant). Both the canal and the plant
have a capacity of 500 1/sec. While the quality of the water is generally
acceptable, the iron content is occasionally as high as 1 mg/i and modifica-
tions in treatment are proposed to reduce this iron content. The raw water's
bacteriological quality is excellent; nevertheless, post-chlorination is
practised for reason of safety.
1.04      Armenia's water supply is inadequate to meet its needs.  This is
due to the bad state of repair of the water distribution system. To prevent
leakage in the future, the Empresas should exercise better control over con-
struction by preparing standards to be followed not only by its contractors
but also by private developers. The distribution system consists of 135 km
of pipe, ranging in diameter from 1 to 16 inches with 37 km (27%) 2 inches
or smaller. Because the small pipes are galvanized steel, they are badly
corroded and need to be replaced. All except 9 km of the larger pipe is
made of asbestos-cement.
1.05      The sewerage system serves approximately the same area as that
supplied with water. About 13,000 or 87% of the houses with water supply
are also connected to sewers. The system is a combined one, carrying storm-
water as well as sewage, and consists of 95 km of concrete pipe; 71 km or
75% are 8-, 12- and 16-inch pipe, too small for storm-water flows. Future
construction following the project (see paragraph 2.02) will consist of storm
sewers, with the existing small pipe then being used only for domestic sewage.



- A-2 -
1.06      All of the city's sewage goes into various creeks, which discharge
into either the Espejo River or the Quindio River. Those two rivers traverse
uninhabited, deep valleys for 20 km before reaching the Vieja River. River
flow is turbulent and reoxgenation excellent, with measured oxygen values at
80-90% of saturation. With the Viega's minimum flows of 40 m3/sec, dilution
is in excess of 100 to 1 and therefore sewage treatment is not required in
the foreseeable future.
II. PROJECT
Armenia's Water Supply and Sewerage Program
2.01      The project is the initial phase of the first stage of Armenia's
master plan for water supply and sewage disposal and would be constructed
in 1972-74. Facilities of the second phase, completing the first stage,
would be constructed in 1975-76; it is expected that a Bank loan for that
project will be requested in 1974. The purpose of dividing the first stage
into two phases is to permit the Empresas to institute management and orga-
nizational reforms before undertaking a major project.
2.02      The second phase of the master plan's first stage would further
improve and expand the water treatment, distribution and storage facilities
and add interceptor sewers to carry sewage away from high-density population
areas. Future stages of the master plan would extend these facilities as
population and water demand increase. The feasibility study for both phases
was undertaken by Compania de Ingenieria Sanitaria of Bogota and Barnard and
Burk, Inc., of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Description of Project
2.03      The project would consist of:
(i) modifications of the existing treatment plant to increase
its capacity to 800 1/sec;
(ii)  construction of 9,000 m3 of water storage facilities;
(iii)  construction of water transmission and distribution mains;
(iv)  improvements to the existing water distribution system;
(v) construction of most urgently needed sewer interceptors and
mains;
(vi)  purchase of equipment for meter testing and maintenance,
leak detection and sewer maintenance.
The treatment plant would be designed for maximum daily demand, estimated to
be 125% of average daily demand. The distribution system would be designed
for maximum hourly demand (equal to 200% of average hourly demand).



- A-3 -
2.04      Appendix A-1 gives a more detailed description of the project and
cost estimates. Growth of the city's population is projected at 5% per year
and the population served would increase from 131,000 in 1971 to 227,000
in 1980. Statistics on the water supply system, including consumption and
demand, past and forecast, are in Appendix A-2 and Chart 6381. The project
is intended to meet the estimated demand and would give an internal economic
return of 19%, as calculated in Appendix A-3 and discussed in greater detail
in Chapter V of Volume 1.
Cost Estimates
2.05      The estimated costs of the project are summarized below. 1/  The
annual investment program is given in Appendix A-4.

- A-4 -
2.06      The estimates are generally based on the engineers' estimates in
the feasibility report and on suppiiers' quotations. The engineers' unit
cost estimates have been verified by using the unit cost of recent similar
work in Armenia and neighboring cities in Colombia. Additionally, the unit
costs were compared with those tabulated by INSFOPAL. Technical contin-
gencies of 10% on imported equipment and 20% on civil works reflect the
degree of certainty associated with the respective project items. The cost
of engineering and construction supervision has been assumed at 10% of net
construction cost, conforming to local conditions, plus estimated costs of
foreign consulting services. The price contingency is discussed in para-
graph 4.15 of Volume 1.
Project Execution
2.07      The preparation of final designs should commence immediately in
order to keep the project on schedule. The Empresas has already engaged a
local engineering consultant, Compania de Ingenieria Sanitaria. This con-
sultant will need the help of an expert in water treatment plant design,
presumably a foreign consultant. The cost of foreign consulting services
would not exceed US$35,000.
2.08      Three years of construction, 1972 through 1974, are expected.  The
project schedule is shown in Chart 6380.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization
3.01      The Empresas Publicas de Armenia, created in 1962 as an autonomous
enterprise by the Armenia Municipal Council, is responsible for the city's
water supply and sewerage, electric power distribution, telephone service,
public markets, cattle trading fair, slautherhouse, and solid waste collection
and disposal.
3.02      The Empresas is directed by a six-member Board of Directors.  The
Mayor is a member ex officio. Two of the Board members are appointed by
the Municipal Council from its own members; two others are also appointed by
the Council but need not be Council members. One Board member is appointed
by the Council from a list of three names submitted by the Corporacion
Autonoma Regional de Quindio. All the Board members are appointed for two-
year terms, with appointments staggered to assure continuity of the Board.
3.03      The Board has extensive powers, including the power to fix tariffs
within the limitations approved by the National Public Services Tariff Board
and the power to execute contracts and borrow money.
3.04      The Empresas' day-to-day operation is administered by the General
Manager, who is appointed by the Board of Directors.  The present Ganeral
Manager is capable and is expected to continue in office.



- A-5 -
3.05      The organizational structure existing at the time of appraisal
(see Chart 6379) has been changed recently by the Empresas Board according
to the proposal of the management consultants, Planificadores Asociados.
The reorganization comprises the creation of two main departments, one
technical, one financial/administrative under the general manager. The
managers to head these new departments have already been appointed.
Staff and Management
3.06      The Empresas has 500 employees, 113 of them in the Water Supply
and Sewerage Division. This amounts to 0.86 staff per 1,000 persons served
with water and sewerage -- a relatively low ratio, especially when one con-
siders that 44 (39%) of the Division's employees are in the Sewerage Sec-
tion, mostly doing maintenance work necessitated by faulty original construc-
tion. The Water Supply Section, which has 62 employees, will need 15 to 20
more to assist in the leak detection/repair and meter maintenance programs;
they could be obtained by hiring new staff or by transfers from the Sewerage
Section once sewer reconstruction has reduced the excessive maintenance.
3.07      The middle management staff is well qualified and dedicated.  It
should be possible to promote from this group to fill at least some of the
upper management positions to be created by the reorganization. Employees'
salaries and benefits are competitive with those of private industry in the
city. Hourly employees are unionized and the union exerts a fairly strong
influence on the Empresas' management.
Billing and Collection
3.08      Billing is processed by punched cards through an IBM calculator.
The consumers receive two bills monthly: one for water supply and sewerage,
electricity, street cleaning and other services; the other for telephone
service. The present methods of collection are not satisfactory and would
be improved as part of the reorganization. The policy of disconnecting
service for non-payment is not strictly enforced, and up to 30% of the bills
are outstanding for longer than three months. Governmental agencies are
billed but only 25% of their bills are paid. Total billing to these agencies
represents about 3% of the Empresas' operating income.
Accounting, Inventories and Audit
3.09      The Empresas' accounting system lacks adequate technical organiza-
tion, and the General Manager does not receive the information required for
control of operations and financial decisions. The Empresas' budget is
prepared only to justify expenses to the Municipal Council. The book value
of assets is not accurately reported and assets are not depreciated. Cost
accounting is non-existent and internal control inefficient.
3.10      The Empresas does not perform physical inventory control on a
yearly basis and the recorded level of inventories is not reliable. A
better codification of inventories is required.



- A-6 -
3.11      The Empresas has engaged management consultants, mentioned in para-
graph 3.05 above, to help in the reorganization and in the establishment of
data processing and proper cost control, budgeting, accounting, billing and
audit procedures. These consultants are acceptable to the Bank.
3.12      Audit of the Empresas is performed by an appointee of the Municipal
Council. To ensure that the information provided in the financial statements
is accurate and presented in accordance with current accounting practice, the
Empresas should employ commercial auditors, beginning with the 1972 accounts.
A contract for this audit service with acceptable auditors will be necessary.
A contract for this audit service with acceptable auditors is a condition of
effectiveness for the subsidiary loan agreement (Specific Condition).
IV. FINANCES
Water Supply and Sewerage
Past Finances
4.01      Revenues produced by water supply and sewerage operations have not
covered cash operating costs in two of the past three years. These cash
deficit were covered by cash surplus generated by the Telephone Division.
The 1971 increase in revenues was largely due to the 47% increase in tariffs.
No depreciation allowance was recorded in the books of the Empresas. De-
tailed financial statements are given in Appendices A-7 and A-8. Past fi-
nances are discussed in Appendix A-5 and are summarized below.

4.02      Despite a low debt service of Col$0.5 million in 1971 and a com-
plete absence of new investments and bank-financing during the past three
years, the debt coverage was only 1.2, due to the low revenues.



- A-7 -
Financing Plan
4.03      The financing plan during the years 1972-75 is based on the follow-
ing premises:
(i)  an average tariff of Col$1.30/m3 will be implemented by
July 1, 1972, and maintained to achieve the revenues
specified in paragraph 4.07;
(ii)  Funds generated by the Water Supply and Sewerage Division
will not be transferred to any other service (General Con-
dition); and
(iii)  Immediately after completion of the project (end of 1974)
a second project will be undertaken (1975-76) to complete
the first stage of the master plan (see paragraph 2.01).
It has been assumed that loans would be considered for the
second project on terms similar to those for the first one.
Other financial assumptions are set out in Appendix A-6.

4.05      Loan funds required would be made available as follows:

(Col$24.8 million) at an assumed interest rate of 7.25%
with amortization over 21 years after a 4-year grace period;
and
(ii)  A National Loan of Col$13.1 million at an assumed interest
rate of 12%, repaid in equal semi-annual payments over 11
years after a 4-year grace period;



- A-9 -
(iii)  The Empresas' contribution of Col$27.5 million, equal
to 34.2% of the total application of funds, consisting
of the net internal resources of the Water Supply and
Sewerage Division; and
(iv)  a foreign loan for US$0.37 million (Col$10.4 million)
and a second national loan for Col$4.5 million on the
same terms as in (i) and (ii) for Other Works in 1975.
Tariffs
4.06      In 1971 the combined water supply and sewerage tariff averaged
Col$0.72/m3 (US$0.13/1,000 gallons). This tariff schedule was established
in June 1971 in accordance with National Public Services Tariff Board guide-
lines, and represents an increase from an average of Col$0.49/m3. The new
tariffs have six domestic categories (assessed property values), minimum
charges that increase with property value, and the same minimum allowance
(25 m3/month) and excess charges (Col$0.70/m3) for all consumers. Sewerage
tariffs are 50% of the water bill. Industrial and Official tariffs are
equal to Domestic category 5 and Commercial to category 3, 4, 5 or 6.
Tariffs are shown in Appendix A-9.
4.07      Even the new tariffs are inadequate to provide the funds necessary
to cover costs of operations and a portion of expansion needs. The tariffs
will have to be raised to produce the following average revenue:

Future Finances
4.08      Estimated income statements are summarized below.  Detailed finan-
cial statements are in Appendices A-7 and A-8.

- A-10 -
4.09      The 167% increase in revenues from 1972 to 1976 is based on both
increases in tariffs and amount of water sold. The latter is due to a
reduction of unaccounted for water from 50% to 29% and an increase in pro-
duction of 29%, to give a net increase in water sold of 70%. During the
same period the rate of return will average 6.5, the debt service coverage
5.0 and the current ratio 1.5.
4.10      To ensure that increases are sufficient, an average tariff of
Col$1.30/m3 is a condition of effectiveness of the subsidiary loan agreement,
and rates of return should be set as follows (Specific Condition):
1973 to 1977              6.5%
Thereafter                7.0%
4.11      The rate of return would be calculated by taking income before
interest as a percentage of revalued average net fixed assets. Revaluation
and tariff review would be done yearly, using the cost of living index for
workers developed for the Department of Quindio by Departamento Administra-
tivo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE). The subsidiary loan agreement will
provide that the base would be the net revalued fixed assets (Col$40.7 mil-
lion) as of December 1971, see Appendix A-18 (Specific Condition). The rate
of return for all three services has been computed using preliminary re-
valued assets which still have to be verified by the consultants to the
satisfaction of the Empresas and the Bank. If the review results in a change
in the asset values, a corresponding adjustment would be made in the rate of
return required.
Power
4.12      Historical and projected income and cash flow statements are
shown in Appendices A-10 and A-11. Past finances are discussed in Appendix
A-5 and assumptions for financial projections in Appendix A-6. In 1969-70
the Power Division provided more than 30% of the Empresas' total revenues
but a very small proportion of its internal cash generation (less than 1%)
and in 1971 it had a cash deficit of Col$1.4 million. Operating ratios
during the same period were about 100%, which is unsatisfactory. The Power
Division has no outstanding debt.
4.13      Revenues are expected to increase, reflecting both a growth in
demand and rate increases of 76% in 1973, 14% in 1974 and 5% in 1975. Thanks
to an improved internal cash generation, the Empresas will be able to finance
an investment program of Col$26.0 million. Supplier credits of Col$18.0 mil-
lion are expected to be obtained; but the debt service coverage ratio will not
fall below 1.8 times during the period 1972-1979.
4.14      Tariffs will be maintained to provide the following minimum
annual rates of return on the average net current value of the power assets
revalued as of December 1971 at Col$25.5 million as shown in Appendix A-18
(Specific Condition).



- A-11 -
1973                      6%
Thereafter                11%
4.15      The rate of return would be calculated by a method identical to
the one proposed for the water supply and sewerage fixed assets in paragraph
4.11.
Telephones
4.16      Historical and projected income and cash flow statements are
shown in Appendices A-12 and A-13. Past finances are discussed in Appendix
A-5 and assumptions for financial projects in Appendix A-6. The telephone
Division provided in the past about 25% of the Empresas' total revenues and
the largest proportion of its net income (80% in 1969, 90% in 1970 and 75%
in 1971). Operating ratios during the same period were about 40% which is
satisfactory. In 1969 the Empresas obtained a loan from Telefonaktiebolaget
L. M. Ericsson (Stockholm) to finance telephone investments. The debt amount-
ed to Col$7.3 million, with an annual interest rate of 10% and a final pay-
ment in 1974. Total outstanding debt as of December 1971 amounts to Col$6.0
million. Telephone revenues are all collected by a sponsoring local bank
in Pereira. This bank withholds the amount needed to pay Ericsson and re-
funds the remainder to the Empresas.
4.17       Revenues are expected to increase, reflecting both a growth in
demand and fixed charge increases (96% in 1973 and 20% in 1975).   In addi-
tion, it is expected that a 3-minute impulse will be introduced, thereby
increasing by 30% the revenues from calls. The improved cash generation
will enable the Empresas to carry out an investment program of Col$31.0 mil-
lion. Suppliers' credits of Col$24.0 million are expected but the debt serv-
ice coverage will not fall below 1.4 during the period 1972-1979.
4.18      Tariffs will be maintained to provide an 11% annual rate of return
on the average net current value of assets revalued as of December 1971 at
Col$20.7 million as shown in Appendix A-18 (Specific Condition).
4.19      The rate of return would be calculated by a method identical to
the one proposed for water supply and sewerage fixed assets in paragraph 4.11.
Other Services
4.20      The Other Services include solid waste collection and operation of
the city's public markets and slaughterhouse. The projected income and
cash flow statements for these services are in Appendix A-14 and assumptions
for financial projections in Appendix A-6. The operating ratio before de-
preciation from 1969 to 1971 was around 100%. It has been assumed that rea-
sonable tariff increases would enable the Empresas to carry out an investment
program of Col$8.0 million during the period 1972-1976. These investments
are necessary to provide adequate services for the growing population.



- A-12 -
4.21      To ensure that the tariffs of these services are adequate, assur-
ances were included in the subsidiary loan agreement, except as the Bank
may otherwise agree, that an operating ratio excluding depreciation of 75%
should be maintained beginning in 1975. As steps toward this goal, the
operating ratio should decrease from 95% in 1972, to 85% in 1973 and to 80%
in 1974.
Consolidated Finances
4.22      Consolidated income, cash flow and balance sheet statements for the
Empresas are in Appendices A-15 through A-17. The consolidated operating
ratio will decrease from 67% in 1973 to 56% in 1979. Net income increases
from Col$4.0 million in 1971 to Col$23.2 million in 1979. The Empresas'
capability of meeting its current obligations will improve, with a current
ratio of 0.9 in 1971 to 2.0 in 1976 and 2.8 in 1979. Debt as percentage of
capitalization will remain at a low level never being higher than 29%.
4.23      After project construction, borrowing will be limited by a general
covenant that debt would not be incurred unless net cash generation for the
previous year covers rmaximum future debt service at least 1.5 times (Specif.c
Condition). The expected internal cash generation will provide annual debt
service coverage of no less than 1.9 after 1972.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      In addition to the General Conditions applicable to all seven
projects, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the following
Specific Conditions will be included in the subsidiary loan agreement be-
tween INSFOPAL and the Empresas Publicas de Armenia:
(i)  A contract with acceptable auditors for audit services
is a condition of effectiveness of the loan (para-
graph 3.13);
(ii)  An average water supply and sewerage tariff to yield
Col$1.30/m3 will be established as a condition of ef-
fectiveness of the loan, and the tariffs will be main-
tained so as to achieve the following minimum rates of
return, based on a valuation of net fixed assets of
Col$40.7 million as of December 31, 1971, (paragraphs
4.10 and A 11);
1973-77                 6.5%
Thereafter               7.0%
(iii)  Electric power tariffs will be set to provide the follow-
ing minimum rates of return, based on a valuation of net
fixed assets of Col$25.5 million as of December 31, 1971,
(paragraph 4.14):



- A-13 -
1973                    6%
Thereafter             11%
(iv)  The tariff for the telephone services will be maintained
to provide an 11% minimum annual rates of return, based
on a valuation of net fixed assets of Col$20.7 million
as of December 31, 1971, (paragraph 4.18):
(v)  Tariffs for the other services, including markets, slaughter-
house and solid waste collection, will be maintained to achieve
the following operating ratios, before depreciation (paragraph
4.20):
1972                   95%
1973                   85%
1974                   80%
1975 and thereafter   75%
5.02      With the above Specific Conditions, along with the Central Condi-
tions in Chapter VII of Volume 1, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$1.01 million for a term of 25 years, including a 4-year grace period.

MEDIUM-SIZE CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECTS
EMPRESAS PUBLICAS DE ARMENIA
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE DIVISION
PROJECT FACILITIES
Existing Water Treatment Plant
The raw-water conduit consists of sections of open canals,
tunnels and aqueducts. The present limiting capacity of the canal is
500 1/sec though some tunnel sections have a capacity in excess of
2,000/1/sec. Canal sections of minimum capacity would be enlarged
and other improvements made to the canal as part of this project.
The existing raw-water intake, a primitive stone diversion dam,
would be replaced later.  Further expansion of the raw-water canal
transmission capacity would also be provided as part of the second
phase.
From the raw-water channel the water passes through a grit
chamber. This grit chamber is not functioning because sand and grit
settles out along the 9-km canal before reaching the water treatment
plant. When the new raw-water intake facility is constructed as part
of the second phase, the facility will incorporate grit chambers to
minimize future maintenance of the raw-water canal and the existing
grit chamber will be abandoned. After the grit chamber the raw wa-
ter flows in an open channel through the flash mixer and then through
the Permutit precipitators.  These precipitators are arranged in 4 rows
of 10 each. From the precipitators the water flows either through 4
standard rapid sand filters, or through 6 Valveless Permutit rapid sand
filters. The existing filter rate is 5 m/hour (2 gal/min per sq.ft).
The filter effluent is chlorinated and then aerated; consequently,
chlorine residuals are not maintained.
Plant effluent quality varies in general with raw-water
quality. This is because the chemical feed units do not have suffi-
cient capacity to vary chemical feed rates of alum and lime propor-
tionate to raw-water turbidity. Sufficient chemical feed units would
be added as part of this project to permit future dosing as required
by raw-water quality. The raw water is of excellent bacteriological
quality. Turbidities range from an average of between 5 and 10 parts
per million up to 100 parts per million. Turbidities above 30 parts
per million are very infrequent and generally occur only when the



Apendix A-1
Page   a  5- rpages
canal is damaged by landslides, when repair work is being done, or when
heavy rainfall causes muddy run-off to enter the open canal. The raw
water also has up to one part per million of iron, only a small amount
of which is being removed by the present treatment.
Future treatment will incorporate alum as flocculent aid,
lime for PH correction and pre-chlorination to oxidize the iron.  For
safety reasons post-chlorination will be maintained, but the subse-
quent aeration will be eliminated.
Tests are presently under way to determine whether the instal-
lation of tube settlers in the existing precipitators would permit
increased flow through the existing precipitators with effective floc
removal rates.  Depending on the success of these experiments, future
plant expansion would consist of either the installation of tube settlers
or the addition of flocculation and sedimentation units.
As part of this project the flow rates through the existing
filter units would be increased. To accommodate the increased flow,
piping of the conventional rapid sand-filters would be replaced.
Initially, the filter rate of these conventional units would be
increased to 10 m/hour (4 gal/min per sq.ft). Flow rates of the
Valveless Permutit filters would be increased to 6.5 m/hour (2.6 gal/
min per sq.ft), not requiring a change in the piping. With the new
filter rates, the plant would be capable of producing 800 1/sec which
is sufficient until the late 1970s. When at that time, increased demand
requires further expansion of treatment capacity, the filters could be
changed to dual media-filters which would permit increased filter rates
at a mall additional investment.
The filtered water would be discharged to the Regivit storage
reservoir, a ground-level concrete storage tank of 4,500 m3 capacity.
Additional backwash water tank capacity would not be required for this
expansion.
New Distribution System
The quantities of transmission and distribution piping and
estimated costs are as follows:

The above estimates are net construction costs, at 1971 pri-
ces, and include all accessories such as valves, fittings and hydrants.
The distribution network has been designed by the Hardy-Cross
method with maximum (static) and minimum pressures set at 90 and 25 psi,
respectively. C-values of 140 were used for new asbestos-cement pipe
in accordance with INSFOPAL design standards. The system has been de-
signed for ultimate water demand, resulting in large pipe diameters
even for the initial stages of construction. The pipe to be installed
as part of this project is a very much reduced quantity, sufficient
for the immediate future only. During construction of this first phase
of the first stage of the master plan, the consultants would revise
the design of the entire distribution system, replacing, where feasible,
large-diameter pipe with smaller pipe, sufficient for a period of 15
to 20 years, to reduce the initial capital investment. The design
would incorporate the future installation of parallel transmission
mains and distribution main reinforcements.
The project would include funds to rehabilitate the existing
distribution system in the central part of the city. Mains in this
area generally consist of galvanized-steel pipe of 2- and 3- inch dia-
meter. These pipes not only are too small but also badly corroded,
as evidenced by the high rate (50%) of unaccounted for water. Rehabi-
litation of the system would consist of replacement of inadequate

and corroded mains, detection and elimination of leaks, repair of
defective meters and installation of meters at unmetered accounts.
The project cost does not include the expense of house connections
and meter installation because these costs are paid by the customer
at the time the installation is made.
Distribution Storage
The distribution system has been separated into several
separate pressure zones necessitated by Arm6nials topography. Each
zone is served by its own storage tank, which also acts as a pressure
break. At the present time there are three tanks with a total capa-
city of 7000 m3 .  The project would add 3 more storage tanks with a
total capacity of 12,000 m3.
Normal required distribution storage in a system that is
entirely gravity-fed, with no unusual high risk features, should be
about 15% of maximum daily demand. To this a fire demand allowance
should be added. The city's maximum daily demand in 1980 is esti-
mated to be 83,000 m3; 15% of this would be 12,500 m3.  The total
storage, including that to be constructed as part of the project,
is 19,000 m , or 6,500 om3 more than the required minimum. These
3,500 m3 would provide a fire flow of 500 1/sec for almost 4 hours,
which is more than adequate for a city of Armenia's size and type of
construction.
Additional storage would be built during the second phase
of the master plan's first stage. This additional storage is required
because of the unusually long transmission canal, which is exposed to
occasional damage from landslides.
Sewerage System
The project includes the construction of the most urgently needed
sewer interceptors and mains to reduce the periodic flooding of some areas
in the center of the city and to carry domestic sewage away from populated
areas.
Equipment
Equipment to be purchased under the project would include:
(i) water meter test bench and auxiliary equipment;
(ii) leak detection equipment;
(iii) sewer maintenance equipment.

Timing
The facilities to be provided are urgently required to prevent
further deterioration of the water service. They are the minimum needed
and are intended as a stop-gap measure until the Empresas is reorganized
and capable of handling the largest project of the entire first stage
of the master plan. The modifications designed for the treatment plant
and the construction of the transmission/distribution mains and storage
tanks would permit the Empresas to provide improved water service for
Armenia's inhabitants. A vigorous program of leak detection and elimi-
nation would make unnecessary further expansion of the water treatment
plant in the immediate future, and thus postpone additional investments
for water treatment facilities.

EC ONC14IC RETURN
The economic return for the project as measured
by total water supply revenues is 16.7%. The benefits are measured by
the additional quantities of water provided, valued at the proposed
water and sewerage supply tariff after deducting incremental operating
costs due to the project. The costs are those of the project and the
post-construction period investment necessary to utilize it fully.
The following assumptions have been made for the calculations
shown on page 3:
(i) The average life of the assets is 50 years.
(ii) The projected volumes sold are shown in Appendix A-2.
(iii) Since there is no excess capacity at present, all
additional water sold is attributed to the project.
(iv) The total volume sold is multiplied by the tariff ex-
pected to be in force at the end of 1972, i.e. by
Gol$1.30/m3. In this way all benefits are expressed
in constant 1972 prices.
(v) Only the incremental operating costs are charged to
the project. To obtain the operating costs net of
inflation, the 1973 operating cost is divided by 1.10,
which is thought to be the relevant inflation factor,
The 1974 cost is divided by (1.10)2, and the opera-
ting costs thereafter by (1.03)3. The incremental
operating cost is then the difference between these
adjusted operating costs and the 1972 operating costs.
(vi)  The costs of works are shown in Appendix A-4 and are
converted into constant 1972 prices by applying the
inflation factor.  When investments aim at improving
service to existing customers, their costs are not
charged to the project. The tax component is negli-
gible as project items are imported free of duty and
no domestic taxes are levied.



Appendix A-3
Page 2 of 3 pages
As is shown in Annex 13, the project has a medium probability
of achieving-all objectives. It is therefore thought unlikely that the
investment costs would increase more than 10%, in which case the internal
economic rate of return would fall to 15.0%. As the public's acceptance
level of rate increases is rated medium, it is assumed the drop of
incremental revenues would not exceed 20%, in which case the return
would be 14.0%. The rates of return are high, due to a pared investment
program with little excess capacity. Unaccounted for water is expected
to fall sharply from 50% at present to 25% by 1980.

CdWENTS ON PAST FINANCES
INCOME STATEMENTS (See Appendices A-7, A-10, A-12, A-14 and A-15)
Sales
In 1971, the Empresas revenues were obtained as follows:
Power                  31%
Telephone              26%
Water and Sewerage    21%
Others                 22%
Total            100%
Unaccounted-for water remained at 50% during the past three years.
Water rates were raised in 1971 from an average of Col$ 0.49 to
Col$ 0.72/m3, substantially improving the financial position of the Water
Supply and Sewerage Division which had previously been unsatisfactory. The
current water tariff is shown in Appendix A-9.
Tariffs for electric power, telephone and other services were
raised in 1968.
Non-operating Income
Non-operating income includes sale of materials and other income
not directly related to operations, such as the sale of old equipment, rental
of tools, etc. Non-operating income is not taken into consideration in the
internal economic return and operating ratio calculations.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses are allocated among the different
divisions in accordance with the revenues generated by each one.
Gperating Ratio
The operating ratio for the Water Supply and Sewerage Division was
112% in 1969, 105% in 1970 and 98% in 1971. Operating ratios for the other
division are shown below and indicate that the Power Division also has not
been profitable.

Other Services        84%      84%        86%
Depreciation
In the past, no depreciation allowance was recorded in the books
of the Empresas. In 1971 the assets were revalued by consultants and an
accumulated depreciation was calculated which represents 33% of the gross
revalued fixed assets.
CASH FLOW STATEMENTS (See Appendices A-8, A-ll, A-13, A-14 and A-16).
Bad Debts
There is no allowance for bad debts. Public services and government
bills which are not collected are considered as an operating cost.
Inventories
In the past, ratio of inventories to consumption of supplies for all
divisions was about 3.0. This ratio is too high and should be reduced in the
future. Inventory records do not separate accounts by division.
Cash
The cash position of the Water Supply and %ewerage Division has not
been satisfactory during the past two years, and in 1971 an estimated cash
deficit of Col$ 0.2 million was covered by cash surplus from the Telephones
Division. Cash position of the Power Division is also weak but other services
have a satisfactory accumulated cash. The consolidated financial position of
the Empresas is satisfactory, however, with an accumulated cash of Col$ 1.6
million at the end of 1971, and a current ratio which improved from 0.6 in
1969 to 0.9 in 1971.
BALANCE SHEETS STATEMENTS (See Appendix A-17.)
Gross Fixed Assets
At end of 1971 the Empresas' total revalued gross fixed assets were
Col$ 145.3 million, i.e. a 62% revaluation surplus.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are not kept by division and amounted to Col$ 3.0
million on December 31, 1970.

Revenues
Revenues are from billings only. Water and sewerage charges which
average Col$ 0.72/m3 in 1971 are assumed to increase 81% to  ol$ 1.30/r3
in the second half of 1972. Additional increases of 8% to Col$ 1.40/m3,
7% to Cbl$ 1.50/m3, and 7% to C0l$ 1.60/m3 are assumed for 1973, 1974 and
1975, respectively. After 1975, average tariffs will remain at the same
level.
Operating Costs
All operating costs are based on 1971 first six months' actuals,
and include an annual 10% price contingency until 1975 and an annual 5%
allowance for unexpected expenses. Labor oosts are projected to increase
according to the following factors:

EMPRESAS PUBLICAS DE MANIZALES
I. EXISTING WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES
1.01      Manizales, with a population of 300,000, is the capital of the
Department of Caldas and one of the most important centers of Colombia's
coffee trade. Situated in the Cauca Valley atop a ridge at an altitude of
2,170 m, the city has an average annual temperature of 16°C. Water supply
and sewerage are provided by the Empresas Publicas de Manizales, which is
also responsible for telephone and various other services (see para. 3.01).
1.02      An estimated 78% of the city's population is supplied with water.
There are 20,300 house connections, all but 200 of them metered, with each
serving an average of 11 persons. By way of comparison, the electricity
company has more than 30,000 customers.
1.03      Manizales gets its water supply by gravity from the Blanco River,
its tributaries (Pinares, Guerra and Arenosa) and the Olivares River (see
Map 3791). The water treatment plant built in 1941, with a second stage
completed in 1952 to increase capacity to 400 1/sec, is estimated to be
working up to 750 1/sec with an average of 600 1/sec. (These are rough
estimates since there is no way to measure inflow and outflow.)
1.04      A new treatment plant, located 14 km to the southwest of Manizales
at the confluence of the Chinchina and Cajones Rivers, started operations in
December 1971. The plant was designed to treat 1,000 1/sec, but only two of
the three clarification units were built; hence, its present capacity is
only 670 1/sec. It will use water from the Cajones (minimum flow 300 1/sec)
and the Chinchina (minimum flow over 700 1/sec). The intake on the Cajones
is already installed, while the one on the Chinchina would be included in
the project, to increase the supply to 1,000 1/sec.
1.05      The distribution network is very old and the extensions to it have
been installed haphazardly. The network consists of some 180 km of pipe,
70% with diameters 4 inches or smaller. The pipe 2 inches or smaller (17%)
is mostly of galvanized-steel and needs to be replaced as it is too small
and often badly corroded. Low pressures and excessive losses are caused by
this use of pipe with very small diameters and by construction deficiencies.
Because of the steep topography, many areas have very high pressures.
1.06      The sewerage system is a combined one, carrying sewage and storm-
water, and serves the same area that has water supply, with about the same
number of house connections. The sewers have many deficiencies and have
contributed to landslides and washouts. The untreated sewage and rainwater
drain into several creeks, some of them flowing through heavily populated
areas, which discharge into the Chinchina and Olivares. Those rivers can
handle the sewage since for some distance beyond the city no use is being
made of them, and separation of the sewerage system is therefore not required.



- M-2 -
1.07      Land in Manizales is so scarce and costly that low-income residents
are forced to build their homes on steep slopes subject to landslides and
washouts. One of the purposes of the project is to alleviate at least part
of this problem by building sewers to carry stormwater away from the slopes.
1.08      Maintenance of both the water distribution and sewerage suffer
from lack of personnel and from inadequate supervision. A meter maintenance
program should be instituted and meter repairing accelerated. The Empresas
recognizes this situation and plans to remedy it. Technical assistance
in operations should be provided under the project (General Condition).
II. THE PROJECT
Manizales' Water Supply and Sewerage Program
2.01      With the recent completion of the new water treatment plant (see
para. 1.04) and its proposed expansion under the project, the supply of
water to Manizales will be assured for some time. Additional treatment
capacity can be obtained by upgrading the two existing plants. The longer-
term program will consist of expanding water distribution and sewerage/
drainage to keep pace with the expansion and intensification of the urban
area. The project would be the first stage of such a program; it includes
meeting the present deficit in areas already built but not yet served. The
feasibility study for the program was prepared by AEI Ltda. of Medellin.
Description of Project
2.02      The project would include the following:
(i) Water Supply, First Stage
(a)  An intake on the Chinchina River to abstract 700 1/sec
and divert it to the newly constructed intake on the
Cajones River, in order to increase the supply to 1,000
1/sec. A tunnel of approximately 150 m to take water
from the Chinchina intake to the Cajones dam.
(b)  Construction of a third clarification unit at the
Chinchina treatment plant.
(c)  Construction of 8 storage tanks with a total capacity
of 30,250 m3 and some minor changes in the 16 existing
tanks, to give a total storage of 51,250 m3.
(d)  Major improvements in the distribution network, consist-
ing of new mains and changes of pipe when needed due to
insufficiefit capacity or poor condition of the pipe.



- M-3 -
(ii) Sewerage, First Stage
(a)  Changes in pipe diameters in the network when needed
because of system design.
(b)  Changes in alignment to avoid pipelines being built
under built-up areas.
(c)  Trunk sewers to carry storm-water and sewage.
Appendix M-1 gives a more detailed description of the project.
2.03      Growth of the city's population is projected at 6% and the popula-
tion se'rved will increase from 78% at present to 90% in 1976.  Statistics,on
the water supply system, including consumption and demand, past and forecast,
are in Appendix M-2 and Chart 6605. The project is intended to meet the
estimated demand and to give an internal economic return of 8% as calculated
in Appendix M-3 and discussed in greater detail in Chapter V of Volume 1.
Cost Estimates
2.04      The estimated costs of the project are summarized below. 1/ The
annual investment program is given in Appendix M-4.

1/   Except for the price contingency, the prices are at 1971 values, with
an exchange rate of Col$20 to US$1.00.



- M-4 -
2.05      The project cost estimates were made by the consultants.  Tech-
nical contingencies are 20% for the water supply and 30% for the sewerage
component. Engineering and administration costs are 12% for the sewerage
and 10% for the water supply component. The price contingency is discussed
on paragraph 4.15 of Volume 1.
Project Execution
2.06      The present consultants, AEI are acceptable to the Bank.  Their
assignment is to design the project and supervise construction. The design
work is being financed by a loan from the Colombian Development Fund (FONADE),
while about half of the cost of construction supervision would be covered by
the Bank loan.
2.07      A four-year construction period, 1972 through 1975, is expected.
Project design would carry on into 1972 and major construction would take
place in 1973, 1974 and 1975 (see Chart 6385).
III. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization
3.01      The proposed beneficiary, Empresas Publicas de Manizales, is an
autonomous entity which provides water supply and sewerage, telephone serv-
ice, street cleaning and solid wastes collection, and operates a slaughterhouse
and marketplaces in Manizales. The Empresas was created in the 1950s as
Empresas Municipales Delegadas. In 1962 the Manizales Council gave the
Empresas full autonomy and changed its name to Empresas Publicas de Manizales.
3.02      The Board of the Empresas is composed of five members.  The Mayor
of Manizales is the President of the Board, two members are elected by the
Council, and two are appointed by the Council from lists made up by the
Empresas' four major creditors.
3.03      The Board has extensive powers, including the power to fix tariffs
(as authorized by the National Tariff Board).
3.04      The Board has traditionally delegated authority for daily operation
of the Empresas to the General Manager and this should continue. The General
Manager is also nominated by the Board. The present General Manager, who
joined the Empresas in June, 1970, has performed well and will probably con-
tinue to serve in his present post.
3.05      The Empresas has four main divisions (see Chart 6386):
(1)  Administration which is responsible for accounting, billing
and collection, and data processing;



- M-5 -
(ii)  Water Supply and Sewerage, which includes reforestation;
(iii)  Telephones;
(iv)  a division for Other Services which operates the slaughter-
house and marketplaces and is responsible for street cleaning,
garbage collection and other minor activities.
3.06      The assistant to the General Manager is in charge of legal
questions, personnel and Board meeting preparation.
3.07      The present structure of the Empresa is inadequate.  All respon-
sibilities are centralized in the hands of the General Manager, who cannot
rely upon his subordinates with the exception of the former head of Water
Supply and Sewerage, who is now supervisor of the Administration Division.
The Empresas' structure would be reviewed by the management consultants
referred to in paragraph 3.14.
3.08      The General Manager also directs the Empresas' finances.  There
is urgent need for a financial manager. During negotiations, agreement was
reached that a financial manager will be appointed before December 31, 1972.
(Specific Condition.)
Staff and Management
3.09      The Empresas has a large staff of 660:151 in the Water Supply and
Sewerage Division (10.70 employees per 1000 population served which is low),
71 in the Telephone Division, 316 in Other Services, and 122 in Administra-
tion. Other Services and Administration appear to be overstaffed and trans-
fers from these divisions to the expanding water and telephone divisions
should replace hiring of new employees. Salaries in the Empresas are higher
than in other municipal institutions in Manizales and are adequate. There is
a labor union with which the Empresas maintains a good relationship.
Billing and Collection
3.10      Billing and collection procedures are good.  Billing is processed
efficiently through the computer. The consumers receive two bills monthly:
one for water supply, sewerage and street cleaning, and the other for tele-
phone service. Revenues from the marketplaces are also collected monthly,
but on a daily occupancy basis as stipulated in the contract between the
tenants of the market premises and the Empresas. Revenues from the slaughter-
houses are collected daily.
Accounting, Inventories and Audit
3.11      The balance sheet and profit and loss accounts are kept separately
for all services, but there is no adequate cost accounting system or budgetary
control. Some accounting procedures are deficient and cumbersome and should
be improved so that the financial reports will be more useful and reliable.
Some of the balance sheet accounts should be analyzed for correction or re-
classification.



- M-6 -
3.12      A general study of inventories is necessary.  The consolidated
turnover of the inventories is high but varies widely from service to serv-
ice. The Empresas uses a Kardex system which enables continuous revalua-
tion of inventories. There is a central shop, mainly for spare parts and
maintenance work. Two other shops are used for water supply/sewerage and
for telephone.
3.13      Audit of the Empresas is performed by an appointee of the Municipal
Council and by an auditor of the National Government (Controlaria). To ensure
that the information provided in the financial statements is accurate and
presented in accordance with current accounting practice, the Empresas will
employ commercial auditors, beginning with the accounts for 1971 (General
Condition).
3.14      The Empresas expects to improve its organization and operations
by engaging management consultants. Satisfactory arrangements for this as-
sistance should be a condition of effectiveness of the subsidiary loan agree-
ment (Specific Condition). The cost of this assistance has not been defined
but could be US$25,000 and could be met out of the engineering cost provisions
for the project.
IV. FINANCES
Water Supply and Sewerage
Past Finances
4.01      Income from water supply and sewerage operations has been deteriorat-
ing, as shown below in the financial statements for the last three years.
Past finances are discussed in Appendix M-5 and detailed financial statements
are given in Appendices M-7 and M-8.

- M-7 -
Financing Plan
4.02      Because of low revenues, expansion has been financed by Government
contributions (Col$7.5 million in 1970 and Col$5.3 million in 1971) and by
debt, which amounted to Col$34 million at the end of 1970. Consequently,
the debt service ratio fell from 1.8 in 1969 to 0.6 in 1971.
4.03      The financing plan for the project is based on the premise that the
Empresas will institute the required tariff increases (para. 4.06) and will
not transfer funds generated by the water supply and sewerage services to any
of the other services (General Condition). Other assumptions are set out in
Appendix M-6. The financing plan for 1972-1976 is summarized below.

4.04      The funds required would be made available as follows:
(i)  The Bank loan through INSFOPAL for US$2.22 million (Col$58.0
million) at an assumed interest rate of 7.25% with amortiza-
tion over 21 years after a 4-year grace period;
(ii)  A national loan of Col$37.5 million at an assumed interest
rate of 12%, repaid in equal semi-annual payments over 11
years after a 4-year grace period;
(iii)  The Empresas' contribution of Col$44.3 million, which would
be the net internal resources of the Water Supply and Sewer-
age Division and is expected to meet 30% of total applications
of funds during the project period.
Tariffs
4.05      The Empresas has a history of low tariffs in water supply and
sewerage, although increases have taken place. These tariffs follow a pat-
tern common in Colombia, which consists of varying the fixed monthly charge
according to the assessed property value. The number of categories were
reduced from 25 in 1967 to 6 in 1971, the maximum number recommended by the
National Public Services Tariff Board.
4.06      Present tariffs average Col$0.72/m3 (US$0.14/1,000 gallons) are in-
adequate to provide the funds needed to cover capital and costs of operations.
A new tariff proposes to reduce the number of categories and minimum allow-
ance and to charge all consumers the same price for excess consumption
(Appendix M-9).  Ths average for water supply and sewerage of the new tariff
would be Col$1.13/m (US$0.19/1,000 gal). The new tariff has been put into
effect in May 1972. The tariff will be raised to Col$1.53 in 1973 as a
condition of subsidiary loan effectiveness.
Future Finances
4.07      The water supply and sewerage forecast income statements are sum-
marized below. Projected financial statements are in Appendices M-7 and M-8.

- M-9 -
4.08      The significant revenue increase of 155% between 1972 and 1976 is
due to both the increase in volume of water sold and higher tariffs. As a
result of the project the volume of water sold would increase 84% in the
period 1972-1976, reflecting a 26% increase in production in that period
and gradually diminishing losses. The debt service coverage will be begin-
ning ln 1973 sufficient with a debt service ratio of above 2.0.
4.09      To ensure that earnings are sufficient, an average water supply and
sewerage tariff of Col$1.53/m beginning in January 1973 is a condition of
effectiveness of the subsidiary loan agreement, and rates of return have been
set up as follows (Specific Condition):
1974-1976            5%
thereafter           7%
4.10      The rate of return would be calculated by taking income before
interest as a percentage of revalued average net fixed assets. Revaluation
and tariff review would be done once a year at year's end, using the cost
of living index for workers which the Departamento Administrativo Nacional
de Estadistica (DANE) developed for the Department of Caldas at the last
month of the preceding year. For this purpose, it was agreed during nego-
tiations that the net value of assets in use were Col$115 million as of
December 31, 1972, see Appendix M-18 (Specific Condition).
Telephones
4.11      The Telephone Division provided 74% of the internal cash genera-
tion of the Empresas in 1969 and 93% in 1970. The operating ratio has been
kept at an adequate level and is estimated to be less than 40% in 1971.
4.12      The Telephone Division's historical and projected income and cash
flow statements are shown in Appendices M-12 and M-13 and the assumptions
for the financial projections in Appendix M-6. Total revenues are projected
to increase 69% in the period 1972-1975, reflecting a growth in the nuiber
of telephones and an assumed installation of pulsemetering equipment by the
end of 1972.
4.13      The tariffs will be maintained to provide a minimum annual rate
of return of 8% during 1973-1976 and 11% thereafter on the average net current
value of the telecommunication assets. As for water supply, it was agreed
that the net value of telephone assets as of December 31, 1971 were Col$52
million, as shown in Appendix M-18 (Specific Condition).
4.14      The rate of return would be calculated by a method identical to
the one proposed for the water supply and sewerage fixed assets in para-
graph 4.06.



- M-10 -
4.15      In the period 1961-1965, the Empresas' investments in telephones
were financed by Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson (Stockholm). The debt
totalled US$1.30 million, with an annual interest rate of 8% and an amortiza-
tion schedule ending in October 1972. The arrears payments as of December
31, 1971, were US$0.23 million and the amortization payments to be made in
1972 are US$0.22 million. The Empresas plans to pay the balance due in 1972
and 1973, but written agreements on these payments have not been formalized
with Ericsson. It is a condition of subsidiary loan effectiveness that the
Empresas will either repay or reach a refinancing agreement with Ericsson
(Specific Condition).
Other Services
4.16      The Other Services are street cleaning, solid waste collection, mar-
ketplaces and slaughterhouse. Projected income and cash flow statements
are shown in Appendix M-14, and assumptions for financial projections in
Appendix M-6. These services have been in deficit, with a loss before
depreciation of Col$2.4 million in 1970.
4.17      It has been assumed that the operating ratio, before depreciation,
of these services will fall from 117% in 1971 to 85% in 1976, and that tariff
increases will be made for the markets. Another improvement could be made
by better utilization of the refrigerator/slaughterhouse, now being used at
only 30% of capacity.
4.18      To ensure that the tariffs for these services are adequate, a
covenant was included in the subsidiary loan, that an operating ratio be-
fore depreciation of no more than 85% will be achieved by 1973, and tariffs
to achieve 100% for the remainder of 1972 should be a condition of effective-
ness (Specific Condition).
Consolidated Finances
4.19      Consolidated income and cash flow balance sheet statements are
presented in Appendices M-15 through M-17.
4.20      In 1971, the Telephone Division was the major internal cash generator
of the Empresas, generating 88% of the total. As a result of the tariff in-
crease for water supply and sewerage, this situation will change and the share
of the Water Supply and Sewerage Division in total cash generation will in-
increase from 21% in 1971 to 56% in 1976, remaining at about that level there-
after without significant variation.
4.21      Total net income will increase from Col$0.6 million in 1972 to Col$13.2
million in 1976. Consolidated operating ratio will be maintained at about 50%
from 1973, which is acceptable. The internal cash generation will cover the
debt service no less than 2.0 times from 1973 onwards during the project period.
4.22      The current ratio will be 0.6 in 1972 and no lower than 2.2 after
1975, which shows good recovery of the Empresas' ability to meet its cur-
rent obligations. Debt to total capitalization will be no higher than 29%.



- M-11 -
4.23      In view of the problem caused by the Ericsson loan borrowing would
be limited by a general covenant that consolidated net revenues will cover
maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times (Specific Condition).
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      In addition to the General Conditions applicable to all seven proj-
ects, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the following Speci-
fic Conditions will be included in the subsidiary loan agreement between
INSFOPAL and the Empresas Publicas de Manizales:
(i) an experienced financial manager will be appointed by
December 31, 1972 (para. 3.08);
(ii)  satisfactory arrangements for management assistance will
be a condition of effectiveness of the loan (para. 3.14);
(iii)  an average3water supply and sewerage tariff to yield
Col$1.53/m beginning January 1973 will be established as
a condition of effectiveness of the loan, and the tariffs
will be maintained so as to achieve the following minimum
rates of return, based on a valuation of net fixed assets
of Col$115 million as of December 31, 1972 (paras. 4.06,
4.09 and 4.10);
1974-1976            5%
thereafter           7%
(iv)  the tariff for the telephone services will be maintained
to provide a minimum annual rate of return of 8% during
1973-1976 and 11% thereafter based on a valuation of net
fixed assets of Col$52 million as of December 31, 1972
(para. 4.13);
(v) As conditions of effectiveness of the loan, the Empresas
will be up-to-date in its payments to Ericsson or have
arranged the refinancing of the loan (para. 4.15);
(vi)  telephone pulsemetering equipment will be installed and
functioning by January 1973;
(vii) an operating ratio, before depreciation of 85% will be
maintained for the Other Services in 1973 and tariffs to
achieve 100% in the remainder of 1972 will be a condition
of effectiveness (para. 4.18);
(viii) a consolidated debt service coverage of at least 1.5 times
will be maintained (para. 4.23).



- M-12 -
5.02      With the above Specific Conditions, along with the General Condi-
tions, in Chapter VII of Volume 1, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$2.22 million for a term of 25 years, including a 4-year grace period.

The Chinchina Plant
This new treatment plant started operations in December 1971. It
was designed to treat 1,000 1/sec but the third clarification unit has not
yet been built; hence the plant can treat only 2/3 of its projected capacity.
As the Cajonest minimum flow is only 300 1/sec, there is need to build an
intake on the Chinchina River and take the additional water to the intake on
the Cajones River to complete the 1,000 1/sec needed for the plant. To do
this requires building a tunnel of approximately 150 m directly from the
intake on the Chinchina to the dam on the Cajones. This plant is situated
at the confluence of the Chinchina and Cajones Rivers, 14 km southeast of
Manizales, on the left bank of the Cajones 200 m upstream from its con-
fluence with the Chinchina. This is a compact plant and the equipment was
supplied by PINTSCH-BAMAf A.G. (Butzbach, Germany).
New Distribution System
(i)  Storage:  8 new storage tanks are proposed for the first
stage (H 17 to 24) with a total storage of 30,250 m3. The

ECONCt4IC RETURN CAICULATfON
The econonic return for the project is about 11.4% and will rise
to about 15% if the cost of the existing treatment plant with much excess
capacity is considered a sunk cost.
The calculation considers as benefits the incremental revenues earned
as a result of the project and considers as costs the project costs, its opera-
ting cost and the capital and operating cost of the additional works constructed
after 1975 to utilize the project fully. The cost of making connections is
approximately equial to the connection fees, hence neither their cost nor benefits
enter into the calculation. Operating costs are taken net of depreciation.
The following assumptions have been made for the calculations shown
on page 2 of this Appendix.
(i) The project life is 50 years after the end of the main investment
period.
(ii) The projected volumes sold are shown in Appendix M-2.
(iii) Since at present there is some excess capacity, only 20% of additional
water sold in 1972 and 80% sold in 1973 are attributed to the project.
After 1973 all incremental sales are credited to the project.
(iv) The total volume sold is multiplied by the assumed tariff in each year
discounted by the inflation factor. In this way all benefits are
expressed in constant 1972 prices.
(v) Only the incremental operating costs are charged to the project.
To obtain the operating costs net of inflation, the 1973 operating cost
is divided byl.10, which is thought to be the relevant inflation factor.
The 1974 cost is divided by (1.10)2, and the operating costs thereafter
by (1.10) . The incremental operating cost is then the difference
between these adjusted operating costs and the 1972 operating costs.
(vi)  The costs of work are shown in Appendix M-4 and are converted into
constant 1972 prices by applying the same inflation factor. When
investments aim at improving service to existing customers, the costs
are not charged to the project. The tax component is negligible as
project items are imported free of duty, and as domestic taxes are levied
As is shown in Annex 13, the project has a medium probability of
achieving all objectives. It is therefore thought unlikely that the investment
costs would increase more than 10%, in which case the economic rate of return
would fall to 10.8$. As the publicts acceptance level of rate increases is rated
medium, it is assumed that the drop of incremental revenues would not exceed 20%,
in which case the return would be 8.3%.

Although the tariffs were increased in 1965 and 1970, they were
insufficient to offset the increase in operating costs due to inflation.
As a consequence, the operating ratio was a high 81% in 1971, compared with
67% in 1969.
The internal cash generation decreased from Col$3.7 million in
1969 to Col$2.6 million in 1971, and the debt service coverage fell to o.6
in the same year.
Because of low revenues the Empresas could meet its financial
requirements through (i) borrowing, which totaled Col$34 million at the
end of 1970, (il) goverment contributions of Col$102 million in 1969,
Col$7.5 million in 1971 (see following table):

The INSFOPAL loan was for the purchase of pipe, While no formal
agreement has been reached between the parties, the Empresas plans to
amortize this debt, free of interest, in 1972.
In 1966 the Elpresas began to build the Chinchina treatnent plant,
which was completed in 1971. Its foreign exchange cost (InM 4 million) was
financed through a portion of a loan of IM 35 million granted Colombia by
the Federal Republic of Germany. The conditions of repayment to the German
Kreditanstalt are very advantageous for the Empresass 16 years, annual
interest of 5%, and a commitment charge of 0.25% a year.
The Empresas did not begin to depreciate its fixed assets until
late 1969.
Telephones
Presently 14,500 lines are installed. They do not include the
telephones of the Empresas itself nor 300 public telephones.
There are four classes of subscribers, with distribution as follows:
Conmercial         3,754
Residential        9,750
Official             699
Rural                297
Each subscriber class has four categories, established according
to property valuation, and a different monthly quota per telephone:
First category     Col$40
Second category    Col$30
Third category     Col$20
Fourth category    Col$15
Calls are charged at Col$O.10 each without time limit.
The telephone service has a very low operating ratio, which has
been decreasing frcm 46% in 1969 to 38% in 1971. The internal cash generation
was sufficient during the same period to cover the debt service with a ratio
of no less than 2.0.
The existing debt corresponds to Ericsson and smounted to Col$9.5
million as of December 31, 1970.
Other Services
The Empresas' other services -- street cleaning, marketplaces and
slaughterhouse -- have had very poor operating ratios: 139% in 1969 and
117% in 1971. As this situation is mainly due to low tariffs, it has not
been possible to improve the facilities of these services. In November 1970
the General Manager proposed to the Board that the tenants of the market-
places pay higher rental charges, but the proposal was not accepted. The
refrigerator/slaughterhouse is being used at only 30% of its capacity.
No improvement in this percentage is possible unless cattle are brought to
Manizales from outside.

Revenue
The cmbined wat r and sewage tariff is Col$0.72/m3. A new
tariff yielding Co1$1.13/mr  has been put into effect as of May 1972.
A combined tariff of Col$1.53/m3 will be implemented in 1973 and thereafter
a combined tariff of Coltl.65/m3 has been assumed.
Other revenues for 1971 were also based on first six months'
actuals. The 1972 figure was based on a 12% increase over the 1971 figure,
which was the same as that between 1969 and 1970. The amount for 1973 was
arbitrarily fixed at Col$2.5 million, equivalent to an increase of 19% over
the 1972 figure. For subsequent years annual increases of 12% were assumed.
Operating Tcenses
All operating expenses for 1971 have been cmputed on the yearts
first six months' actuals. Projections of operating expenses include a price
contingency and a general allowance of 5% for unexpected expenses. No price
contingency is applied after 1975.
Labor costs include wages, salaries, fringe benefits and distribute-d
personnel costs of head offices. Labor costs increase with the number of
personnel.
Chemicals and spare parts (maintenance) increase with additional
water produced.
Other operating costs increase with water produced. The 5% tax on
sales paid yearly by the Enpresas to the Municipality is included in these costs
Administrative and general costs increase along with the general
allowance of 5% for unexpected expenses.
Depreciation and Interest
Depreciation has been calculated at 3% on the average annual
revalued gross fixed assets. The revaluation of assets as of December 31, 1970,
follows the methodology recommended by the National Planning Office. Subse-
quent annual revaluation has been made at the rate of 10% a year.
Interest on the proposed Bank loan and the National loan are
capitalized during the period of construction.

Non-Operating Income
Non-operating income remains constant at Col$0.3 million annual.
Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Items
Accounts payable are equivalent to three months' consumption of
supplies.
The [reditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau carried on the books in
Col$ was revalued to reflect the devaluation of the Colombian peso and
the resulting additional payment.
Inventories increase with the water produced.
Accounts receivable are equivalent to 1-1/2 months' billing.
TELEPHONES
Revenues
Revenues have been projected on the basis of 1971's revenue
per line which is assumed to increase 6% p.a. up to 1975 reflecting
historical growth rates. In addition, the introduction of time-limit on
calls increases the total revenues by about 30% in 1973.
Costs
Operating costs and administrative expenses increase with the
number of lines installed, and include an annual price contingency of 10%
until 1975 and a general allowance of 5% for unexpected expenses.
The 5% tax on sales to be paid to the Municipality has been
included in operating costs.
Depreciation
The 5% annual straight-line depreciation has been calculated on
the revalued fixed assets without any residual value.
CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET ITEMS
Investment Program
The investment program has been designed to increase revenues
by installing a Pulsemetering system by the end of 1972 and to meet the

I.  EXISTING WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES
1.01      Neiva, with a population of some 130,000, is the capital of the
predominantly agricultural Department of Huila in southern Colombia. The
city is situated 450 m above sea level, between the central and eastern
chains of the Colombian Andes, and has a mean annual temperature of 21°C.
The Magdalena, the country's largest river, flows past the city.  Water
supply and sewerage are provided by the Empresas Publicas de Neiva, which
is also responsible for garbage collection and other public services (see
para. 3.01).
1.02      An estimated 70% of the population is supplied with water.  There
are 12,800 house connections, 11,700 of them with meters, many of which are
not in working order. The inadequate distribution network consists of 91 km
of pipes (80% with diameters 4 inches or smaller) made of cast-iron, asbestos-
cement and galvanized-steel; the latter is in poor condition due to corrosion.
1.03      Neiva's present water source is the Ceibas River (see Map 3793),
whose minimum observed flow is 3.2 m3/sec, enough to satisfy the city's
water needs up to the year 2000. There are two water treatment plants. The
one that was built in 1948, and modified in 1966 to increase its nominal
capacity to 225 1/sec, is overloaded to 330 1/sec with 20 1/sec bypassed.
This plant was abandoned upon partial completion (in early 1972) of
the new INSFOPAL-built plant, located near the old one but 13 m higher in
elvation. INSFOPAL has also built a new intake, 1 km upstream from the old
one, and a new 6.8 km transmission line with a capacity of 400 1/sec.
1.04      The sewerage system serves approximately the same area as that
supplied with water, and about 80% of the houses with water supply also
have sewer connections. The system is the combined type, carrying storm-
water as well as sewage. Raw sewage and storm-water drain into the Mag-
dalena and Ceibas Rivers and into the Toma, a stream that runs through the
middle of the city. While it may be necessary in the future to cease the
discharge into the Ceibas and Toma, final discharge into the Magdalena
could continue indefinitely.
1.05      The Empresas has under construction new sewerage mains and inter-
ceptors, including the interceptor along the Magdalena's left bank, and has
also started a program of sewer cleaning and maintenance with newly imported
equipment. Small contractors are building extensions to the sewerage
system.
1.06      Maintenance is poor in both the water distribution and sewerage
systems. To remedy the situation, the Empresas needs additional personnel
and some technical assistance. A meter maintenance program also needs to be
instituted and meter repairing improved.

II. THE PROJECT
Neiva's Water Supply and Sewerage Program
2.01      With the new supply facilities already built and the expansion of
the water treatment plant, Neiva's water requirements for the immediate
future will be met. The distribution network and sewerage need to be ex-
panded to reduce the deficit in areas served. In the longer term, it is
essential to put the Empresas on a sound financial and operational footing
so that it can meet the water supply and sewerage requirements of this fast
growing city.
Description of Project
2.02      The project would consist of improvements and extensions of the
intake, conduction line and water treatment plant to make it possible to
treat 700 1/sec. The new plant would be completed by adding two higlh-rate
filters, making changes in the flash mixer and flocculation basins, addinlg
another settling tank and increasing storage capacity form 5,000 m3 to 10,000
m3. A pumping station would be built to take 300 1/sec from the old canal
to the new plant. A new transmission line (30 inches diameter) from the plant
to the city would be built.
2.03      In the city, extensive additions would be made to the distribution
system, including house connections. Although a large number of additionial
sewers and drains are needed, only the most urgent would be constructed. Addi-
tional works would be built later as funds permitted.
2.04      Appendix N-1 gives a more detailed description of the project.  Growtl
of the city's population and statistics on its water supply system, including
consumption and demand, past and forecast, are in Appendix N-2 and Chart 6604.
The project is intended to meet the estimated demand and will give an internal
economic return of 9% as calculated in Appendix N-3 and discussed in greater
detail in Chapter V of Volume 1.

feasibility study. Technical contingencies are 20% for the water supply works
and 30% for the sewerage works. Engineering and administrative costs are 10%
of the construction sub-total. The price contingency is discussed in para-
graph 4.15 of Volume 1.
Project Execution
2.07      The Empresas' consultants are Salgado-Piedrahita-Escallon of Bogota,
and are acceptable to the Bank. They have been engaged to design the project
and would supervise project construction. The design work is being financed
by a loan from the Colombian Development Fund (FONADE), while the cost of
construction supervision would be covered by the proposed Bank loan.
1/   Costs are at 1971 values, with an exchange of Col$20 to US$1.



- N-4 -
2.08      A three-year construction period, 1972 through 1974, is expected.
Project design would carry on into June 1972 and major construction would take
place in 1973 (see Chart 6378).
III. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization
3.01      The proposed beneficiary, Empresas Publicas de Neiva, is an autonomous
entity which provides water supply, sewerage, street cleaning and garbage col-
lection, and operates a slaughterhouse and marketplaces in Neiva. Created in
1959 by a legislative act of the Municipal Council, the Empresas started opera-
tions in November 1964 and was reorganized in 1970 by Municipal Decree.
3.02      The Board of Directors of the Empresas is composed of five members:
the Mayor (who serves as President of the Board), the Personero Municipal
(the legal representative of the municipality), the Chief of the Municipal
Planning Department, and two members of the Municipal Council. The latter
two members are elected for two-year terms.
3.03      The Board has extensive powers, including the power to set tariffs
(subject to the approval of the National Public Services Tariff Board),
approve contracts in accordance with Colombian laws and the Empresas' statutes,
and borrow money for financing projects of the Empresas.
o.04      The Empresas' General Manager is elected by the BQard.  He is assisted
by an Administrative Manager and a Technical Manager. The present incumbent is
new and his managerial ability untested.
3.05      The Empresas has two main Divisions (see Clart 6377):
(i)  Administrative, which is responsible for accounting,
billing and collection, and for operating the market-
places, slaughterhouse, garbage collection and street-
cleaning services.
(ii)  Technical, which operates the water supply and sewerage
services, subsequently referred to as water supply and
sewerage division.
Staff and Management
3.06      The efficiency of the Empresas' staff and the performance of manage-
ment and operating functions - particularly accounting, internal control and
maintenance - need to be improved (see paras. 3.07 - 3.11). The Empresas re-
cognizes that qualified consultants should be employed to study these defici-
encies and make recommendations for overcoming them. Contacts have already



- N-5 -
been made with local affiliates of international firms, and it was agreed during
negotiations that an acceptable contract for management assistance would be a
condition of effectiveness of the subsidiary loan agreement (Specific Condition).
3.07      The Empresas' employees total 163:  65 in water supply and sewerage;
70 in street cleaning, garbage collection, slaughterhouse and marketplaces;
and 28 in administrative functions. The number of employees is adequate,
but staff efficiency should be improved. As a first step towards this goal,
a thorough study of personnel - functions, requirements and available supply -
should be part of the management study. There is a labor union in Neiva with
which the Empresas maintains a good relationship.
Billing and Collection
3.08      Bills are processed by the IBM Computer Center in Bogota, to which
the Empresas sends data on water consumption each month. Bills for water
supply, sewerage and garbage collection are distributed house-to-house by
the F.mpresas' meter readers, who are also supposed to report on defective
meters anld connections.  This method of distribution does not work efficient-
ly because of lack of training of the readers and bad organization.
3.09      Bills are paid at local banks or at the Empresas' head office.
There is a strictly enforced policy of disconnection if private consumers
don't pay their bills. Free service is provided to municipal consumers,
equivalent to about 4% of the total water consumption.
3.10      The Municipality collects a tax for street cleaning but does not
reimburse the Empresas, which renders the service.
Accounting, Inventories and Audit
3.11      There are a number of serious deficiencies in accounting procedures,
and the internal control of operations is extremely weak. Accounting is on
a cash basis, no depreciation is charged on fixed assets, and inventory
records are poorly kept and inconsistently valued. Electronically processed
billing and collection control should be used more efficiently. The consultants
would recommend improvements, and would also detenmine whether further data
processing applications are necessary in such areas as inventory and budgetary
controls, payrolls, general and cost accountancies. Balance sheet accounts
would be reclassified and in some cases adjusted to show more accurately the
Empresas' financial condition.
3.12      Audit of the Empresas is performed by an appointee of the Municipal
Council and by an auditor of the National Government. To ensure that the
information in financial statements is accurate and presented in accordance
with current commercial accounting practice, the Empresas would employ
commerical auditors for audit purposes, beginning with the accounts for 1972
(General Condition).

IV. FINANCES
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE
Past Finances
4.01      The financial performance of the water supply and sewerage division
is bad. Because of low tariffs, the operating ratio averaged 80% in the last
three years and internal cash generation covered the debt service only one
time. In 1971, the Empresas received a Col$2.2 million Government contribution.
Past financial statements for 1969-1971 are summarized below and are detailed
in Appendix N-5.

Total debt of the Empresas on June 30, 1971 was Col$1.5 million.
Financing Plan
4.02      The financing plan is based on the premise that the Empresas will
increase tariffs as described in paragraph 4.05 and will not transfer funds
generated by the water supply and sewerage services to any of its other
services (General Condition). Further assumptions are set forth in Appendix
N-6.
4.03      The financing plan for 1972-1974 is summarized below.  Detailed
financial tables are in Appendices N-7 and N-8.

resources of the water supply and sewerage division
and is expected to be 19.4% of total applications of
funds during the period covered by the financing plan;

(iv) loans from national and local banks, already arranged,
for Col$5.3 million (US$0.24 million).
Tariffs
4.05       The tariff structure for water supply and sewerage is shown in
Appendix N-9. The average tariff for 1971 was Col$0.73/m3 (US$0.14/
1,000 gal). The Empresas proposes to increase the average tariff by mid-1972
to Col$1.30/m3 (US$0.25/1,000 gal). Additional increases will be needed in
1973, to Col$1.40, and in 1974, to Col$1.50.
Future Finances
4.06      The projected income and cash-flow statements for water supply and
sewerage are shown on Appendices N-17 and N-8 and are sumarized below.
Assumptions are given in Appendix N-6.

Rate of Return                       0.8%   2.6%   3.3%   5.4%
4.07      The revenue increase of 78% between 1972 and 1974 is due to both
the increase in volume of water sold and a higher tariff (see para. 4.05).
4.08       In 1971, the new water treatment plant built by INSFOPAL was trans-
ferred to the Empresas. The historical cost of this plant is Col$16 million,
revalued at Col$22.0 million. The two parties have not yet fixed the condi-
tions of repayment. A supplemental letter to the subsidiary loan agreement
would provide for an agreement between the parties which does not jeopardize
the Empresas future finances, and that in no case shall the length of the pay-
ment period be less than 17 years (not including grace), it shall not commence
before 1975, and interest and other charges on the outstanding amount shall not
exceed six percent per annum. For purposes of financial projections the above
minimum conditions have been assumed.
4.09      To ensure satisfactory finances, agreement was reached during negotia-
tions that a water supply and sewerage tariff calculated to yield Col$l.3o/m3
wiU  be inplemented as a condition of effectiveness of the subsidiary loan
agreement, and that the following minimum rates of return will be achieved
(Specific Condition):
1973-1977             3-1/2%
Thereafter            6%



- N-9 -
4.10      The rate of return would be calculated by taking income before
interest as a percentage of revalued average net fixed assets. Tariff and
revaluation reviews will be made annually in January using the cost-of-living
index for workers for Neiva of the Departamento Nacional de Estadlslica
(DANE) for the preceeding year. It was agreed during negotiations that the
net value of these assets as of December 31, 1971 was Col$39.2 million, see
Appendix N-18 (Specific Conditions).
Other Services
4.11      These services include street cleaning, garbage collection, market-
places and the slaughterhouse. While their total revenues have been historical-
ly hiigher than those of water supply and sewerage (57% of total revenues in
1969 and 53% in 1970), these services, especially street cleaning, have re-
gistered only marginal profits, because of low tariffs, and because the Muni-
cipality withholds the municipal tax for street cleaning (see para. 3.10).
Past financial statements for these services are given in Appendix N-14.
4.12      Assumptions for financial projections are presented in Appendix
N-6.  lt has been assumed that with adequate tariffs, the Empresas will succeed
in obtaining from the operations of these services an internal cash generation
sufficient for the renewal or improvement of the existing facilities, i.e., a
yearly program of investments of Col$3 million beginning in 1975. The conso-
lidated operating ratio of these services should therefore drop to 65% in 1975.
4.13      To ensure that the tariffs of these services remain adequate, it
was agreed during negotiations that the tariffs will be maintained at
such a level that they can cover costs and minimum cash needs, by means of an
operating ratio (excluding depreciation) of no more than 70%, exclusive of
the municipal tax (Specific Condition).
4.14      The Empresas owes the Municipality Col$1.8 million for garbage
collection equipment and for a payment the Municipality made to the Instituto
de Credito Territorial on the Empresas' behalf. The Empresas has informed
the Bank that this debt will be cancelled by the Municipality. Cancellation
of this debt would be a condition of effectiveness of the subsidiary loan
agreement (Specific Conditions).
Consolidated Finances
4.15      Consolidated income, cash-flow and balance sheet statements for
the Empresas are presented in Appendices N-15 through N-17.
4.16      In 1971 almost half the contribution to internal cash generation
was made by the Other Services. Thereafter, due to the required tariff
increases and additional volume produced, the water supply and sewerage divi-
sion progressively increases its proportion of internal cash generation to
77% in 1976.



- N-10 -
4.17      The Empresas' consolidated financial position would improve pro-
gressively from 1972. The consolidated operating ratio would fall from 70%
in 1971 to 53% in 1976, and stabilize at around 50% thereafter. Internal
cash generation covers debt service by a factor of at least two during the
period 1972-1979. The current financial position is reflected in the current
ratio, which improves from 0.5 in 1971 to 2.4 in 1976. The indebtedness of
the Empresas remaitns at an acceptable level with a debt as percentage of
capitalization no higher than 44% during the period 1972-1979.
4.18      After project construction, borrowing will be limited by a general
covenant that debt will not be incurred unless net cash generation for the
previous year covers maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times (Specific
Condition).
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RRCOMMENDATIONS
5.01      In addition to the General Conditions applicable to all seven
projects, assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the fol-
lowing Specific Conditions will be included in the subsidiary loan agree-
ment between INSFOPAL and the Empresas Publicas de Neiva:
(i)  An acceptable contract for management assistance would
be signed as a condition of effectiveness of the loan
(para. 3.06);
(ii)  An agreement on settlement of the debt between the
two parties (para. 4.08);
(iii)  An average water supply and sewerage tariff to yield
Col$1.30/m3 will be established as a condition of
effectiveness of the loan and the tariffs will be
maintained so as to achieve the following minimum rates
of return, based on a valuation of net fixed assets of
Col$39.2 mll1ion as of December 31, 1971 (paras. 4.09
and 4.10);
1973-1977               3-1/2%
Thereafter              6%
(iv)  The tariff for other services including street cleaning,
markets and slaughterhous will be maintained to achieve
an average operating ratio of 70% before depreciation
beginning in 1972 (para. 4.13);



- N-11 -
(v) The municipality will cancel the debt owed to
it by the Empresas as a condition of effectiveness of
the subsidiary loan (para. 4.14);
(vi) A debt service coverage of 1.5 would be maintained
(para. 4.18).
5.02      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$1.07
million for a term of 25 years including a four-year grace period.

MEDIUM SIZED CITIES WATERSP-PLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECTS
EMPRESAS PUBLICAS DE NEIVA
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE DIVISION
PROJECT FACILITIES
Existing Facilities
1.        Treatment Plant (old)
Neiva uses water from the Ceibas River, which has a minimum flow
of 3.2 r43{sec. The intake is located 4 km from Neiva at an elevation of
520 m above sea level.  A canal, mostly unprotected, carried the water (+
300 1/sec) to the old treatment plant.
This plant was built in 1948 for 150 1/sec; in 1966 it was
modified to increase its nominal capacity to 225 1/sec. It is now overloaded
to 330 1/sec and a bypass is used to add 20 1/sec. Upon completion of the
new plant, the old one will be abandoned.
2.        New Treatment Plant
INSFDPAL has built a new plant, with a first-stage capacity of
400 lsec.
INSFOPAL has also built a new intake at an elevation of 533 m above
sea level, located about 1 km upstream from the old intake. A transmission
main with diameters varying from 20 to 30 inches carries 400 1/sec to the new
plant. This plant consists of the following:
(i)   Flash mix.  There are now two units equipped with vertical
agitators. Each tank has a volume of 32 m3, providing a
detention time of 80 seconds.
(ii) Flocculators. There are three units equipped with horizontal
agitators. The total volume is 900 in3 and the detention time
is 37 minutes for a flow of 400 ltsec.
(iii) Settling Basins. Fbr the first stage INSFOPAL3built three
settling basins, each with a volume of 2,000 m3.
(iv)  Filters.  There are four double-cell filters, 4.25 x 8.5 m.
7he filter medium is a layer of sand 0.70 m thick, effective
size 0.50, and uniformity coefficient 1.6 supported by layer
of gravel of 0.45 m. The filters are equipped with surface
wash. Wash water is supplied from an elevated storage tank.

3.       Eiating Distribution System
The distribution network, which is inadequate, consists of pipes
of cast-iron, asbestos-cement and galvanized steel. The cast-iron and
asbestos-cement pipes are in good condition; the galvanized pipes are
corroded and leak.
4.        Eidsting Sewerage System
The sewerage system is the combined type, with interceptors along
the rivers that flow across or near the city. The Empresas is building new
sewerage mains, by employing local contractors. Operation and maintenance
have been deficient, but thebmpr.aas has recently imported maintenance
equipment and started a cleaning and maintenance program.
New Facilities
1.        Water Treataent Plant
the new plant constructed by INSPOPAL has to be oompleted and expanded
to treat from 700 to 800 1/sec; it is necessary to:
(i)   complete the construction of the two filters that INSFDPAL
left incomplete and increase the rate of filtration to at
least 4 gpm/sq ft;
(ii) install rate-controllers and pipes adequate for increased rates
of filtration;
(iii) install adequate chemical-dosing equipment;
(iv) build a pumping station to take the water from the old canal
to the new plant;
(v) improve the old canal's carrying capacity and reduce its leakage;
(vi) build 5,000 m3 additional storage capacity to increase capacity
to 10,000 m3.
2.        New Distribution System
The quantities of distribution system piping to be constructed under
the project and the costs are listed below.

INTERNAL ECONOMIC RETURN
The internal economic return for the project is 10%; if the cost
of the recently-built water treatment plant were excluded, the return would
be 16.4%.
The internal return calculation considers as benefits the incre-
mental revenues earned as a result of the project, and considers as costs
the project cost, its operating cost and the capital and operating cost of
the additional works constructed after 1974 to fully utilize the project.
Operating costs are taken net of depreciation.
The following assumptions have been made for the calculations
shown on page 3 of this Appendix:
(i) The project life is 50 years after the end of the main
investment period;
(ii) the projected volumes sold are shown in Appendix N-2;
(iii) since at present there is no excess capacity, all in-
cremental water sold is attributed to the project;
(iv) the total volume sold is multiplied by the tariff in
force at the end of 1972, Col$1.30/m3. In this way
all benefits are expressed in constant 1972 prices;
(v) only the incremental operating costs are charged to
the proJect. To obtain the operating costs net of
inflation, the 1973 operating cost is divided by 1.10,
which is thought to be relevant inflation factor. The
1974 cost is divided by (1.10)2, and the incremental
operating cost is the difference between these adjusted
operating costs and the 1972 operating costs;
(v) the costs of works are shown in Appendix N-4 and are con-
verted into constant 1972 prices by applying the same
inflation factor. When investments aim at improving
service only to existing'customers, the costs are not
charged to the project. The tax component is negligible
as project items are imported free of duty and no domestic
taxes are levied.



Appendix N-3
Page 2 of 3 pages
An is shown in Annex 13, the project has a medium probability
of achieving all objectives. It is therefore thought unlikely that the
investment costs would increase more than 10%, in which case the internal
economic rate of return would fall to 9.6%. As the public's acceptance
level of rate increases is rated medium, it is assumed the drop of
incremental revenues would not exceed 20%, in which case the return would
be 7.8%. The rates of return are low, due to the large cost of the new
treatment plant being charged to the first year of the project.

Water Supply and Sewerage Division
Because of the poor management of its water supply and sewerage
operations,  the Empresas has a high 35% to  40% unaccounted-for water.
The present rates for water supply and sewerage were approved
by the Superintendency of Economic Regulation by a resolution of July
28, 1965. There are 22 categories, based on property values, a number
much higher than the 6 categories recommended by the Nati3nal Planning
Office.  The average combined tariff in 1971 was Col$0.73/m.
Starting from 1966, the economic condition of the Empresas has
been getting weak. During the last four years the operating ratio was
about 80%.
With an annual internal cash generation of about Col$1.0 million,
the Enpresas has not been able to finance its expansion program and has
obtained loans for the purpose from national financial institutions. As
of June 30, 1971, its total debt was as followsA

The total investments made by the Empresas in its water and
sewerage systems from 1966 are as follows:
Col$ million
1966                           3.1
1967                           0.5
1968                           0.4
1969                           1.0
1970                           0.9
1971 (first semester)          0.9
Total                    6.8
In 1971 the Epresas received a Col$2.2 million government
contribution for waterworks.
Because of low internal cash generation, the debt service
coverage ratio was around 1.0 during the last three years, The Expresas
is not depreciating its fixed assets. In 1971 the new water treatment
plant built by INSFOPAL was transferred to the Epresas; its historical
cost is Col$16.0 million, revalued at Col$31.0 million. The two parties
have not yet fixed the conditions of repayment.
Other Services
The street-cleaning, garbage-collection, market places and
slaughterhouse operations have provided more than 50% of the Eipresast
total revenues(57% in 1969 and 53% in 1970). Street-cleaning operations
have no direct income since the municipal tax for street cleaning is
collected by the Municipality and not refunded to the E1presas,  who
renders the service. The market places and slaughterhouse have profit-
able operations with adequate operating ratios. In 1970 the operating
ratio was 54% for the market places and 72% for the slaughterhosle. The
internal cash generated by these services was used by the npresas to
offset the deficit for street cleaning and also enabled the company to
make sme investments in new facilities (Col$5.0 million during the last
three years). In 1971 the E presas contracted a debt of Col$0.3 million
from local banks for the importation of cleaning machines. This debt will
be amortized in three equal payments of Col$0.1 million in 1971, 1972 and
1973. The Epresas has an outstanding debt (Col$1.8 million) with the
Municipality of Neiva, which is carried forward from various years and is
made up as follows:
one garbage collector (machine)              Col$1.2 million
One pick-up and one Jeep                     Col$0.1 million
Payment by the Municipality on behalf
of the E&Vreeas to Inatituto de Credito
Territorial for acquisition of land         Col$0.5 million
Total         Col$1.8 million



Appendix N-5

The Empresas reported that the Municipality has decided to
write-off this debt, but no agreement has been written.
Consolidated Finances
Other assets of the Empresas are composed of shares from:
(i) the Compania Telefonica de Neiva S.A. (85,920 shares)
of Col$10 nominal value;
(ii) the Conpania Centrales Electricas (683 shares) of
Col$1,000 nominal value.
These investments provide annual dividends of about Col$200,000.

WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE DIVISION
Revenues
It has been assumed that the combiged tariff for water supply
and sewerage will be increased to Col$1.30/mJ in the second semester of
1972. The average combined tariff for 1971 was Col$0.73 and will be kept
during the first semester, which gives an average tariff of Col$1.02/m'
for the total yeaK. The tariff would be increased in 1973 to Col$1.40/m3
and to Col$1.50/*-l in 1974 and subsequent years.
Other revenues for 1971 (Col$0.2 million) were also based on
first six months' actuals, and have been assumed to increase with the
number of connections.
Operating Costs
All operating expenses for 1971 have been computed on the
year's first six months' actuals. Operating expenses have been pro-
jected with annual price contingency of 10% and an annual general
allowance of 5% for unexpected expenses. No price contingency is applied
after 1975.
Labor costs include wages, salaries, fringe benefits and
distributed personnel cost of head offices. Labor costs increase with
the number of personnel.
Chemicals and spare parts (maintenance) increase with additional
water produced.
Other direct costs and administrative and general costs increase
with the population served.
Depreciation
Depreciation msm calculated at 3% on the average annual revalued
gross fixed assets. The revaluation of assets as of December 31, 1970,
follows the methodology recommended by the National Planning Office.
Subsequent annual revaluation has been made at the rate of 10% a year.
In 1971 the new plant built by INSFOPAL was included in the investment
of the year for its revalued cost (Col$31.0 million). The plant was
revalued subsequently at the same rate as the other assets.



Appendix N-6
Interest Charged to Income Statement               Page 2 of 3 pages
Interest charged to income statement are those corresponding
to loans from FONADE, Banco de Bogota and Banco Popular. These loans are
described in Appendix N-5. Interest includes the assuwed 6% paid to
INSFOPAL on the book value of the new plant (Col$16.0 million). It has
been asstumed that the amortization of this debt will be in 17 years and
that the debt service, including interest,  will begin in June 1975.
Interest on the proposed Bank and National loans are capitalized during the
period of construction.
Non-Operating Income
Non-operating income remains constant at Col$0.2 million annual.
Cash-Flow Items
Connection fees increase with the number of connections. The
statistical cost per connection of Col$500 has been assumed to be paid
by the new consumers in two years.
Accounts receivable are equivalent to one month's billing.
Inventories are assumed to be equal to 6 months' consumption
of materials and spare parts.
Accounts payable are equivalent to three monthst purchases.
Other Services
Revenues were calculated assuming that the operating ratio would
be progressively reduced in order to be less than 70% in 1975. The result-
ing annual increases in revenues are as follows:
Street Cleaning      Market places       Slaughterhouse
1971/2               25%                                       10%
1972/3               20%                                       17%
1973/4               38%                  _                    20%
1974/5               12%                  5%                    8%
In order to obtain these revenues the Tmpresas will have to
increase tariffs and perhaps look for other sources of income, such as
transfer of the municipal tax for street cleaning from the Municipality
to the Empresas.
Operating costs for 1971 are based on the first six months'
actuals.
Street-cleaning and slaughterhouse operating expenses increase
with the city's population. These expenses include a 10% price contingency
and 5% allowance for unexpected costs.



Appendix N-6
Page 3 o-f 3 pages
Operating costs of the market places increase 10% a year.
Depreciation was calculated at 5% on the revalued fixed
assets as of December 31, 1970.
It has been assumed that the Etpresas will not invest in other
services activities until 1975, when the internal cash generation (if the
assumed tariff increases have been applied) will enable the company to
invest Col$3.0 million a year.

EDPRESAS PUBLICAS DE PEREIRA
I. EXISTING WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES
1.01      Pereira, a city of 230,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the
Department of Risaralda in the Cauca Valley, about 200 km north of Cali.
Situated about 1,500 m above sea level in hilly terrain on the south bank
of the Otun River, the city has a temperate climate with an average annual
temperature of 21 C. Water supply and sewerage are provided by the Empresas
Publicas de Pereira, which is also responsible for electric power, telephone
and various other municipal services (see para 3.01).
1.02      An estimated 80% of the population is supplied with water through
about 23,000 house connections, 22,000 of them metered. The meters are read
regularly but repaired only when drastic changes in the pattern of water con-
sumption are observed.
1.03      Pereira's source of water is the Otun River (see Map 3788), which
has a minimum flow in excess of 6 m3/sec. This is more than twice the city's
estimated water needs in the year 2000. The river originates in the Andes
Mountains about 40 km. east of the city in a forested watershed controlled by
the Empresas.  The area traversed by the river is largely uninhabited.  A 4-km
canal conducts the vater to two conventional treatment plants (see Appendix
P-1 for details), which have a combined capacity of 370 I/sec. An additional
70 1/sec are supplied by bypassing the plants, taking the water from the grit
chamber, and returning it to the plant effluent prior to chlorination.
1.04      The water supply is limited in quantity because of insufficient
treatment and distribution capacity, resulting in occasional rationing of
water in some parts of the city and low pressure in others. Quality of the
water is generally acceptable, even though some unfiltered water is added to
the treated water and supplied to customers; however, all the water is
chlorinated.
1.05      The distribution system consists of about 200 km of pipe, ranging
in diameter from 2 to 30 inches. About 30% is 1-inch galvanized steel pipe,
easily corroded, which should be replaced. Another 30% is 3-inch galvanized
steel and asbestos-cement pipe.
1.06      The sewerage system serves roughly the same area as that supplied
with water and has approximately 20,000 house connections. The system is a
combined one, carrying storm-water as well as sewage, and consists of about
160 km of sewers built of asbestors-cement pipe (8- to 33-inch diameters)
and 2 km of concrete box culverts (1.2 to 2.0 m).
1.07      This combined sewerage system is inadequate for Pereira's needs.
The sewers usually discharge waste into the nearest water course. Although
these polluted streams and creeks traverse the city, flooding and human con-
tact do not constitute any great problem as they flow in deep, ravine-line
cuts.



- P-2 -
1.08      Receiving waters for all of Pereira's sewage are the Otun and
Consota Rivers. As their water is used only for irrigation, for example
sugar cane, sewage treatment is not required for the foreseeable future.
1.09      Operation and maintenance of the water distribution and the
sewerage systems are very good. However, operation of the water treatment
plant is inadequate and should be improved, and a program of meter main-
tenance should be instituted.
1.10      To reduce the serious water shortage, the Empresas has started
work on expanding the capacity of one of the two existing treatment plants
(Canceles) from 250 a/sec to 600 1/sec. This work, financed by an IFI-AID
loan, is expected to be completed early in 1972.
II. THE PROJECT
Pereira's Water Supply and Sewerage Program
2.01      The project is the first stage of Pereira's master plan for water
supply and sewage disposal. The original feasibility study for the project
was undertaken by Salgado-Piedrahita-Escallon of Bogota and Reynolds, Smith
and Hill of Jacksonville, Florida. The facilities of this first stage would
be constructed from 1972 to 1975.
2.02      The second stage of the master plan, consisting of additional water
treatment capacity, and extensions and additions to the water distribution
and sewerage systems, would be constructed as required bv increased popula-
tion and water demand, but not before the early 1980s.
Description of Project
2.03      The project (first stage) would consist of:
(i) expansion of the second existing treatment plant
(Patterson) from 120 1/sec to approximately 300
1/sec capacity;
(ii)  construction of a new water treatment plant of
560 1/sec capacity;
(iii)  construction of 9,000 m3 capacity of water storage;
(iv)  construction of water transmission and distribution
mains;
(v) improvements to the existing water distribution
system;



- P-3 -
(vi)  purchase of equipment for meter testing and maintenance
and leak detection;
(vii)  construction of the Egoya combined interceptor sewer
and main collecting sewers;
(viii) purchase of sewer maintenance equipment;
(xi)  consultants' study of computerized accounting and
inventory control.
2.04      Appendix P-1 gives a more detailed description of the project.
Growth of the city's population is projected to be 5% annually and the
population served will increase from 81% at present to 90% by 1980.
Statistics on the water supply system, including consumption and demand,
past and forecast, are in Appendix P-2 and Chart 6376. The project is
intended to meet the estimated demand and will give an internal economic
return of 13% as calculated in Appendix P-3 and discussed in greater detail
in Chapter V of Volume 1.
Cost Estimates
2.05      The estimated costs of the project are summarized below 1/.  The
annual investment program is given in Appendix P-4.

- P-4 -
2.06      The estimates are generally based on the engineers' estimates con-
tained in the feasibility report and suppliers' quotations.  The engineers
unit cost estimates have been verified by using the unit cost of recent
similar work in Pereira and other neighboring cities in Colombia. Additionally,
the unit costs were compared with unit costs tabulated by INSFOPAL. Technical
contingencies of 10% on imported equipment and 20% on civil engineering works
reflect the degree of uncertainty associated with the respective items of the
project. The cost of design and supervision includes funds for the design of
facilities originally included in this project but postponed for financial
reasons. This cost is estimated at 10% of the estimated construction cost of
the project as initially submitted by the beneficiary. The price contingency
is discussed in paragraph 4.15 of Volume 1.
Project Execution
2.07      The preparation of final designs should commence immediately in
order to keep the project on schedule. The Empresas has already engaged
local engineering consultants, Salgado-Piedrahita-Escallon, who are accept-
able to the Bank. These consultants will need the help of an expert in water
treatment plant design. The amount for the foreign expert will not exceed
US$50,000 or about 1-1/2% of the cost of the project.
2.08      Four years of construction from 1972 to 1975 are expected.  The pro-
ject schedule is shown in Chart 6375.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization
3.01      The Empresas Publicas de Pereira was created in March 1926 to pro-
vide power, telenhone, slaughterhouse, market and water services for the city.
It became an autonomous enterprise in 1957, and exists in the same form today.
In 1959 the Empresas became responsible for the sewerage system, and the
watershed, and in 1969 for solid waste collection.
3.02      The Empresas' Board of Directors has seven members.  The mayor is,
ex officio, President. Two members are appointed by the Municipal Council.
Three members are appointed by the mayor from a list of six submitted by
civic organizations. One member is appointed by the mayor from two lists of
three names each submitted by the Chamber of Commerce and the National Federa-
tion of Mlerchants. Directors are appointed for two years, beginning in January,
with appointments staggered to ensure continuity of the Board.
3.03      The Board has extensive powers, including the power to fix tariffs
within the limitations approved by the National Public Services Tariff Board,
approve contracts and borrow money.



- P-5 -
3.04      The day-to-day operation of the Empresas is administered by the
General Manager, who is appointed by the Board of Directors. It is expected
that the present General Manager, who is experienced and very capable will
continue to serve in his present post.
3.05      The Empresas is organized into two Divisions (Chart 6374):
(i)  The Technical, which is responsible for water supply and
sewerage, power, forestry, telephones, and solid waste
collection. This Division has a planning and design sec-
tion which performs all the engineering work for the various
departments.
(ii)  The Financial/Administrative, which is responsible for all
financial and commercial activities of the Empresas, such
as billing, collection, bookkeeping, budgetary control,
cost accounting, data processing, demand forecasting and
for personnel, miscellaneous services and the operation of
the public market and slaughterhouse.
The organization is adequate, and no changes are necessary to carry out either
the project or the expanision planned in the power and telephone sectors.
Staff Management
3.06      The Empresas employs 865 people, of whom 123 are in the Water Supply
and Sewerage Division. This amounts to 0.73 employees per 1,000 persons
served by the Water Supply and Sewerage Division. This ratio is low compared,
for example, with similar utilities in the USA. However, the Division is well
operated, and only a few additional staff will be needed to operate the ad-
ditional water treatment plant, and the proposed water meter maintenance pro-
gram.
3.07      The general manager is assisted by an excellent financial/administra-
tive manager. The position of the manager in charge of the Technical Division
has recently been filled with a competent engineer.
3.08      Middle management and employees consist of qualified, dedicated
people. One exception to this is the present operator of the water treatment
plant. During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances that the water
treatment plant superintendent will have additional training and treatment
plant operation will be reviewed periodically (Specific Condition).
3.09      Employees' salaries and benefits are competitive with those of
private industry in the city. In-house training is conducted and the turn-
over of staff is small, with over 70% of employees working for the Empresas



- P-6 -
for three years or longer. Hourly employees are unionized. Management -
union relations are good, as exemplified by the absence of strikes during the
past decade.
Billing and Collection
3.10      Billing and collection are satisfactory.  Bills are processed by
the Empresas' computer and distributed monthly. The computer is old and
should be replaced. Consumers receive one monthly bill for all the services
rendered to them by the Empresas. The policy of disconnecting service for
non-payment is strictly enforced and less than 5% of the bills are outstand-
ing longer than three months. Governmental agencies are billed, but no
attempt is made to collect. Total billing to these entities represents
about 3% of the Empresas' total operating income. Bills are delivered by
the Empresas' employees and payment is made to several authorized banks in
the city and the Empresas' office.
Accounting, Inventories and Audit
3.11      The present manual accounting system is satisfactory.  Accounts are
separated by services. It is suggested, however, that the system be improved
following the guidelines of the Pan American Health Organization. In addition,
it is recommended that the presentation of financial statements be simplified
for better understanding by the management and the Board of Directors. The
Empresas has cost accounting and budgetary control system. Some improvements
should be made concerning, particularly, defining the sources of profit and
data processing.
3.12      The level of inventories is high, Col$11.5 million on December 31,
1971. Late last year the Empresas' management decided, subject to approval
by the Board, to reduce the inventory by Col$5 million. A further reduction
to about Col$3 million would be desirable. A computarized inventory control
system is also desirable.
3.13      The Empresas has a fiscal auditor appointed by the MIunicipal Coun-
cil to insure that the accounts are properly administered and to permit a
detailed review of the Empresas' financial activities. Thus, internal control
is good. In 1971 the Empresas engaged an external auditor for annual audits.
This auditor, Ulysse Martinez & Cia. of Bogota, is acceptable to the Bank.
3.14      The Empresas recognizes the problems mentioned in paragraphs 3.11
and 3.12. An obligation that it will engage management consultants is a
condition of effectiveness of the subsidiary loan agreement (Specific
Condition).

WATER SUPPLY AND SEWJERAGE
Past Finances
4.01       Income from water supply and sewerage operations has been deteri-
orating as shown below in the summarized financial statements for the past
three years. Past finances are discussed in Appendix P-5, financial assump-
tions in Appendix P-6. Detailed financial statements are given in Appendices

the debt service coverage fell from 6.8 in 1969 to 1.2 in 1971 due to an
insufficient internal cash generation which also decreased sharply from
Col$3.4 million in 1969 to Col$1.7 million in 1971.  Details of outstanding
debt are given in Appendix P-5.
Financing Plan
4.03       The financing plan during the years 1972-76 is based on the assump-
tion that funds generated by the water supply and sewerage division will not
be transferred to any other division (General Condition) and tariff increases,
as discussed in paragraph 4.05, will be implemented.

_ P-9 _
Tarif fs
4.05      In 1971 the combined water and sewerage tariff averaged Col$0.5/m.3
(IJS$0.14T ner 100 gallons) , only 63% 3f the tariff approteed in April 1969 by
the Board. but not totally applied for political reasons fsee Appendix P-9).
This was the first increase in rates since 1967.  If approved tarif's were
fully applied, they would still be inadequate to provide the funds necessary.
Tarlffs will have to be raised to yield the following combined average revenue:
1975 and
Year                      1973        1973       1974      thereafter
Average revenue (Col$/m3)  1.30         1.45       1.60       1.60
At the time tariffs are raised, thev should be revised in accordance with the
guidelines of the National Public Services Tariff Board, i.e., categories
shoul.d be reduced to six or less, and minimum allowances and excess rates
should be the same for all users.
Future Finances
4.06      The water and sewerage estimated income statements are summarized
below. Detailed financial statements are in Appendices P-7 and P-8.

4.07      The increase in revenues of 131% from 1972 to 1976 Is based on in-
creases in both tariffs and sales. Production and sales are expected to
increase 63%.. During the some period the rate of return -would average 3.9%.
This low tHgure has been computed using preliminarv revaluations of assets
tiich still have to be ,rerifted by the consultants to the satisfaction of
the Empresas and the Bank.  If a change irn asset values results, a corres-
ponding ad'ustment will be rade in the rate of return requ'rements (para.
4.08). The debt service coverage ratio will average 2.2 wThich is satisfactory.

in 1972 of Col$1.30/m3 will be a condition of effectiveness of the sub-
sidiary loan agreements, and a rate of return of 40% should be maintained
except for 1975-1977 when 3% should be achieved (Specific Condition):
4.09      The rate of return would be calculated by taking income before in-
terest as a percentage of revalued average net fixed assets. Revaluation and
tariff review would be done yearly, using the cost of living index for workers
developed by Departamento Adminlstrative Nacional de Estadistica (DANE) for
the Departamento de Risaraldo. it was agreed during negotiations that the
base would be the revalued fixed assets as of December 1971 of Col$85.7
million, see Appendix P-18 (Specific Condition).
Power
4.10      Historical and projected income and cash flow statements are shown
in Appendices P-10 and P-11. Past finances are discussed in Appendix P-5
and assumptions for financial projections are in Appendix P-6. The power divi-
sion provides the largest proportion of the Empresas' income: 44% in 1969,
47% in 1970 and 46% in 1971. Operating ratios for power (without deprecia-
tion) during the same period were fairly high, ranging between 68% and 78%,
primarily because of the high cost of personnel. The rate of return on re-
valued fixed assets was about 6% in 1971, a low percentage for power services.
The power division's outstanding debt on December 31, 1971, was Col$0.5 mil-
lion. Details are listed in Appendix P-5.
4.11      Revenues are expected to increase with growth in demand and with
tariff increases of 5% in 1972, 15% each in 1973 and 1974, and 20% in 1975.
These tariffs will enable the Empresas to finance an investment program of
Col$42 million during the period 1972-76 and to refund its present debt of
Col$6 million to the other services.  The 1972 deficit of the division will
be covered by a Col$10 miliion suppliers' credit.
4.12      Tariffs should be maintained to provide the following minimum annual
rates of return on the average net current value of power assets, as revalued
on December 1971 at Col$63.8 million (Specific Condition).
1973                            1%
1974                            4%
1975 and thereafter             8%
The rate of return would be calculated as in paragraph 4.09, based on a value
for fixed assets of Col$63.8 million as of December 31, 1971 (Specific
Condition).
Telephones
4.13      Historical and projected income and cash flow statements are shown
in Appendices P-12 and P-13.  Past finances are discussed in Appendix P-5,
and assumptions for financial projections are in Appendix P-6. The telephone



- P-11 -
division provides the second largest proportion of the Empresas' income: 22%
in 1969, 20% in 1970 and 19% in 1971. Operating ratios (about 50%) and debt
service coverage (about 3.0) were satisfactory during that period. The
telephone division had an outstanding debt of Col$7.0 million on December
31, 1971. Details are listed in Appendix P-5.
4.14      Revenues are expected to increase with growth in demand and in-
creases in fixed charges of 68% in 1973, 10% in 1974 and 10% in 1975. In
addition, impulse charges will be introduced in 1973, which is expected to
increase revenues from calls by about 30%. These tariffs will enable the
Empresas to finance an investment program of Col$41 million. The 1972 deficit
of the division will be covered by suppliers' credit.
4.15      Tariffs should be maintained to provide the following minimum annual
rate of return on the average net current value of telephone assets as re-
valued on December 1971 at Col$48.0 million (Specific Condition).
1973                        6%
1978 and thereafter         8%
The rate of return would be calculated as in paragraph 4.09, based on a value
for fixed assets of Col$48.0 million as of December 31, 1972 (Specific
Condition).
Other Services
4.16      Other services include markets, the slaughterhouse and solid waste
collection. The projected income and cash flow statements for these ser-
vices are in Appendix P-14 and assumptions for financial projections are
in Appendix P-6. These statements indicate that "other services" barely
meet expenses. The operating ratio from 1969 to 1971 varied from 113% to
87%. It has been assumed that tariffs increases will be made and that the
operating ratio (before depreciation) of these services will fall to 83% in
1975.
4.17      To insure that the tariffs for these services are adequate, a cov-
enant should be included in the subsidiary loan, agreement that an operating
ratio before depreciation of not more than 85% by 1973 will be achieved and
an increase in tariffs be made to reach at least 95% for the remainder of
1972 is a condition of effectiveness (Specific Condition).
Consolidated Finances
4.18      The Empresas' capacity to meet its current financial requirements
will improve in the future. This is shown by the current ratio which will
rise from 1.7 in 1973 to 3.5 in 1976 and 4.7 in 1979.



-P-12-
4.19      It is expected that internal cash generation will provide a con-
solidated debt service coverage of not less than 3.0 after 1972 and that
debt as percentage of capitalization will remain at a low level of no more
than 23%. The subsidiary loan agreement will limit borrowing by a covenant
that total earnings for the previous year should cover total maximum future
debt service at least 1.5 times (Specific Condition).
4.20      Empresas' assets also inclue (i) Col$1.6 million shares of the
Central Hidroelectrica de Caldas (CHEC), (ii) Col$6.2 million invested in
reforestation and erosion control works in the Rio Otun watershed. Other
liabilities are mostly composed of social security reserves and appropriated
surplus accounts.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      In addition to the General Conditions applicable to all seven pro-
jects, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the following
Specific Conditions will be included in the subsidiary loan agreement
between INS?OPAL and the Empresas Publicas de Pereira:
(i)  Review periodically, jointly with INSFOPAL and the Bank, the
operation and maintenance of the water treatment plant and
the performance of operating persoinnel and, if necessary, take
actions to improve operation and maintenance (para. 3.08);
(ii)   An average water supply and sewerage tariff to yield
Col$1.30/m3 will be established as a condition of effec-
tiveness of the loan and the tariffs will be maintained
so as to achieve a 4$ minimum rate of return, except for
3% in years 1975-77, based on a valuation of net fixed
assets of Col$85.7 million as of December 31, 1971
(paras 4.08 and 4.09):
(iii) Electric power tariffs will be set to provide the following
minimum rates of return, based on a valuation of net fixed
assets of Col$63.8 million as of December 31, 1971 (para 4.12):
1973                       1%
1974                       4%
1975 and thereafter        8%
(iv) The tariff for the telephone services will be maintained to
provide the following minimum annual rates of return, based
on a valuation of net fixed assets of Col$48.0 as of December
31, 1971 (para 4.15):
1973 to 1977               6%
1978 and thereafter        8%



- P-13 -
(v) Tariffs for the other services, including markets, slaughter-
house and garbage collection, will be maintained to achieve
an operating ratio before depreciation of not more than 85%
from 1973 and 95X for the remainder of 1972 as a condition
of effectiveness (para 4.17).
(vii) A debt service coverage of 1.5 would be maintained (nara. 4.19).
5.02      With the above Specific Conditions, along with General Conditions,
in Chapter VII of Volume 1, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$2.14 million for a term of 25 years including a 4-year grace period.

EMPRESAS POBLICAS DE PERKIRA
WATER SUPPLY AND SEIERAGE DIVISION
PBDJECT FACILITIES
Existing Treatment Plants
The existing intake is from the head race of the Libare hydro-
electric power plant on the Otun River.
The aqueduct is 4.3 km long and consists of a 1.5 m x 1.5 m canal,
three tunnels and one 100 cm steel-pipe siphon, which limits capacity to
2,800 I/sec.   Estimated demand will not exceed this amount until after the
year 2000.
From the raw-water aqueduct, the waterpasses through a grit chamber.
This grit chamber was designed for one plant only and is not functioning
properly at present flows. It will be replaced.
The water then reaches the Patterson and Canceles plants via splitter
box and open concrete channel. The Pattoron plant was constructed in 1936;
it consists of one flash mixer, two upflow hopper-type flocculation tanks, two
straight-thru-flow sedimentation tanks, and four rapid sand filters. All
control instruments and chemical feed units are out of order and will be
replaced as part of the project. At the same time, two new flocculators will
be added, the existing flocculators converted to sedimentation basins and the
filters converted Lo dual-media filters to increasecapacity from 120 1/sec
(1900 gpu) to 300 1/sec (4760 gpm).  Eisting and future unit loadings are
as follows:
unit          Existing           Fhture
1.  Flash mix            70 sec             29 sec          detention
2.  Flocculation         53 min             25 min          detention
3. Sedimentation         80 min             55 min          detention
4.  Filters         5 m/h (2 gpm/ft2) 12 m/h (5 gpwft2)  filter rate
With the exception of the detention time in the sedimentation basins,
future loadings are within accepted design values. Difficulties due to this
short detention time are not expected because the raw water's quality is
usually very high. During the months of August and September 1971, turbidities
greater than ten ppm were experienced ten times only, and all but 14 times
turbidities were less than 6 ppm. It is reported that these occurrences are
of short duration only. obnsequently, an occasional floc carryover to the
filters is acceptable.
To determine whether sedimentation basins are really necessary, or
whether flocculation and filtration will be sufficient for the proposed new
plant, the consulting engineer is conducting a study and tests at the Canceles
Plant.



Appendix P-1
Page 2 of 4 pages
The Canceles Plant was constructed in 1951. It consists of one
flash mixer, two flocculators with mechanical agitators, two end-around-flow
sedimentation tanks, and four rapid sand filters. As in the Patterson
Plant, instruments and chemical feed units are mulfunctioning and are being
replaced. The filters are being converted to dual-media filters and the
influent chamnel is being modified to permit increased flows. The modifications
will increase capacity from 250 1/sec (3970 gpm) to 600 1/sec (9520 gpm).
Present and future loadings are as follows:
Unit         E&isting            Future
1.  Flash mix            62 sec            26 sec          detention
2.  Flocculation         46 min            19 min          detention
3.  Sedimentation      216 min             90 min          detention
4. Filters        5mJSi  (2 gpm/ft2)  12 m/h (5 gpmfft2)   filter rate
The modification of the Canceles Plant is finances by A.I.D. and
the National Government and the work will be finished early in 1972.
The existing plants are followed by a common chlorination facility
and aerator. Because chlorination is followed by aeration, it is ineffective.
As part of the project, aeration will be eliminated and the chlorinator
replaced with a unit serving all three plants.
3Three treated-water concrete storage tanks with a combined capacity
of 1250 m are located adjacent to the two existing plants and will remain in
use in the future.
New Treatment Plant
The new treatment plant proposed will be the first, 560 1/sec
capacity stage of a plant designed to treat 1700 lsec ultimately. The new
plant will be located adjacent to the existing Patterson Plant. Its construction
will include certain units common to all three plants. The construction
program will include:
Capacity
1. Grit Chamber                  1500 1/sec      (for all three plants)
2. Pre-Chlorinator               1500 1/sec      (for all three plants)
3. Raw Water Conduit             1700 1/sec      (for new plant only)
4. Cbntrol Bailding
5. Flash Mix (1)                  560 1/sec
6. Flocculators (4)               560 1lsec
7. Sedimentation (4)              560 1/sec
8. Filters (4)                    560 1/sec     12 m/h (5 gpm/ft2)
9. Pbst Chlorination (1)         1500 1/sec      (for all three plants)
The plant will be provided with all necessary chemical feed equipment, filter
control and instrumentation. Chemical treatment will be the same for all three
plants: pre-chlorination, alum for flocculation, lime for pH control, post-
chlorination.



Apendix P-1

The new plant will be connected to the nearby Cbrea distribution
storage tank by a 30 inch main.  Due to the elevation difference between the
new plant and the Canceles Plant, filter effluent from the latter can be
used for filter backwashing in the former.
New Distribution System
The quantities of distribution system piping and their costs are
as follows:
Size (inches)       Length (meters)        Cbst (0b1$)
6                   3,400                    680,000

10                   2,200                    680,oo0
12                   b,000                  1,680,000
14                     900                    430,000
16                     800                    480,000
18                  1J,700                  1,220,000
24                   4,ooo                  4,800,000
30                    ,zoo2                 1J110,000
Total                   21,300                 12,010,000
The costs are net construction costs, 1971 prices and include all accessories.
The costs of house connections and meters are not included in the project
costs because customers pay these costs at the time of installation.
The distribution network has been designed by the Hardy-Cross Method,
using a digital computer. A C-value of 120 was used for new asbestos-cement
pipe. Fbr existing pipes, C-values of 100 and less have been used, depending
on pipe size, because the slightly corrosive water affects the smaller
galvanized steel pipes much more than the asbestos-cement pipes.
Maximum (static) pressure was set at 90 psi, minimum pressure at
25 psi.
Distribution Storage
The distribution system has been separated into four pressure zones,
each served by its own storage tank. The tanks also act as pressure breaks.
One tank of 4000 m3 was constructed in 1970; three more with a combined
capacity of 9000 m3 would be built as part of the project.
Normal storage in a system that is entirely gravity fed, well designed
and has no unusual featunrs, should be about 15% of maximum daily demand.
To this, a fire demand allowance should be added. The maximum 1980 daily
demand in Pereira is estimgted to be 112,500 m3. 15% of this would be 17,000
m3, 4,0o0 m3 more than the existing and proposed distribution storage of
13,000 m3.



Appendix P-1
Page 4 of 4 pages
With the treatment plants close to the distribution system, plant
storage may be considered as distribution storage. Including 11i,20 aJ of
plant storage, there will be an excess of 7,250 m3 of storage, which would
provide a fireflow of 500 lsec for a period of 4 hours, which is more than
adequate for a city of Pereira's size and type of construction.
Sewerage System
The sewers to be constructed would include about 600 meters of the
Egoya combined interceptor sewer, plus various urgently-needed collector mains.
Equipment
Equiprent to be purchased under the project would include:
1. Water meter test bench and auxiliary equipment;
2. Leak detection equipment;
3. Sewer rodder;
4. Sewer main cleaning equipment.
Timing
The facilities to be provided are urgently required to prevent
further deterioration of the water service. The Empresas has been unable
during the past four years to satisfy demand. Cbnstruction of treatment
plant and distribution mains will permit adequate water service to Pereira's
inhabitants. Construction of the sewers will also solve the most pressing
problem.

ECONO0MIC RETURN
The economic return for the project is 13.1%.
The return calculation considers as benefits the incremental
revenues earned as a result of the project, and considers as costs the project
cost, its operating cost and the capital and operating cost of the additional
works constructed after 1975 to utilize the project fully.  The cost of making
connections is approximately equal to the connection fees, hence neither their
cost nor their benefits enter the calculation. Operating costs are taken net
of depreciation.                                                         e
The following assumptions have been made for the calculations
shown on page 2:
(i)  The project's life is 50 years after the main investment
period ends.
(ii) The projected volumes sold are shown in Appendix P-2.
(iii)  9ince there is some excess capacity at present, only 25% in
1972 and 50% in 1973 of incremental sales have been attributed
to the project. All incremental sales after 1973 are credited
to the project.
(iv)  The total volume sold is multiplied by the tariff in force
at the end of 1972, i.e. by Col$1.30/m3. In this way all
benefits are expressed in constant 1972 prices.
(v)  Only the incremental operating costs are charged to the
project.  To obtain the operating costs net of inflation, the
1973 operating cost is divided by 1.10, which is thought to be
the relevant inflation factor. The 1974 cost is divided by
(1.10)2, and the operating costs thereafter by (1.10)3. The
increnental operating cost is then the difference between
these adjusted operating costs and the 1972 operating costs.
(vi)   The costs of works are shown in Appendix P-4 and are converted
into constant 1972 prices by applying the same inflation
factor. When investments aim at improving service only to
existing consumers, the costs are not charged to the project.
The tax component is thought to be negligible as project items
are imported free of duty, and no domestic taxes are levied.
Relatively large follow-up investments have to be made from
1976 to 1981 to meet growing demand.
As is shown in Annex 13, the project has a hi h probability of
achieving all objectives. It is therefore thought unlikely that the invest-
ment costs would increase more than 5%, in which case the economic rate of
return would fall to 12.5%. As the public's acceptance level of rate increase
is rated medium, it is assumed the drop of incremental revenues would not ex-
ceed 20%, in which case the return would be 9.5%.

COMMENTS ON PAST FINANCES
INOOME STATEMENTS (see Appendices P-7, P-10, P-12, P-14 and P-15)
Sales
The amount of water sold increased steadily until 1967, when the
treatment plant reached its capacity. Sales have remained constant ever
since. Losses of water remained constant at 27% during those years, which
is an acceptable performance.
Water rates were raised in 1967 and have increased from an average
of Cbl$ 0.65 in 1968 to Col$ 0.75/m3 in 1971, because the number of customers
paying the minimum rate increased without a corresponding increase in water
supplied. The current water tariff is shown in Appendix P-9.
The most recent tariff increases for electric power, telephone and
other services took place in 1968.
Non-Operating Income
Non-operating income includes sale of materials and other income
not directly related to operations, such as the sale of old equipment, rental
of tools etc. Non-operating income is not taken into consideration in the
financial rate of return and operating ratio calculations.
General and Administrative E&penses
General and administrative expenses are allocated to the different
divisions in accordance with the revenues generated by each division.
Operating Ratio
The operating ratio, for the water and sewerage division based on
income before depreciation was 59% in 1969, 70% in 1970 and 84% in 1971,
indicating that the division's revenues have not kept pace with growing
operating costs. Operating ratios for the other divisions are the following:
1969     1970     1971
Pbwer                      72%      68%       78%
Telephone                  51%      49%       56%
Other Services            112%      88%       95%



Appendix P-5

Depreciation
Assets were revalued in 1971, using the expected life of assets
recommended by Regulacion 12 de Regulacion Ebonomica (1966) and the cost of
living index for workers developed by Departamento Administrativo Nacional
Estadistica (DANE). Water and sewerage division assets are listed below:
Average Gross      Accumulated    Depreciation
Fixed Assets       Depreciation   as % of Average

1968                      12.9                 2.7             21

* Revalued
The difference between revalued and non-revalued depreciation as
percentage of average revalued and non-revalued gross fixed assets is due to
adjustments made to (i) the book records of assets after completion of the
field inventory and (ii) the replacement costs of assets in operations.
CASH FIOW STATEMENTS (See Appendices P-8, P-11, P-13, P-14 and P-16)
Bad Debts
An annual allowance for bad debts of private industrial and
commercial consumers is included in general and administrative costs. Govern-
mental bills are not collected.
Internal Cash Generation
Internal cash generation is broken down into income before depreciation,
connection fees, and non-operating income.
Oollection of water connection fees has been suspended, pending
a court decision, but is expected to be reinstituted in the near future.
Inventories
In the past, ratio of inventories to consumption was too high because
of a relatively large amount of equipment and stores no longer useful to the
Enpresas.
Cash
The cash position of the water and sewerage division has not been
satisfactory during the past two years, and in 1971 an estimated cash deficit
of Col$ 8.4 million was covered by loans from the power and telephone divisions.
The consolidated cash position of the Empresas is satisfactory however.

BALANCE SHEET STATEMENTS (see Appendix P-17)
Gross Fixed Assets
At the end of 1971 the total revalued gross fixed assets of the
water and sewerage division amounted to Col$ 159.5 million, i.e. 45% of the
total Empresas' assets, versus 32% before revaluation (see depreciation).
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are net of provision for bad debts. On December
31, 1970 the provision (Cbl$ 2.8 million) represented 26% of the total
receivables (Col$ 10.8 million).

Revenues
Revenues are from billings only. Water and seweragi charges averaging
Col$O.75/m3 in 1971 are assumed to increase 73% to Col$1.30/m  for the second half
of 1972. Additional increases of 11.5% to Col$1.45/m', and 10.3% to Col$1.60/m3
are assumed for 1973 and 1974, respectively. After 1974, average tariffs will
remain at the same level.
operating Costs
All operating expenses for 1971 have been computed on the years' first
six months' actuals.
Projections of all operating expenses include an annual price contingency
of 10% until 1975 and a general allowance of 5% for unexpected expenses.
The cost of labor is projected to 1979 with the following additional
assumptions:
- the number of employees will increase gradually from 123 in
1971 to 167 in 1979;
- fringe benefits and other labor costs (overtime, holidays,
workers, compensation, temporary help, etc.) will average 85%
of direct labor costs, according to statistical data for the
past three years;

The costs of chemicals are projected to increase with the water
produced.
The costs of power will be very small, due to the absence of
pumping stations.
The costs of materials, others and administrative and general,
based on 1970 figures, are projected to increase with the population served.
Unpaid services invoiced to public entities are charged to general
costs, without affecting revenues.
Taxes are paid to the Municipality, and they amount to 7.5% of
total revenues.
Income before depreciation does not include either connection fees
and non-operating income or interest. Non-operating income is projected to
increase from Col$0.4 million in 1970 to Col$0.6 million in 1979. Connection
fees are shown in the cash flow statements.
Cash Flow Items
Connection fees are projected assuming a charge of Col$200 per
connection.

Revenues
In accordance with the Empresas expansion program, the number of
telephones is projected from the 1971 ratio of 4.9 per 100 persons to 7 per
100 persons in 1979 (in 1971, the highest ratio in Colombia was achieved in
Medellin with 12.1 telephones per 100 population).

During 1971, the Empresas built 4,400 additional lines with a
Siemens' credit. To meet future demand, the Enpresas has an investment
plan, following a study made by consultants, which provides for new lines
and replacement of some older ones.
Monthly revenues per telephones are projected, based on 1970
actuals, as follows:
--------------- -- ----Col$/Telephone/Month- - ------------ ____

Revenues from public telephones has been assumed to remain at the
same level as 1970 because the number of individual and commercial telephones
increase.
The fixed charges rate increases by 67.7% in 1973 and 10% in 1974
and 1975.
The 30% increase in impulses revenues in 1973 reflects the change
from calls with no time-limit to the 3 minutes, impulse system. The sub-
sequent (10%) increases from 1974 and 1975 are due to changes in costs per
inpulse.
Operating Costs
Direct and indirect costs are based on 1970 actuals and are pro-
jected to increase according to the following factors:
Unpaid services invoices to public entities are charged to general
costs, without affecting revenues.

During the years 1973, 1974 and 1975, productivity improvements
are expected due to replacement of 70% of the old lines (distribution system)
and equipment.
A tax representing 7.5% of total revenue is paid to the Municipality.
Non-operating income is projected to increase gradually from
Col$0.3 million in 1971 to Col$0.8 in 1979.
Cash-Flow Items
Increases in customers' deposits are projected assuming a charge
of Col$300 to new customers.
For purpose of the projections, it has been assumed that connection
fees will not vary between 1972 and 1979. Inventories increase Col$0.1
million a year. Accounts payable are assumed to remain at their 1971 level
which is high. Accounts receivable are assumed to be equal to 3 months'
sales.
POWER DIVISION
Revenues
Power consumption (92.1 megawatt-hours in 1970) is assumed to
increase 5% per year to 161.4 megawatt-hours in 1979. Corresponding
per capita ccnsumptions are 434 and 489 kwh/person/year for 1970 and 1979
respectively.

During the years 1973, 1974 and 1975, productivity improvements
are expected due to replacement of old undergound lines.
Services to the city (operating costs), which include street
lighting and power supplied to public entities, are assumed to increase with
power produced.
Power purchased is the difference between gross demand and power
generated by the Empresas. The latter is assumed to decrease from 91.8
megawatt-hours in 1970 and 86.0 in 1973 and remain at that level until 1979,
by reducing the amount of water taken from Rio Otun, to assure a sufficient
supply of water for the water treatment plant which uses the same intake
channel carrying water to the hydro-electric power generating plant.

A tax representing 5.5% of total revenue is paid to the Municipality.
Non-operating income is projected to increase gradually from
Col$O.l million in 1971 to Col$0.3 million in 1976 and remain at the same
level the following years.
Cash-Flow Items
The present inventory level has been assumed to be high enough
to enable the Empresas to get through 1972 without purchases for its power
operations. Consequently inventories decrease of Col$2.9 million in this
year. Thereafter an annual increase of Col$0.1 million has been assumed.
Accounts receivable are equal to 3 months of sales.
OTHER SERVICES DIVISION
Revenues
Market revenues are projected to increase 10% per year, according
to the terrs of present leases.
Slaughterhouse revenues are assumed to increase with the population,
sales to other towns, and moderate increases in prices during the years
1971 to 1975. After 1975, increases are due to population growth.

Operating Costs
Operating costs are based on 1970 actuals and are projected to
increase with population (5% per year) and inflation (10% per year)
during the years 1971 to 1975 and only 5% per year the following years. All
operating costs include a single 5% increase to compensate for administrative
contingencies.
Investments
Annual investments are projected, according to cash generation,
to provide for a total increase in new assets of Col$14.8 million during
the years 1971-1979, to take care of future demand and to replace old equip-
ment.
Consolidated Balance Sheet
Deferred revenues and others have been assumed to remain constant
over the period of the projections.

EMPRESAS MUNICIPALES DE TULUA
I. EXISTING WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES
1.01      Tulua, serving a rich agricultural area in the Department of Valle
del Cauca, has about 80,000 inhabitants. It is situated 90 km northeast of
Cali at 300 m above sea level and has a mean annual temperature of 24°C.
The Tulua River runs through the city. Water supply and sewerage, along
with telephone and other public services, are provided by the Empresas
Municipales de Tulua.
1.02      About 74% of the city's population is supplied with water.  Of the
8,800 house connections, all except 300 have meters but many of them are not
in working order. The distribution system is inadequate, unable to satisfy
even the average demand.  There are 75 km of pipes (85% with diameters 4
inches or smaller), including 5.6 km of galvanized-steel pipes smaller than
4 inches which need to be checked to see if they need to be replaced because
of corrosion.
1.03      Tulua's water supply is limited in quantity but fair in quality.
There are two water sources, the Tulua River and wells (see Map 3792). Water
from the river, whose minimum observed flow is 3.8 m3/sec, is channelled
to the Empresas' water treatment plant (capacity 90 1/sec, see Appendix T-1)
and the Tulua Power Company's hydroelectric station through a 3.5-km canal.
1.04      Groundwater seems ample.  The sedimentary rocks in the valley
floor have excellent aquifers as confirmed by test-pumping data from the
existing wells. One well that has been in operation since 1965 is produc-
ing an average of 84 1/sec and another an average of 70 1/sec. Both these
wells pump directly into the water distribution system; both have deficien-
cies in construction with respect to well-finishing, type of screen and lo-
cation of the pumps. Analysis indicates that the water needs chlorination
only.
1.05      The sewerage system, a combined one carrying both storm-water and
sewage, serves about the same area as that supplied with water. About
7,700 houses have sewer connections. Sixty percent of the sewage discharges
into the Tulua River and the remainder into the Morales River. These rivers
are used for irrigation only. The pollution load is approaching their ab-
sorptive capacity, and therefore sewage treatment will have to be considered
soon in a later project.
II. THE PROJECT
Tulua's Water Supply and Sewerage Program
2.01      The program would utilize more groundwater and abandon the more
expensive surface water. The water supply system could then be expanded



- T-2 -
annually to keep pace with the growth of the city's population and water
demand. As funds permitted, sewerage and drainage works would be extended
to serve the entire urban area, and sewage treatment would eventually be
introduced. The original feasibility study for the water supply and sewerage
project was undertaken in 1968 by Salgado-Piedrahita-Escallon (Bogota) and
Reynolds, Smith and Hill (Jacksonville, Florida).
Description of the Project
2.02      The project would include construction of three new wells and
improvements of two of the existing ones. The treatment plant would con-
tinue in operation until the new wells were finished (1973) and then would
be abandoned. The water laboratory located at the plant would continue in
operation and would be provided with more and better equipment. It is in-
tended to get 125 1/sec from each of the three new wells. Storage would be
provided at the site of the treatment plant using the existing reservoir
(2,300 m3) and building 7,200 m3 of additional storage capacity.
2.03      In the city, additions would be made to the water distribution
network, including house connections. Sewerage and drainage works would be
limited to main collectors to carry the sewage outside the urban area. Lat-
eral sewers in areas lacking them would be built later as funds permit.
2.04      Appendix T-1 gives a more detailed description of the project.
Growth of the city's population is projected at 5% per year and population
served increasing from 60,000 in 1971 to 116,000 in 1980. Statistics on
the water supply system, including consumption and demand, past and forecast,
are in Appendix T-2 and Chart 6388. The project is intended to meet the
estimated demands and will give an internal economic return of 8% as calcu-
lated in Appendix T-3 and discussed in greater detail in Chapter V of
Volume 1.
Cost Estimates
2.05      The estimated cost of the project are summarized below. 1/  The
annual investment program is given in Appendix T-4.
1/   Costs are at 1971 values, with an exchange rate of Col$20 to US$1.

2.06      The project cost estimates were made by the consultants and
corrected or adjusted by the Empresas.  Technical contingencies are 20%
for water supply and 30% for sewerage works.  Engineering and administra-
tion costs are 10% of the construction subtotal. Price contingency is dis-
cussed in paragraph 4.15 of Volume 1.
Project Execution
2.07      The present consultants, Idesco Ltd. of Bogota, are acceptable
to the Bank. They have been engaged to design the project and would super-
vise construction. The design work is being financed by a loan from the
FONADE, while the cost of construction supervision would be covered by the
proposed Bank loan.
2.08      A four-year construction period, 1972 through 1975, is expected.
Project design would carry into June 1972 and major construction would take
place in 1973-75 (see Chart 6603).

III. BENEFICIARY
Organization
3.01      The proposed beneficiary, Empresas Municipales de Tulua, is an
autonomous entity which provides water supply, sewerage and telephone
services, and operates a slaughterhouse and market in Tulua. Created in
1942 by Municipal Decree, the Empresas has undergone several reorganizations
and in 1965 obtained full autonomy.
3.02      The Empresas' Board of Directors is composed of six members:  two
are elected by the Municipal Council (one from a list presented by the Bank
Association of Tulua and the other from a list presented by the Chamber of
Commerce) and four are Municipal Council members. The Board has extensive
powers, including the power to fix tariffs within the limitations imposed
by the National Public Services Tariff Board, and to approve contracts.
3.03      The General Manager is appointed by the Board for a two-year term.
The present General Manager, who joined the Empresas in 1965, has performed
satisfactorily and will probably continue in his position.
3.04      By resolution No. 71 of December 22, 1960, the Municipal Council
created the "Oficina de Valorizacion" and made the Empresas responsible for
administering it. This office administers a fund for the construction of
sewerage and road projects. Users are taxed according to the benefits they
will receive from the projects, and the taxes are used to finance construc-
tion.
3.05      The Empresas' organization chart is shown in Chart 6387.  The
entity suffers from an inadequate organization, as discussed below.
Staff and Management
3.06      Most of the Empresas' operations are centralized under the General
Manager. The only activities with some autonomy are the water supply and
sewerage operations and maintenance, for which the Technical Manager is re-
sponsible, and the recording of accounts and preparation of financial state-
ments, performed by a competent Accountant. Purchases, inventories and ad-
ministration of the slaughterhouse, market, telephones and reforestation
are headed by poorly qualified personnel who report directly to the General
Manager. He exercises direct control over all these activities.
3.07      Since 1965, the Empresas has maintained a staff of 138, 39 of them
in water supply and sewerage activities. The salaries paid by the Empresas
are similar to those of the municipal employees. There is a labor union in
Tulua, with which the Empresas maintains a good relationship.



- T-5 -
3.08      The Empresas' operation and maintenance programs are very poor and
there are also a number of deficiencies in administration. The Empresas is
aware of this situation. It was agreed during negotiations to take steps
to correct it and obtain the assistance of consultants. (General Condition).
Billing and Collection
3.09      Bills are prepared with an old billing machine.  The consumers
receive two bills monthly: one for water supply and sewerage, the other for
telephone service. Bills are distributed by the Empresas' house-to-house
collectors, who are also supposed to report on defective meters and connec-
tions but do not carry out this function effectively. Census of consumers,
zoning, codification of house connections, and meter reading procedures are
either lacking or deficient.
3.10      The Empresas provides free water supply, sewerage and telephone
services to entities of the Municipality. The value of the water supplied
to these entities is estimated at 5% of total production.
3.11      Bills are paid at local banks or at the Empresas' head office.
While there is a strictly enforced policy of disconnecting for private con-
sumers for non-payment of bills, this policy suffers from the inefficient
meter-reading procedures mentioned above.
3.12      Revenues from the marketplace are collected monthly, on a daily
fee basis as stipulated in the contract between the market tenants and the
Empresas. Revenues from the slaughterhouse are collected daily.
Accounting and Inventories
3.13      Although the general accounting records are well kept, the account-
ing system is not an efficient management tool. There are no manuals that
show the classification of accounts and explain the accounting procedures.
Cost accountancy, budgetary control and internal control are non-existent,
particularly concerning the payment of salaries, wages and suppliers' in-
voices. Although a physical inventory is performed once a year, it is done
carelessly and inefficiently.
3.14      Audit of the Empresas is performed by an appointee of the Municipal
Council.  The Empresas employs commercial auditors, Touche Ross, Rodriguez
and Vega, Cia, who are acceptable to the Bank.  The Empresas would continue
to employ commercial auditors (General Condition).
3.15      The commercial auditors included recommendations on the above
mentioned deficiencies in their 1970 report, but thus far no improvements
have been made by the Empresas.  Satisfactory provision for the assistance
of management consultants would be a condition of effectiveness of the
subsidiary loan agreement (Specific Condition).

IV. FINANCES
Water Supply and Sewerage
Past Finances
4.01      Even with the tariff increase of 1968, revenues produced by water
supply and sewerage services were not sufficient to cover the operating
costs, as shown in the financial statements for the last three years. Past
finances are discussed in Appendix T-5, and detailed financial statements
are given in Appendices T-7 and T-8.

4.02      Because of low revenues, no investments other than a feasibility
study financed by FONADE, were possible during 1969-1971.
Financing Plan
4.03      The financing plan for the project is based on the premise that
the Empresas will establish tariffs as described in paragraph 4.09 and will
not transfer funds generated by the water supply and sewerage services to
any of the other services (General Condition). Other assumptions are set
forth in Appendix T-6. The financing plan for 1973-1976 is summarized
below.

4.04       The funds required would be made available as follows:
(i) The Bank loan through INSFOPAL for US$1.16 million
(Col$29.6 million) at an assumed interest rate of 7.25%
with amortization over 21 years after a four-year grace
period;
(ii)  A National loan of Col$21.1 million including Col$1 million
to be received in 1972 not reflected in the above 1973-1976
financing plan at an assumed interest rate of 12%, repaid
in equal semi-annual payments over 11 years after a four-
year grace period; and
(iii)  The Empresas' contribution of Col$20.4 million would be
the net internal resources of the water supply and
sewerage division and is expected to meet about 28% of
total applications of funds during the period under con-
sideration.



- T-8 -
4.05      The internal cash generation includes revenues from the "Oficina
de Valorizacion" for Col$4.6 million (see 3.04).
Tariffs
4.06      The Empresas has a history of very low tariffs in both water
supply and sewerage. The tariffs are established on the basis of a fixed
charge which varies according to the assessed property value. Water supply
and sewerage tariff remained constant from 1962 to 1968. A new tariff was
approved in 1968 but was put into effect only in January 1969. Another
tariff increase was adopted in August 1971 which included fixing a minimum
volume of 25 m3 for all categories, except for an official category (45 m3),
increasing the number of categories from 3 to 4 by segregating commercial and
industrial categories, and introducing the billing of sewerage as a percent-
age (40%) of water bills (formerly 10% of the assessed property value). The
Empresas is applying this new tariff in three steps, reaching the full value
in August 1972, when it will average Col$1.02/m3, including sewerage.
Future Finances
4.07      The Water Supply and Sewerage Division's projected income statements
are shown in Appendices T-7 and T-8 and summarized below.

valued fixed assets         (1.31)          2.8%           2.7%            4.3%
4.08      The significant revenue increase 3.0 times between 1972 and 1976
is due both to the increase in volume of water sold and higher tariffs.  As
a result of the project, the volume of water sold would increase 31%, in the
period 1973-76, reflecting a 18% increase in production and gradually di-
minishing losses from about 30% to 20%.
4.09      To assure that earnings are sufficient, an average water supply
and sewerage tariff of Col$1.30 would be a condition of effectiveness of the
subsidiary loan agreement and rates of return would be set up as follows
(Specific Condition):



- T-9 -
1973                 5%
1974                 3%
1975                 2%
1976 and thereafter 3%
4.10      The rate of return would be calculated by taking income before
interest as a percentage of average revalued net fixed assets. The net
fixed assets would be the average of the net (estimated) fixed assets in use
at the beginning and the end of the year for which the rate of return calcu-
lation is made. Revaluation and tariff review would be done once a year, at
the end of the year, using the cost of living index for workers developed by
the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE) for the
Departamento de Valle del Cauca at the last month of the preceeding year.
The subsidiary loan agreement should provide that the base would be the
revalued net fixed assets as of December 31, 1971, of Col$22.7 million
(see Appendix T-18).
4.11      Annual cash surplus would increase from Col$1.4 million in 1972 to
Col$3.7 million in 1976 with an accumulated cash balance of Col$9.2 at the
end of 1976.
Telephones
4.12      The Telephone Division earned 83% of the internal cash generation
of the Empresas in 1969 and 100% in 1970 and all of its annual cash surpluses.
The telephone operating ratio has been kept at an adequate level of approxi-
mately 40% in the period 1969-1971.
4.13      The Telephone Division's historical and projected income and cash
flow statements are shown in Appendices T-12 and T-13. Comments on past
finances and assumptions for financial projections are described respectively
in Appendices T-5 and T-6. Total revenues are projected to increase 50% in the
period 1972-1975, reflecting a growth in the number of telephones and assumed
increases in tariffs. The tariffs will enable the Empresas to meet expansion
need and maintain a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 2.0 (except
in 1972).
4.14      The Empresas' expansion program of Col$4.7 million for the installa-
tion of 800 new lines began in 1969 and will be completed in 1974. This pro-
gram is financed by Philips Holland, Philips Colombia and a local loan from
the Banco Popular. After 1974, it has been assumed that the Empresas will
have to install an average of 200 new lines a year to maintain the ratio of
3 telephones per 100 inhabitants, giving a total investment of Col$12.2 mil-
lion during 1975-76.
4.15      The tariffs would be maintained to provide at least an 11% annual
rate of return on the average net current value of the telecommunications
assets revalued as of December 1971 at Col$4.0 million, as shown in Appendix
T-18 (Specific Condition). The rate of return would be calculated by a
method identical with the one proposed for the water supply and sewerage
fixed assets in paragraph 4.10.



- T-10 -
Other Services
4.16      These services include slaughterhouse and markets. Their histori-
cal and projected income and cash flow statements appear in Appendix T-14,
and assumptions for financial projections are described in Appendix T-6.
Although the combined operating ratio of these services was as high as 88%
in 1970, a small profit with modest internal cash generation, has been made,
which the Empresas has invested in new facilities.
4.17      It has been assumed that the operating ratio before depreciation
of these services will fall from 80% in 1971 to 78% in 1976, and that the
tariff will be increased to achieve this improvement. Assurances would
be included in the subsidiary loan that an operating ratio before deprecia-
tion of no more than 80% will be achieved and tariffs will be adjusted in
1972 to meet that goal as a condition of effectiveness (Specific Condition).
Consolidated Finances
4.18       Consolidated income and cash Elow balance sheet statements are
presented in Appendices T-15 through T-17.
4.19      As a result of the increase in the water supply and sewerage tariff,
the share of these services in total cash generation will increase from 0%
in 1971 to 51% in 1976. Total internal cash generation will increase from
Col$1.6 million in 1971 to Col$10.1 million in 1976, covering the debt serv-
ice no less than 1.9 times during the same period. A covenant would be in-
cluded in the subsidiary loan agreement providing that previous year's total
earnings cover future maximum debt service at least 1.5 times (Specific Con-
dition).
4.20      The consolidated operating ratio before depreciation will be
maintained at about 50% after 1973, which is acceptable.
4.21      The current ratio will be 7.0 in 1972 and will be maintained at
a very high level until 1979 (no less than 5.0). This is due in part to
the strong cash position of the company (Col$21.5 million in 1976 and
Col$26.8 million in 1979) which reflects particularly the income from
valorizacion estimated to reach in 1977 Col$1.8 annually. Funded debt to
total capitalization will increase during the period 1972-1976 to 44% and
will begin to decrease thereafter.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      In addition to the General Conditions applicable to all seven proj-
ects, assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the following
Specific Conditions will be included in the subsidiary loan agreement between
INSFOPAL and the Empresas Publicas Municipales de Tulua:



- T-11 -
(i) The recommendations of the commercial auditors will be
implemented (para. 3.14);
(ii) An average water supply and sewerage tariff of Col$1.30/m3
will be established as a condition of loan effectiveness
and rates will be maintained to achieve the following rates
of return based on a valuation of net fixed assets of Col$22.7
million as of December 31, 1971 (para. 4.10):
1973                      5%
1974                      3%
1975                      2%
1976 and thereafter       3%
(iii)  Telephone tariffs will be maintained so as to earn a
minimum annual rate of return of 11% based on a valua-
tion of net fixed assets of Col$4.0 million on December
31, 1971 (para. 4.15);
(iv) Tariffs for the slaughterhouse and market will be set to
maintain an operating ratio before depreciation of 80%,
and adjusted to achieve this ratio for the remainder of
1972 as a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 4.17);
(v)  A debt service coverage of at least 1.5 would be maintained
(para. 4.19).
5.02      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$1.16
million for a term of 25 years, including a 4-year grace period.

PROJECT FACILITIES
Existing Facilities
Tulua is served by a conventional water treatment plant, built
in 1929 with a capacity of 75 2/sec and expanded in 1950 to 90 I/sec, and
three wells, two of them functioning and producing a total of 150 1/sec.
The treatment plant consists of presettling, flocculation, sedi-
mentation filtration and chemical feed units. Equipment and instruments
are largely inoperative and plant maintenance neglected. Upon completion
of the project, the plant will be taken out of service.
The distribution system is inadequate, unable to satisfy even
the average water demand, due to insufficient pipe-diameter (85% of total
pipe length consists of diameters 4 inches or less).
The sewerage system is a combined system, discharging both sewage
(untreated) and storm-water into the Morales and Tulua Rivers. Most of
the sewers are made of concrete.
New Facilities
11. New Wells
Three new wells, 125 1/sec each, would be constructed.  One will
be a stand-by unit. Their final location is to be defined by the local
consultants (Idesco Ltda of Bogota). Careful hydrogeological studies and
adequate construction methods would be employed to ensure the proper loca-
tion and future operation of the wells.
Chlorination made at the wells would fully guarantee the
water's bacteriological quality. While no problem is expected from the
physio-chemical standpoint, a careful study should be made, especially
with reference to pH correction.
A storage tank of 7,200 m3 would be constructed to give S total of
9,500 m3 storage or 25% of the expected water demand in 1985.

ENONCMIIC RE TURN
The economic return for the project is at least 9.2%. The return
calculation considers as benefits the incremental revenues earned as a result
of the project, and considers as costs the project's cost and its operating
cost. The follow-up investments to utilize the capacity fully will be required
in the late 1980s since the initial investment is relatively large. Operating
costs are taken net of depreciation.
The following assumptions have been made for the calculations shown
on page 3:
(i) The project's life is 50 years after the end of the main investment
period;
(ii) The project volumes sold are shown in Appendix T-3;
(iii) Since at present there is no excess capacity, all additional water
sold is attributed to the project;
(iv) The incremental volume sold is multiplied by the tariff in force
at the end of 1972, Col$1.30/m3. In this way all benefits are
expressed in constant 1972 prices;
(v) Only the incremental operating costs are charged to the project.
To obtain the operating costs net of inflation, the 1973 operating cost
is divided by 1.10, which is thought to be he relevant inflation
factor. The 1974 colt is divided by (1.10) , and the operating costs
thereafter by (1.10) . The incremental operating cost is the difference
between these adjusted operating costs and the 1972 operating costs;
(vi) The costs of works are shown in Appendix T-5 and are converted into
constant 1972 prices by applying the same inflation factor.
When investments aim at improving service to existing customers,
their costs are not charged to the project. The tax component is
negligible as project items are imported free of duty and no domestic
taxes are levied.
As shown in Annex 13, the project has a medium probability of achieving
all objectives. It is therefore thought unlikely that the investment costs would
increase more than 10%, in which case the internal economic rate of return would
fall to 7.7%. However, as the public's acceptance level of rate increases is
rated low it is assumed the drop of incremental revenues could be as much as 30%
in which case the return would be 3.9%. The rates of return are low, because
relatively large investments are made early and there will be excess capacity
in the early years in the projectts life. Another reason for the low rate of
return is the fact that 20% of the investment is for sewerage, which tends to be
less remunerative than water supply. Losses of water are already as low as 30%6,
and it is thought that only a small reduction will now be possible, so the
percentage of losses estimated by 1980 is 20%.

COMIMEIS ON PAST FINANCES
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE
The Enpresas has apparently maintained 30% unaccounted-for water,
which is a doubtful figure when considering the bad management of billing and
collection.
Even with the 1968 tariff increase, t4ie average tariff for water
supply and sewerage was no more than Col$O.38/m'. This average tariff did
not provide the Empresas with sufficient revenues to cover its operating
costs, The operating ratio was about 105% during the period 1969-1971, and
consequently, the internal cash generation was negative during this period.
The feasibility study for the project took place in 1969 and was
financed by FONADE.  The cost of the study was Col$1.1 million, to be repaid at
a rate of 10% a year with amortization over 10 years. The Empresas did
not begin to depreciate   its fixed assets until 1968, following the Guide-
lines of the "Superintendencia de Regulacion Economica."
TELEPHONES
As of December 30, 1971, 2,000 telephone lines were installed.
The distribution of telephones by category and their corresponding monthly
fixed charges are as follows:
Monthly              Number of
Category            Fixed Charge             Telephones
----C
Residential                    10                     901
Commercial & Industrial        15                    919
Rural                          20                     60
Official                       10                     76
Public                                                144
Total                                         2,000
There is no limit on the time allowed for each local call, which
is charged at Col$0.10. Monthly collection per public telephone is Col$47.
The average monthly income per telephone has been calculated at Col$42.00.
The Empresas receives from Telecom, the national telecommunication agency,
28% of total revenues for long-distance calls.



Appendix T-5
Page 2 of2 pages
The telephone services have a very low operating ratio -- about
40% in the last three years. The intemnal cash generation has been enough
to offset the water supply and sewerage deficit and to provide the Bnpresas
with an annual cash surplus of about Col$0.5 million.
The existing debt corresponds to an investment in 800 new lines,
which will enable the Emnpresas to maintain a low ratio of about 3 tele-
phones per 100 persons until 1975. Total investment will be Col$4.7 million.
Philips of Holland will finance 53% of the total (Col$2.5 million) at an
interest rate of 7%, with a down-payment of US$19,900 in 1972 and then semi-
annual equal payments of principal and interest, the last payment being due
in 1976. Philips of Colombia will finance 4% (Col$0.2 million) of the total
investment and will be refunded in three seani-annual equal payments ending in
1973. A local loan from Banco Popular will finance the remaining 13% (Col$2.0
million) and will be repaid by annual equal payments of Col$200.00 of prin-
cipal, and semi-annual payments of interest separately. This loan will be
repaid in 1982.
OTHER SERVICES
The market and slaughterhouse operations have been financially
acceptable in the past, with an operating ratio of 88% and an intemal cash
generation which enabled the Enmpresas to make some investments. The rental
charges of the market's tenants have not been increased since 1968. During
that year the city's new slaughterhouse was built.
OTHER INVESTMETS
The Enmpresas owns 32,683 shares of the power company in Tulua.
These shares have a nominal value of Col$10 each and in 1971 had a market
value of Col$70 each.

FINANCIAL ASSUMPTION!S
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE
Revenues
Billings for 1971 are based on first six months' actuals.
The combined water and sewerage average tariff for 1971 is Col$04.6/m3.
New water tariffs, approved in August 1971, and percentage of water bills
for sewerage introduced at the same time, are being qpplied in various steps
as shown below.
Excess        Sewerage as %
Consuwption      of Water Bills
(Col$J7m-'}
Until December 1971                0.50                20%
January to May 1972                0.70                30%
June to July 1972                  0.90                40%
From August 1972                   1.00                40%
Revenues for 1972 have been estimated on this basis and would be
Col$3,4 million, compared with Col$2.1 million in 1971 -- an increase of
52%. The combined water and sewerage average tariff would be Col$1.02/m3
by the second semester of 1972. This combined average tariff has been
assumed to be increased to Col$1.30m3 by the first quarter of 1973 to
Col$1.43/m3 in 1974, to Col$1,57/m in 1975, reaaining at this level there-
after for purpose of financial projections.
Other revenues for 1971 (Col$200,000) were also based on first
siA  months' actuals.  This income has been arbitrarily fixed at Col$300 ,000
for the following years.
Operating Costs
All operating expenses for 1971 have been computed on the year's
first six months' actuals.  Operating expenses have been projected taking
an annual price contingency of 10% until 1975 and an annual general allow-
ance of 5% for unexpected expenses.
The costs of electric power are projected to increase with the
annual volume of water pumped. Chemicals have been estimated only until
1973, as the plant would be abandoned then, when the three new wells begin
to operate.
Other operating costs (labor, administrative and general) increase
with the population served.



Appendix T-6
Page 2 of 4 pages
Depreciation
Annual depreciation is calculated at 3% of the average revalued
gross fixed assets in service at the beginning and end of the year, straight-
line, without residual value.
Interest Charged to Income Statement
Until 1975, the interest amounts charged to Income Statement are
those paid to FONADE for the financing of the feasibility study (Col$1.l
million). Thereafter the interest includes that paid to the Bank and to
INSFOPAL for the financing of the project.
Cash-Flow Items
Connection fees are projected by taking into account the annual
increase in the number of connections and a statistical cost per connection
of Col$700 assumed to be collected in two years.
Accounts receivable average two months of sales. Accounts payable
average three months of materials consumption.
The Empresas has estimated that an annual amount of Col$2.2 million
will be collected from "valorizaci6n" beginning in 1973. Because of
possible delay in collection, the financial projections show an annual
collection of only Col$1.2 million until 1976 and Gol$1.8 million there-
aft er.
It has been assumed that inventories will remain at their present
level (Col$1.30 million).
TELEPHONES
Revenues
Revenues were projected based on 1971   figures, and increased
with the number of telephones. The fixed charge was projected based on a
monthly average of Col$13.18/telephone.
Revenue for calls will double in 1974, when the charge per call
is assumed to increase from Col$0.10 to Col$0.20.
Revenue from Telecom and other revenues have been assumed to
increase arbitrarily by 10% in 1972 and 1974.
Operating Costs
Operating costs were projected to increase with the number of
telephones, including an annualprice contingency of 10%.
Depreciation
Annual depreciation is calculated at 5% of the average revalued
gross fixed assets in service at the beginning and end of the year, straight-
line, without residual value.



Appendix T-6
Interest Charged to  Income Statement             Page 3 of 4 pages
Interest amounts charged to Tncome Statement are those correspond-
ing to (i) the present debts to Philips and the Banco Popular (see Appendix T-8);
(ii) the new financing of the expansion program assumed to take place in
1975-1976 (see Cash-Flow Items).
Cash-Flow Items
Customersf deposits are estimated to be Col$900 for each new
installation.
Connection fees are estimated to be Col$500 for each new installa-
tion.
Inventories have been assumed to increase with the number of
telephones.
Accounts receivable average 2-1/2 months of sales.
It has been assumed that accounts payable will remain at their
present level.
In order to maintain the proportion of 3 telephones per 100
persons after 1975, it will be necessary to install additional telephones
as f ollows J
1975        100
1976        300
1977        100
1978        200
1979        200
The corresponding additional investments have been estimated
at Col$8.3 million. Financing would be from the Empresas for 20% of the
total (Col$1.7 uillion) and from a supplier credit for the difference
(Col$6.6 million); this credit would be amortized over 5 years by equal
semi-annual payments and at the rate of 12%.
OTHER SERVICES
Revenues were calculated assuming an operating ratio of less
than 80%, oomputed on operating costs forecast as explained below.
The resulting annual increases in revenues are as follows:
Slaughterhouse          Market
1971/2                        15%                  10%
1972/3                        13%                   8%
1973/4                        11%                   7%
197h/5                         5%                   6%
1975/6                        10%                  13%



Appendix T-6
Page 4 of 4 pages
In order to obtain these revenues the Empresas will have to
increase the tariffs and perhaps look for other sources of income.
Operating costs for 1971 are based on the first semester actuals,
and include an annual price contingency of 10% until 1976.
Armual depreciation is calculated at 5% of the average revalued
gross fixed assets in service at the beginning and end of the year,
straight-line, without residual value.
Given the uncertainty as to whether the assumed increase in
tariffs will be obtained, no new investments have been projected.

EMPRESA DEL ACUEDUCTO DE BUENAVENTURA
I. EXISTING WATER SUPPLY FACILITIES
1.01      Buenaventura is Colombia's second largest port and has a population
estimated at 100,000. Situated on the Pacific Coast about 80 km northwest of
Cali, the city lies at sea level and has a tropical climate with an average
annual temperature of 270 C. Its water supply is the responsibility of the
Empresa del Acueducto de Buenaventura, which is operated by Acuavalle with
headquarters in Cali. Acuavalle is a water supply company owned by INSFOPAL
and the Department of Valle del Cauca.
1.02      About 40 percent of the population is supplied with water through
approximately 8,500 house connections. Of these, only 6,500 are legal con-
nectlons installed by the Empresa; the other 2,000 are illegal connections,
which will be converted to legal accounts as part of the proposed rehabili-
tation program. Of the 6,500 legal connections, about 60 percent are
metered. The meters are very unreliable as there is neither a maintenance
nor repair program.
1.03      Buenaventura's source of water is the Escalerete River (see Map
3794), which has a minimum flow of 1.8 m3/sec---2-1/2 times the city's esti-
mated water needs in the year 2000. The river originates in the Andes
Mountains about 30 km from the city. The Empresa owns the watershed, which
has an annual precipitation of more than 6 m and is uninhabited. A 1-km
culvert conducts the water to the treatment plant, whose capacity is 350
1/sec (see Appendix B-1 for details). From the plant two 28-km transmis-
sion mains (16- and 20-inch diameters) carry the treated water to Buenaven-
tura. The first of these mains was built in 1934 of cast-iron; the second
was built in 1964 of steel and concrete.
1.04      Buenaventura's water supply is limited because of insufficient
transmlssion capacity and the bad state of repair of the distribution system.
It Is estimated that more than 50 percent of the water is lost. This re-
sults in rationing and low pressures in several parts of the city. Water
quality is acceptable since the raw water is uncontaminated and needs no
treatment, even though the water supply system includes a conventional
treatment plant.
1.05      The distribution system consists of 22 km of pipe, ranging in
diameter from 2 to 12 inches. Of these, 4,000 m are 2-inch pipes and
11,000 m are 3- and 4-inch pipes. Those with 2- and 3-inch diameters are
galvanized steel, which the Empresa has only recently begun to replace with
asbestos-cement pipe.
1.06      The city has little sewerage and storm-water drainage, which
has caused serious problems. Those services are the responsibility of a
regional development corporation, which has an urban development program for
the city.



- B-2 -
1.07      The water distribution system is poorlv operated and maintained, as
shown by the high percentage of losses. To correct the deficiencies, programs
of leak detection and repair and meter repair and maintenance should be insti-
tuted. Also, the Empresa should replace the reservoir altitude valves, which
at present do not function.
II. THE PROJECT
Buenaventura's Water Supply Program
2.01      The project is the first stage of Buenaventura's water supply and
distribution improvement program. The facilities of this first stage, to be
constructed in 1972 and 1973, would:
(i) rehabilitate water distribution and storage facilities,
(ii) eliminate excess water leakage, and
(iii) legalize about 2,000 new customers to the system.
The second stage of the program would consist of additional transmission
facilities to be constructed as growth of population and water consumption
make increased capacity necessary. The two stages were designed by Ilidrosan
of Bogota and reviewed by Interconsult of Bogota.
2.02      It is anticipated that additional transmission capacity will, be
needed by 1976. Hidrosan is now studying which alternative - an additional
transmission main or a booster pumping station - would be the more economical
solution.
Description of Project
2.03      The project would consist of:
(i) construction of water distribution mains,
(ii) construction of additional house connections,
(iii) additional transmission main capacity,
(iv) installation of altitude valves at the existing
storage tanks and repair of equipment,
(v)  purchase of equipment for meter testing and leak
detection.



- B-3 -
2.04      Appendix B-1 gives a more detailed description of the project.
Growth of the city's population is estimated to be 5-1/4% and population
served is anticipated to increase from 39,000 in 1971 to 107,000 in 1980.
Statistics on the water supply system, including consumption and demand,
past and forecast, are in Appendix B-2 and Chart 6384. The project is
intended to meet the estimated demand and gives an internal economic
return of 14% as calculated in Appendix B-3 and discussed in greater
detail in Chapter V of Volume 1.

- B-4 -
2.06      The above estimates are generally based on the engineers' estimates
contained in the feasibility report and on suppliers' quotations. The engi-
neers' unit cost estimates have been verified by using the unit cost of re-               4
cent similar work in Buenaventura. Additionally, the unit costs were com-
pared with unit costs tabulated by INSFOPAL. Technical contingencies of 10%
on imported equipment and 20% on civil works reflect the degree of uncertain-
ty associated with the respective items of the project. The cost of engineer-
ing and construction administration has been assumed at 10% of net construction
cost. Price contingency is discussed in paragraph 4.15 of Volume 1.
2.07      The project includes sufficient funds for the construction of the
transmission main between Buenaventura and Loma Alta, the initial section of
future transmission facilities. However, these funds will be released only
after the consulting engineers have submitted their analysis of transmission
facility needs, and then only in the amount needed to permit construction of
the least-cost solution (Specific Condition).
Project Execution
2.08      Final designs for the works to be undertaken have been prepared by
Hidrosan, and are acceptable to the Bank. INSFOPAL would supervise and ad-
minister construction of the facilities. The engineer assigned to the project
by INSFOPAL seems capable and is acceptable to the Bank.
2.09      Two years of construction, 1972 and 1973, are expected, although
carry-over into 1974 is possible if the study described in paragraph 2.07
should be unexpectedly time consuming. The project schedule is shown in
Chart 6383.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization
3.01      The beneficiary would be the Empresa del Acueducto de Buenaventura
originally an independent public utility owned by the national railways and
the Corporacion de Servicios Publicos de Buenaventura. Under Law No. 29 of
February 15, 1957, the Empresa was transferred to INSFOPAI. and assumed the
status of a subsidiary of INSFOPAL, which administered the Fmpresa directlv
until May 1971, when responsibility for the Empresa was transferred to
Acuavalle.
3.n2      Acuavalle, a waterworks management organization owned by INSFOPAL,
the Department of Valle del Cauca and affiliated municipalities, administers
and manages 31 small water supply systems with a total of about 33,000
customers. Only three of these systems have over 2,000 customers, one of
them being Buenaventura, with 6,500.



- B-5 -
3.03      AcuavalLe is directed by a Board of Directors composed of five mem-
bers selected by the general assembly of stockholders. Two of the directors
are from INSFPOPAL, two from the Departmental government, and one from the
municipalities. Thie composition of the Board reflects the fact that the
majoritv of the sJhares are owned by INSFOPAL and the Departmental government.
3.04      The Roard has extensive powers, including the power to fix tariffs
within the limitations imposed by the National Public Services Tariff Board
and the power to approve contracts and borrow money.
3.05      The dn-.7-to-day operations of Acuavalle are administered by the
General Manag .r, who is appointed by the Board of Directors. It is anti-
cipated that th- present General Manager, an experienced and energetic in-
dividual, will continue in his position.
Administratiou
3.06      FrOT; it  headquarters in Cali, Acuavalle provides administrative
services sucrn   tilling, accounting, payroll, purchasing and internal audit
for most of the '1 water supply systems. Because of the size of the Empresa
in Buenaventur~A  these functions are performed in that city by local staff
working under th- overall direction of the General Manager of Acuavalle.
The new Buenaven'tura administrative organization instituted by Acuavalle
after assuming tontrol is shown in Chart 6382.
Staff
3.07      This new set-up for the Buenaventura water supply system provides
for 57 emnlovecs. An administrator would be in charge, assisted by an engineer
and an accountanL. At present only 40 of the 57 posts provided for in the
organization chart are filled.
3.08      The 57 employees proposed for the Buenaventura system would amount
1.45 employees per 1,000 persons served, using as a basis of the computation
the populationi served through legal connections (see para 1.02).  When those
who obtain water from illegal connections are included, the ratio drops to
1.1 employees per 1,000 persons served, which is still a somewhat high figure
when compared with other Colombian water supply systems which are well
operated and manrcained. This is acceptable, however, because the water
supply svstem in !uenaventura has been badly neglected and needs a consider-
able workforce to execute the improvements that will enable the Empresa to
provide a high-qu&lity water service.
3.09      The ne-71y hired senior staff - the administrator, the engineer and
the accountant -- av qualified and motivated. Recent actions undertaken
by Acuavalle7o General Manager and the local Buenaventura staff, such as
the purchase of r.eters for installation in unmetered accounts and efforts
to identify qilcgUl connections so as to convert them to legal metered
connections, indicate that the management of the Empresa should improve
rapidly.



- B-6 -
3.10      The Empresa has been able to attract and retain relatively well
qualified staff despite the low salaries it pays. The reason for the small
employee turnover is that the Empresa and INSFOPAL offer excellent fring
benefits and guarantee job security; this is especially important in Buena-
ventura, a port city with wide fluctuations in employment opportunities. In
1970 the Empresa's workers founded a union and thus far union-management re-
lations have been harmonious.
Billing and Collection
3.11      At present, billing for water sold is unsatisfactory because of the
lack of adequate data on water consumption.  Unmetered accounts receive a
bill based on an estimate of the amount of water consumed. This estimate,
in turn, is based on the water consumption of similar metered accounts. With
most of the meters either not in working order or malfunctioning, this billing
method is obviously unsatisfactory. Bills are processed manually and must be
paid at the Empresa's office. The policy of disconnecting service for non-
payment is not strictlv enforced and consequently about 15% of the bills are
outstanding for longer than three months.
Accounting and Audit
3.12      The Empresa's (Acuavalle) accounting is done manually and provides
a fair amount of information on its financial operations. Nevertheless, it
is proDosed that the accounting system be revised to conform with the guide-
lines of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). In addition, it is
recommended that the Buenaventura accounts and funds be kept separate from
the other operations of Acuavalle (Specific Condition).
3.13      To ensure that the information provided in the Buenaventura finan-
cial statements is accurate and presented in accordance with current accotrnt-
ing practice, the Empresa will employ commercial auditors for audit purposes,
beginning with the accounts for 1971 (General Condition).
3.14      The Empresa recognizes the need for improvement of its organization
and operations. Satisfactory provision for the assistance of management con-
sultants is a condition of effectiveness of the subsidiary loan agreement
(General Condition).
IV. FINANCES
WATER SUPPLY
Past Finances
4.01      Acuavalle's operations have been characterized by a constantly de-
creasing net income, as shown by the following net income figures:



- B-7 -
Net Income
Col$ million
1968                  0.08
1969                 (0.13)
1970                 (0.33)
4.02      Aat.,talie's ability to meet its current financial obligations is
poor (the curr-nt ratio is less than unitv). The present long-term debt of
Col$10 milloi, is dangerously heavy and only INSFOPAL's transfers maintain
the cash pol.ition in equilibrium.
4.03      Buenaventura's water system was transferred from INSFOPAL to Acu-
avalle in 1971.  axul the effect this system will have on Acuavalle's financial
position is ;-.- knlown.  The Buenaventtira operations have been supported in
the past by -^v nnment grants.  In 1971, money available from such grants
amounted to f33.9 million and for 1972, Col$7.2 million.  It is difficult
to assess the D-i.zt financial performance of these systems because no balance
sheets are p'p?ed that would reflect the changes in its assets, debt and
capital strnic,ure. The cash-flow figures for the 1970-71 (Appendix B-8)
are reconstrutsd and should be interpreted with reserve.  Unaudited operating
results were aj follows:
---- Col$ million -----
1970                 1971
Revenues                   1.9                   1.8
Operating Cost             2.1                   2.4
Operating Ratio           111%                  133%
4.04      The prrincipal underlying causes of these bleak operating results
were low taril-.  very poor management and unbilled or uncollected water
services.
4.05      Managcment reforms, including the appointment of a capable adminis-
trator, havre b_    instituted.  A program of conversion of fraudulent services
to legal ones, r&,ster installation and collection of previously uncollected
bills and urJ,b1_1Ld consumption is under way.

of funds incl.}das tariff increases described in paragraph 4.09.  Financial
assumptions cia -* found in Appendix B-6.  Cash-flow statements are shown in

/1   Both on Bank and National Loans.
4.n7      The futnds required would be made available as follows:
(1) the Bank loan through INSFOPAL would be US$0.53 million
at an assumed interest of 7.25% and amortization over
21 years after a 4-year grace period;
(ii)  the national loan would be Col$6.9 million at 12% repaid
in equal semi-annual payments over 15 years after a
4-year grace period;
(iii) internal funds of the Empresa del Acueducto de Buenaventura
for Col$7.6 million; and
(iv)  the national grant of Col$7.2 million provided in
the 1971 Budget.



- B-9 -
4.08      As of December 1971, the Empresa has no long-term debt.  All
government contributions to Buenaventura have been grants.
Tariffs
4.09      To meet the proposed financing plan, tariffs will have to be in-
creased 100% to Col$1.20/m3 as a condition of effectiveness of the subsidiary
loan agreement and should thereafter be maintained to meet operating costs
and depreciation until 1975 when the following minimum rates of return would
apply, based on a net asset value to be recognized in the subsidiary loan
agreement, of Col$43.0 million as of December 31, 1971, as shown in Appendix
B-18 (Specific Condition):
1975-76              1%
Thereafter           2%
4.10      It is assumed that tariffs would be raised to Col$1.50/m3 in 1974
and to (ol$1.60/m3 in 1975 to keep pace with presumed inflation during the
project period. At the same time, tariffs would be redesigned in accordance
with National Tariff Board guidelines, reducing the number of categories to
5 or 6 and introducing uniform minimum allowances and excess charges for all
categories.
4.11      The rate of return would be calculated by taking income before in-
terest as a percentage of average revalued net fixed assets. The net fixed
assets would be the average of the net (estimated) fixed assets in use at
the beginning and the end of the year for which the rate of return calcula-
tion is made. Revaluation and tariff review would be done once a year, at
the end of the year, using the cost of living index for workers developed by
the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE) for the De-
partment of Valle at the last month of the preceding year.
F(Uture Finances
4.12      If the necessary financial reforms are effected, the future fi-
nances of the Empresa should be sound and an additional investment program
could be undertaken. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the funds generated by the Buenaventura water supply system will be used
exclusively for Buenaventura (Specific Condition). The estimated income
and expense statements are presented in Appendix B-7 and summarized below.
The assumptions in the financial projections are presented in Appendix B-6.

4.13      Annual internal cash generation should increase from Col$0.9 million
in 1972 to Col$5.7 million in 1976 and should remain at about Col$6.0 million
thereafter. Funded debts to capitalization will not exceed 24%, and the ben-
eficiary's ability to meet its current obligations will be excellent. In
the cash-flow projections presented in Appendix B-8, about Col$3 million a
year have been assumed to be disbursed after the project construction period
for additional waterworks.
4.14      The debt service ratio is projected over the period 1972-79 at a
relatively high level because of the uncertainty concerning the Fmpresa's
financial records and the illustrative nature of financial projections made
from them. Therefore, assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the beneficiary will not incur new debt without the consent of the Bank
(Specific Condition).
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      In addition to the General Conditions applicable to all seven pro-
jects, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the following Specific
Conditions will be included in the subsidiary loan agreement between INSFOPAL
and Acuavalle on behalf of Buenaventura:
(i)  Funds for transmission facilities will be released
only for the least cost solution, as determined by
an engineering study, and funds for other works will
be released after submittal of a construction program
acceptable to INSFOPAL and the Bank (para. 2.07);
(ii)  Accounts for Buenaventura will be maintained
separately from other accounts of Acuavalle
(para 3.12);



- B-11 -
(iii) An average water supply tariff to yield ColS1.20/m3
will be established as a condition of effectiveness
of the loan, and the tariff will be maintained so as
to meet operating expenses and depreciation until 1975
and then to achieve the following minimum rates of
return, based on a valuation of net fixed assets of
Col$43.0 million as of December 31, 1971 (para. 4.09);
1975-76              1%
Thereafter           2%
(iv) Funds generated by Buenaventura will be kept separately
and used exclusively for Buenaventura (para 4.12);
(v) No additional debt will be incurred on behalf of
Buenaventura without the Bank's consent (para 4.14).
5.02      With the above Specific Conditions, along with the General Condi-
tions in Chapter VII of Volume 1, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$.53 million for a term of 25 years, including a 4-year grace period.

EMPRESA DEL ACUEDUCTO DE BUENAVENTURA
PROJECT FACILITIES
Existing Treatment Plant
The raw-water intake is located 1 km upstream from the plant
on the Escalerete Rivero The conduit bringing the water from the
intake to the plant is an 80 x 95 cm rectangular, reinforced-concrete
culvert. The estimated capacity of this culvert is 1 m3/sec. The
conventional water treatment plant consists of -
(i) raw water meter
(ii)  chemical dosing equipment
(iii) flocculaticn chambers
(iv)  sedimentation basing
(v) filters
(vi)  chlorination equipment
(vii) treated water meter
(viii) generating plant
The treatment plant is designed for a capacity of 350 1/sec. The floc-
culation chambers provide a retention time of 29 min. Sedimentation
tank detention time is 3 hours and 48 min.  The filters are dual-media
filters designed for a filter rate of 5 m/hour (2 gpm/sq ft).
Both meters are out of service, as are the chlorinators and
the dosing equipment. An electric power plant produces power through
a turbine driven by 200 1/sec of water taken from the raw-water
intake canal. The remoteness of the treatment plant location makes
connection to the electric power network impossible.
Transmission Mains
The water is transmitted from the treatment plant to Buena-
ventura 28 km away by two transmission mains. These mains have a
combined capacity of 250 1/sec. With the raw-water intake capacity of
1,000 2/sec and the plant capacity of 350 )/sec,the transmission mains
will need expansion first. This expansion in transmission capacity can
be achieved by construction of another main, installation of a booster
station, or a combination of the two, whichever is most economical.



Appendix B-1
Page 2 of 3 pages
The older of the two existing transmission mains was built
in 1934 of cast-iron pipe.  The newer main, built in 1964, is a steel
pipe. Inspection indicated that the older main has many small leaks
but that the newer main is in good condition. A maintenance program
should be started to repair the older main and protect the newer steel
pipe by repairing the protective coating, which is worm in many places.
New Distribution System

The costs are net construction costs, 1971 prices, and include all
accessories.
The distribution network has been designed by the Hardy-Cross
method. The "C" value of 140 was used for the new asbestos-cement pipe
in accordance with design criteria promulgated by INSFOPAL.

Distribution Storage
The distribution system has four elevated steel storage tanks
of 1,000 m3 capacity each. Only one of these tanks is actually functioning.
The other three have been isolated fron the distribution system because
of the malfunctioning of the altitude valves.
For the present, 4,000 m3 qf storage is adequate; however, it
is recommended that at least 2,000 min distribution storage be constructed
at the time the transmission capacity is expanded to obtain a total storage
capacity of 15% of 1980 peak daily flows.
Equipment
Equipment to be purchased under the contract would include--
(i) water meter test bench and auxiliary equipment
(ii) leak detection equipment.
Timing
The facilities to be provided are urgently required to prevent
further deterioration of the water service. The Empresa has been unable
during the past few years to satisfy demand. Construction of the new distribution
piping and the institution of a vigorous leak detection and meter maintenance/
repair program will permit the E^presa to provide adequate water service to the
people of Buenaventura.

ECONOMIC RETURN
T7he accnat  return for the project is 14.2%
lTh rate of return calculation considers as benefits the increnental
revenues earned as a result of the project, and considers as costs the project
cost, its operating cost. and the capital and operating costs of the additional
works constracted after i:9,73 to utilize the project fully.  The cost of making
connections is =nroximately equal to the connection fees; hence neither tbeir
cost nor benefits enter into the calculation. Operating costs are taken re'
of depreciatiorn.
The following assumptions have been made for the calculations on
page 3 of this Appendix:
( . L) le pr-*Iect`s llfe is 50 years after the end of the main invs.ent'
I,eJr id o4
(ii) Tbeo project vo.]umes sold are shown in Appendix B-2.
(iii)  3i:nac- -   presEont, there is no excess capacity, all additiona.- wat.e-
ssl;l  -.tt-4buted to the project.
(iv)  Uhn  t1otA  volime sold ig multiplied by the tariff in force at the
end of 1972, Gol$1.20/m' . In this way, all benefits are expressed
in constant 1972 prices.
(v)  Onlyr the incremental operating costs are charged to the project.
To c:ttain the operating costs net of inflation, the 1973 operating
cost is divided by 1.10, which is thought to be he relevant infla-
tion  hactor.  The 1974 cost is divided by (1.10)  and the operating
co+.ts `t^lereafter by (1.10)3.  The incremental operating cost is the
di"'cnrence beiTeen these adjusted operating costs and the 1972
operat-4.ns costs.
(vi)  The costs of works are shown in Appendix B-4 and are converted into
constrzo'4 1972 prices by applying the inflation factor.  The tax cora-
ponen t i: negligible as project items are imported free of duty and
no domrestic taxes are levied.
As is shown in Annex 13, the project has a low probability of achieu-
ing all object.Jir:.e   It is therefore thought that the investment costs right
increase by as much as 15%, in which case the econonic rate of return would fall
to 12.2%. As the p.blic's acceptance level of rate increases is rated low
it is assumed the drop of incremental revenues could be as much as 30%., in which
case the return would be 7.3%. Reasons for the relatively high rate of return
are rapid demand E7owth and the fact that investments are made for sewerage,
which tends tr be less remunerative than water supply. The sharp drap iin
unaccounted-for water from 73% to 25% also affects the rate of return favrorably.

Revenues
Revenues are from sales to regular customers and to ships.
Revenues from regular customers include billings only. Water
charges, averaging Col$0.59/m3 in 1971, are assumed to increase 103% to
Col$1.20/m3 in the second half of 1972. Additional increases of 17% to
Col$1.40/m3, 7% to Col$1.50/m3 and 7% to Col$1.60/m3 are assumed for 1973,
1974 and 1975, respectively. After 1975, the average tariff is assumed to
remain at the same level.
Revenues from sales to ships are projected assuming that the present
rate of US$0.60/m3 will not change and that the volume sold will increase 17%
in 1973, 14% in 1974 and 13% in 1975. After 1975, the volume sold is assumed
to remain at the same level.
Cperating Costs
All operating costs are based on 1971 actuals (January-October).
Labor
Labor costs are projected to increase according to the following
factors:

The 30% increase in the number of personnel in 1972 is due to the new
organization that Acuavalle is implenenting in Buenaventura.
Chemical costs are insignificant.
Power costs with gravity water transmission are assumed to be in-
significant. However, installation of pumping stations on the transmission
lines could change this assumption.

At present, taxes are not paid to the Municipality. It is assumed
that this situation will continue.
Cash-Flow Items
Accounts receivable are assumed to be eaual to 3 months of sales.
Accounts payable (an insignificant figure) and inventories remain at their
present levels.
J 1971 materials costs, Col$0.5 million, are too high. Therefore, the
figure Col$0.2 million has been selected as the projection base.

EMIRESA DE ACUEDUCTO Y ALCANTARILLADO DE SANTA MARTA
I. EXISTING WATEPR SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES
1.01      Santa Me2ta, fou.4dd in :525 and incorporates. .n ;._53, is one of
Colombia's main ports and -he capital of the Departnment of 4agdalena.  Its
population is estimated at i40,000. Situated on the Caribbean coast at sea
level, the c17:v is also a major tourist resort.  The cILiate is hot, with
an average asnual temperature of 30oC. There are two pronotmced rainy
periods, April and October.
1.42      About 100,000 or 70% of the city's total population are served
with water. Of the 12,000 registered connections, 4,000 have meters (2,000
were instailed in 1971). It is estimated that there are as many as 3,000
illegal water s-Upply connections. Distribution pipes total 150 km. There
is no inveittory of pipes, but it is believed that those of small diameter,
mvsUly of galvanized steel, are corroded and need to be replaced.
1.03      The water supply system is barely sufficient to satisfy Santa
Marta's present requirements.  Treatment plant capacity is insufficient, re-
sulting in low quality oF treated water. Unchlorinated well water, carrying
sand, is pumped directly into the distribution system. As the city has no
storm sewer system, rainwater infiltration is a problem; fortunately, however,
heavy rains are relatively infrequent and of short duration.
1.04      Santa Marta's water sources are the Manzanares River and two tube-
wells, each of 55 1/sec capacity (see Map 3790). From the river intake the
water is coniducted by a pipeline of 400 1/sec capacity, built in 1968, to
the Mnamotoco treatment plant lccated 3.5 km from the city. This plant, pro-
dtucing an average of 300 I/sec, is a bottleneck restricting supply to the
city. The treated water flows to the city by gravity through two pipes, one
16-inch and the other 12-inch. The two tubewells are over-exploited and
their sand-laden water causes meters to wear out in a very short time, usual-
ly six months.
1.05     mTere are 55 km of sewers and about 5,500 sewer connections (about
45 of the water customers). The sewers drain by gravity to a pumping station
in the harbor area.  Untreated sewage is pumped to the Taganga Bay shoreline
at the same point where the city's solid waste is dumped. The most cffensive
sea pollutioni is from solid waste, with sewage pollution a lesser problem. Sea
pol'Lution studies have been made which suggest that no sewage disposal modifica-
tion will be required for the next five to ten years.  Sewer trunk mains costing
Col$9..' millior. are under construction but are not part of the project.
1.0f6     The efficiency of both water supply and sewerage has suffered from
-pocr iiiaintenance and overall bad management. An ambitiour meter installa-
t4on irogranL is under way, for which better managerial skills and i"mproved
maintenance are particularly required. General technical assistance should
be sought so as to achieve an acceptable level of management (General Condi-
tion).

II. THE PROJECT
Santa Marta's Water Supply and Sewerage Program
2.01      The project is to be constructed in 1972-74 and is a part of the
initial stage of Santa Marta's water supply and sewerage improvement program.
The project consists principally of improvements to the water treatment and
distribution system. In addition, a major Col$13.0 improvement to the sewer-
age system will be concurrently performed with USAID financing. Assurances
have been obtained during negotiations that the sewerage improvement program
would be reviewed by the Bank and INSFOPAL prior to implementation.
Description of Project
2.02      The project would consist of:
(i) modifications to the existing water treatment plant to
increase its capacity to 400 1/sec and to improve treated
water quality, or construction of groundwater wells with
a combined yield of about 300 1/sec;
(ii)  construction of a 3,000 m3 capacity water storage tank;
(iii) construction of water transmission and distribution mains;
(iv) installation of 9,000 new or repaired water meters; and
(v) purchase of equipment for maintenance leak detection and
meter testing.
2.03      The project would permit the water system to peak demands estimated
at 1.8 times average demand. Additional limited water distribution and sewer-
age works could be built with funds obtained from property assessment (valoriza-
tion) and from any internal cash generation surplus over debt service.
2.04      At present the water source component of the water supply project is
undefined, it will either be groundwater, in which case groundwater wells would
be constructed, or a continuation of surface water, which would require modi-
fication to the existing treatment plant to improve the quality of water pro-
duced and increase its capacity by 100 1/sec. A groundwater study and economic
analysis of the alternatives would be performed early in the project to decide
between the two alternatives. If the decision is made not to modify the plant,
it would be abandoned during the project period.
2.05      There are a number of cases where interconnections between pipes in
the distribution system can immediately improve the functioning of the system.
These interconnections will be made before any construction is begun.



- S-3 -
2.06      Appendix S-t gives a more detailed description of the project.  Growth
of the city's population is estimated at 5-1/4% per year and population served
will increase from 103,000 in 1972 to 174,000 in 1979. Statistics on the water
supply system including consumption and demand, past and forecast, are in
Appendix S-2 and Chart 6694. The project is intended to meet the estimated
demands, and will give an economic return of 13% as calculated in Appendix
S-3 and discussed in greater detail in Chapter V of Volume 1.
Cost Estimates
2.07      The estimated costs of the project are summarized below. 1/  The
annual investment program is given in Appendix S-4.

1/   Costs are at 1971 values, with an exchange rate of Col$20 to US$1.00.  For
the purpose of this estimate it is assumed that the treatment plant alterna-
tive (see para. 2.04) would be selected.



- S-4 -
2.08      The project costs estimates were made by the consultants CETREDE
and Escuela Superior de Administracion Publica (ESAP) who prepared the fea-
sibility study. Technical contingencies are 20% and engineering and admin-
istrative costs are 10% of the construction sub-total. The price contingency
is discussed in paragraph 4.15 of Volume 1.
Project Execution
2.09      Except for the pipe network, consultants have not been employed to
design the project and supervise its construction. It was agreed during nego-
tiations that satisfactory consultants would be retained or other arrangements
made using INSFOPAL staff which are satisfactory to the Bank (General Condi-
tion). Design and supervision would be covered by the Bank loan.
2.10      A three-year construction period, 1972 through 1974, is expected.
Project design would continue into late 1972 and major construction would
take place in 1973 (see Chart 6601).
III. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization
3.01      The proposed beneficiary will be a new corporation, the Acueducto
y Alcantarillado de Santa Marta S.A., to which the Santa Marta's water supply
and sewerage services would be transferred. It was agreed during negotiations
that the new corporation would be legally formed and that it would have ac-
quired the ownership of all assets operated by the water supply and sewerage
system of the City of Santa Marta, and sent its bylaws to INSFOPAL (Condition
of Effectiveness).
3.02      At present Santa Marta's water supply and sewerage system is under
Acueducto y Alcantirallo de Magdalena S.A. (Acuadelma), controlled by
INSFOPAL. Acuadelma is a corporation formed in 1959, whose purpose is "the
study of projects': the construction and administration of water supply and
sewerage works, for the municipalities of the Magdalena Department."
3.03      The new corporation's authority will be vested in a Board of
Directors (Junta Directiva) elected by shareholders. INSFOPAL would have
majority control, with Santa Marta Municipality participating.
Staff and Management
3.04      In addition to the engineer responsible for the operation and
maintenance of the existing system, the administration of the Empresa con-
sists essentially of a billing officer with two cashiers and two meter
readers. The Empresa has a staff of 68, or 10 employees per thousand of
population served. This ratio is high, but will improve with future system
expansion if the staff is not increased.



- S-5 -
Billing and Collection
3.05      The water service has an estimated 2,800 illegal connections.  A
census to identify all illegal connections is now in its final stages. The
underlying idea is to reduce the illegal connections by 1,000 during 1972
and eliminate them all in 1973.
3.06      As already mentioned (see paragraph 1.06), there is an ambitious
meter installation program, which would be carried forward even faster with
the proposed loan, that is expected to result in substantial reduction in the
percentage of unaccounted for water as follows:
1973                     46%
1974                     42%
1975                     37%
1976 and thereafter      35%
3.07      Bad debts are about 10% of billings.  This high percentage can be
reduced to normal levels as soon as a determined and unbending "cut-off"
policy is implemented. This will have to wait, in all probability, until the
new corporation is formed and new management appointed. For projection pur-
poses, uncollectibles were estimated at 10% of billings for 1972 and 1973,
5% for 1974 and 2.5% thereafter.
A.countius. Isw.utori.s and Audit
3.08      The accounting function is centralized at Acuadelma's main office
in Santa Marta. Accounting is done on an accrual basis. A trial balance is
prepared monthly, and at the end of the fiscal period a balance sheet and a
profit and loss statement are prepared. There are no individual balance
sheets prepared for the various water supply and sewerage systems, as they
do not have assets or liabilities nor Juridical representation of their own.
However, individual proforma profit and loss statements are loosely prepared.
The accounting system is relatively sophisticated, but it is not used as a
managerial tool. It has some weak points; the provision for bad debts is in-
adequate, inventory control is non-existent, asset value and depreciation re-
serves are unrealistically low. The internal auditor is concerned with the
avoidance of fraud rather than budget enforcement and control from a manage-
rial view point. Management assistance will be provided by the management
consultants (see paragraph below) under the general management assistance
programs of this proposed loan.
3.09      During negotiations, INSFOPAL agreed to employ management consultants
to recommend upon organization and finances, accountancy, and budget planning
of the new Empresa.
3.10      There is no commercial auditing of the Empresa.  Commercial auditors
acceptable to the Bank, for either organizational alternative, would be em-
ployed (General Condition).

IV. FINANCES
Past Finances
4.01      Acuadelma has incurred increasing yearly deficit, as shown by the
following figures (Appendix S-7):
Acuadelma's net deficit
Col$ million
1966                             2.2
1968                             5.8
1969                             7.2
1970                             7.2
Acuadelma's liquidity is poor (the current ratio is less than unity). The
present long-term debt of almost Col$18 million would be disastrously heavy
were it not for INSFOPAl's transfers of funds that maintain the cash posi-
tion in equilibrium.
4.02      Santa Marta's water supply and sewerage system weighs heavily in
Acuadelma's finances. Its 1970 revenues of approximately Col$5.9 million ac-
counted for more than half of Acuadelma's total revenues. It is difficult
to assess the past financial performance of Santa Marta. As mentioned, there
are no balance sheets prepared that would reflect the changes in its asset,
debt and capital structure. The cash flow figures for 1969-1971 (Appendix
S-8) are reconstructed and should be interpreted with reserve. Santa Marta's
unaudited operating results have been as follows:

The principal causes of these bleak operating results were very poor manage-
ment, extraordinarily high personnel expenses, and unbilled or uncollected
water services. Sewerage works in 1969-71 (Col$11.4 million) were financed
entirely by INSFOPAL transfers. Administrative expenses seem to be diffi-
cult to cut. Future operating expenses should be stabilized at tolerable
levels.

Inter-American Development Bank debt into Acuadelma's shares or into shares of
the new entity. Col$2.2 million are owed to the Instituto de Credito Terri-
torial for sewerage investments which are presently under construction. The
debt to the Instituto would be assumed by INSFOPAL. For the purpose of the
financial projections, the long-term debt has not been included.
Tariffs
4.06      To meet the proposed financing plan; tariffs would be adjusted on
August 1, 1972 to produce an average water supply tariff of Col$1.32/m3 and a
sewerage surcharge of 50% of the water bill, (Condition of Effectiveness) by
mid-1973, to produce an average water supply tariff of Col$1.45/m3 and to
produce an operating ratio (excluding depreciation) not higher than 65% in
1974 and 1975 and 60% thereafter.
Future Finances
4.07      If the financing plan is followed (and tariffs increased as required),
the future finances of the Empresa should be sound (the internal cash genera-
tion will increase from Col$0.7 million in 1971 to Col$7.8 million in 1976)
and further investments could be undertaken. The projected income and expense

V. AGREEKENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      In addition to the General Conditions applicable to all seven pro-
jects, assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the following
Specific Conditions will be included in the subsidiary loan agreement between
INSFOPAL and beneficiary:
(i)  An Empresa would be formed to administer the water supply
and sewerage system of the City of Santa Marta.  All assets
operated by the above system would be contributed to and
form part of the new Empresa, its bylaws would be sent to
INSFOPAL as Conditions of Effectiveness (paragraph 3.01);
(ii) INSFOPAL and the Empresa will complete in 1973 a groundwater-
study enabling them to make a decision as to the best water
source alternative, between superficial and groundwater
(paragraph 2.04);
(iii)  The sewerage works not included in the World Bank loan and
the financial obligations associated with such works will
be executed and contracted to the satisfaction of INSFOPAL
and the World Bank (paragraph 2.01);
(iv) Tariffs would be adjusted to produce an average water supply
rate of Col$1.32/m3 and a sewerage rate surcharge of 50% of
the water supply bill, as a condition of effectiveness and to
produce, in mid-1973, an average water supply rate of Col$1.45/m3
and to produce an operating ratio, excluding depreciation, not
higher than 65% in 1974 and 1975 and 60% thereafter (paragraph
4.06).
5.02      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$0.43
million for a term of 25 years including a 4-year grace period.

PROJECT FACIIITIES
Ecisting Sources
The principal source of water is the Manzanares River.   The
diverted raw water is gravity-fed to the treatment plant by a 14-, 16-,
and 18-inch asbestos-cement main 10 Jun long with a capacity of 400 1/sec
(the river's minimum flow).   This main was built in 1968 to replace an
old pumping system, and its capacity is not fully utilized because the
treatment plant's nominal capacity is 240 1/sec.   Two wells, each of
55 1jsec capacity, are the second source of water.   The groundwater is
pumped directly into the distribution network without chlorination or
treatment.   Both wells are sand producers, probably because of the
strainers used (field-perforated pipe) and high pumping rates.
Existing Treatment Plant
The Mamotoco treatment plant has a 240 1/sec nominal capacity
(1951 increase).   Raw water enters the mixing changer, where alum and
other chemicals are added.  Because the dosage equipment is too small
and frequent power cuts occur, chemicals are hand-fed.   The flow passes
over a triangular measuring weir (submerged and not functioning) to
reach the baffled flocculation basin.
The original treatment plant was built in 1933.  In 1951
sedimentation and filtering basins were added.   Because of lack of
conduit and filtering capacity, same 2 to 5X of sedimented water is
spilled.   Floc formation is inadequate because of power failures,
lack of control (manual feeding) and operating over-capacity.
The filters have a total area of about 170 m2 with a filtra-
tion rate of 2 gal/min/ft2 (5 m/h) and produce nominally 240 1/sec.
Estimated peak flow is limited to 320 1/sec, presumably by the capacity
of the sedimentation basin and filter connections.
There are two clear-water tanks at an elevation of 50 m, with
3,000 m3 total capacity.   Flows are measured by two Venturi meters, but
only one works and its recording range is exceeded.   The total daily
production is estimated as twice the volume recorded by the meter in
operation.
Chlorine is added after the filters and residuals are said to
be maintained in the distribution system.  Actually residuals are not
checked.   The zone supplied with water fram the wells does not have
chlorinated water.



Appendix S-1
Page 2 of 4 pages
Existing Distribution System
The distribution system is connected to the plant by two 16-inch
pipes. The main grid consists of 10- and 8-inch pipes. There are low
pressure problems in some areas of the network. A small pumping station,
located to the north of the city, supplies about 500 m /day of potable
water to Taganga. No detailed pipe inventory is available but the total
pipe length is estimated to be 150 kmn.
Treatment Plant Modifications and Ground Water Alternative
The consultants prepared some preliminary estimates of changes
and additions necessary to improve the treatment plant and satisfy
Santa Marta's water demand. The existence of the recently (1968) built
raw-water gravity-flow pipeline, with a capacity of 400 llsec, led to a
decision to increase the treatment plant's capacity frcm 240 1/sec to
4,00 1/sec. The main modifications consist of:
(a) increasing the capacity of the mixing chamber;
(b)  replacing the chemical dosage equipnent and mixers
with equipment of greater capacity;
(c) replacing the raw-water weir by another measuring device,
possibly a Parshall flume;
(d) raising the walls of the canals and basins at critical
points;
(e) increasing the capacity of the flocculation basin;
(f) eliminating hydraulic restriction between sedimentation
basins and filters;
(g) reconstructing the rapid sand-filters, replacing filter
media and bottoms, rate controllers, control equipment
and much of the piping;
(h) changing the recording equipment for the Venturi meters
for treated water;
(i) adding equipment to the laboratory.
It is possible that ground water is an economic alternative to modification
of the treatment plant, and this will be studied early in the project period.
If the study so indicates, wells of a total capacity of about 300 1/sec
would be constructed in lieu of modifying the plant, and the treatment
plant would be abandoned during project period.



Appendix S-1
Page 3 of 4 pages
For the treatment plant alternative, design will be finalized
during the third quarter of 1972 and orders for the equipment placed in
1972. The plant will be modified in 1973 without service interruption.
New Transmission System
To carry the increased flow of treated water to the city for
the treatment plant alternative, one 18-inch asbestos-cement main of
240 1/sec capacity will be constructed between the plant and the now
storage tank, and another 24-inch asbestos-cement pipe of 480 1/sec capacity
from the plant to the distribution system. The total peak capacity will be
720 1/sec. To improve pressures in the distribution system, a 16-inch main
will be laid along Calle 22; other improvements will be recommended in a
distribution system study awarded to the consultants by INSFOPAL.  Should
the ground-water alternative be selected, the scope and configuration of
the proposed transmission system would be revised.
The estimited quantities and costs of transmission and distri-
bution system piping to be constructed as part of the treatment plant
alternative are listed below; accessories, valves and paving replacement
are included in the cost. Costs would be slightly lower under the ground
water alternative.

A treated water storage tank of 3,000 m capacity will be con-

distribution from future wells. A second tank will be constructed at a
later date.
Existing Sewerage System
The present system is a sanitary sewerage system. Storm-water
drains along the streets down to the seashore, where short culverts convey
the water from streets to shoreline.



Appendix S-1
Page 4 of h pages
The sewers drain by gravity to a pumping station, close to
the docks; from there the sewage is pumped to Taganga Bay, opposite
Santa Marta Bay. The same point is used also for garbage disposal.
Garbage is the main nuisance and source of pollution, as currents carry
the sewage out to sea. Sane solid wastes have been reported at Taganga.
A brewery discharges its treated wastes into the Manzanares River.

balanced to maximize the number of connections, and hence, the revenue
production capability of the investment. INSFOPAL has agreed to review
the proposed program with the Bank prior to implementation.

ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
The economic rate of return is at least 13.4%.
The economic return calculation considers as benefits the incre-
mental revenues earned as a result of the project, and oonsiders as costs the
project cost, its operating cost and the capital and operating cost of
the additional works conetructed to utilize the project fully. The cost
of making water supply connections is approximately equal to the connec-
tion fees, hence neither their cost nor their benefits enter the calcula-
tion. Operating costs are taken net of depreciation.
The following assumptions have been made for the calculations
shown on page 3t
(i) The project's life is 50 years after the main
investnent period ends.
(ii) The projected volumes sold are shown in Annex S-2.
(iii) Since there is no excess capacity at present, all
additional water sold is attributed to the project.
(iv) Total incremental volume attributable to the project
is multiplied by the water gupply tariff expected
to be enforced and a 50% sewerage surcharge is added
only for subscribers with both water supply and
sewerage connections. The results are expressed in
1972 prices by applying the deflating coefficients
explained below.
(v) Only the incremental operating costs are charged to
the project. To obtain the operating costs net of
inflation, the 1973 operating cost is divided by 1.10,
which is thought to be the relevant inflation factor.
The 1974 cost is divided by (1.10)2, and the operating
costs thereafter by (1.10)-.  The incremental operating
cost is then the difference between these adjusted
operating costs and the 1972 operating cost.



Appendix S-3
Page 2 of 3 pages
(vi)  The costs of works are shown in Appendix S-4 and
are converted into constant 1972 prices by applying
the same inflation factor. Relatively large follow-
up investments have to be made from 1975 to 1979
to meet growing demand. When investments aim at
improving service only to existing customers, the
costs are not charged to the project. The tax com-
ponent is negligible as project items are imported
free of duty, and no domestic taxes are levied.
As is shown in Annex 13, the project has a low probability of
achieving all objections. It is therefore thought that the investment
costs might increase by as much as 15%, in which case the economic rate
of return would fall to 13.8%. However, the public's high acceptance level
of rate increases would probably limit the drop of incremental reserves to
10%, in which case the return would be 13.2%. The rates of return are high,
due to a pared investment program which leaves little excess capacity.
Another reason for the high rates of return is the fact that all the invest-
ments are for water supply which tend to be more remunerative than sewerage
investments. Losses of water are projected to fall from 55% at present to
30% by 1980, with a corresponding improvement in the rate of return.
