        aims to assist in raising productivity, employment, incomes\n            and living standards and to develop a replicable model for\n            rural development for other districts in Sri Lanka. The\n            project will provide for rehabilitation of existing\n            irrigation schemes accompanied by improved water management\n            practices to fully exploit the irrigation potential, and for\n            programs for replanting/underplanting, intercropping and\n            fertilizing of smallholder coconut plantations. The project\n            will also strengthen agricultural extension services,\n            improve the supply of input services such as fertilizer\n            distribution and seeds supplies, and lay the foundation for\n            a viable agriculture credit system. These directly\n            productive investments will be complemented by investments\n            in transportation, health, education, water supply and rural electrification."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
