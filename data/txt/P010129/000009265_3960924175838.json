{"cdata!": "The Kurunegala Rural Development Project\n            in Sri Lanka was achieved. However, implementation did not\n            progress as anticipated particularly in the initial period\n            and the project closing date was extended twice by one year\n            in order to achieve most of the set targets. The main reason\n            for the slow start-up was a fourteen-month delay in the\n            procurement of equipment and vehicles, which affected staff\n            mobility and execution of work. This was mostly due to the\n            inexperience of Agencies' staff with the Bank's\n            International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. The\n            other important reason for delay was a serious manpower\n            shortage in the main implementing agency, i.e., the\n            Department of Irrigation which slowed down identification of\n            tanks and design of rehabilitation work. Most of the project\n            implementation difficulties could have been avoided through\n            more detailed project preparation efforts. In particular,\n            more attention should have been given to the strengthening\n            of the Department of Irrigation and to ensuring better\n            inter-agency coordination. The fact that the officials of\n            the agencies involved in project implementation were not\n            familiar with ICB procedures should have been recognized and\n            technical assistance and/or training provided."}, "docdt": "1989-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
