It assesses\n            the outcome, impact, and sustainability of the major\n            productive components of the two projects. From a\n            quantitative and qualitative viewpoint, it found the\n            projects' performance to be mixed. The ERRs (Economic\n            Rate for Return) for the productive components were\n            generally below the traditional cutoff point for a\n            satisfactory rating. In addition, the quality of the initial\n            rehabilitation works was poor and the subsequent O&M\n            (Operation and Maintenance) insufficient. The primary\n            problems behind the poor performance were: 1) overly\n            optimistic SAR targets; 2) over-attribution of production\n            increases to project actions; and 3) lack of beneficiary\n            involvement, poor supervision, and an absence of\n            transitional planning. Despite these shortcomings, some\n            success did emerge. First, paddy yields in the small\n            irrigation schemes rehabilitated under the projects proved\n            to be above average for the districts and had increased more\n            rapidly than in the country as a whole. Second, the\n            infrastructure projects provided significant benefits.\n            Lastly, the line agencies involved in implementing the\n            projects expanded their implementation capacity\n            considerably. Overall, the impact of the projects can be\n            considered marginally satisfactory."}, "docdt": "1997-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
