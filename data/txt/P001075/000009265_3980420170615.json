is to alleviate\n            the effects of poverty and improve health by increasing\n            access to safe and affordable water and sanitation; to\n            encourage private sector participation; and to ensure\n            sustainability by improving water pricing and cost recovery\n            and developing Guinea's water sector regulatory and\n            planning capacity. Specific project objectives are (1) to\n            improve Guinea's urban and rural water resource\n            management; (2) to build institutional capacity by\n            strengthening the National Service of Hydraulics (SONEG),\n            and developing its activities in urban water distribution,\n            increasing coverage in Conakry and metered connectins; and\n            (3) to rehabilitate and extend Conakry's sewerage and\n            to contribute to improvements in environmental quality,\n            through constructing, rehabilitating, and extending the\n            existing network; and by training private local contractors.\n            The operation's three components are: (1)\n            rehabilitating and expanding Conakry's water supply\n            network, constructing two storage reservoirs, installing\n            household connections, strengthening SONEG's regulatory\n            and policy capacity, and assisting it with preparing an\n            urban water strategy and negotiating a new management\n            contract; (2) arranging a cost recovery study among other\n            detailed studies and recruiting a private operator to run\n            the sewage service, promoting proper techniques, training,\n            and support to rehabilitate and construct on-site systems,\n            rehabilitating and maintaining the existing Conakry sewerage\n            system, constructing a sewage treatment facility, and\n            rehabilitating a waste stabilization pond for sludge and\n            sewage treatment; (3) organizing a Natural Water Resources\n            Management Workshop as a basis for an integrated strategy,\n            technical assistance to revise water legislation,\n            strengthening human resources and institutional capacity,\n            and promoting regional river basin cooperation."}, "docdt": "1997-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
