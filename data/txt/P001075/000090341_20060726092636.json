was\n            unsatisfactory, the sustainability was highly unlikely, the\n            institutional development impact was negligible, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the project: The Third Water and\n            Sanitation Project--which built on the experience of a prior\n            successful project-shows that strong and continuous\n            political will is as essential for consolidating and\n            deepening reforms, as for initiating them. The\n            lease/affermage arrangements did not entail major investment\n            risks for the private partners, but the investment climate\n            in the country and the general trend of international\n            operators to limit their international exposure influenced\n            the strategy of Guinean Water Operation Company\n            (SEEG's) shareholders. Whereas the prior project\n            mobilized many donors, this project was purely a Bank\n            operation. Other (bilateral and multinational) donors were\n            expected to step in later and specifically after the closure\n            of the new contractual arrangements in urban water supply.\n            The unsatisfactory Bank performance reflects the ambiguous\n            message conveyed to the Government during project\n            implementation. The Bank's supplemental financing did\n            not help to strengthen the reform process and actually gave\n            the wrong signal to the Government."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
