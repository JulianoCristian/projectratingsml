Lessons suggest that the original\n            project design included too many individual studies in the\n            case of transport; conversely, the revision of the urban\n            program was too concentrated, dependent solely on the\n            performance of one contractor who under-performed. As it\n            turned out, a limited number of experts were recruited, who\n            established, and integrated the various urban, and transport\n            sector outputs into an overall strategy, and investment\n            plan. Despite more intensive management, this approach\n            reduced the risk of poor performance, and forced an active\n            involvement in strategy development. Furthermore, the\n            persistent participatory approach taken by the coordination\n            unit, as it relates to those working groups which were not\n            functional in some sub-sectors, proved successful, in that\n            its effective control was conducive to a more open dialogue\n            on the urban strategy, raised the level of commitment, and\n            allowed private participation. By and large, the success of\n            the coordination unit lies in the fact that it operated\n            independently from the Government, but the level of\n            flexibility, endurance, and diplomacy is the unique merit of\n            the individuals within the coordination unit. However, the\n            exclusive focus on sector policy, and institutional reform,\n            prevented a major accompanying investment package, which\n            limited leverage in assuring long term application of policy reforms."}, "docdt": "2000-08-14T00:00:00Z"}
