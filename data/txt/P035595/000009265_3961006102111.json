objectives of the Transport Sector\n            Technical Assistance Project are to: 1) strengthen the\n            institutional management capacity of the Borrower's\n            transport and urban sectors; 2) establish a transport sector\n            strategy and an investment plan, including the promotion of\n            improved sector efficiency, increased competition, reduction\n            of transport costs, and the decrease in subsidies to public\n            enterprises in the transport sector; 3) prepare the\n            transport sector restructuring plan; 4) establish an urban\n            sector development strategy and an investment plan aimed at\n            improving urban investment planning, urban budgeting,\n            management of existing infrastructure in Libreville, and\n            urban land tenure system; and 5) execute an urban\n            infrastructure improvement program in Libreville using\n            labor-based methods. The project will consist of: a) policy\n            support, institutional development activities and\n            preparation of investment plans; b) execution of a pilot\n            operation to test the use of labor-based methods in urban\n            civil works; and c) equipment and financing of incremental\n            operating costs related to project management."}, "docdt": "1994-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
