PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
ZAMBIA - SECOND PROGRAM LOAN
(LOAN 1322-ZA)
PREFACE
This report presents an audit of performance under the Second
Program Loan to Zambia (Loan 1322-ZA). The loan, in an amount of
US$30 million, was approved in September 1976 and fully disbursed by
February 1977.
The audit memorandum is based on the attached Program Comple-
tion Report (PCR) prepared by the Bank's East Africa Regional Office,
file research and discussions with Bank staff. OED finds the PCR com-
prehensive and accurate; the memorandum elaborates on the issue of tying
the loan with negotiations between the Government of Zambia and the IMF,
as well as on the usefulness of creating a special project account to
receive counterpart funds generated by the loan. No comments were
received from the Borrower.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
ZAMBIA - SECOND PROGRAM LOAN
(LOAN 1322-ZA)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.          This was the second of two program loans made by the Bank to the
Republic of Zambia in 1973 and 1976 respectively, to help the country
overcome difficulties originating in a drop in copper prices.
2.          The approval of the program loan was tied to the conclusion
of a standby agreement between the IMF and the Government of Zambia, and,
as a result, was delayed. However, given the continuance of low copper
prices, the loan served the objective of providing the country quick-
disbursing funds to finance essential imports during a period of serious
foreign exchange stringency.
3.          The main policy objectives of the loan were not fully met.
The Government did raise agricultural produce prices, which was one of
the policy objectives of the loan and which is expected to have a long-
term impact on the country's growth. In the short run, though, given
the budgetary constraints and the related austerity measures agreed with
the IMF, the objective of reorienting the emphasis and perspective of
the government towards agriculture and rural development and strengthening
agricultural services would have necessitated budgetary reallocations
which proved impossible for the Government to implement (vide para. 5.10
of PPAM).
4.          Other points of interest are:
- creating a Project Account to receive counterpart funds
generated by the sale of foreign exchange disbursed under
the loan does not appear to have served any useful purpose
(vide para. 5.04 of PPAM, paragraphs 32 and 33 of PCR);
- impossibility of allocating counterpart funds to the sup-
plementary categories of the recurrent and capital budgets
of the Ministry of Rural Development because of the late
timing of loan approval (vide para. 5.04 of PPAM, para. 36
of PCR);
- doubt about the usefulness of linking the approval of the
loan to an agreement between the Government and the IMF
(PPAM para 5.05); and
- lack of follow-up on the suggestion of creating a stabiliza-
tion account (development equalization account) to receive
excess public resources during periods of high copper prices
(vide para. 5.06 of PPAM, paragraphs 29 to 31 of PCR).






PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
ZAMBIA - SECOND PROGRAM LOAN
(LOAN 1322-ZA)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Loan 1322-ZA in an amount of US$30 million was the second program
loan made by the Bank to the Republic of Zambia. It was approved in
September 1976, committed in October 1976 and closed fully disbursed in
June 1977; it followed a first program loan (Loan 911-ZA) in a like amount
made in 1973.
1.02      At the request of the Government, the balance of the first loan (58%)
was cancelled in June 1974, following a sharp upturn in copper prices whose
previous decline had provided the rationale for Bank assistance. An Audit
Report covering this first loan (SecM77-165) was distributed to the Board
on March 8, 1977. Apart from the totally unexpected upturn in copper prices,
this first loan was marked by procedural difficulties which led to slow
disbursement, as well as by the fact that the Government did not open a
special account to hold counterpart funds as required by the loan agree-
ment.
II. THE SHORT-TERM DIFFICULTIES
2.01      The second Program Loan (under review) was made in the context
of a particularly severe economic crisis which has only deepened since
then. The recovery in copper prices which had led to the cancellation
of part of the first loan turned out to be short-lived. After having reached
a peak of US$1.38 a lb in April 1974, the price of copper on the London
Metal Exchange (LME) slumped even more rapidly than it had climbed before,
oscillating since the beginning of 1975 around 60 cents a lb, except for
April-September 1976 when it was around 70 cents a lb (see chart Annex I).
Low copper prices have been particularly detrimental to the Zambian economy,
owing to the latter's heavy reliance on copper mining which alone accounts
for 95% of total export earnings and as much as 45% of public revenues
during high copper price periods. This has made the economy highly
vulnerable to fluctuations in copper prices on the international market
upon which Zambia has little or no control even though it provides more
than 15% of the world's total copper exports. The Government's mining



revenues have suffered most from such large swings in copper prices,
being based almost entirely on mining companies' income taxes whose
volatility is higher than that of export earnings themselves.
2.02      During 1975 Zambia's export earnings from copper dropped by 45%
compared with 1974. Moreover, the value of imports continued to progress
on the basis of past growth, exceeding exports for the first time in the
country's history (PCR, para. 7). These developments led to a current account
deficit of US$610 million which Zambia was unable to finance in its entirety,
causing arrears in payments for imports and private transfers to accumulate.
As a result of lower copper prices, the mining revenues of the Government
dropped by 83% between 1974 and 1975, i.e., by the equivalent of 75% of the
loss in the country's copper export earnings between these two years, indicat-
ing that the Government Budget absorbed most of the impact of the lower
copper prices. This was, however, attenuated to some extent by the contin-
uous improvemant in the Government non-mineral tax performance, as suggested
by the following table:

2.03      Considering the gravity of the foreign exchange situation (by the
end of 1975 international [gross] reserves were down to slightly above one
month's imports) and the apparent persistence of low copper prices, the Govern-



-3-
ment requested the Bank in September 1975 to make a second program loan.
Preappraisal and appraisal missions visited Zambia in November 1975 and
February 1976, respectively. The Government was at the same time negotiating
a standby agreement with the IMF to bridge part of the 1976 current account
deficit on the balance of payments (US$300-400 million); this standby agre 7
ment.was to cover drawings from the second and part of the third tranches.-
In this context. the Bank made it clear to the Government of Zambia that a
satisfactory agreement had to be reached with the Fund before a program loan
could be made..
2.04      To meet the budgetary crisis, the Government announced in January
1976 a number of austerity measures, including in particular a 10% reduc-
tion in recurrent expenditure (to be achieved mainly through a cut in
subsidies on food items and fertilizers) and a 36% reduction in capital
expenditures; the Government also raised the price of a number of important
farming products (see paras. 10 and 11 of PCR). These measures, however,
fell short of IMF requirements, and negotiations (in particular, regarding
the need for devaluing the Kwacha) continued until July 1976 when agree-
ment was reached in an amount equivalent to US$61 million on a standby.
agreement for a period of one year. This standby became effective in
August 1976; the Bank program loan was approved in September 1976 and
became effective in October 1976.
2.05      The Bank loan was intended to finance the importation of essential
goods, including intermediate and capital goods, required to maintain a
reasonable level of economic activity. The loan was also meant to support an
appropriate public investment program through the use of counterpart funds
generated by the sale of the foreign exchange under the loan to private and
parastatal entities; these funds were to be deposited in a special project
account to be created with the Central Bank and transferred periodically to
cover expenditures under specified categories of the 1976 capital budget as
well as under a supplementary recurrent and capital,budget for the Ministry of
Rural Development and provincial Cabinet offices. -
III. THE LOAN'S LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES
3.01      When the loan was made, it appeared that the crisis which Zambia
was passing through was essentially of a cyclical (short-term) nature and
1/ During 1975, Zambia had already drawn US$67 million ($22 million net) from
the first credit tranche and the oil and compensatory financing facilities
of the IMF.
2/ During negotiations, the Government had agreed to approve this supple-
mentary budget which was to increase its 1976 budgetary allocations for
rural development in amounts equivalent to 2.8% of the original alloca-
tion on current account and 21% of that on capital account.



that therefore, its solution naturally fell within the jurisdiction of
the Fund. However, a number of structural imbalances generated by the
extreme dualism of the economy aggravated the impact of short-term
difficulties and, in consideration of their impact on the development
process, justified the Bank's assistance. A posteriori, copper prices
have not recovered and the deterioration in Zambia's terms of trade
now appears more persistent than was originally expected.
3.02      The Zambian economy has been characterized by a sharp dualism
between an urban sector dominated by mining activities and a largely under-
developed agricultural sector. Until the second program loan was made,
most of the resources generated by copper mining were transferred to the
urban sector (by way of either consumer subsidies or fixed investment),
and the Government's action in improving the agricultural sector was con-
sidered by the Bank as inadequate.   The country's dependence on mining
made the economy vulnerable to erratic fluctuations in copper prices,
affecting most particularly public revenue. Since the beginning of the
decade the Government has endeavoured to diversify its sources of revenue
(vide Table 1, p. 3); in 1976, non-mineral Government revenues accounted
for approximately 28% of GDP, compared to 16% in 1971. This increase,
however, was neutralized by a commensurate growth in recurrent expendi-
tures (of which consumer subsidies were an increasing item), leaving
little resources available for development purposes. 1/ Moreover, imple-
mentation of development programs was constantly hindered by the "stop-go"
pattern dictated by copper price cycles.
3.03      These considerations pointed to the need to diversify the
economy away from copper mining by developing the country's agricult-
ural potential so as to create conditions for stable development as
well as to bridge the urban-rural income gap which had been increasing.
The performance of the Government with regard to the policies in the
agricultural sector had been below potential. While the issue had
been raised in general terms when the first program loan was made,
the dialogue between the Bank and the Government which took place on
the occasion of the second loan was more focused, emphasizing policy
measures necessary to develop agriculture as well as ways to improve the
the management of public financial resources. The understandings which
had been reached during negotiations between the Government and the
Bank on these two matters were recorded in supplemental letters from
the Government, signed along with the Loan Agreement.
3.04     As regards agriculture, the discussions were conducted on the
basis of conclusions of the Bank's 1975 Agricultural and Rural Sector Survey
1/ Government savings during the 1971-76 period averaged less than 2% of
total revenues (i.e. less than 1/2% of GDP).



- 5 -
(Report No. 841a-ZA) which had been discussed with the Zambian authorities.
The Government concurred with the two-pronged strategy proposed in the
report: In the short run increases in output were to be obtained through
policy improvements - mostly price adjustments; agricultural prices, which
are kept under Government control through (parastatal) monopoly
marketing boards, had been allowed to drift substantially below
border prices, thus discouraging domestic production and encouraging sale
of higher-priced imports at subsidized prices. In a longer term per-
spective, increased production was to stem from a transformation of the
traditional (mainly subsistence) sector. This, in turn, was to require
increased budgetary allocation of investment and recurrent resources, as
well as a number of ancillary institutional changes. In this regard, the
Agricultural and Rural Sector Survey had emphasized the need for strength-
ening administrative services dealing with agriculture and rural develop-
ment and promoting a greater decentralization of decision making and
implementation responsibilities to the provinces.
3.05     The Government indicted during loan negotiations that it intended
to strengthen the Ministry of Rural Development as well1las the provincial
administrative structures related to rural development;-     technical
assistance for this was to be contracted under bilateral arrangement.
The Government was also to set up an interministerial working group with
the task of drawing up a program to reorganize these services; recoumenda-
tions from this working group were expected within three to four months
(i.e. early 1977).
3.06     As regards the management of public financial resources, the
Bank's position was in line with that of the Fund. Apart from the imposi-
tion of credit ceilings and the requirement that the Kwacha be devalued,
the IMF had insisted that mining revenues be allocated entirely to develop-
ment budget, recurrent expenditures being entirely covered by non-mineral
revenues. On the basis of budgeted expenses and continued improvement in
tax collection, this objective was attainable in 1976. In addition, the
Government agreed to establish a special Development Equalization Account
which was to finance development expenditures in years when mining revenue
would be insufficient, and receive excess balances from mining revenue
during periods of higher copper prices. By producing steady, reasonably
equalized stream of development investments, this account was meant to
foster a steady growth of the development budget, consistent with the
long-term availabliity of resources.
IV. EVOLUTION OF THE FISCAL AND PAYMENTS SITUATION
'.01     During 1976, the Government was unable to curb recurrent expen-
ditures as it had intended to; in sharp contrast with the 13% cut that was
l/   In particular, the Government intended "to establish at all provincial
headquarters planning units comprising inter alia,    Farm Management
Officers, Land Use Planning Officers, Economists, and Specialists in
Agricultural Statistics" (Supplemental letter).



-6-
budgeted, recurrent expenditures increased by almost 6%, which still
corresponded to a reduction of about 6% in real terms. This however,
was insufficient to enable the Government to adhere to the credit ceilings
imposed under its standby agreement with the IMF (see para. 17 of PCR).
4.02     As regards the balance of payments, the Zambian Government's
inability to finance its deficit through new medium-term credit
persisted, possibly as a result of its failure to obtain IMF credit.    As
a consequence, the level of arrears on payments for imported goods and
services continued to climb, reaching US$290 million by the end of 1976.
Moreover, shortfalls in net capital inflows led to a drastic cut in imports,
total imports being kept in 1976 more than 26% below the Bank's estimate of
minimum requirements for the year. These difficulties persisted through
1977 as copper prices, contrary to expectations, did not recover and pro-
duction declined as a result of the non-availability of medium-term credit,
leading to shortages of essential imports (see paras. 21 and 22 of the PCR
and Table 2 of Annex 2 of this Memorandum).
V.  ACHIEVEMENTS UNDER THE LOAN
5.01      Performance under the loan has to be reviewed with reference
to its two objectives which were (i) to contribute to bridging the 1976
current account deficit (by financing the importation of essential
intermediate and capital goods required to maintain a reasonable level
of economic production) and support an appropriate public investment
program through the use of counterpart funds generated by the sale of
foreign exchange; (ii) to support the Government's effort to diversify
the economy from copper mining and promote agricultural and rural
development.
5.02     Disbursement under the Loan and Use of the Bank Funds.   Quick dis-
bursements were clearly essential if the objectives to support the balance
of payments situation and enhance the Government's budget position during
1976 were to be achieved. To ensure quick disbursement, a special unit
was created within the Bank of Zambia whose function was to process the
necessary documentation (under the first loan, commerical banks had shown
little interest in processing application for foreign exchange purchases).
Moreover, the requirement that imports made by the public sector be obtained
through international competitive bidding was eliminated, thus simplifying
procurement procedures. These measures led to much quicker disbursement than
under the first program loan. Although no forecast of disbursements had been
made with the loan, it had been originally assumed that, given loan approval
early 1976, the loan would be fully disbursed by 1976-end. However, with
the loan approved in September 1976, 58% of the loan amount (US$17.4 million)
was disbursei b- 1976-end (see Annexes 3 and 4) and the loan was fully
disbursed within another five months (September 1976 - February).



5.03     Although the loan had not the catalytic effect which was expected
in terms of promoting the mobilization of term credit from commercial
sources, it did contribute to the financing of essential imports at a time
when shortage of foreign exchange was particularly acute, accounting for
2% of total imports in 1976 and 3% in 1977, i.e. the equivalent of 8% and
14% of net capital inflow in 1976 and 1977, respectively.
5.04     It is more difficult to assess the impact of the loan on the
allocation of public revenues. The Government opened a Project Account
with the Bank of Zambia as was required under the Loan Agreement and the
Kwacha equivalent of foreign exchange disbursed under the loan was credited
to this account. These funds were then credited to the Government's main
account to meet development expenditures under the categories specified in
the Loan Agreement (Schedule 4) (see paras. 32 and 33 of PCR); however,
funds started to reach the Project Account too late in 1976 to finance
supplementary allocations to the recurrent and capital budgets of the
Ministry of Rural Development as they were intended to (see para. 34 of
PCR). In spite of specific reporting requirements in the loan agreements,
information is available as regards the exact allocation of Bank funds
among the eligible categories of the Government capital budget for less
than half the amount of the loan. Furthermore, under the Loan Agreement,
the Govenlment was requested to have the Project Account audited by a firm
acceptable to the Bank; an audit report was prepared which does acknowledge
the proper funding of the Project Account, but fails to examine the final
utilization of funds (see para. 33 of PCR). The fungibility of public
resources makes the allocation of Bank funds among budget categories an
unimportant issue, the relevant question being the possible restructuring
of budget expenditures during the period of the loan. The budgeted share
of development expenditures channelled through the Ministry of Rural
Development remained constant at 8.2% through 1976 and 1977; however, the
lack of actual figures for 1977 prevents an assessment of the impact of
cuts in total (development) expenses on actual allocations. In any case,
the creation of a special account for counterpart funds does not appear
to have served any useful purpose.
5.05     The fact that the loan was disbursed approximately six months
later than was originally envisaged is entirely attributable to the delays,
which took place following the original identification mission, in having
the loan approved, pending the conclusion of a standby agreement with the
IMF. In themselves, these delays were not detrimental to program perfor-
mance as the balance of payments situation kept worsening during 1977 and
the Bank funds were fully utilized by February of that year. However, had

copper price projections (made in May 1976) proved correct,-/ the timing
issue would have been crucial as it was under a number of other program
loans such as the first program loan to Zambia (Loan 911-ZA) and the
second one to Korea (Loan 1219-KO). Moreover, the fact that the loan was
fully disbursed 2yen though the Government was not in a position to meet
IMF requirements- casts some doubt on the usefulness of having the approval
of the loan predicated on an agreement between the Government and the Fund.
5.06     Management of public revenues.   The use of mining revenues for
development purposes and their stabilization over time through the creation
of a Development Equalization Account have remained academic issues because
of the lack of such revenues since the loan was made. While agreeing with
the concept of a stabilization fund as suggested by the Bank and the Fund,
the Government has not yet established the account, arguing that the need
for it was not yet actual (vide para. 31 of PCR). More importantly, dis-
cussions on the subject have remained at a very general level and its
technicalities have not so far been worked out (such as the trigger

Average of first 8 months
Forecast in the past few years have been regularly biased upwards while
in fact there has been continuing recession in copper export markets.
One cent per lb difference on the price of copper represents additional
annual export earnings of approximately US$15 million for Zambia. This
suggests that if price forecast made in May 1976 had materialized in
1977, additional foreign exchange earnings would have amounted to about
US$450 million, i.e. fifteen times the amount of the loan.
2/ During 1976 Zambia was only able to draw SDR 19 million (i.e. 25% of its
quota) to which it was eligible unconditionally under the compensatory
financing facility (CFF), bringing its total drawing under this facility
to 50% of its quota. Zambia did draw another SDR 19 million under CFF
in 1977, which brought its total drawing under this facility to 75% of
its quota, this last drawing being conditional (vide para. 18 of PCR).

mechanism which would initiate/interrupt fund accumulation phases or the
use of excess balance in the account), indicating a lack of follow-up on
the Bank's part regarding this matter; the arguments for such lack of
follow-up are that projections for copper prices still do not indicate
a build-up in the account in the near future and there have been delays
in the Third National Development Plan which would provide the fram-
work for such an account. In particular, while the idea to create a
stabilization account is good, the important exercise of linking future
development expenditures with projections of the long-term trend increase
in copper revenues has not been conducted, leaving the possibility of
having the Government unprepared in case of a sudden rise in copper prices.
5.07       Agriculture.   An essential, immediate measure which the Govern-
ment agreed to consider in order to foster agricultural production was to
review producer prices with a view toward improving incentives. Price in-
creases announced in January 1976 (i.e. prior to the loan) were a step in
the right direction but proved insufficient to close the gap between the
two sets of prices. Moreover, prices announced in October 1976 (too late
in any case to have any significant impact on the farmers" decisions re-
garding their sowing operation for the 1976/77 season) were kept unchanged
in spite of the devaluation of the Kwacha. Price increases were only
announced a year later (August 1977), and again in 1978, reducing partially
the gap with border prices.
5.08      The Government set up a working group to draw up a program for
strengthening the Ministry of Rural Develppment. This working group sub-
mitted its recommendations several months behind schedule; moreover, these
recommendations do not appear to have been implemented, neither for that
matter have they been transmitted to the Bank (vide para. 26 of PCR). In
April 1977, the Government did however reinforce the Ministry of Rural
Development by increasing its focus on project identification and prepara-
tion, and adding to it a number of related services, the ministry being
now called Ministry of Lands and Agriculture (vide para. 27 of PCR).
5.09      The Bank had proposed to finance technical assistance as part of
the loan to strengthen the new Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, but the
Government was not willing to accept Bank terms for such a purpose while
bilateral grants were available. Recently the Government has been able to
obtain technical assistance (from the Canadian Government) to strengthen
the new Ministry. The Bank is in the process of preparing a technical
assistance credit for Zambia on IDA terms.
5.10      Apart from the need for the Government to improve its efforts in
agriculture, the main issue remains the feasibility of implementing far
reaching administrative reorganization and reinforcement in the midst



- 10 -
of economic difficulties. The improvements suggested in the Agricultural
and Rural Sector Report necessitated above all increased budgetary alloca-
tions on current account. A proper relationship between capital and
recurrent expenditures needs to be maintained if the Ministry of Lands and
Agriculture is to have the positive role which the Bank wanted to impart to
it. Moreover, for the rural development program to be effective it was
considered essential to decentralize the Government's decision-making and
implementation services; apart from the problem of a general shortage of
agricultural staff, decentralization would require increased allocation
of funds to maintain staff in the field in the face of the strong attraction
of higher-income urban areas. These considerations suggest a conflict
between the IMF program and the Bank's objectives in the short run, given
the acute shortage of funds which the Government was facing at the time,
unless the Government was willing to make cutbacks elsewhere. Since then,
the rise in copper prices and Government revenues which was expected has
not taken place, making it impossible for the Government to increase its
recurrent budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01      Although small in comparison with Zambia's shortfall in foreign
exchange, the progran loan played a useful purpose by financing essential
imports at a time when further import restrictions would have affected very
seriously the country's productive capacity. Administrative protedures
related to disbursement were streamlined in connection with the loan and
funds were disbursed with much greater efficiency than they had been under
the first program loan three years before, thus reaching the first objective
of the loan of assuring a prompt transfer of resources.
6.02      Persisting economic difficulties throughout 1977 made the late
approval of the loan an unimportant issue; the delays which took place in
having loan approval held up by IMF negotiations, however, could have forced
the Bank to cancel part of the loan, had economic developments, particulatly
copper prices,taken the course that was expected. This highlights the
importance of the timing question in relation to program loans, an issue
which has proved crucial in a number of other cases such as the first pro-
gram loan to Zambia (Loan 911-ZA) and the second one to Korea (Loan 1219-KO).
6.03      As regards the Bank's long-term objectives in making this loan
to Zambia, little progress could reasonably be expected from the Govern-
ment during the short period of the loan towards solving the problem of
reorienting the emphasis and perspective of its administration regarding
agriculture and rural development. Apart from the subdued performance of
the Government as regards policies suggested by the Bank and the difficulty



- 11 -
of monitoring performance under most of the measures agreed during
negotiations, the question arises as to the immediate feasibility of
the loan's objectives in the particular context in which they were set.
The Bank did achieve one policy objective which could have a long-term
impact, i.e., raising agricultural producer's prices together with
establishing a mechanism for a periodical review of these prices. On
the other hand, it is apparent that the strengthening of agricultural
services desired by the Bank was not fully compatible with short-term
budgetary constraints and the related austerity measures imposed by the
IMF, unless the Government was willing to make matching cutbacks else-
where. While the Fund was trying to impose "across the board" budgetary
cuts, the Bank clearly attempted to foster a reallocation of resources
among the different budget categories. On the basis of preliminary
figures, this does not seen to have been feasible and, in this context,
there is no indication that the creation of a project account to receive
counterpart funds generated by the sale of the loan proceeds played
any useful purpose, in the sense that it did not succeed in influencing
the allocation of internal resources.

Completion Report
Second Program Loan (Loan 3322-ZA)
Introduction
1.        The following report is based on the reports of the various pre-
appraisal and appraisal missions, the President's Report, Loan Agreement
and supplementary letters, and on the discussions and correspondence between
the Bank and the Government during the supervision of the loan. A detailed
analysis of Zambia's economy is contained in the Basic Economic Report on
Zambia (No. 1586-ZA, dated October 3, 1977).
Economic Situation Preceding the Program Loan
2.        The extent of Zambia's dependence on copper mining is illustrated
by the fact that, in 1975, a relatively unfavorable year for mining, the
sector still accounted for about one quarter of GDP, more than 90 percent
of merchandise export earnings, and 13 percent of government revenues. 1/
3.        Due largely to this reliance upon copper as the principal mover
in the economy, Zambia neglected the agricultural and rural sector. With
urban incomes on the average estimated at more than three times those in
rural areas, migration to urban centers was rapid, and by 1974 more than
35 percent of the population was urban. The overall economic performance
of agriculture, despite plentiful land resources for crops and livestock, was
disappointing. During 1965-76 agricultural output grew less than 2 percent per
annum so that the country came to rely more and more on imported food and
agricultural raw materials. In 1974, for example, approximately 40 percent
by value of Zambia's marketed food was imported. The major imports (e.g.,
beef and dairy products, wheat, edible oils and cotton) were all products
for whtich the country had significant production potential.
4.        For a long time, the Government's policies and development
strategy failed to give sufficient priority to agriculture. Farmers were
not given proper incentives to increase output, and public investment failed
to set the stage for the longer term development of the rural areas. The
prices of agricultural products, most of which are fixed by government
marketing boards, were not allowed to rise as rapidly as those of manu-
factured goods. This discouraged production and depressed farm incomes
and, with rapid rises in modern sector wages, the gap between urban and
rural areas widened. At the same time, investments in agriculture were
insufficient in volume and, over a long period, whatever schemes were
undertaken suffered from inadequate planning and implementation, largely
because of the shortage of qualified personnel and weak organization.
1/ In 1974 the mining sector accounted for more than 50 percent of govern-
ment revenues.



- 17 -
5.        Just prior to the second program loan, the Government had begun to de-
vote somewhat more attention to the rural areas and to stimulatine aericultural
development. It started a number of programs (e.g., school production
units, rural reconstruction program) aimed at reorienting attitudes, par-
ticularly among youth, toward rural work and living. There also was a
steady increase in output of a government-owned sugar plantation and factory,
which had enabled Zambia to reach self-sufficiency, as well as rice and
rainfed wheat projects and greater efforts to revive cotton and expand
edible oilseed production. These, and new policy developments in pricing
and strengthening agricultural institutions (see paras 10 and 11), were en-
couraging beginnings in turning Zambia to agriculture and reducing its
dependence on copper.
6.        After reaching an all-time high of $1.52 per lb in April 1974,
copper prices declined rapidly. The average price for 1975, $0.56 per lb,
was the lowest since 1957. This difficulty was compounded by a series of
developments adversely affecting landlocked Zambia. Until 1973, when the
border with Rhodesia was closed, the bulk of Zambia's trade was transported
through Rhodesia to and from the Mozambican ports of Beira and Nacala.
After the border's closure, the Benguela Railway and the port of Lobito
in Angola became a major route, carrying more than one half of Zambia's
total exports and a slightly smaller percentage of imports. With the war
in Angola and closure of Lobito, Zambian trade had to be diverted to other
routes once again, a difficult and expensive undertaking.
7.        Zambia's export earnings from copper in 1975 dropped by 45 percent
compared with 1974. The balance of payments on current account turned
from $75 million surplus in 1974 to a $610 million deficit in 1975.
In that year, for the first time in the country's history, the value of
goods imported exceeded exports. During the year, net foreign assets were
reduced by $236 million while $159 million in arrears in payments for
imports and private transfers were accumulated. At the end of the year,
Zambia's international reserves (gross) stood at only $149 million, the
equivalent of only slightly more than one month's imports. Net foreign
assets were negative.
8.        The impact on goverament revenues was equally devastating.
Revenues in 1975 declined by 30 percent, reflecting in part a $425 million
fall in revenue from mining (income tax, minerals tax, withholding tax on
dividends to shareholders and dividends to the government). Meanwhile,
recurrent expenditures climbed by more than 35 percent. The result was
an unprecedented $514 million budget deficit as compared to a $127 million
surplus in 1974. The government had to borrow heavily from the banking
system to finance this deficit since foreign borrowing and domestic borrow-
ing from the public were insufficient. Such year-to-year swings, due to vari-
ations in mining revenues., has made implementing an investment program and
managing the economy very difficult. Large cyclical fluctuations in invest-
ment expenditures over the years have led to excessive strains on the country's
physical and administrative capabilities at the peak of the cycle and to
difficulties in meeting high priority needs at the trough when commitments
to ongoing programs left little or no room for maneuvering in development
planning.

Background to the Loan
9.        With Zambia passing through its most severe economic crisis
since independence in 1964, and with little likelihood of improvement in
the immediate future, the government in September 1975 requested the Bank
to make a program loan. A mission, whose visit to Zambia coincided with
that of the Regional Vice President, initially appraised the request in
October-November 1975. Their discussions in Zambia focussed on the need
to (i) diversify the economy away from its dependence on copper, (ii)
bridge the urban-rural income gap by holding the line on urban wages and
promoting agricultural and rural development, and (iii) improve the manage-
ment of financial resources. Specific policy measures sought included:
(a) reducing consumer subsidies, (b) restraining urban wages, (c) restrain-
ing recurrent budget expenditures, (d) formulating a rural development
strategy and initiating a plan of action, and (e) raising agricultural
producer prices. The Finance Minister agreed at the mission's conclusion
to (a) reduce consumer subsidies by 60 percent in the next budget (announced
in January 1976), (b) announce higher agricultural prices in the budget
speech, and (c) work out the broad outlines of an agricultural action
program.
10.       In January 1976, the Government's budget advanced a series of
austerity measures, most important of which was a 10 percent reduction
in recurrent budget expenditures, achieved mainly by reducing subsidies
by 40 percent and gross capital expenditures by 36 percent, compared to
1975 (actual expenditures). Customs duties and sales, excise and income
taxes were raised and other measures to reduce demand and encourage
savings initiated. In mid-1975 the retail price of wheat flour had been in-
dreased by 85 percent, of bread by 33 percent, sugar by 14 percent and
edible oils and fats by 26 and 30 percent respectively. In February 1976,
the retail prices of other basic commodities were also increased sub-
stantially -- maize meal, the major item in the Zambian diet, by 25 per-
cent for coarse and 120 percent for refined; and fresh milk by 18 percent
(28 percent for reconstituted milk). Prices of fertilizers also increased
by 56 percent. Further, in an effort to keep wages in line with prevailing
economic conditions within the country, the Government agreed not to raise
Government employees' salaries during 1976 and 1977 and to try to hold down
wage increases in parastatal organizations. By cutting expenditures and
increasing non-mineral revenues, the Government expected to reduce its
1976 deficit by about 25 percent as compared with 1975.
11.       Reducing subsidies and raising consumer prices required con-
siderable political courage on the part of the Government and reflected
the extent of its concern about the financial crisis, as well as the need
to provide adequate price incentives for agricultural production.
12.       Following these developments, and a visit to Washington by
Zambian officials, a Bank mission went to Zambia in March to explore with
the GDvernment these measures and, particularly, its rural development
strategy to determine whether or not there were sufficient achievements
and plans to justify proceeding with a program loan. Zambian officials



- 19 -
were also advised that the country would have to make full use of
the Fund facilities available to it before the proposed program loan
could be presented to the Executive Directors. The mission, upon its
return, recommended that, depending upon the outcome of the Government's
discussions with the Fund, the Bank proceed with negotiating a program
loan of up to $35 million. The loan committee authorized negotiations
in Lusaka for a loan of $30 million.
Objectives
13.       The major objectives of the program loan essentially were two-
fold: First, over the short term, to provide foreign exchange to help
finance a minimum level of imports to (i) maintain a reasonable level of
output in agriculture, manufacturing and mining, and (ii) support an ap-
propriate Government investment program. Second, over the longer term,
the loan was to support the Government in its efforts to reduce the
economy's heavy dependence upon copper and enhance its prospects for
stable development. Negotiations for the program loan were part of a
continuing dialogue between the Government and the Bank which centered
upon diversification, particularly through promoting agricultural and
rural development. Prior to the loan, the Government had begun taking
appropriate measures, including negotiating a standby arrangement with
the IMF (see below), to reduce the short-term impact of the economic crisis.
In addition, the Government had announced its firm intention to emphasize
economic diversification, agricultural and rural development and a better
balance between the urban and rural sectors. The program loan was designed
to support these policies and to encourage the Government to undertake
specific measures in their support.
IMF
14.       In 1975, Zambia had purchased $67 million, $22 million net, from
the IMF first credit tranche, oil and compensatory financing facilities.
In April 1976, the Government and the Fund negotiated a standby arrangement
which, due to difficulties the Government had in accepting some of the Fund con-
ditions, was not approved by the Fund's Executive Board until July 21 and
did not become effective until August 1976. On July 9, Zambia announced,
"as part of a comprehensive financial program", a devaluation of the kwacha
of 20 percent.
15.       The one-year standby arrangement, covering the second and most
of the third credit tranches,was for SDR 62.0 million ($71.3 million) to
support a program designed to arrest the deteriorating balance of payments
situation and to provide the basis for increasing economic growth and
improving the balance of payments in the medium term. The measures which
the Government already had taken were considered as constituting a new
policy direction designed to gradually reduce the economy's overdependence
on copper by stimulating agricultural output, diversifying exports and re-
ducing food imports.



- 20 -
16.       Under the standby arrangement, Zambia undertook (i) not to
increase salaries of Government employees in 1976 and 1977 and to make
every effort to prevent wage increases in parastatals, (ii) adjust agri-
cultural producer prices to take account of the direct and indirect
impact of the exchange rate adjustment, (iii) spend less on subsidies8
(iv) enlarge the non-mining tax base and reduce the reliance on mineral
revenue to finance current expenditure, (v) limit the net domestic assets
of the banking system (K 710.7 million in December'-1975) to no more than
K 823.7 million up to September 30, 1976 and K 830.7 million up to
December 31, 1976,(vi) limit net credit to Government (K 317.8 million
in December 1975) to K 387.8 million and K 392.8 million respectively
(for the same two periods as in(v)), and (vii) reduce the arrears on
current international transactions (SDR 135.7 million in December 1975)
to SDR 70.0 million by December 31, 1976 and SDR 30.0 million by March 31,
1977.
17.       Over the remainder of 1976, the Government, however, was unable
to meet the credit limits or to reduce the arrears in payments as specified
in the IMF agreement. First, there was a shortfall in estimated Government
receipts (due mainly to reduced disbursements of foreign loans, which, in
turn was caused by a slowdown in the implementation of public sector capital
projects). Second, this shortfall was coupled with a more rapid than anti-
cipated increase in recurrent expenditures, largely for subsidies,
defense and debt service, which led to supplemental budget Appropria-
tions. As a consequence, the net domestic assets of the banking system by
the end of September were some K 55 million over the ceiling, and net credit
to Government K 93 million over the limit. By the end of 1976, the ceilings
were exceeded by K 144 million and K 178 million respectively. The arrears
in payments also continued to climb, reaching a level of SDR 222 million in
December 1976. Part of the reason for the continued rise in arrears was the
Zambian Government's inability to finance them through obtaining new medium-
term credit, as had been anticipated by the IMF.
18.       Despite these difficulties, Zambia's relationship with the IMF
has continued to be good. During 1977, Zambia drew an additional SDR 19
million under the IMF's Compensatory Financing Facility, raising its total
drawings under the Facility from 50 to 75 percent of its quota. Since such
a drawing is conditional, the Zambian Government had to be actively co-
operating with the Fund to find appropriate solutions to its balance of
payments problems in order to make use of the Facility. Moreover, on the
basis of the 1978 budget, the Fund and Zambia shortly will begin negotiat-
ing a new standby arrangement.
The Program Loan
19.       The Bank's Executive Directors approved the second program loan
of $30 million on September 7, 1976. The loan agreement was signed on
September 17 and became effective on October 6; disbursements started later
in the month. Compared with the difficulties experienced with disbursing
the first program loan, the second loan was drawn down rapidly and without major



- 21 -
problems. By the end of 1976, total disbursements amounted to $14.3
million. Disbursements continued at a rapid pace, and the loan was
fully disbursed in early February 1977, five months after Board approval
and four months after loan effectiveness (compared with an estimate Of
six to nine months at Board presentation). The loan's rapid disburse-
ment underlined the Government's pressing need for foreign exchange in
1976/77 to enable it to purchase essential imports.
20.       A breakdown of the disbursements under the program loan shows
that about $20 million was spent for imports of machinery and transport
equipment, $4.5 million for raw materials, $3.5 million for manufactures
and $2.0 million for chemicals. Had the loan not been made, Zambia would
have had to restrict imports of such vital goods even further than was
actually the case -- with further adverse effects upon the country's
development effort and productive capacity. The Government, in the
absence of the loan, might have postponed reducing imports for a time
by increasing its short-term borrowing -- but only by adding to the grow-
ing pressures on its balance of payments over the next few years.
21.       In any case, the untinuation of low copper prices through the
remainder of 1976 and 1977,- coupled with the shortfalls in anticipated
net capital inflows, made further reduction in imports inevitable. At
the time the loan was presented to the Board, it was estimated that a net
capital inflow of $286 million,2/ in addition to the anticipated drawings
under the IMF standby arrangement and other Fund facilities,
was needed in 1976 to maintain a reasonable level of imports and allow a
$76 million reduction in the arrears in payments. In contrast, Zambia
was able to realize only $173 million during 1976, of which disbursements
from the Bank's program loan accounted for $14.3 million.
22.       As a consequence, 1976 imports were only $836 million -- more than
26 percent below the 1975 level -- compared with the Bank's estimate of 1976
requirements of $1,135 million. In 1977, although net capital inflows fell
to an estimated $120 million (including $22 million from the IMF Compensatory
Financing Facility), imports were about the same as in the previous year.
Shortages of imported spare parts and other essential goods became increasingly
serious. Output, particularly in manufacturing, transport and construction,
declined sharply and unemployment, already uncomfortably high, rose further.
GDP, according to preliminary estimates, fell by 4 percent in 1977; the decline
would have been even more serious if agricultural production had not been at
relatively favorable levels. On the international side, gross reserves slipped
from about $149 million at the end of 1975 to about $50 million -- equivalent
to only about 3 weeks of imports -- by the end of 1977. During the same time,
arrears in payments on current account rose from SDR 135.7 million to SDR 350
million.
1/ The Bank's projected copper prices ("Price Prospects for Major Primary
Commodities", June 1976) at the time of presentation to the Board
were $0.67 per lb for 1976 and $0.80 for 1977. The actual average
prices in the two years were $0.64 and $0.59 per lb respectively.
2/ $412 million gross capital inflow, less $126 million debt repayments
(including $76 million for reducing the arrears in payments).

Policy Understandings and Actions
23.       In connection with the loan, the Bank obtained several important
understandings: First, the Government indicated that it was
taking a number of measures to strengthen key agricultural institutions.
Second, the Government agreed to review the price structure of agricultural
commodities and production inputs on a periodic basis -- at least annually --
and take whatever measures might be needed to maintain adequate price in-
centives for production. Third, the Government stated its intention to
curb recurrent budget expenditures and provide for greater stability in
its budgeting by (i) funding recurrent expenditures from non-mineral
revenues, while using all mineral revenues (and any recurrent budget
surpluses) to finance capital expenditures; and (ii) establishing a special
development equalization account in the Bank of Zambia into which mineral
revenue surpluses relative to development requirements in any year would
be deposited for use in subsequent years when there were shortfalls.
Strengthening Agricultural Institutions
24.       The need to strengthen key agricultural institutions was an
important topic in the Bank-Zambian dialogue, both preceding and following
the program loan. In a supplemental letter, the Government wrote that it
recognized "the vital importance to the country of accelerated agricultural
and rural development and as an expression of its total commitment to pro-
vide such development" was taking a number of measures with a view to
strengthening in particular the Ministry of Rural Development as well as
provincial administrative structures. Specifically, the Government reported,
first, that it was preparing an official request to the Canadian Government
(following up on an earlier informal approach) for technical assistance in
strengthening the Ministry of Rural Development's project planning capacity.
Secondly, the Government had decided to establish at all provincial head-
quarters, planning units comprising, inter alia, farm management officers,
land use planning officers, economists and agricultural statisticians.
Thirdly, the Government had set up a working group to draw up a program
for strengthening the Ministry of Rural Development and expected its re-
commendations in three or four months. After reviewing the working group's
recommendations, and in consultation with the Bank, the Government would
speedily implement all measures necessary to achieve the objectives outlined,
and request assistance, should the need arise, from the Bank in carrying out
the program.
25.       The Government did follow up its informal approach to the Canadian
Government with an official request for technical assistance in filling a
number of specific positions; the Government also requested Sweden to help
as well. The Canadian Government reportedly has approved technical assistance
to the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture in the form of one senior agri-
cultural economist who would advise the Under-Secretary for Planning and
three agricultural economists, one of whom would devote himself to project
planning and analysis, another to project management and implementation and
the third to marketing. All would be assigned to the Ministry's planning unit.



- 23 -
In addition, there would be a team coordinator who would work in the
National Planning Commission. The Zambian Government currently is re-
viewing the draft project agreement, which the Canadian Government
expects to be signed in March 1978, with personnel starting to arrive
in Zambia around June. In regard to the provincial planning units,
the Government established the requisite posts. However, none have been
filled, due largely to the scarcity of qualified Zambian manpower.
26.       Turning to strengthening the Ministry of Rural Development, the
working group in early 1977, several months behind schedule, submitted its
report to the Cabinet Office. The report, however, was not considered as
a satisfactory basis for taking any action. (The Government, in fact, has
declined to make a copy available to the Bank because it considers the
report unsatisfactory.)
27.       Nevertheless, the Government in April 1977 transformed the
Ministry of Rural Development into the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture,
sharpened its terms of reference and appointed a new, dynamic minister as
its head. However, there has to date been little improvement in the MLA's
staffing. With this new leadership and the emphasis the top leadership
now places on agriculture and rural development, the Ministry of Lands
and Agriculture has intensified identification and preparation of agri-
cultural projects. As part of this proces*, the Ministry is working
closely with the Bank; two projects have been identified, and preparation
of both is almost complete.   Other external financiers, particularly the
EEC, also are working with the Ministry in preparing and financing projects.
As a result, the pipeline of agricultural projects should increase sig-
nificantly over the next few--years.
Agricultural Prices
28.       In its dialogue with the Zambian Government, the Bank had con-
sistently advocated the use of agricultural producer prices as an important
instrument to stimulate agricultural production. During discussions lead-
ing up to the program loan, and subsequently in the Loan Agreement, the
Government committed itself to review prices of agricultural commodities
and production inputs at regular intervals and announce new prices suf-
ficiently in advance of the planting season for farmers to consider them
as part of their crop planning for the coming season. While the Government
had been reviewing agricultural prices periodically prior to the program
loan, 't had failed to maintain levels that would provide sufficient in-
centive for production. As a consequence, Zambian price levels had fallen
further and further below border prices. In January 1976, however, the
Government announced substantial rises in agricultural producer prices,
ranging from 20-56 percent. These higher prices, coupled with favorable
weather, brought 1976 agricultural crop production to record levels. Real
value added in agriculture rose by 4.6 percent with maize output increasing
by 33 percent to 8 million bags (a record level of production) and sub-
stantial increases registered in the production of other important crops --



- 24 -
rice (60 percent), groundnuts (25 percent), sunflower (50 percent)
and cotton (19 percent). Preliminary estimates for 1977 show that on
balance the level of agricultural production has been maintained: maize
output declined slightly to 7.5 million.bags (still a near-record level)
but cotton, wheat, rice, groundnuts, tea and coffee all increased. In
August 1977, producer prices were again raised by 8-25 percent for mai2e,
sunflower, groundnuts, soya beans, cotton and coffee, so that the prices
of all major agricultural commodities now are close to prevailing border
prices.
Stabilizing the Budget
29.       Planning Government expenditures in the face of widely
fluctuating copper prices and revenues has been a major problem in Zambia
(para. 8). In a second supplementary letter to the Loan Agreement, the
Government agreed to take a new approach to budgeting recurrent and
capital expenditures. In the future, mineral revenues would be treated
as a windfall gain. The Government would finance current expenditures
entirely from non-mining tax revenues, while development expenditures
would be financed from recurrent budget surpluses, mineral revenues and
domestic and foreign borrowings. Thus, when recurrent surpluses, mineral
revenues and borrowings exceed the requisite development expenditures,
Government balances would be built up. Conversely, when surpluses, mineral
revenues and borrowings were lower than needed for development, these
balances would be utilized. The Government agreed to establish a Develop-
ment Equalization Account in the Bank of Zambia to handle the surplus
balances and to commence accumulations as soon as the price of copper and
mineral revenues exceeded certain levels to be agreed upon in consultation
with the Bank.
30.       Bank staff have discussed the establishment of the account in
overall terms several times with the Government. In the absence of agreed-
upon national development objectives, overall fiscal policies and projections
of revenues and investment requirements for future years, however, it has
not been possible to discuss the policies to be followed in administering
the account nor the prices of copper and levels of mineral revenues which
would determine accumulations and decumulations of funds. Zambia's Third
National Development Plan originally was to be ready for initiation in
January 1977, but delays in preparation and in the United National
Independence Party's and the Government's deciding upon future develop-
ment objectives and strategies have forced postponement. These questions
are still under discussion, although their resolution, in the form of
either a five-year development plan or possibly a three-year "emergency
program", currently is expected around the middle of 1978.
31.       Since mineral revenues at present are nil and are expected to
remain insignificant for the immediate future, the Government has maintained
that there is no need to establish the development equalization account.
Nevertheless, the Bank has continued to urge its establishment, even though
any accumulation likely would not commence for several more years.



- 25 -
Counterpart Funds
32.       Pursuant to the Loan Agreement (Section 3.02), the Government
opened a Project Account with the Bank of Zambia into which the counter-
part funds to the foreign exchange disbursed under the loan were paid.
The Bank of Zambia regularly furnished the Bank with statements of the
account whenever there were transactions. As stipulated in the Loan
Agreement (Section 3.02 (d)), the Ministry of Finance supplied the Bank
with certificates for the months of October, November and December 1976,
showing expenditures actually made under each category of its capital
budget and supplementary budget for 1976 specified in Schedule 4 of the
Loan Agreement, and the amounts withdrawn from the Project Account in
respect of such expenditure. These amounts totalled K 11.4 million.
For the remaining K 12.5 million, which accumulated in January and
February 1977, the Ministry of Finance requested the Bank's permission
to use them for similar categories in the Government's 1977 capital
budget. The Bank agreed to this request, but suggested that part of the
remaining counterpart funds be used for an urban project for which the
Bank had made a loan and which had received an insufficient allocation
in the Government's budget. Subsequently, however, the Bank agreed that
it was not necessary to allocate counterpart funds to the urban project
in 1977, as other arrangements have been Trade to nrovide for the project's
financial needs.
33.       The Ministry of Finance informed the Bank that the K 12.5
million had been transferred from the Bank of Zambia to the Government's
main account, but has not yet submitted certificates drawing funds from
this account actually expended under each budget category, as stipulated
in Section 3.02 (d) of the Loan Agreement. The Government also has not
transmitted to the Bank certified copies of the financial statements in
connection with the project account in the Ministry of Finance, nor a
signed copy of the audit report prepared "by auditors acceptable to the
Bank" (Section 3.02 (e) of the Loan Agreement). The financial state-
ments and report were supposed to have been sent before September 30,
1977. The Government, however, did send to the Bank (in February 1978)
a copy of an auditor's report dated September 26, 1977 and addressed to
the Bank (but never received), which stated that the loan proceeds had
been "properly brought to (the project) account" and had been "treated
by the Bank of Zambia ... in compliance with the terms and conditions
relating thereto as set out in the loan agreement". The report emphasized,
though, that the auditors had not examined the application of the loan
proceeds once they had been credited to the project account.
34.       During loan negotiations, the Government had agreed to increase
its budgetary allocations for rural development by K 2.7 million in 1976
in a supplementary budget. However, as the counterpart funds started to
become available much later in the year (almost at the end) than had
originally been anticipated, the additional allocation was not made.
Moreover, the Ministry of Finance argued that in any case the Ministries
concerned would be unable to spend the additional funds effectively in the
short time remaining in the year.

Conclusion
35.       The objectives of the second program loan were: (a) over the
short term to provide foreign exchange to help finance a minimum level
of imports for maintaining a reasonable level of output and supporting
the Government's investment program, and (b) over the longer term, to
support the Government's efforts to diversify the economy and enhance
its prospects for stable development. With the country suffering through
the most severe economic crisis in its history, Zambia urgently needed
such assistance: First, it had an immediate need for foreign exchange
to help make up the shortfall in earnings from copper exports.
Second, the Government had begun to pursue a   policy of economic diver-
sification, mainly by developing agriculture, which over the longer term
would reduce Zambia's heavy dependence on copper and lessen the need for
further special assistance in the future. The program loan was important
to the latter since it gave support, at a particularly crucial time, to
the Government in what it considered to be a difficult undertaking. As
such, it was an essential link in Bank's policy dialogue with project
lending to Zambia for reducing the country's vulnerability to the vagaries
of copper production and exports.
36.       The program loan, by financing critically needed imports, un-
questionably helped Zambia maintain its economy and investment program.
Unfortunately, the loan by itself was not sufficient to cover fully the
shortfall in Zambia's requirements. As a consequence, 1976 imports were
26 percent below the 1975 level and oonsiderably less than the Bank's
estimate of requirements. Shortages of essential imported goods reduced
output, particularly in manufacturing, transport and construction, and
raised unemployment. The Government's investment program also suffered
badly. Public capital expenditures (in real terms) declined in 1976 by
38 percent, compared with 1975, and in 1977 by another 30 percent. New
projects were deferred; many ongoing projects were delayed as budget
allocations were cut. In the absence of the program loan, the deteriora-
tion, of course, would have been even more serious.
37.       The shortfall between estimated and actual external receipts
was due to (i) smaller export earnings than had been projected at the time
of the program loan, and (ii) Zambia's failure to obtain the amount of
financing from the IMF and other external sources that had been anti-
cipated. The appraisal report, for instance, projected 1976 exports at
$1,050 million, while actual exports reached only $987 million.l/ The
shortfall in capital inflows was also large. The Bank, assuming the
above figure for exports, estimated that $286 million in net capital
inflow, in addition to the anticipated drawings under the IMF stand-by
1/ Of the $1,050 million, copper exports, assuming a volume of 650,000
tons and an average price of $0.67 per lb, were projected to earn
$867 million. Although prices averaged only $0.635 per lb, actual
copper exports totaled $964 million since some 740,000 tons were
exported.

arrangement and other Fund facilities, was needed in 1976 to maintain a
reasonable level of imports ($1,135 million) and a $76 million reduction
in payments arrears.
38.       In fact, the Government was able to realize net capital inflows
of only $173 million, of which disbursements from the Bank's program loan
accounted for $14.3 million. The projections made in appraising the pro-
gram loan, of course, proved overly optimistic. Because of the shortfall
in anticipated external assistance, however, it is equally obvious that
the Bank's loan was even more crucial to helping Zambia maintain its
economy than had been expected. Moreover, the additional kwacha which
became available from the program loan as counterpart funds enabled the
Government to sustain its investment program at a level wiiich otherwise
would not have been possible -- without further increasing its already
large budget deficit. As it was, the overall 1976 deficit came to K 300.9
million ($421.3 million), compared with the budget estimate of K 249.7 million.
39.       One of the reasons for the shortfall in projected external capital
was Zambia's inability to draw upon funds from the IMF stand-by because it
could not meet the performance criteria. While it is true the Bank's pro-
gram loan was premised upon Zambia's successfully carrying out the IMF-agreed
stabilization program and using the higher credit tranches, it is difficult,
even in retrospect, to argue that the Bank's loan should have been directly
linked to drawings under the IMF stand-by. In the first place, while the
IMF's stabilization program addressed short-run balance of payments and
budgetary problems (and hence was important to Zambia's economic recovery
and to the effectiveness of Bank assistance generally); the program loan
was primarily concerned with the longer-term problems of economic diver-
sification and structural change.
40.       In the second place, the Bank and the IMF, of course, expected
Zambia to satisfy these criteria, even though it was evident that they
were difficult to meet. The Zambian Government had, after all, already
taken a number of politically difficult decisions which demonstrated its
will to deal with the crisis: it had devalued the kwacha and introduced
a number of austerity measures including reductions in recurrent expendi-
tures (mainly through subsidy cuts) and tax increases. However, the size
of the 1976 btidgetary deficit and consequent need to borrow from the
banking system were not correctly foreseen: recurrent expenditures were
higher than predicted mainly due to rising prices of goods and services
purchased by Government and increased debt service, and revenues were
lower than forecast because import restrictions reduced receipts from
customs, sales and excise taxes.
41.       Even without any drawings from the IMF stand-by, the Bank's
program loan has contributed materially to Zambia's efforts to diversify
the economy and enhance its prospects for stable development. The
country has steadily increased its commitment to these efforts and to
agricultural development as a priority objective. Agricultural crop



- 28 -
production reached record levels in 1976 following substantial in-
creases in agricultural producer prices, which now are largely eliminat-
ing the gap between domestic and world prices. The newly-created
Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, with a new, dynamic minister, has
intensified identification and preparation of agricultural projects,
working closely with the Bank and other external financiers. With re-
gard to fiscal management, the Government has continued to voice its
intention to restrain recurrent expenditures and to implement progtams
which would provide for greater stability in long-run development ex-
penditures. The Government has restrained increases in recurrent ex-
penditures in its 1977 and 1978 budgets mainly through cuts which have
reduced subsidies to slightly over half their 1975 level. Nonetheless,
the Government's performance in some areas has fallen short of expecta-
tions, and some undertakings made in connection with the program loan
have not yet been completed. There has been little or no progress in
strengthening the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture or the provincial
administrative structures. Both remain distressingly weak. The
Government has yet to establish the special development equalization
account, although both the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the
Bank of Zambia have responded favorably to the proposal. The National
Commission for Development Planning has conveyed its intention to in-
clude a stabilization scheme in the next development plan. Finally,
the certificate relating to the use of the counterpart funds in 1977
have not yet been received nor has the project account been fully
audited.
