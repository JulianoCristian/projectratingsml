satisfactory, global environmental objective\n            (GEO) outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, risk to GEO\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            scaling-up RE brings about pressures on the financial\n            situation of distribution utilities, and the power sector as\n            a whole, which require regulatory action. The potential\n            conflict between the long-term nature of RE and short-term\n            political objectives requires a sustained commitment and\n            understanding of authorities to avoid distortions in\n            programs' design and implementation. A RE program that\n            engages distribution companies from the early stage and is\n            complemented by a regulatory framework that targets barriers\n            to development and provides the right incentives is likely\n            to defeat the 'common wisdom' that distribution\n            companies are not interested in RE. Promotion of productive\n            uses of electricity can be a highly beneficial component of\n            a RE project, particularly in middle income countries where\n            a critical mass of entrepreneurs is present. Safeguard\n            issues need to be addressed thoroughly at an early stage and\n            incorporated into the project design in order to minimize\n            negative and or irreversible impacts. A precise definition\n            of key performance indicators and the accurate estimation of\n            values, as well as a flexible use of them, are requirements\n            for an effective and smooth monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2013-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
