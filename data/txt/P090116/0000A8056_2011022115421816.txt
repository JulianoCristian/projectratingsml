                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to achieve solid progress toward meeting its objectives. Project results include: (a) electricity distribution companies have completed grid extension projects to
                         serve 68,000 rural households representing more than 290,000 people, (b) the Project has received additional proposals for the installation of more than 8,000 solar home systems
                         (SHS) which are expected to be installed and operating under the supervision of electricity distribution companies by the close of the Project, and (c) The first contract under the
                         productive uses promotion pilot supported more than 1,500 rural families to improve their productivity and incomes through the adoption of electricity and the second contract is
                         expected to have assisted at least the same number of households. Additional contracts are underway or in process to enable the target of 9,000 households benefited to be met.

                         (Please note that the original estimate in the disbursements graph includes both the IBRD loan and the GEF grant, for a total of US$60 million. The formally revised disbursement
                         estimate reflects only the cost of the IBRD grant of US$50 million. This is a system generated error that will be corrected.)
