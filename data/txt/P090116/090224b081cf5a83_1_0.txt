                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project results include: (a) electricity distribution companies have completed a total of 60 rural electrification sub-projects in 15 regions, making 90,733 new household connections
                         during construction and installing the total capacity to serve 105,000 new household connections (51 grid extension sub-projects with 83,600 new households served during
                         construction and a total capacity for 97,900 connections; and 9 PV system sub-projects serving 7,100 households); (b) nine electricity distribution companies participated in the
                         Project, co-financing grid-extension and PV systems sub-projects in 16 departments; and (c) completion of 14 consultancies to promote productive uses of electricity that assisted
                         over 19,900 family production units to improve their processes using electrical equipment, increasing electricity consumption by 18.8 GWh/year and resulting in investment of US$14
                         million in electric equipment. Important progress has been made on the right-of-way payments that averaged 81% paid by May 24, 2013, and 84% paid by June 15, 2013.
