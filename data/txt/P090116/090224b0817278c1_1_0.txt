                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to make progress toward meeting its objectives, albeit facing implementation delays. Project results include: (a) electricity distribution companies have
                         completed grid extension projects to serve 78,200 rural households and the installation of 1,772 PV systems, (b) ten electricity distribution companies are participating in the Project,
                         co-financing projects based on grid extension and PV systems;and (c) five contracts under the productive uses promotion component have assisted more than 4,700 rural producers
                         to improve their productivity and incomes through electricity using equipment in Cuzco, Junin and Lima Provinces, while an additional 9 contracts are underway in these and other
                         areas. The Project is facing implementation delays, mostly related to: (i) the right-of-way payments, and (ii) the number of grid extension connections and installed PV systems.
