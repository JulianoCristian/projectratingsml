          PERU – RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT (P090116)
                        Loan Agreement No. 7366-PE
                          Extension of Closing Date
                             Grant No. 056023-PE
  Cancellation of Component 4 on Small Hydro Financing Facility (US$5 million)


A. SUMMARY

1.      The Government of Peru signed an IBRD Loan Agreement (7366-PE) for
US$50 million and GEF Grant Agreement (TF-56023 PE) for US$10 million for the
development of the Rural Electrification Project (Foner 1). The objective of the Project is
to alleviate poverty in the Borrower’s territory by increasing access to efficient and
sustainable electricity services in rural areas. The project closing date is September 30,
2012, while the GEF grant closing date is June 30, 2013.

2.      The proposed restructuring paper seeks (i) the approval of a 9-month extension
for the Loan Agreement; (ii) the cancellation of US$608,641.31 dollars from the Loan
Agreement; (iii) the cancellation of US$5 million GEF Grant Agreement, (iv) and the
cancellation of Component 4 of the Project (financing small hydropower stations). The
proposed modifications do not change the Project’s objectives, remaining project
components implementation or any other relevant aspect of it.

3.      On September 5, 2012, the Ministry of Economic and Finance (MEF) requested a
9-month extension of the closing date of the IBRD loan (the new closing date will be
June 30, 2013), in order to comply with the Bank’s safeguards policies, especially the
right-of-way payments made by the electricity distribution companies under the grid
extension subprojects (Component 1). The delays in the right-of-way payments are facing
serious risk of not being completed by the closing date of the Loan (September 30, 2012),
which has important legal implications due to non-compliance with Bank Safeguard
policies (Loan Agreement, Schedule 5). The Borrower prepared an Action Plan for the
completion of the Project within the time provided in the extension.

4.     On August 21, 2012 the MEF requested the cancellation of US$608,641.31
undisbursed balance from the Loan Agreement. According to the MEF, the amount
already disbursed is sufficient to meet the financial commitments until the closing date
and consequently such amount will not be needed.

5.      The GEF Grant Agreement allocated US$5 million for the financing of small
hydropower stations (Component 4). On July 5, 2012, the MEF requested the Bank to
cancel these funds due to the unlikelihood of implementing the Component before the
closing of the Grant Agreement in June 2013. In 2010, ten possible projects were
identified out of which three (3) presented partial documentation in the request for
presentation of projects in March 2011. To date none have complied with the
requirements for financing, including feasibility study, licenses, social and environmental
documentation and mobilization of equity investment. Given that the GEF Grant
Agreement closes in June 2013, it is very unlikely that any project is able to complete


                                            4
construction and reach the initial operation stage for which the small hydro financing
facility is designed to assist before its closing.

B. PROJECT STATUS

6.      The loan is scheduled to close on September 30, 2012 while the GEF grant is
schedule to close by June 30, 2013. As of September 10, 2012, the loan disbursements
amount to US$49.4 million, 99 percent of the loan amount. The disbursement of the GEF
grant is US$3.8 million, representing 38 percent of the grant's total (Table 1). The GEF
disbursements under Components 2 and 3 of the Project are expected to accelerate during
the remainder of the Project, particularly for the US$1 million contract for installation of
hydrometeorological stations.

7.      Component 1 is facing serious delays related to compliance of Bank safeguards
policies, particularly with the right-of-way payments made by the electricity distribution
companies. There is a high risk of non-compliance of the above mentioned policies by
the closing date of the Loan Agreement. In order to comply with them as established in
the Loan Agreement (Schedule 5), the distribution companies must complete the payment
of right-of-way before the closing date. Thirty (30) out of fifty-four (54) sub-projects
need extra time to complete these payments. According to the Action Plan, it is expected
that by March 2013, ninety two percent (92%) of the subprojects will have finished the
payment process. The remaining three (3) sub-projects are expected to finish the right-of-
way payments by June, 30 2013.

8.     Component 4 on small hydro financing facility (US$5 million) has not presented
any progress and, therefore, has not disbursed as is shown in Table 2. This Component
was not implemented, and consequently no Administrative Financial Agreement was
signed for this component. Despite the maximum effort made by the Ministry of Energy
(MEM) to implement the GEF activity, it was unable to do so for various reasons. Mainly
MEM faced challenges due to a combination of: (a) overly complex implementation



                                               5
arrangements that required restructuring before start-up; (b) introduction by the GoP in
2008 of renewable energy auctions with a premium price, that eased financing difficulties
for all but the smallest projects; and (c) the fact that the remaining small projects were
being implemented by informal sponsors who could not meet the requirements. MEM
also informally requested the Bank team to check whether it would be possible to use the
US$5 million for more hydrometeorological stations but the GEF indicated that this
would not be possible as the original funding was meant to result in direct reduction of
carbon emissions. Therefore, implementation arrangements associated to Component 4
were never created or executed.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

9.      Considering the aforementioned information the Project team recommends: (i) a
9-month extension of the closing date (June 30, 2013) to comply with the safeguards
policies as established in the Loan Agreement, as specified in the Action Plan; (ii) the
cancellation of Component 4, including modifications to relevant implementation
arrangements and related provision in the Grant and Loan Agreements; (iii) the
cancellation of US$5 million dollars from the GEF Grant; (iv) the cancellation of
US$608,641.31 from the Loan; and (v) the cancellation of Component 4 related
indicators as explained below.
                    a. Objective results indicators
                           i. MW new renewable energy generating capacity under Project:
                              This indicator can only be measured with the construction of small
                              hydro facilities. Given that MEM determined that is impossible to
                              finance any small hydropower project and that no installations will
                              be constructed, this indicator should be cancelled.
                          ii. Project-related avoided emissions (Tons of C02): This indicator
                              measures the CO2 emission avoided by the implementation of
                              small hydro facilities. Given that no small hydro power facility
                              will be installed during the project’s life that would lower CO2
                              emissions, this indicator should be cancelled.
                    b. Intermediate results indicator
                            i. MW of new small hydropower installed for electricity generation
                               to feed the grid: This indicator measures the MW produced by new
                               small hydropower installed. Considering that MEM determined
                               that it is impossible to finance any small hydropower project and
                               installations are not yet in place, this indicator should be cancelled.


                                                                                  6
10.     The Grant Agreement and the Loan Agreement will be amended to reflect the
above-mentioned changes, the revised co-financing amount, and to eliminate provisions
related to Component 4 to maintain consistency between the Agreements (Loan and
Grant Agreements).

11.    Since the project would be extended to June 30, 2013, and considering that the
cancellation of Component 4 does not affect the implementation of the remaining project
components, the Operational Manual, Procurement Plan and Safeguards documents do
not need to be modified.
