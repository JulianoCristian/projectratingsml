Subject:    Uganda - Contribution Agreement Amendment
            Economic Recovery Program
            CIDA Trust Fund 05-20852-UG
Dear Mr. Colaco:
Attached for your review and signature are two originals of a
Contribution Agreement Amendment between CIDA and the International
Development Association, extending our $ 2.5 Million Contribution to
Uganda's Economic Recovery Program from March 31, 1993 to June 30,
1993.
This Amendment coincides with the IDA's extension of the Second
Economic Recovery Credit (2087-UG) to June 30, 1993.  The additional
three more months will provide the Government of Uganda more time to
utilize the remaining balances in CIDA's Special Credit facility for
the final purchase of petroleum products.
If you concur with the attached Amendment, I would request that you
sign both originals and return one original to the undersigned.
We look forward to continuing our cooperation with the Bank and the
Government of Uganda and appreciate the assistance provided by your
officers on this Program.
Yours truly,
Stephen Free
Regional Director
Eastern Africa Program
Africa & Middle East Branch.
