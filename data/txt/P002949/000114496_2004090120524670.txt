            Re: Second Economic Recovery Credit
            Credit Number 2087-UG (Amendment)
Dear Minister Mayanja-Nkangi
      I refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the Second
Economic Recovery Credit dated February 8, 1990, between the
Republic of Uganda (the Borrower) and the International
Development Association (the Association), as amended, and to your
request for an increase in the amount of the Credit and for
imports of petroleum products.
      In order to implement your request, which we find
acceptable, we propose to amend the Development Credit Agreement,
as amended, as follows:
      Paragraph 4 (g) of Schedule I to the Development Credit
      Agreement is amended to read:
      "(g) expenditures in excess of an aggregate amount
      equivalent to SDR 35,200,000 for petroleum products"
      Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing proposed
amendment by dating and returning the enclosed copy of this letter
to us, at which the amendment shall constitute a binding agreement
between the Borrower and the Association.
Very truly yours,
International Development Association
