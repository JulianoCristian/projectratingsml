      Re:   Dutch Grant related to Credit 2087-UG
            (Second Economic Recovery Credit)
            Amendment
Dear Mr. Minister:
          We refer to the Dutch Grant Agreement for the above-
referenced Credit dated December 20, 1991 between the Republic of
Uganda (the Grantee) and the International Development Association
(the Administrator).
      Having noted the Bank of Uganda's request to increase the
authorized allocation in the special account, we propose that
paragraph I (b) of the Schedule to the Dutch Grant Agreement be
amended by increasing the authorized allocation from US$1,000,000
to US$10,000,000.
      Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing proposed
amendment by signing, dating and returning the enclosed copy of
this letter to us, at which time the amendment shall constitute a
binding agreement between the Grantee and the Administrator.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
