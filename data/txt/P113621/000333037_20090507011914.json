efforts to improve the fiscal position and increase\n            government transparency and accountability. Despite enormous\n            challenges, the Palestinian Authority (PA) continues to make\n            strides towards creating the structure of a future\n            Palestinian State. However, during the past several years\n            the political process has stagnated and there has been\n            little visible progress towards a long term peace\n            settlement. As a consequence, the economy has continued to\n            deteriorate with low investment, the productive base\n            hollowing out and per capita Gross Domestic product (GDP)\n            declining. GDP levels are only maintained through massive\n            inflows of foreign aid that has propped up consumption and\n            government spending. Despite this, the PA, with generous\n            support from the international community, has moved ahead\n            with creating the institutional structures required to\n            provide needed services to the Palestinian people. The World\n            Bank's ongoing technical assistance and budget support\n            has been instrumental to these efforts, especially in\n            helping the PA mobilize the international assistance needed\n            to fund their operations. Regular and consistent external\n            support is required to maintain momentum and World Bank\n            assistance is viewed by all donors as a strong indication\n            that the PA is fulfilling its commitments and deserves\n            continued funding."}, "docdt": "2009-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
