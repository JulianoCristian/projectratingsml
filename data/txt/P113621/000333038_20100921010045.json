           Development Plan Development Policy Grant II", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Palestinian Reform and\n            Development Plan (PRDP) and Second Development Policy Grant\n            Project for West Bank and Gaza were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            PRDP was based on optimistic assumptions with respect to the\n            easing of movement and access and other economic\n            restrictions imposed by Government of Israel (GoI). Making\n            substantial progress towards fiscal sustainability will not\n            have been possible, were it not for the shift in the\n            development strategy by the Palestinian National Authority\n            (PNA) towards community development projects which are not\n            as vulnerable to these restrictions. This shift triggered\n            some economic growth in the West Bank in 2008 and a 13\n            percent increase in gross PNA revenues in New Israeli Shekel\n            (NIS) terms. The gross revenues increased by 10.4 percent in\n            NIS terms over 2008, despite the weakness of clearance\n            revenues during first half of the year. Domestic tax\n            revenues increased by 10.3 percent, as a result of strong\n            collection efforts put in place by the ministry of finance,\n            particularly during the second half of the year, for the\n            income and property taxes and due to reforms in domestic tax\n            administration and robust economic growth. The economic\n            growth momentum achieved in 2009 appears to be continuing in\n            2010 and, if sustained, PNA gross revenues are expected to\n            exceed US$2 billion for the first time. The PNA does not\n            control its political and economic environment due to daily\n            Israeli Defence Forces incursions into Palestinian areas and\n            the erosion of Palestinian economic space through the\n            expansion of settlements. Consequently, the implementation\n            of reforms, including prior actions, may be thrown off track\n            due to these actions. Therefore, the reform process and\n            implementation calendar must demonstrate a substantial\n            degree of flexibility. Despite the challenges faced by the\n            PNA in 2009, and the continued pressures imposed by the\n            occupation, especially the emergency spending in Gaza in the\n            aftermath of Israel's military operation which raised\n            the deficit from roughly US$1.3 billion in 2008 to US$1.6\n            billion on a commitment basis in 2009, the budget execution\n            in 2009 has been very strong, partly due to the robust\n            economic growth in 2009, which is estimated at about 7\n            percent in real terms, and partly due to the number of\n            institutional and administrative reforms."}, "docdt": "2010-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
