for\n            India successfully achieved its primary objectives to\n            improve the efficiency, productivity, and capacity of the\n            Bombay Electrical Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST).\n            The project accomplished this through augmentation of the\n            bus fleet, improving maintenance, increasing average bus\n            speeds through better traffic management, and selected\n            traffic engineering works and signal systems. Achievement of\n            secondary objectives related to organizational, fiscal, and\n            management aspects of BEST was mixed. The report recommends\n            regularization of the financial and institutional\n            arrangements for bus fare revisions and funding bus\n            transport operations.  Progress was made in traffic\n            management in the Bombay Metropolitan Area, but much remains\n            to be done to achieve the full benefits of traffic\n            management. Institutional development of the Bombay\n            Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA)\n            strengthened its capacity for investment planning. One\n            lesson is that a complex set of factors affects the success\n            of efforts to improve regional investment programming,\n            including project scope and size; institutional structure;\n            the status and nature of investment and development planning\n            at the State Government level; and the status and nature of\n            policy changes sought by a Bank-funded project. The results\n            of the technical assistance and training component were\n            mixed. Due largely to institutional causes, technical\n            assistance was relatively ineffectual in some cases."}, "docdt": "1986-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
