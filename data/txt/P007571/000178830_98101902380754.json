skilled workers and\n            technicians. The program's goals are to expand the\n            output of skilled workers and technicians and to improve the\n            quality, relevance and efficiency of technical training. The\n            project would include: facilities for training teachers,\n            development of instructional materials, and program\n            administration; constructing, or remodelling, and equipping\n            of 99 technical training centers; and the preparation of\n            CONALEP's 1984-1988 operations plan. The project would\n            increase CONALEP's enrollment capacity by 50,000\n            student places and would provide equipment necessary for\n            70,000 trainees. At full development in 1985-86, the project\n            is expected to add annually about 20,000 skilled workers to\n            the labor force. It would also prepare annual 800 technical\n            teachers, and upgrade specialized skills for 1,000 employed\n            workers and technicians."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
