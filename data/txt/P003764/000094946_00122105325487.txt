INDONESIA II: DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
A. Population Characteristics
Population Size and Distribution
1.        Indonesia is the fifth most populous country in the world.  The
population count recorded by the most recent Census taken on Septimber 24,
1971 was 119.2 million. With a total land area 2f 1.9 million km the density
of population on that date was 63 persons per km , rather more moderate and
lower than that of Asia (78) or India (172). However, 64% of the Indonesians
lived in Java, including Madura, which accounts for less than 7% of the land
area and had a density of 565 persons per km in 1971, almost twice that of
the densely-populated countries in Northwest Europe, such as the Netherlands
(326) or Belgium (318), and higher than in Bangladesh (510). 1/ The 22
provinces of Indonesia, excluding Java and Madura, have a much lower density
with large differences among them. Bali had a density close to Java'5 in
1971, while Kalimantan and West Irian had only 9 and 2 persons per km
respectively (Table 1).
Sex and Age Composition
2.        Females were slightly in excess of males, the 1971 Census having
recorded 972 males per 1,000 females in the whole of Indonesia. There was
a greater preponderance of females in Java and Madura (957 males to 1,000
females), while in the rest of Indonesia the sexes were more evenly balanced
(998 males per 1,000 females). Indonesia's population is marked by a high
proportion in the younger age groups (Table 2). In 1971, 44.0% were in the
age group 0-14 years, 53.5% in the age group 15-64 years and 2.5% in the age
group 65 years and over. Such an age distribution is indicative of a high
level of childbearing and a relatively low to moderate expectation of life
at birth over the previous decades.
Urban-Rural Distribution
3.        Seventeen per cent of the population in the country was recorded
in the 1971 Census as living in the urban areas (Table 3). In Java, includ-
ing Madura, 18.0% of the population was classified as urban. In the other
islands, Kalimantan was slightly more urban than Java and Madura (20.4%).
The urban populations in Sumatra and Sulawesi were 17.1% and 16.1%, respec-
tively. The provinces of Bali, West and East Nusatenggara, Maluku and West
1/   Figures for the Netherlands and Belgium refer to 1972.  See United
Nations Demographic Year Book 1972, New York 1973.

Irian were the least urbanized. A high density of population in Java and
Madura, coupled with a relatively low degree of urbanization, results in
heavy population pressure on cultivable land.
Selected Characteristics
4.        Some selected population characteristics are shown in Table 4.
Increasing urbanization and improvement in literacy rates are discernable.
School enrollment ratios given in Table 5 show that universal education
can be expected in the near future.
B. Population Dynamics
5.        Population growth in Indonesia is determined primarily by births
and deaths occurring within the country, as international migration plays an
insignificant part. Indonesia's population growth rate during 1961-71 was
2.1% per year, an increase of 0.6% over that recorded during 1931-61.
International Migration
6.        During 1964-70, there was a net emigration from Indonesia of the
order of 86,000 persons (immigrants: 693,000, emigrants: 779,000) which
formed less than 0.01% of the enumerated population in 1971. 1/ Despite
the encouragement of private or foreign investment in recent years, immigra-
tion is generally restricted. The 1971 Census enumerated only 140,000 per-
sons born abroad (sex ratio 1,488) and 162,400 (sex ratio 1,657) who reported
their last place of residence to be abroad. Likewise, there is little pros-
pect of a sizeable emigration of Indonesians in the years ahead, and it can-
not provide a safety valve for the growing population pressure in Java.
Vital Rates
7.        Indonesia does not have a national system for the recording of
births and deaths occurring in the country and it is, therefore, not possi-
ble to obtain, as in the case of most developed countries, information on
levels or trends in birth and death rates from routine official records. 2/
1/   Lembaga Demografi, Demographic Fact Book of Indonesia, Jakarta 1973,
p. 133.
2/   A "Sample Vital Registration Project" was undertaken as part of the
joint IDA/UNFPA-assisted project to study the feasibility of introducing
a routine vital statistics registration system in selected sample areas.
On the basis of the experience gained in this project, a decision has
been taken to extend the system to the entire East Java Province.

Mortality
8.        Fair indications of mortality levels are obtained by using the
survival ratio of children given by the 1971 Census, and the data provided
by the Fertility Mortality Survey, 1973. 1/ Based on this information,
infant mortality in the latter part of the 1960s was about 144 per 1,000 in
rural Indonesia and 115 per 1,000 in urban Indonesia with an overall level
of around 140 per 1,000 for the country as a whole. In addition to the
urban rural differences, regional differences in mortality could be detected.
Mortality rates appeared rather similar in the urban areas of Central Java,
East Java and Sumatra (infant mortality rate of 110 per 1,000). In urban
West Java and Sulawesi mortality rates appeared to be higher with an infant
mortality rate of 126 per 1,000. In rural areas the ranking of the regions
by infant mortality rates, from the highest to the lowest was West Java,
Sulawesi, Sumatra, Central Java, and Bali with East Java showing the lowest
mortality. The infant mortality rates varied from 167 per 1,000 in West
Java to 120 per 1,000 in East Java. 2/
9.        Substantial and continuous declines in childhood mortality can
be observed in all regions of Indonesia since 1945. The rates for 1965-67
are only about 50% of those applying 20 years earlier in 1945-49. This
50% decline in 20 years is consistent with the 25% decline in the 10 years
between 1961 and 1971 estimated by McNicoll and Mamas. 3/ The decline in
rural areas has been only slightly less than in urban areas. The trend in
childhood mortality is presented in Table 6. These substantial declines in
mortality, without a substantial change in fertility up to 1970 as will
be shown later, have been contributing to the problems of rapid population
growth. With the need and possibility for a considerable lowering in mortal-
ity rates, there is further scope for an increase in the rate of population
growth unless fertility declines. Given the broad relationship between mor-
tality rates for different age groups, the expectations of life at birth
1/   The Fertility Mortality Survey was a large one-round sample survey,
covering the topics of marriage, marriage dissolution, fertility, mor-
tality and knowledge, attitude and contraceptive practice (KAP) in Java,
Sumatra, Sulawesi and Bali, which together contain 86% of Indonesia's
total population. Jakarta, which constitutes a special region equiva-
lent in status to a province, was not included in the sample (or in the
above estimate of 86%).

around 1971 can be placcI at around 47 years for the whole of Indonesia.
Differences between males and females, and between Java and the other islands
are shown in Table 4; females had an expectation of life three years less
than in Java.
Fertility
10.       Both the 1973 Fertility and Mortality Survey, and the 1971 Census
provided data on cumulative fertility, namely the number of children born
to ever-married women who had completed their reproductive span. The figures
obtained from both sources fob the different regions are shown in Table 7
for ever-married wome' aged 40-44 an(d 45-49 years. In spite of deficiencies
both the Census and survey data indicate that for women nearing the end of
their childbearing period the number of children born is high in Sumatra,
followed by Sulawesi, West Java, Bali, Central Java and lowest of all, East
Java. This general pattern holds in both urban and rural areas. 1/
11.       The regional differentials in the number of children born are quite
pronounced. For example, for women aged 40-44 living in urban areas, parity
is fully 2.4 childrel, higher in Sumatra than it is in East Java, and for rural
areas, the Sumatra East Java differential is 1.9 children. Even within Java,
the differentials are large for women aged 40-44, almost 1.5 children higher
irl West than in East Java.
12.       According to the data cited in Table 7, there is little difference
between urban and rural areas in completed fertility. The differences in
parity between regic s, along with a lack of differential between urban and
rur,il areas, is suggestive of ethnic characteristics producing fertility dif-
ferences as opposed to the effect of "modernization" on fertility.
13.       The lev  s of fertility as given in Table 7 when combined with
mortality levels as given in Table 6 show that East Java and Central Java
are the two provinces where "comparatively" low levels of fertility and mor-
tality ar( prevalent. In general, Indonesia's demographic pattern, at least
before the 1970s l ls one of high fertility and somewhat declining mortality
leading to an increase in the population growth rate.
14.       Hlas there b n a decline in fertility during the decade 1960-70?
Cable 8 presents data on total fertility (equivalent to the average number
of children during the course of reproductive life to all women) during
1959-63, 1964-68, 1969-70 and 1971-72 as given by age-specific birth rates
for these periods obtained frout the Fertility Mortality Survey. These figures
l/   Both sets of data suffer from inaccuracies.  It is usual to find errors
due to "recall lapse" especially among older women and this is shown by
a smaller figure, in some instances, for women aged 45-49 years as com-
pared to that for women aged 40-44 years. Census figures are known to
have 5X to 10X women with parity not stated, resulting in a lowering of
the estimate for the number of children born. The survey figures on the
other hand were slightly over-estimated due to a tendency to neglect to
obtain information from divorced and widowed women whose parity level
would tend to be below average.

suggest a diminution in fertility during 1971-72. However, careful analysis
of the data has led to the following summary statement:
"The measured fertility decline in 1971-72 remains
somewhat of a mystery. The explanation would appear
to be a compound of age mis-statement, under-registra-
tion of young children and in the case of Bali and
East Java at least, some actual decline in fertility.
The last factor can account for only a small part of
the measured decline; the main explanation would
appear to be in age mis-statement and under registra-
tion." 1/
Levels and Trends of Age-Specific Fertility Rates 2/
15.       Age-specific fertility rates which provide the number of births
per 1,000 women in a specified age-group during a 12-month period assist
in appreciating the contribution to total fertility made at various ages
in the reproductive span. These contributions are determined by cultural
factors such as age at marriage and also give an insight to the deliberate
control of fertility. The pattern of fertility in Indonesia as a whole can
be described as an "early marriage, high fertility" pattern. Fertility
rates are high even at extreme ages of childbearing such as 15-19 and 35-39
years. It is common for women's childbearing to be spread over a 20-year
span or longer, whereas in the western Europe a 10-year span or shorter is
much more typical.
16.       Within regions there are considerable variations. In particular,
fertility at the older ages (35 and above) accounts for a higher proportion
of fertility in those regions where fertility is highest. This general
pattern holds very clearly in urban areas. In rural areas there is greater
uniformity between regions in pattern of fertility, although childbearing
at older ages is least pronounced in the two lower fertility regions, Central
and East Java. Sulawesi and Bali emerge as the two regions where childbearing
continues into older age groups, closely followed by Sumatra. But even Central
and East Java exhibit a much older pattern of childbearing than countries with
low levels of fertility, such as Taiwan or Japan or France. Fertility at ages
below 20 varies considerably and in each region is much higher in rural than
in urban areas. The Javanese pattern of early marriage causes fertility rates
for the ages 15-19 to be higher in East Java than they are in Sumatra, despite
much lower levels of fertility. The net result of high fertility at the
extreme ages of the childbearing span is that these ages account for around
30% to 35% of the sum of the age-specific fertility rates in Indonesia,
compared with only 10% to 20% in most Western countries and as low as 6% in
Japan.

17.       Over the decade of the 1960s, or more specifically between 1959-63
and 1969-70, some rather consistent trends in fertility rates emerge. In
almost all regions fertility rates at ages 15-19 showed a fall. This is
clearly related to the rising age at marriage which occurred universally
during the 1960s, though more pronounced in urban than in rural areas. Fer-
tility rates at the main childbearing ages (20-34) mostly rose during the
decade, whereas at the older ages (35-44) they fell fairly consistently in
urban areas. The trend at these ages in rural areas was mixed. These
trends--a decline in fertility at the youngest and oldest childbearing ages,
more pronounced in urban than in rural areas--are fairly typical of countries
entering the early stages of a transition to lower fertility rates. They can
be optimistically interpreted as presaging a further decline in fertility as
time goes on. The age-specific fertility rates during 1965-70 as estimated
for Java and Madura and other islands from the data obtained in the Fertility
Mortality Survey, and augmented by information from other sources, and cor-
rected for certain inaccuracies in basic data are given in Table 9.
18.       Interest centers on the trend in fertility after 1970, when the
NFPCB took shape and the national family planning program in Java and Bali
went into operation. Unfortunately precise figures are not yet available.
Based on the number of persons who had accepted family planning methods
through the program and on the continuity of use of these methods, it has
been estimated that the birth rate declined by about six points between
1970 and 1975. The decline was more marked in East Java and Bali (Table 10).
Under the aegis of the Central Bureau of Statistics an inter-censal survey
in three stages has been completed and the data are being processed. Very
preliminary findings from the survey tend to confirm the evidence of a de-
cline in fertility but the final results will not be available until the
end of 1977.
C. Population Projections
19.       Population projections have been made by the Indonesian Institute
of Sciences (LEKNAS) under different alternate assumptions about fertility,
transmigration and rural to urban migration for the 10 planning regions into
which Indonesia has been divided by the National Development and Planning
Agency (BAPPENAS). 1/ The assumptions are based on policy goals adopted by
the Government but do not imply that the Government would or should adhere
to these goals. In fact, the projections are intended to help policy-makers
to evaluate these goals or alternatives and to estimate the magnitude of
programs needed to achieve them.

20.       The alternative assumptions made are:
a.   Fertility Assumptions
Low fertility - Total fertility in each region is
assumed to decline linerally to a level
consistent with a 50% decline in crude
birth rate from the 1966-70 level.
This decline is assumed to be achieved
by the 1996-2000 period in Java and
Bali and by the 2001-05 period outside
Java and Bali.
High fertility - Total fertility is assumed to decline
linerally at one half the rate of decline
of the low fertility assumption in re-
gions comprising Java and Bali. No de-
cline in regions making up the other
islands is assumed.
b.   Migration Assumptions
Low migration - Inter-regional migration is assumed to
continue at the same rates estimated
for 1966-71 from the 1971 Census with
a small upward adjustment for the re-
ported increase in transmigration from
1966-71 to 1971-75.
High migration - The rates assumed for the low migration
assumption have been increased so that
the total transmigration for 1976-80 is
250,000 persons per year, which was the
target of the second national five-year
plan. The rates of migration calculated
for 1976-80 are applied to the following
periods which implies that transmigra-
tion will continue to increase in pro-
portion to the total population of
Indonesia.
c.   Urbanization Assumptions
Low assumption - The difference in urban and rural growth
rates in each region will remain the same
as that observed between the 1961 and
1971 Censuses.



ANNEX 1
Page 8
High assumption - The difference in urban and rural
growth rates will increase to 2.75%
per year (UN medium assumption) in
regions where the rate of urbaniza-
tion between 1961 and 1971 was low
and to 3.75% (UN high assumption) in
regions of medium to high urbanization
in 1961-71. On the average this re-
sults in an increase in urban growth
by about 1.5% per year over the low
urbanization assumption.
All projections were made from the populations reported in the 1971 Census
(Series B). The initial age distributions were obtained from the 1971 Pop-
ulation Census (Series E) adjusted for age misreporting. In respect of
mortality, female life expectancy is expected to increase by 2.5 years for
every 5 years projected, from 47.5 years in 1971-75 to 62.5 years in 2001-05.
The male life expectancy is expected to increase from 45 years in 1971-76
to 59 years by 2001-05. West Model Life Tables of Coale and Demeny were
used in projecting mortality rates. All projections were made using the
component cohort approach and are given as of December 31 of the year under
reference.
21.       The insights gained from an analysis of the projections are as
follows:
a.   Fertility Decline:  fertility assumptions have the greatest
effect on total population. If the goal of the national
family planning program of reducing the crude birth rate by
50% by 2000 is achieved, the total population will be around
209 million. If the goal is only partly achieved on Java and
Bali and there is no change in fertility outside Java and
Bali (high fertility assumption), the total population will be
around 258 million. The difference between the low and high
fertility assumptions is about 49 million people (Table 11).
The projections under the high fertility assumption show the
imperative need to extend the national family planning program
outside Java and Bali if the size of the Indonesian population
is to be controlled. Of the 49 million difference in popula-
tion size likely to be attained under the "low" and "high"
assumptions of fertility, 23 million will occur inside Java
and Bali and 26 million outside Java and Bali. The popula-
tion outside Java and Bali will increase by 115% under the 'low
fertility' assumption and by 180% under the 'high fertility'
assumption.



ANNEX 1
Page 9
The age distribution of the population around the year 2000
will be affected by the speed with which fertility declines.
Under the 'low fertility' assumption, 32.6% will be under 14
years of age, while on the 'high fertility' assumption 42.8%
will be under this age (Tables 12 and 13).
The expected birth and death rates for Indonesia under the two
fertility assumptions are shown in Table 14. Whilst under the
'low fertility' assumption Indonesia's population will grow at
the rate of 1.4% per annum around the year 2000, the rate of
growth at that time would be 2.6% per annum under the 'high
fertility' assumption. Since the latter assumes a decline in
fertility in Java and Bali at one-half the rate of the 'low
fertility' assumption, it is evident that with levels of
fertility remaining constant at prevailing levels, the already
fast rate of population growth will be further accelerated.
b.   Transmigration:  the effect of transmigration is best seen on
the rural population of Java and Bali. Under assumptions of
"high" transmigration the rural population of Java and Bali will
be about 8 million less around the year 2000 as compared with
the number that will be expected under assumption of the
"low" transmigration.
c.   Urbanization:  a higher pace of urbanization will increase the
urban population of Java and Bali by 10 million and will reduce
the rural population of Java and Bali by the same amount, around
the year 2000.  Outside Java and Bali the difference will be of
the order of 8 million.  The expected 'urban' and 'rural' popu-
lations in Java and Bali and outside Java and Bali under the
various assumptions around the year 2000 are given in Table 15.

but has been omitted here because its inclusion would have obscured the effects
of transmigration.

INDONESIA II: THE NATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM
A. Background
1.        Family planning in Indonesia was pioneered by a private organiza-
tion, the Indonesian Planned Parenthood Association (IPPA) which began operat-
ing in 1957. President Suharto signed the Declaration of World Leaders on
Population in 1967. Recognizing the need to stem population growth in the
country, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) set up a semi-governmental insti-
tute in 1968 to coordinate family planning activities which were being
carried out by various private and official agencies. At the same time, the
GOI invited a joint UN/WHO/IBRD mission to help it to develop a comprehensive
program. As the next step, the GOI replaced the institute in 1970, by the
fully governmental National Family Planning Coordinating Board (NFPCB) to
plan, coordinate, supervise and evaluate a national family planning program,
at first restricted to Java (including Madura) and Bali.
B. Organization
2.        The President is personally responsible for the progress of the
program; this devolves upon the Provincial Governors insofar as the province
is concerned and upon the Bupatis with regard to their kabupatens which are
the next administrative division. Advising the President on policy matters
is a ministerial council composed of all the concerned ministers, with the
State Minister of People's Welfare as the Chairman and the Chairman of the
NFPCB as its secretary. The NFPCB is a non-departmental body with a Chair-
man, three deputy chairmen, a Secretariat for administrative and financial
support, and nine bureaus representing the various staff functions required
to fulfill its responsibilities (Chart 1). The Chairman reports directly
to the President and the State Minister of People's Welfare, acting on behalf
of the President, exercises certain powers on day-to-day matters. Actual
implementation of program activities is vested in the concerned operational
Ministeries of the Government such as Health, Information, Education, In-
terior, and the Armed Forces and voluntary organizations such as the IPPA,
Muhammadiyah and the Indonesian Council of Churches. A program consultative
committee composed of the heads of the implementing units advises the Chair-
man on policy formulation and operational strategy.
3.        The NFPCB has an office in each of the provinces in which the
program functions--six in Java and Bali and 10 in the other islands. Each
office is headed by a Chairman and has a secretary, three division chiefs
(planning, supervision and research and evaluation) and several project
leaders taking responsibility for one or more operational aspects of the
program. Inasmuch as provincial governors are responsible to the President
for the progress of the developmental programs within the province, provin-
cial chairmen are required to obtain his directives on operational matters.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Provincial chairmen are also responsible to the Chairman of the Central
NFPCB for all administrative, financial and technical matters.
4.        At the kabupaten level, which is really the operational base of
the program, the NFPCB has a chairman, a field work supervisor and an
administrative staff. The kabupaten chairman is responsible to the Chairman
of NFPCB but is directed by Bupatis in operational matters. Working with
the medical officer of the kabupaten (DOKABU) and kabupaten officials of
other implementing units, he coordinates program activities within his juris-
diction and exercises supervisory powers.
5.        At the kecamatan level, the Camat from the Ministry of the Interior,
the PUSKESMAS (public health centre) physician from the Ministry of Health
(MOH) and the group leader of the non-medical fieldworkers of the NFPCB,
assisted by other officials, organize educational, informational and service
activities. At the village-level, the Lurah from the Ministry of Interior,
the non-medical fieldworker from the NFPCB and the midwife from the MOH,
assisted by the voluntary village-level family planning worker (PPKBD) are
responsible for recruiting acceptors and sustaining their practice of con-
traception.
C. Program Development
6.        Program development is an elaborate process and involves several
levels of administration. The National Working Meeting meets once a year, is
presided over by the Chairman of the NFPCB and is attended by all senior and
middle level officials of the central and provincial NFPCB and of the family
planning cells of the implementing units; representatives of BAPPENAS, the
Ministry of Finance and other concerned ministries also participate. Review-
ing past experiences and anticipating future needs, this body recommends
programs and policies to the Chairman of the NFPCB. After further discussions
of the National Working Meeting's recommendations with the appropriate author-
ities, the Chairman enunciates national policy and indicates the kind of
programs required to implement the policy. This information is then relayed
to the provincial NFPCB Chairman for evolving specific program activities;
the provincial chairman in turn sends it to the several kabupaten NFPCB
to review needs and work out operational details. The recommendations of
these operational level units are consolidated and coordinated by the provin-
cial NFPCB and after obtaining the Governor's approval are presented to the
central NFPCB as the provincial program. The Central NFPCB after reviewing
the provincial programs, formulates the national program which it discusses
with representatives of the central level implementing units, BAPPENAS and the
Ministry of Finance. When this group endorses the program it becomes the
basis both for the budget and for program operations.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
D. Program Funding
7.        The Indonesian family planning program has progressed from the
stage where contraceptive information and services were provided primarily
through foreign donor assistance (96.5% of the total family planning budget
in 1968-69) to one where the GOI has assumed primary responsibility for
providing these services and has committed itself to underwriting a large
percentage of program costs (49% of the family planning budget in 1975-76,
not including MOH personnel salaries) (Table 1). The family planning
budget per capita has steadily increased from US$.028 in 1968-69 to US$.297
in 1975-76. On the other hand, the cost of recruiting a new acceptor has
declined to a level of US$10 to US$15 per acceptor.
E. Service Delivery
8.        Until recently, the bulk of the family planning services was being
provided by a network of clinics operated by the MOH, the Armed Forces (ABRI)
Health Services, and other Government and private agencies. As of March
1977, there were in Java and Bali 2,719 registered family planning clinics
located in PUSKESMAS, sub-clinics and satellite clinics, of which 2,261 be-
longed to the MOH, 199 to the ABRI, 51 to other governmental agencies and
208 to private organizations. In addition, there were 1,443 mobile teams
which carried services to those who did not have an easy access to clinics.
Most of the PUSKESMAS in Java and Bali now have a physician in charge and/or
other supporting staff and the sub-clinics are manned by midwives and/or a
PKK (primary health nurse). The mobile team consists of a midwife/PKK,
a non-medical family planning fieldworker and a local volunteer. The
latter two prepare the community for the midwife's visit; the midwife pro-
vides the services.
9.        In the 10 other provinces to which the program was extended in
1974, as of March 1977, there were 901 family planning clinics of which
637 belonged to the MOH, 108 to the ABRI, 47 to other Government departments
and 109 to voluntary organizations. There were 194 mobile teams in operation.
In the mobile team, there is an auxiliary health worker known as a motivator,
instead of the fieldworker as in Java and Bali.
10.       Involved in the field operations in the country are 2,145 doctors,
3,416 midwives, 2,967 assistant midwives, 2,097 recording personnel, 1,557
information workers, 6,574 fieldworkers, 1,295 group leaders, 202 supervisors,
6 field work coordinators and 21 assistant coordinators, 274 motivators and
others.
11.       Some institutional contraceptive methods (vasectomy and tubal liga-
tion) are available in specially designated hospitals. Availability is con-
tingent upon the existence of a demand for such methods and the socio-cultural



ANNEX 2
Page 4
conditions which permit them. Field trials on the commercial distribution
of condoms through the vendors of herbal medicine (Jamu Jago) and other small
drug retail outlets have been carried out. Distribution by mail upon request
has also been tried. Results of both studies are encouraging. Commercial
distribution may soon become a national scheme.
Community-Based Distribution Scheme
12.       The national family planning program has launched an all out effort
to make the resupply of such contraceptives as the oral contraceptive and
the condom as easy and as convenient for the user as possible. This is the
Community-Based Distribution Scheme. For this purpose, a variety of village
contraceptive distribution centres (VCDCs) have been established through most
of Java and Bali. These are staffed by various categories of individuals,
including paid acceptors, members of the Village Social Institute who come
under the authority of the Ministry of Interior, and members of the village
headman's staff. In Bali, contraceptive resupply, among other family plan-
ning activities, has been integrated into the traditional Balinese banjar
or hamlet administrative system. All told, there are approximately, 28,000
VCDCs in Java, and over 3,000 in Bali. Compared with the number of clinic
supply points, the VCDCs outnumber clinics 9 to 1. The proportions of all
oral contraceptive resupplies distributed through the VCDCs are 36% in West
Java, 45% in Central Java, 81% in East Java and 31% in Bali.
Contraceptive Supplies
13.       The Bureau of Logistics of the Central NFPCB is responsible for
procuring contraceptives and maintaining a steady supply line. The Bureau
dispatches the contraceptives to the provincial offices where a reserve of
25% of the supplies is always maintained; the rest is distributed to the
kabupaten. Maintaining a small reserve, the kabupaten NFPCB supplies the
PUSKESMAS which, in turn, supplies the PPKBD with a month's stock. Staff
members are available at each administrative level to handle the distribution
and supply. Except for the 27.5 mm Lippes loop, all other sizes of this type
of IUD are manufactured in Indonesia. Oral contraceptives have been and will
continue to be supplied by USAID until December 1977. Thereafter, the demand
will be r.met by local production--tableting in the initial stages followed by
complete production eventually.
F. Information, Education and Communications
Community Education
14.       Education of the community in Java and Bali is carried out pri-
marily by non-medical family planning fieldworkers. At the national level,
the Special Bureau of Fieldworkers plans the overall program and directs



ANNEX 2
Page 5
and supervises it. A coordinator at the provincial level, backed up by
assistant coordinators does the detailed planning of the provincial program
and provides guidance for its implementation and supervises performance. A
supervisor at the kabupaten is in overall charge of operations and works
through a group leader and fieldworkers who are attached to the PUSKESMAS.
On an average there are four fieldworkers for every PUSKESMAS which works out
to a ratio of one fieldworker to about 14,000 population and one group leader
for every four or five fieldworkers. With the coming in of the Community-
Based Distribution Scheme the fieldworkers assist and supervise the educa-
tional activities of the VCDC . In addition to this direct input of the
NFPCB, family planning is included in the health education programs of the
MOH in the clinic and the community. Information officers of the Ministries
of Religious Affairs and of Information, who are largely face-to-face communi-
cation practitioners working at the kecamatan level, also participate in the
community education program.
15.       Face-to-face communications in 10 provinces of the other islands
include campaigns directed at special groups in the community, involvement
of community leaders, orientation of community leaders and youth groups
and special teams to carry out informational/educational activities at the
kecamatan and village levels. Paramedical staff of the PUSKESMAS educate
the community regarding family planning as part of their health education
activities. The NFPCB plan to intensify this educational program by attach-
ing four volunteer motivators to each PUSKESMAS. The PUSKESMAS staff will
then have a role similar to that of the group leader in Java and Bali and
will operate through the four volunteers at the intermediate stage and
the VCDC and traditional midwives (dukuns) at the village level. The plan
will also provide support to the paramedical staff through the appointment
of a coordinator at the provincial level and a supervisor at the kabupaten
level. Volunteer motivators at PUSKESMAS level are already being recruited
and trained.
Public Information
16.       When the NFPCB was established in 1970, there was hardly any activity
in family planning in the Ministry of Information or its associated agencies,
such as the Radio Republik Indonesia or the Television Republik Indonesia.
The first step taken by the Bureau of Information and Motivation of the
Central NFPCB was to conduct a series of orientation courses, seminars and
workshops for officials of the Ministry of Information and its associated
agencies, as well as for officials of the Ministries of Social Welfare and of
Religious Affairs, journalists, practitioners of indigeneous media, ullemas
(religious leaders), community leaders, and the leaders of women's and youth
groups. The NFPCB provided the funds, technical advice and in some cases
teachers and the organization concerned conducted the sessions. This approach
has resulted in the formation of organized groups such as the Family Planning
Writers Association, Zero Population Group of the students, and others with
population and family planning as the binding force; it has also helped to
introduce family planning into the activities of existing organized groups
such as KOWANI (women's organization) and HMI (Muslim Students Association).



ANNEX 2
Page 6
These national  -ganizations have branches all over the country.  They conduct
orientation couMr,-cs with financial, material and technical assistance from the
NFPCB and thus help in stimulating and sustaining community interest in
population matters.
17.       The Ministry of Information has also developed a family planning
unit; this was reorganized recently and now consists of a Chairman and six
others including the news directors of the State radio and television net-
works and those in charge of public relations and regional publicity. The
NFPCB provides this unit with its assessment of the information needs of the
program, technical information, guidance and funds. At the provincial level,
the Ministry of Information maintains a provincial information office called
the KANWIL consisting of a chairman, and four divisions--public speaking,
mobile units, press and general--each with one or more professional staff;
with other supporting and administrative personnel the total staff strength
is between 50 and 60. There is a project leader for information and motiva-
tion in each provincial NFPCB office in Java and Bali. This officer coor-
dinates public information activities in the provinces through an information
and motivation team comprising representatives of the implementing units.
The Governor's role is pivotal; since he is responsible for the progress of
the program in his province, he personally directs the agencies to participate
in the public information program and thus sets the pace for the Bupatis and
others to do likewise within their areas.
18.       At present, the information, education and communication program in
the 10 other provinces is the direct charge of the Chairman of the provincial
NFPCB. A coordinating team with the provincial information officer as the
Chairman and representatives of the implementing units as members has been
appointed by the Governor to assist the Chairman of the provincial NFPCB and
actually carry out an information service.
19.       At the kabupaten level in Java and Bali--the operational base--the
Ministry of Information has an information office with about three to five
information officers and a total staff strength of between 25 and 30. It
operates a PUSPENMAS (public information centre). Areas of concentration
are the same as at the provincial level and a multi-media approach is used
including posters, leaflets, exhibitions, traditional media, bulletins
and films. A mobile information unit (provided under the joint IDA/UNFPA-
assisted project) is located in each kabupaten with a driver, an operator
and a speaker. As there is no special functionary for information at the
kabupaten NFPCB office, the Chairman himself coordinates public information
activities in the area.
20.       The kecamatan information worker is largely a face-to-face communi-
cations functionary. As of July 1976, there were 1,577 kecamatan information
workers in the six provinces of Java and Bali, of whom 52.8% sent in reports.
Collectively, they organized 26,848 meetings: mixed group (43%), men's group
(16%), women's groups (34%) and youth groups (7%); of these 73% were mass
meetings, 13% group discussions, and 0.73% were sessions using indigeneous

media. Media or audiovisual aids were used on 944 occasions; films accounteu
for 38% of these occasions, slides 7%, flipcharts 48%, filmstrips 0.6%, and
cassettes 6.25%. Total attendance reported was 3,214,070. Subjects covered
included the population problem, religion and family planning, family planning
and family welfare, as well as information on contraceptive methods.
Radio and Television
21.       There are 46 Radio Republik Indonesia stations in the country, of
which 18 are in Java and Bali. In addition, there are 700 governmental and
non-governmental commercial radio stations owned by regional governments,
universities, the Armed Forces and the nrivate sector. There are six television
stations, three in Java, two in Sumatra and one in South Sulawesi; the recently
launched domestic satellite will enable the establishment of a station in each
province during the third five-year plan. There is a great deal of coverage
of family planning in the radio programs of both Radio Republik Indonesia and
commercial stations. Initially, the NFPCB provided funds to both types of
stations for family planning broadcasts. Now both Radio and Television
Republik Indonesia include funds for this purpose in their own budgets, in
addition to NFPCB funding.
Printed Material
22.       Initially, because of the lack of an infrastructure to stimulate
and coordinate production of printing material, the Bureau of Information
and Motivation of the Central NFPCB formerly prepared prototypes, pretested
them, commissioned their production and arranged for their distribution.
Now, except for magazines, bulletins and press reviews, all printed mate-
rials are produced in the provinces. From 1970 to date, the Central NFPCB
has produced 8 booklets on the population problem, 16 on the social, economic
and cultural aspects of family planning, 5 on medical and health aspects, 7
on religion and family planning, 1 on law and family planning, and 15 on
political and organizational aspects. During this period 5.7 million copies
of 27 leaflets and over a million copies of 20 posters were produced. Two
sets of flipcharts were produced in 1972 and 1973, 2,000 copies of each set.
The Central NFPCB publishes a monthly magazine. The annual print order has
increased from 90,000 in 1970-71 to 300,000 in 1976-77. Special calendars
were issued from 1971-72 to 1974-75 with a print order of 10,000 each year.
Films
23.       In all, 24 films have been produced--18 by the Central NFPCB, four
by the IPPA and two by the NFPCB of West Java. Together they account for
624 minutes of running time.   There are 1,191 copies of the 24 titles.  Both
local and international funds have been used to produce these films. Eight
sets of slides have been prepared. A thousand copies of four cassettes with
family planning songs have also been produced.
Training and Communications
24.       Some of the communications personnel involved in the program have
been trained in established training programs at the University of Chicago



ANNEX 2
Page 8
and the East-West Communication Institute, and in India, Japan and the
Philippines. Others have gone on study tours of Asian countries and yet
others on conducted tours to program sites within the country. Recently,
study tours financed under the joint IDA/UNFPA-assisted project were under-
taken by seven batches of three staff each. These persons were drawn from
the central and provincial NFPCB offices; the Ministries of Information,
Health, Interior, Education, Manpower and Religious Affairs, and the Armed
Forces, as well as the IPPA, Muhammadiyah and the Indonesian Council of
Churches. The main objective of the tours was to study the communications
program for family planning of the countries visited with special reference
to organization, programming and research. Countries visited included the
Arab Republic of Egypt, Hong Kong, India, Iran, the Republic of Korea,
Hfalavsia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
G. Training
25.       The IPPA established the National Training Centre in Jakarta in
1968 and in the following year provincial training centres (PTCs) in the six
provinces of Java and Bali. In 1971 a new building was constructed for the
National Training and Research Centre (NTRC). The PTCs, however, were
housed in rented premises. Training staff was part time, drawn from the
MOH and from universities and other teaching institutions.  These institu-
tions not only trained volunteers, staff and field personnel of the IPPA
but also doctors, nurses, social workers and others from the MOH and other
Government agencies.
'26.      With the establishment of the national family planning program
in 1970, training needs soared enormously. A Bureau of Education and Train-
ing was set up in the Central NFPCB and project leaders for training appointed
to the provincial NFPCB offices. Actual training was carried out by the
TPPA training centres and the provincial training centres of the MOH, the
U7FPCB meeting the training costs. With financial assistance from the joint
IDA/UNFPA-assisted project, seven sub-provincial training centres (STCs) in
West, Central and East Java were established primarily to train the large
number of fieldworkers and group leaders required in the national program.
Four of these were managed by the MOH and the other three by the IPPA.  The
joint project provided support for the construction of 10 STCs in these
three provinces and one PTC in each of the six provinces in Java and Bali.
27.       During the period 1969-70 to 1973-74, a total of 40,452 persons
were trained. These included: 1,480 physicians; 4,905 paramedical and
auxiliary personnel; 3,880 clinic-based and 259 kabupaten-based reporting and
recording personnel; 8,590 fieldworkers for initial training and 1,214 in
refresher courses; 1,533 group leaders for initial training and 147 in re-
fresher courses; 76 fieldworkers' supervisors; 23 fieldworkers' coordinators
and assistant coordinators; 282 administrators--61 from the central level,
62 provincial, 119 kabupaten, and 40 logistics personnel; 33 information



ANNEX 2
Page 9
officers; 5,583 information workers; 129 mobile information unit technicians;
161 social workers; 20 research and evaluation personnel; 37 trainers; 10,695
dukuns; and 1,405 others. In addition, several workshops and seminars were
conducted for curriculum development and for special subject areas.
28.       Training was included as a component in the joint IDA/UNFPA-assisted
project. The training component included: construction and equipment of
buildings for six PTCs and 10 STCs; defraying a portion of the operational
costs; and instituting a staff development program. Except for the PTC in
East Java, the construction and equipment of all the buildings has been com-
pleted.
29.       At the same time, the NFPCB was concerned that the two parallel
sets of training institutions under the management of two different imple-
menting units, each set with its own orientations and emphases, was result-
ing in variations in concepts, methods and standards. Careful examination of
the problem led to the conclusion that qualitative improvement would require
a greater degree of uniformity in standards--work-programs, personnel and
facilities--and more and sustained technical guidance from a well-staffed,
multi-disciplinary central institution to peripheral ones which could be
ensured only by developing a cohesive and well-knit training system under
a single management. Since the training of family planning personnel is
interdisciplinary in nature, and hence cuts across the specialties of the
several implementing units, the NFPCB decided to create a national training
system and keep it under its own administrative control.
30.       Ultimately the national training system will include:  the NFPCB's
Bureau of Education and Training which is to be expanded during 1977-78;
six PTCs and 10 STCs in Java and Bali--the successors to the erstwhile IPPA
institutions; and 10 new PTCs to replace the existing ad hoc training facili-
ties of the IPPA in the 10 provinces of the other islands. The NFPCB placed
the new PTCs--housed in the new buildings constructed with joint project
assistance--under the administrative control of the respective provincial
chairmen from October 1, 1976. The NFPCB will endeavor to retain as many
of the IPPA trainers as possible. Remaining positions will be filled by
secondment on a fixed-term basis from universities, teacher training col-
leges, other technical institutions, and concerned Government departments
or by open recruitment. All faculty members--whether NFPCB staff or sec-
onded from other agencies--will be assigned full-time to the training cen-
tres. It is expected that the full complement of staff will be in position
by July 1, 1977.
31.       The NFPCB has evolved a staff development program in two phases--
a short-term one to improve current training programs and a long-term one to
prepare for eventualities. The need for such a program is emphasized by the
anticipation of a staff turnover as a result of the change in management;
this would necessitate the training of a number of new trainers and it was
considered more pragmatic as well as more economical to use a new curriculum



ANNEX 2
Page 10
for this pur-ose, rather than expose the trainers to the old curriculum and
call them back for retraining.
32.       The short-term staff development program envisaged sending about
a dozen trainers to the University of Connecticut for the 13-week course on
training of trainers, and about 20 trainers to the National Institute of
Family Planning in India for exposure to an adapted version of their train-
ing course for Indian trainers to be followed by placement in a regional
family planning training centre and state and local program headquarters
for practical training experience, the whole program lasting for about six
months. On their return home the two groups of trainers would meet in a
workshop situation, review the existing curriculum for trainers and revise
it in the light of their experience in two very different situations. The
expectation was that such a process, without foisting any one ideology on
Indonesia, would encourage the national training program to develop in the
light of its own needs and interests enriched by experience elsewhere.
33.       Five trainers financed by USAID have participated in the University
of Connecticut training course. Sixteen trainers spent 5-1/2 months in India
and stopped in Thailand and Singapore on the way back home; funds from the
joint project were used for this purpose. In addition to these two major
groups, other trainers have visited several other countries and studied their
programs.
34.       The long-term aspect of the staff development program consists of
sending suitable trainers for full academic courses at a master's degree or
diploma level in universities abroad in disciplines or professions relevant
to family planning. Financed by the joint project four trainers are scheduled
to go to the Philippines and the United States of America during 1977-78 for
specialization in management, communications, education and sociology. These
funds will permit sending another five or six persons in the following year.
The rest of the scheme will depend upon availability of funds--national or
international.
35.       The NFPCB has used funds from various sources to strengthen the
competence of other staff members as well as those of the implementing
units in all aspects of the program. Staff members have gone to other coun-
tries for regular academic courses in universities and institutions of higher
learning, established specific- purpose courses, study tours, international
and regional seminars and workshops and observation tours.
H. Service Statistics System
36.       In July 1970, a comprehensive and standardized data system was
designed by the NFPCB for the national family planning program. The
service statistics portion of the system incorporated the field-proven



ANNEX 2
Page 11
aspects of various African and Asian family planning service statistics
systems. Following field testing, which resulted in minor changes, the
system was adopted in 1971. The NFPCB provides a feedback report to the
field within 30 days of data receipt. As an average of 92% of the family
planning clinics submit their reports on time, i.e., within 10-12 days after
the end of the reporting month, the speed with which the monthly statistics
are compiled and reported back to the field in Indonesia is unique for a
national family planning program of comparable size. In 1971, NFPCB also
implemented a monthly contraceptive stock inventory and utilization program.
Both systems continue to be in operation with minor changes necessitated
from time to time to cope with changes in the program. In addition to the
routine statistics, data for specific studies such as continuation rates,
side-effects, etc., are obtained through ad hoc surveys.
I. Program Results
New Acceptors 1/
37.       Since its inception in 1969-70 through the end of 1976-77 2/ the
national family planning program recruited 8,442,054 new acceptors in Java
and Bali. The number of new acceptors recruited annually is shown in Table 2,
together with the annual targets, and acceptors as a proportion of married
women age 15-44.
38.       In terms of the methods selected by new acceptors in Java and
Bali, (Table 3) oral contraceptive has increased considerably in importance
from around 28% of all methods selected in 1969-70 to 68.5% in 1974-75 since
when there has been a slight decline. The IUD, on the other hand, declined
in relative importance, from a high of 55% in 1969-70 to a low of 11% in
1974-75 but subsequently rose to over 18% in 1976-77. New acceptors of the
condom have fluctuated from about 18% in the first year of the national pro-
gram to 5% in 1971-72 back up to 19% in 1974-75 and 1975-76 and down again
to about 13% in 1976-77. Other methods, including injectables and steriliza-
tion, make up a relatively small proportion of total acceptances, generally
in the neighborhood of 1% or more each year.
39.       In the 10 provinces of the other islands, where the program has
been in operation since 1974, the number of new acceptors increased from
117,966 in 1974-75 (24 per 1,000 MWRA 3/) to 233,345 in 1976-77 (62 per
1/   An acceptor is defined as a woman who accepts contraception for the
first time or who reaccepts after the termination of a pregnancy.
2/   The program year coincides with the Indonesian fiscal year, i.e.,
April 1-March 31.
3/   MWRA:  Married woman in the reproductive age group (i.e., 15-44 years).



ANNEX 2
Page 12
1,000 MWRA). The pattern of acceptance does not differ markedly from that
of Java and Bali.
Acceptor Characteristics
40.       In terms of new acceptor characteristics, the family planning
program on Java and Bali has been recruiting progressively younger and
less well-educated women whose husbands are likely to be farmers or fisher-
men and who have fewer living children. Table 4 summarizes the changes
that have occurred in new acceptors over the life of the program. On Java
and Bali the "typical" acceptor is a 27-year old woman with less than a
primary school education, with 2.54 living children and whose husband is
a farmer, fisherman, a laborer or was unemployed. The "typical" acceptor
in the 10 provinces of the other islands is a 29-year old woman with a
primary school or better education, with 3.88 living children, whose hus-
band is a Government official or a tradesman.
Continuation Rates
41.       Data for the calculation of up-to-date continuation rates are
presently being collected and analysed. Listed in Table 5 are a selection
of 12-month first method continuation rates as derived from a number of dif-
ferent surveys. First method continuation rates for IUD acceptors, especially
in the case of Bali and East Java, run consistently higher than comparative
figures for other national family planning programs in the region. Oral con-
traceptive continuation rates, on the other hand, are more in line with those
found in other programs.
Current Users
42.       There has been a continual increase in the estimated number of
current program users.  As shown in Table 6, current users of all contra-
ceptive methods in Java and Bali in 1972-73 were approximately 738,000 or
nearly 8% of all MWRA.  By March 1977, there were an estimated 3,486,323
current users, or 24.1% of MWRA. In the 10 provinces of the other islands,
there were an estimated 322,567 current users as of March 1977, which repre-
sented 6.2% of MWRA.
Program Impact on Fertility
43.       Although data on the direct measurement of fertility change in
Indonesia are not yet available, several estimates of fertility change for
Java and Bali have been made. In a 1975 study, it was estimated that the
total fertility rate (TFR) on Bali had decreased from 5.9% to 4.3% between
1970 and 1975 (a 27% reduction).   East Java followed with a 19% decline,
from a TFR of 5.1% to approximately 4.1%. The decline estimated for
Central Java was in the neighborhood of 11%, with the TFR dropping from
5.6% to 5.0%. West Java registered the smallest reduction, with a TFR
of 6.3% in 1975 compared to a TFR 6.8% in 1970 (a 7% reduction).



ANNEX 2
Page 13
44.       Initial indications from a 1974-75 sample vital registration project
in selected sub-districts of the country suggest that fertility has perhaps
declined further. What is of particular interest is the apparently strong
relationship between the number of current users in the sub-district and crude
birth rate for those areas, as seen in Table 7.
J. Evaluation and Research
45.       Research activities undertaken through the auspices of the NFPCB
have been grouped under four broad categories: information and motivation,
management, training and medical. Some 130 research projects have been
undertaken since the inception of the program. Under the first category are
included a wide variety of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) studies of
particular areas of the country and various minority groups; studies concern-
ing acceptor characteristics; the use of various media, including the mass
media, traditional media and the folk arts, and informal channels for the
communication of family planning information; the use of paramedical personnel
for motivation and service delivery. Other studies have examined the source
and effect of rumors on contraceptive acceptance and use, the status of women
in customary law, and the value of children. Under management studies, sev-
eral manpower evaluations have been conducted on fieldworkers, the feasibility
and advantage of paid incentives for fieldworkers, verification of service
statistics data, and evaluations of the organization and management of the
family planning program at various levels. Under training, studies include
routine evaluation of specific training programs for particular categories
of individuals in addition to studies of the training provided fieldworkers.
Medically-oriented studies consist of evaluations of mobile clinics and mobile
service units, contraceptive continuation rates (including a major on-going
quarterly acceptor survey for Java and Bali), evaluations of sterilization
pilot projects, condom mailing schemes, and the integration of family plan-
ning and maternal and child health activities.

INDONESIA II: THE JOINT IDA/UNFPA-ASSISTED PROJECT
Introduction
1.        In 1969, a UN-WHO-IBRD mission visited Indonesia at the Govern-
ment's request to make recommendations on the establishment of a national
family planning program. On the basis of its report a five-year operational
plan covering Java and Bali was prepared. Subsequently the GOI asked the Bank
for assistance and in May 1972 legal agreements covering a first population
project were signed. This project was prepared on the basis of GOI requests
and with the assistance of the UN and specialized agencies including WHO,
UNICEF, UNESCO, UNFPA and the Bank Group. Project costs were estimated at
US$33 million to be disbursed over a five-year period. The joint project was
funded by an IDA Credit of US$13.2 million, a UNFPA Grant of US$13.2 million
and a GOI contribution of US$6.6 million. The project became effective in
November 1972. At the UNFPA's request, IDA acts as the executing agency.
2.        The objective of this joint IDA/UNFPA-assisted project is to sup-
port the development of the GOI's national family planning program. Its
components covered a wide range of family planning activities including:
a.   the construction and equipment of 10 paramedical
training schools;
b.   the construction and equipment of about 320 MCH/FP
centres in East Java, Bali and Jakarta;
C.   the construction and equipment of six provincial and
10 sub-provincial family planning training centres;
d.   salary support for some 7,000 non-medical field-
workers;
e.   support for research and evaluation acitivities cover-
ing technical assistance, fellowships, research stu-
dies, seminars and a demonstration field postpartum
program;
f.   the construction and equipment of one central and six
provincial NFPCB administrative centres;
g.   the provision of transport for staff involved in
MCH/FP services and motivation activities;
h.   support for an extension of the hospital postpartum
program;



ANNEX 3
Page 2
i.   the provision of 115 mobile information units, tech-
nical assistance, fellowships and studies for infor-
mation and communication activities;
j.   support for a population education program; and
k.   technical assistance and fellowship support for program
management and project implementation.
Implementation
3.        In order to implement the project, the NFPCB established a project
implementation unit (PIU) which included staff for construction, accounting,
procurement and project management. This was considered necessary because
of the NFPCB's inadequate management experience, particularly in civil works.
In the course of time, as the NFPCB's management capability has improved,
the functions of the PIU have been absorbed by the appropriate NFPCB bureaus,
with the exception of the construction unit. The latter is now being absorbed
by the NFPCB secretariat in preparation for the proposed second project.
Foreign management consultants were contracted to assist the PIU in project
implementation, and technical assistance was also provided for family planning
program management, training, information, research, vehicle maintenance and
operations, and population education.
4.        The joint project was the first attempt at donor coordination in
a Bank-assisted population project. Not only was the UNFPA involved as a
funding partner, but other agencies coordinated the provision of technical
assistance and services. WHO supported the project on the basis of its over-
all assistance agreement with the GOI. UNESCO, UNICEF and the Population
Council, a privately-funded agency based in New York, negotiated and signed
specific technical asistance agreements with the GOI. On the one hand, co-
ordination undoubtedly affected the pace of implementation because of the
time taken to sign agreements after the resolution of difficulties caused
primarily by the need to recognize differing agency operating procedures and
GOI assistance requirements. On the other hand, the joint project helped
the GOI to coordinate assistance from several sources for a variety of acti-
vities, avoid overlap and assist the GOI in channelling this assistance to
key program development areas.
Construction
5.        The construction program got off to a slow start in part due to
the inexperience of the NFPCB with a program of this size. Failure to brief
the local architects adquately on user requirements was also in part respon-
sible. Retention of foreign management consultants was of little help in
overcoming these problems. Increasing familiarity of NFPCB staff with Indo-
nesian construction requirements and the establishment of effective tendering



ANNEX 3
Page 3
procedures and documentation with the support of Bank supervision missions
has eventually produced a unit of the NFPCB capable of managing a construc-
tion program of this size and nature. To date, 45 MCH/FP centres have been
built in the Mojokerto Regency of East Java for the demonstration field
postpartum program, five provincial training centres (PTCs) and 10 sub-
provincial training centres (STCs). The central NFPCB headquarters and 50
MCH/FP centres in East Java are under construction. Tenders will be let
in June for the remaining PTC in Surabaya, six provincial offices, and nine
paramedical training schools. The GOI has proposed that the civil works
program be limited to the construction of paramedical training schools,
leaving one nurse-midwifery school and 223 MCH/FP centres in East Java, Bali
and Jakarta to be dropped from the project. The reasons are that the GOI,
through the INPRES program, has built or rehabilitated a total of 3,675
centres in the period 1974-77 (45% in Java and Bali) which has eliminated the
need for additional centres to be constructed from project funds. The nurse-
midwife school is no longer needed following a change in the paramedical
staffing pattern subsequent to the start of the project. And on policy
grounds, the national program is moving towards a service system based to a
lesser extent on static service outlets than at the conception of the project.
The Bank and the UNFPA have formally agreed with these proposals.
Transport
6.        With the assistance of UNICEF, the joint project procured 158 four-
wheel drive vehicles, 213 minibuses, 3,180 motorcycles and 4,570 bicycles.
They are all in use in the field and provide program staff with much needed
mobility. In addition, 115 mobile information units were procured and are
in use in each kabupaten in Java and Bali. With the assistance of a foreign
expert, the NFPCB has established systems and procedures covering the main-
tenance and operation of its vehicles, including those provided by other
donors and those procured from local resources. Further details of the
transport provided by the joint project are given in Annex 5.
Training
7.        Two of the joint projects' components are directly concerned with
training, providing facilities and equipment for training paramedical staff
and family planning workers. One of the project's objectives was to assist
the process of restructure the 28 classes of paramedical staff which the
MOH employed into two or three categories, all of which would be important
in providing family planning services. As a result of discussions and sem-
inars, the concept of an auxiliary nurse-midwife as considered in the project
appraisal report was developed into that of a community health nurse (PKK).
The MOH plans to train 31,500 PKKs by 1980, 50% of whom would be nurses
retained from existing categories in a one-year course. An essential part
of the development of the PKK course was the retraining of 34 nurses as
PKKs at Sidoardjo in East Java in 1974. They received field training in
Mojokerto Regency and have been posted to the demostration field postpartum



ANNEX 3
Page 4
program. An evaluation of their performance is contributing to the develop-
ment of the PKK training curriculum. The nurse-midwife category has been
replaced by that of a graduate supervisory midwife and the proposed training
school for this category is no longer required. Tendering of the construc-
tion of the nine PKK training schools is scheduled for early June 1977, and
completion of construction is scheduled for April 1978.
8.        The joint project's assistance for the development of family plan-
ning training is discussed in paragraphs 6.09 and 6.10 of this report and in
Annex 6. One of the more important training activities conducted by the
IPPA with NFPCB financial assistance was the training of fieldworkers, the
salaries of whom were provided from joint project funds. Over 8,000 field-
workers and the necessary supervisory staff have been trained. The current
number of fieldworkers is about 5,500 which gives a level of about 1:14,000
people in Java and Bali. The project aimed at a level of 1:10,000 but this
was lowered because of steep salary increases since 1971, problems of re-
taining temporary staff such as fieldworkers, and the development of the
village-based contraceptive distribution system which provides new and wider
peripheral motivation and service activities. Problems of implementing this
assistance were caused by the dual budget system. The GOI share of salaries
was channelled through the development budget whilst project assistance was
channelled through a supplementary budget. Problems in monitoring the two
sources were eventually overcome and project assistance in this respect has
been phased out to the point where the GOI is now entirely responsible for
fieldworkers' salaries.
Information
9.        In addition to the mobile information units, the joint project has
provided two foreign advisors. One, who assisted the NFPCB's Bureau of Infor-
mation, has completed his assignment. A second advisor, recruited to assist
the Ministry of Information's family planning unit, was recruited in November
1976, for one year. His appointment coincides with the reorganization of this
unit and more effective radio, television and mass media support for family
planning activities should result. Problems of providing adequate audiovisual
materials for the mobile information units have been partly overcome by the
provision of an adequate number of copies of existing family planning films.
With the assistance of UNESCO, the production of a new film and other audio-
visual materials is nearing completion and should resolve these problems. The
project has also supported study teams, drawn from the staff of the NFPCB and
its implementing units to observe the information programs of major national
family planning programs.
Population Education
10.       The joint project's support for population education is described
in Annex 8.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
Hospital Postpartum Program
11.       The joint project provided support for an extension of the hospital
postpartum program to 86 hospitals. WHO provided the services of a technical
advisor, and the project provided salary support, essential hospital and
office equipment, informational and educational materials, in-service train-
ing programs, vehicles and funds for the evaluation of activities. The
strength of the hospital postpartum program does not lie in its ability to
add substantial numbers of new acceptors to the progam but in the provision
of contraceptive services immediately after delivery or abortion, particu-
larly surgical methods such as sterilization. The program recruits about
25% of all delivery and abortion cases as "direct" acceptors, i.e., those
who accept before or within three months of their discharge. This figure
compares well with international experience. Of the methods chosen, about
10% selected tubectomy, 39% oral contraceptives and 28% the IUD, the remain-
der selecting conventional contraceptives.
Research
12.       The research component of the joint IDA/UNFPA-assisted project
was designed to strengthen the research/evaluation capability of the NFPCB,
provide support for local contract research, and develop a demonstration
field postpartum program. The Population Council was made the executing
agency; it has coordinated technical assistance support for the NFPCB, the
Population Studies Centre of the Institute for Social and Economic Research
(LEKNAS), and the demonstration field postpartum program in Mojokerto. The
project also provided for fellowships, data processing equipment, vehicles
and salary supplements.
13.       It is in the field of family planning evaluation and research that
aid from other agencies, notably USAID and the Ford Foundation, has comple-
mented the first project activities most directly. Progress made in this
component particularly must be judged against the perspective of overall de-
velopment which has occurred in this field. About 10 studies have been sup-
ported from joint project funds covering both service and motivational aspects
of family planning activities. Of these, the more important include a survey
to evaluate the effectiveness of the special drive for new acceptors in East
Java, a sample vital registration project which is contracted to the Central
Bureau of Statistics, and a quarterly acceptor survey, which provides feed-
back on contraceptive use-effectiveness in the provinces in which the program
operates.
14.       The project is supporting the development of the LEKNAS Population
Studies Centre by funding overseas training fellowships, technical assistance
for both research and teaching duties, and specific studies including the
preparation of population projections for development planning purposes, in-
cluding the preparation of the NFPCB's medium-term strategy. Two research
papers have been produced on the status of women and work is proceeding on
a study of population distribution policies.

15.       The demonstration field postpartum program in Mojokerto had the
objectives of assuring improved maternal child care and more effective family
planning. The joint project provided for the construction of 45 MCH/FP cen-
tres, additional staff, technical assistance, vehicles, equipment and sup-
port for studies. Thirty-four communty health nurses have been trained and
added to the Regency MCH/FP staff, the centres have been constructed and the
necessary vehicles and equipment procured. Baseline surveys, including a con-
traceptive continuation rate survey, KAP studies, and a village ecological
survey (probing into factors such as distance, which affect the provision of
family planning services) have been regulated. In mid-1976, the NFPCB and
the Ministry of Health modified the program's objectives to emphasize the
integration of family planning into MCH care and to improve health services
within the framework of the national family planning program. As a result,
operational plans are being revised, responsibility for evaluation has been
delegated to the Institute for Public Health in Surabaya, and technical
assistance in health/family planning systems analysis is being provided.
Thus far, the demonstration has provided useful basic program data and the
opportunity to examine the effectiveness of PKK training.
16.       The development of an effective family planining research program is
difficult to manage because of its diversification. With donor support, the
NFPCB has managed a contract research program which has focussed on providing
important operational data and information on fertility and contraceptive use
trends; the available results have been successfully used for program feedback
and the development of the NFPCB's medium-term strategy. An adequate institu-
tional research capability will be evident after the completion of the fellow-
ship program and collaboration with foreign advisors.
Disbursements
17.       At April 30, 1977, US$13.2 million (50%) of the combined Credit and
Grant had been disbursed.

INDONESIA II: NFPCB MEDIUM-TERM PLANS
Program Strategy and Rationale
1.        The Indonesian family planning program has evolved through several
critical and overlapping stages. Prior to 1969-70, limited family planning
information and services were administered essentially through a privately-
funded and single purpose program. Once the Government became publicly in-
volved in administering the program, services were first provided through
health channels and in particular through maternal and child health (MCH)
services. In spite of the extremely encouraging response to the expanded
public program which was built up with National Family Planning Coordinating
Board (NFPCB) as the coordinating agency and with several Ministries (Health,
Information, Education and Interior), the Armed Forces(ABRI) Health Services
and voluntary agencies (such as Muhammadiyah and the Indonesian Council of
Churches) cooperating, it was felt that for ultimate success family planning
had to be viewed in a wider context. The second five-year plan, promulgated
in 1974, articulated family planning as a general development issue and linked
national population strategy to national development priorities and activities.
2.        The NFPCB has recognized that ultimate success de-
pended on:
a.   a shift in responsibility for the program to the field
level, i.e., the degree to which fertility control and
the small family norm are accepted by the community it-
self and the degree to which the community bears the
ultimate responsibility for motivating, recruiting and
maintaining family planning acceptors and supporting and
reinforcing the small family norm; and
b.   the undertaking of the responsibility for the family
planning program by the entire Government, i.e., the
degree to which the Government has initiated the process
whereby family planning and the goals of the national
population policy are integrated into the national de-
velopment programs of other ministries.
3.        The redirection of the program towards the field is not new.  One
of the early efforts to achieve this consisted of special drives in East
Java and Bali where the local population and community structures of entire
villages were mobilized for short but intensive campaigns to recruit new
acceptors. Although the special drives were initiated by the Government at
provincial level, their immediate success demonstrated the type of contribu-
tion which communities themselves could make to a more widespread acceptance
of family planning. Similarly, the community contraceptive distribution
schemes and the village acceptor groups emerged as much because of.the
*spontaneous involvement and participation of the communities in the family
planning program as because of direct Government intervention.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.       Ilarnessing local forces consists of a step-by-step procedure of
identifying and training key individuals--formal and informal leaders--
such as the village chief, his staff, local religious leaders and the school
teacher, who have the capacity to organize and positively influence others.
The Government does not consider the transfer of responsibility to the field
possible without a simultaneous improvement of the life of the individual
and the community. It has begun to initiate and implement programs designed
to overcome obstacles to family planning acceptance imposed by such features
as high rates of infant and childhood mortality, widespread illiteracy and
unemployment. For this reason family planning is working in close conjunction
with the national development program for the rural areas to create a respon-
sibility for disseminating, maintaining, and cultivating the small family
norm in the community.
Program Objectives
5.        The long-term aim of the family planning program is to reduce fer-
tility by 50% by the year 2000. On a linear decline, using a base total fer-
tility rate (TFR) around 5.8 in 1970, the TFR should reach a level of about
4.5 by 1983-84 which is the end of the third five-year plan. This would
roughly correspond to a 10-point decline in the birth rate by 1983-84 from
the level round 44 per 1,000 in 1970. In setting this target, the following
factors have been taken into account:
a.   Geographical Coverage:  As of this year, the national
family planning program provides direct information
and services in 16 provinces of the country. The pro-
gram in West, Central and East Java, in Bali and in
Jakarta and Yogyakarta has been in operation since
the inception of the family planning effort. In
1974-75 the national program activities were expanded
to 10 provinces in the other islands. During the
third five-year plan activities will be initiated in
the remaining provinces of the country.
b.   Current Users of Contraception (Prevalence):  The short-
term goal of fertility decline has been set in terms of
prevalence rates to be attained by 1983-84. These are
35% for Java and Bali, 25% for the 10 other provinces
to which the program was extended in 1974-75 and 15%
for the remaining provinces which will be brought
into the program in the third five-year plan. The re-
sponse of the public to the family planning program
has varied between provinces. Within Java and Bali
the acceptor rate has differed markedly with the
result that by March 1977, prevalence rates have
also correspondingly differed, with Bali and East
Java recording prevalence rates of 35.4% and
33.7% respectively of currently married women
aged 15-44, while the other four provinces had



ANNEX 4
Page 3
prevalence rates varying from 15% to 20%. In working
out the targets of acceptors, these differentials in
response between provinces have been taken into account.
Within Java and Bali, the goal of 42% prevalence rate
has been set for Bali and East Java while the goals
for the other provinces are less than 35, the average
for the entire area. In the 10 provinces of the other
islands included in the program, provinces, such as
North Sulawesi, which have done comparatively well are
expected to reach higher prevalence rates than others.
It is premature to adjudge differences in response
likely to arise in the remaining provinces and all
these provinces have been considered as a group to
reach the target of 15% prevalence by 1983-84.
c.   Contraceptive Mix:  An important aspect in relating
goals of prevalence rates to the number of acceptors
to be recruited into the program is the acceptor choice
of the different types of contraceptives. A method such
as the IUD has a greater continuation rate than the
oral contraceptive and it is to be expected that with
a lesser number accepting the IUD the same prevalence
rate as that reached with a larger number of oral con-
traceptive acceptors can be obtained. The contracep-
tive mix as displayed by acceptors is not only impor-
tant in terms of prevalence rates but also in terms
of effective protection given by different contracep-
tives as reckoned by avoidance of accidental preg-
nancies. Oral contraceptives, for instance, give rise
to less accidental pregnancies as compared with the
TUD. The net effect of acceptance of a contraceptive
on fertility is affected by continuance rate as well
as its effectiveness; contraceptive mix is, therefore,
also important in determining fertility decline. Two
sets of contraceptive mix have been assumed for Java
and Bali in working out acceptor targets, and are
given in Table 1. Both assume a reversal of the trend
towards a lower acceptance of the IUD. Mix A sets an
increase in the acceptance rate of IUDs to 20% by 1983-84
while Mix B aims at a more ambitious goal of 30% by that
time. The NFPCB has used Mix B as its target. Oral
contraceptives are expected to make up 50% of the accep-
tors in both mixes, the rest being made up of "other"
contraceptives. In the provinces of the other islands,
the program strategy will aim at obtaining Mix B.
d.   Number of New Acceptors Required:  Having estimated
the prevalence rates and contraceptive mixes required



ANNEX 4
Page 4
to achieve the desired reduction in the birth rate,
the NFPCB has set targets of the number of new accep-
tors which must be recruited. As indicated in Tables
2, 3, 4 and 5, these differ from province to province
in accordance with population size, length of program,
and results achieved thus far. In Java and Bali, in
the next seven years covered by the program, (1977-78
to 1983-84) if contraceptive Mix A which indicates
greater use of oral contraceptives is followed, 16.1
million acceptors will need to be recruited. If Mix B
(the NFPCB target mix) is achieved, 15.15 million new
acceptors are needed to meet the target. Using Mix B,
4.45 million new acceptors are needed in the 10 prov-
inces of the other islands, and 0.7 million in the
remaining provinces.
Program Needs
6.        To meet the program's objectives in Java and Bali, program expansion
will concentrate on the provision of information and services to areas not
completely or adequately covered yet. These will be provided through a number
of channels, including mobile service units and paramedical units as well as
the existing social structures and institutions of the community. The latter
will include village-based contraceptive supply depots, acceptor groups,
community leaders and social organizations which will become the final and
crucial supply link to rural inhabitants. Because of the nature of the
geography and population dispersion of the other islands, and because of
the experience gained by the programs of Java and Bali in involving local
institutions, greater reliance will be placed on mobile services as compared
with static clinics. The NFPCB does not plan to utilize family planning
fieldworkers in the other islands in the way they have been used on Java and
Bali. Instead village volunteers, village leaders and community organizations
will be trained to assume the roles and functions which fieldworkers have
filled elsewhere. At present, the NFPCB facilities in the other islands are
inadequate because they have to share already overcrowded offices with other
Government agencies. To accommodate the expanding activities of the NFPCB
in these areas, there is a need to increase the number of program staff
and new office facilities will be required.
7.        Expansion of program activities will be sought through greater
interaction with the ministries of the national Government whose programs,
particularly in the realm of development, reach down to the community level.
Although the mechanism of involvement of other ministries in the family
planning program has already been set into motion, the NFPCB will provide
considerable assistance, primarily through population training programs and
seminars for the staff of these ministries. Similarly, plans have already
been made for training various key persons in the community such as community
leaders, religious leaders, teachers, local Government officials, voluntary
organizations, labor leaders and intellectuals who heretofore have not been
formally included in the information and educational component of the program.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
Acceptor Maintenance
8.        The program will also need to lengthen effective contraceptive
use. One means of achieving this is to encourage new acceptors to adopt
more effective methods. During the seven-year period 1969-70 to 1975-76
there has been a steady erosion of IUD acceptances in Java and Bali, from
a high 54.7% of new acceptors in 1969-70 to a low 11.3% in 1974-75. In
1975-76 the percentage increased to 18.4% and the NFPCB hopes to maintain
this reversal of the trend away from the IUD and has set the objectives of a
method mix for oral contraceptives, IUD and condoms of 50:30:20 (Mix B) by
1983-84. One obvious approach to achieve this is simply the intensification
of campaigns to encourage acceptance of more effective methods. In the
November 1975 special drive in East Java, particular emphasis was placed
on increasing the proportion of IUD acceptances. The result was that IUD
acceptances made up 25% of the total of new acceptances during the intensive
campaign compared to an average of 10% in the regular program. Aside from
encouraging adoption of the IUD, the national program is investigating
the feasibility of expanding institutional methods such as sterilization.
Although such services are now available in only a few hospitals on Java
and Bali, interest is growing, particularly on Bali. The role of injectables
is likely to increase substantially in the next few years. A small pilot
project in Yogyakarta demonstrated the potential popularity of this method.
9.        Contraceptive use can also be maintained by the removal of identi-
fied obstacles such as rumours on side effects, real or imagined, which dis-
courage continued contraceptive use. There already exists a substantial
international literature on medically validated side effects which may be
encountered by users of various contraceptives. The NFPCB has conducted
research with the support of joint project funds and will embark on a major
informational and educational campaign to dispel those rumours which have
no scientific basis. The campaign will be designed to inform acceptors and
community leaders about common and mostly minor side effects which often
accompany initial and continued contraceptive use. Trained community leaders
can provide local counseling. Also, through the Government's expansion of
community health centres and the provision of mobile service units, increased
professional back-up support is expected to be made readily accessible to
those few individuals who do experience major difficulties with contraceptive
use. Greater emphasis will be made at the community level to create a com-
munity awareness of the obstacles to contraceptive use and to encourage the
community as a whole to support sustained contraceptive use.
10.       Another of the major obstacles to the continued use of contracep-
tives, especially those which must be renewed periodically, is a break,
even a temporary one, in the chain of contraceptive supplies. Here again,
the Village Community Distribution Centre (VCDC) and the village acceptor
groups will play a major part in ensuring that contraceptive supplies are
available when and where they are needed. The mobile service units, too,
will contribute significantly to this effort.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
11.       At the national level, a decision has been taken by the Government
to make Indonesia as nearly self-sufficient in its contraceptive needs as
possible. With the likely phasing out of supplies through foreign assistance
and grants, the Government is moving towards local production. The Govern-
ment launched a domestic IUD production program in 1974, which today supplies
100% of the national need. A local oral contraceptive manufacturing capabil-
ity is also planned; production is expected to begin in December 1977 and
should provide all requirements by the end of the third five-year plan.
Program Support Activities
12.       In order to meet its medium-term objectives and respond to program
needs, the NFPCB has identified principal program support activities which
require strengthening. These are:
a.   Population Education:  The Ministry of Education and
Culture instituted the National Population Education Pro-
ject to run in close collaboration with NFPCB. The project,
supported by joint project funds, has been operating for
three years. The earlier phase of the project had the
limited objective of probing into the integration of pop-
ulation education into the school curricula and out-of-
school program. The feasibility of such integration has
been established. With this in mind and with the decision
to gradually introduce from 1976 over a three-year period
the new curricula at all the stages of school education,
acccompanied by a massive program of upgrading all teachers,
the GOI decided to integrate population education in the
national education system. The program of the first phase
of the National Population Education Project which was to
end in 1978 was changed accordingly. By the end of the
second phase, 1979-80, population education will be assim-
ilated in the educational system of the country covering
all the primary, lower secondary and higher secondary
schools of all types (general, vocational, technical,
etc.). It will become an integral part of the pre-service
and in-service training of teachers at all levels. Its
management would become the responsibility of the existing
educational administrative machinery of the Ministry of
Education and Culture at different levels. Thus, by 1980,
population education would become an integral part of the
activities of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Though
as a start, attention has been focused on integrating popula-
tion education in formal and non-formal education, through
the Ministry of Education and Culture, the plan is to incor-
porate it in the activities of other ministries in due course.



ANNEX 4
Page 7
b.   Tar!Ti4gR: The term, here is broadly defined to include
both formal training of field-level personnel, community
leaders and the like, as well as more informal training
of other groups, such as personnel of national ministries
and other agencies whose greater involvement in the pro-
gram is desired. It will be primarily through such train-
ing that a common awareness and appreciation of the goals
and objectives of the national family planning program are
created and the basis for unified support to the program
will be provided. Training has been provided so far by a
National Training and Research Centre (NTRC), six provincial
training centres (PTCs) and four sub-provincial training
centres (STCs) of the Indonesian Planned Parenthood Associa-
tion (IPPA). Family planning training has also been pro-
vided for medical and paramedical staff at four provincial
and four sub-provincial public health training centres
of the MOH. The IPPA also operates 10 regional training
facilities in the other islands. Under the joint IDA/UNFPA-
assisted project, six PTCs and 10 provincial STCs are being
constructed to provide satisfactory facilities. Training
is now recognized as a development function which meets the
needs of and strengthens the entire range of program opera-
tions. It is against this background that the NFPCB, in
consultation with the concerned implementing units, is
developing a single national training system, under its
own administrative control which will be responsible for
all family planning training activities. In pursuance
of these objectives, the NFPCB's Bureau of Education and
Training will be expanded and developed and will replace
the NTRC run by the IPPA. At present, training facilities
in the provinces of the other islands are ad hoc institu-
tions, utilizing public buildings for training courses
and staffed by part-time teachers brought in from various
organizations. The NFPCB will establish a full-time PTC
in each of the 10 provinces in the course of the next
two years; new buildings will be required to house these
training centres. In terms of staffing and facilities,
the NFPCB intends to develop these training centres on the
same lines as those in Java and Bali. Their function will
be to train all categories of personnel required for the
province.
c.   Management Improvement:  Improvement of the internal
management of the program will be achieved through an
improvement and strengthening of the coordinating func-
tion both within the NFPCB itself, and between the



ANNEX 4
Page 8
NFPCB and the implementing units. Improvement is con-
tingent upon a careful and clear statement of the activ-
ities, which each must undertake so that the function
of each at the central, provincial and district levels
are fully understood and implemented. Since the major
thrust of the program is to achieve the total involve-
ment of the community and its institutions in the pop-
ulation program, the management operation style at the
community level will reflect traditional modes of oper-
ation and will differ markedly from those existing at
higher levels. At the national level, the dialogue
between population specialists and members of the legal
profession will be continued and expanded with a view
toward clarifying the legal aspects of the family plan-
ning program, reconciling any discrepancies between
reality and existing statutes, and investigating a
variety of legislative approaches to encouraging the
acceptance of family planning and the small family
norm. A variety of innovative approaches to encourage
the greater participation, involvement and enthusiasm
of communities in promoting family planning and the small
family norm will be designed and executed. These will
include a number of incentive schemes which reward family
planning achievements at the community level.
