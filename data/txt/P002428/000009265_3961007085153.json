the Urban Water\n            Supply Project are to: 1) improve water supply and\n            sanitation services in Freetown; 2) improve the\n            accessibility of these services to the urban poor; and 3)\n            ensure that water supply and sanitation services will be\n            sustained by strengthening the sectoral institutions.\n            Project components include: a) rehabilitation and repair\n            work on Guma Dam intake tower and raising of the spillway by\n            1.5m to increase storage; b) refurbishment of the Guma Water\n            Treatment Plant including replacement of obsolete equipment,\n            refurbishment of filters and other modifications to increase\n            capacity to match the supply capacity of the Guma reservoir\n            and transmission pipelines to Freetown; c) construction of\n            new bulk transfer mains to the rapidly growing estern areas\n            of Freetown;d) extensions to the distribution system to meet\n            the projected 2005 demands; e) improvement of reservoirs,\n            and provision of new reservoirs at Governor's Lodge,\n            Kortright and Wilberforce Village; f) refurbishment of the\n            subsidiary at Kongo, including provision of package\n            treatment plant of 1600m/day capacity with the source of raw\n            water from the Kongo Reservoir and replacement of the Old\n            Gloucester Service Reservoirs; g) secondary distribution\n            reinforcement; h) Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC)\n            institutional strengthening; i) supply of computers and\n            vehicles; j) technical assistance to implement computerized\n            systems; k) training of GVWC staff; l) improvement of water\n            supply operations in other major towns; m) sanitation\n            including technical assistance to plan low cost sanitation\n            including the design of a community outreach system\n            involving NGOs and/or other private agencies; and n)\n            rehabilitation and pilot scale extension of the existing\n            sewerage system and extension of the outfalls."}, "docdt":
