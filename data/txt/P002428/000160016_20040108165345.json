follows: The project outcome is unsatisfactory, project\n            sustainability is unlikely, the institutional development\n            impact is modest, and the overall performance of the World\n            Bank and the Borrower is unsatisfactory. The political\n            crises from 1997 to 2000 brought the project to the verge of\n            cancellation. Should the Bank cancel a project when a war\n            erupts in a country during project implementation? The\n            cancellation of the Sierra Leone urban water project would\n            have aggravated the potable water crisis in Freetown and in\n            the four cities to which the project had been extended and\n            would have increased waterborne diseases for the population.\n            Water works implementation in Freetown and emergency water\n            works for the secondary cities helped to avoid a\n            humanitarian crisis and restored the power system in\n            Freetown, which was in permanent blackout. The case of\n            Sierra Leone argues against cancellation of a project due to\n            armed conflict, provided committed project team members can\n            be found who are committed and willing to take the risk in\n            continuing supervision. A future Freetown water supply\n            project could ensure that the Guma Valley Water\n            Company's (GVWC) operating, commercial, and financial\n            capabilities are adequately addressed through establishment\n            of sound institutional arrangements. Any further investment\n            should start with strengthening GVWC's management\n            capacity. Future operations should also include\n            rehabilitation of the water supply and sanitation facilities\n            in some major secondary cities to encourage the return of\n            internally displaced people from Freetown back to their\n            places of origin, reducing the pressure on Freetown's\n            infrastructure facilities. When a country's portfolio\n            is restructured, project staff should be involved in the\n            restructuring of individual project documents as a first\n            step. It is important to restructure a project's\n            objectives to bring them to reflect the current situation.\n            This project would have benefited from greater involvement\n            of project staff in the Bank-wide restructuring of projects\n            in Sierra Leone, which took place in FY00. Project staff\n            involvement could have led to the desired redefinition of\n            the project documents to reflect only the revised and more\n            limited objectives of the post-conflict period, while\n            broader aspects could have been placed on the agenda for\n            consideration as part of the country recovery response. In\n            the post-conflict assistance situation, given local capacity\n            constraints, a reasonable timetable for implementing sector\n            reform programs needs to be developed; structural reforms\n            (private sector participation, revenue collection) should be\n            approached incrementally. In post conflict situations, it is\n            important to be clear about what burdens can be carried by a\n            utility. Aspects which are beyond the capacities of the\n            utility should be put clearly on the agenda for\n            consideration as part of the country recovery response. Even\n            if there is not yet time nor sufficient understanding to\n            plot out a new institutional and financial path, it is\n            better to recognize that explicitly than to continue to hold\n            a client accountable for unachievable objectives."}, "docdt": "2003-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
