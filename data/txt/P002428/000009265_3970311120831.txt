MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THIE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE
FOR THE URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval thc following report and rccommcndation on a proposcd
devclopmcnt credit to the Rcpublic of Sicrra Lconc for SDR 24.5 million, thc cquivalcnt of
US$36.0 million, on standard IDA tcrms with a maturity of 40 ycars to help financc thc Urban
Watcr Supply Projcct. Out of the Crcdit, the cquivalent nf US$28.2 million wvould bc onlcnt to thc
Guma Vallcy Water Company (GVWC) for 20 years including 5 years of grace at an annual
intcrcst ratc of 7. 1%, with GVWC bearing the foreign exchange risk. Out of the rcmaining balance
of US$7.4 million, US$1.7 million would be made available to the Sierra Leone Roads Authority
(SLRA) as grant, and US$6. I million to GVWC which would implement on an agency basis the
project components of the Dcpartmcnt of Energy and Power (DOEP).
2.     Background and Strategy. Thc prpulation of Freetown is about 650,000, and it is
expected to reach 920,000 by the year 200 1. Water is supplied for the Greater Freetown area by
the Guma Vallcy Water Company (GVWC), a public enterprise established in 1961.
Responsibility for watcr supply operations in the other major urban ccnters belongs to DOEP's
Water Supply Division and the Sierra Leone Water Company (SLWC) which was set up by DOEP
in 1988. GVWC has a well-qualified staffand has consistently produced positive operating
income (before foreign exchange losses and revaluation of fixed assets) and unqualified audit
reports. This perfornance is attributable to GVWC's autonomy, framed in its Act, which enables
GVWC to operate on a commercial basis with continuity of management and a sound
organizational culture. However, water supply systems are in poor states of repair. Responsibility
for sewerage rests with DOEP. There is a small sewerage system serving part of Freetown.
3.     Thr: strategy of the Government (GOSL) and GVWC foi developing water supply in
Frcetown is to: (a) maximize the supply of water available from existing sources/water systems by
minimizing losses through a concentrated leak detection and repair program and increasing the
volume of water in the Guma Reservoir, which would defer the US$150 million cost of developing
a major new water source; (b) manage water demand more effectively through a tariff policy based
on metered consumption; and (c) modernize the management of GVWC These issues are already
being addressed in part by the ongoing Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (FIRP)
financed under IDA Cr. 251 1-SL approved by the Board in June 1993. Similar strategies for
SLWC are being developed for the major towns outside Freetown:
4.     For domestic sanitation, most of Freetown relies on a combination of septic tanks, pit
latrines and bucket latrines; many residents are without any means of domestic sanitation. The
absence of adequate disposal methods results in serious environmental and health risks, especially
for the poor. The existing small sewerage system in the business district is in need of
rehabilitation. Under the FIRP, a study was carried out to update the sewerage master plan for
Greater Freetown, and community ablution blocks are being provided in critical areas. The study
recommended a strategy for sanitation and sewerage for various areas of Freetown based on social
conditions, densities, soil conditions etc., as well as institutional arrangernents for providing and



2
managing thcsc facilities. This strategy includes a low-cost saniitation program for many of thc low
inconic areas involving self-lhelp pit latrinc dcvclopmcnt.
5.     Proicct Ob'cctives. Thc main objectives of thc project arc: (i) to improvc watcr supply
and sanitation serviccs in Frcetown; (ii) to improve thc acccssibility of thcsc scrviccs to thc urban
poor and; (iii) to cnsure that watcr supply and sanitation scrviccs arc sustained by strengthening thc
sectoral institutions, espccially thc GVWC and the agcncics to bc responsible for sanitation, and by
introducing privatc scctor participation. Thc projcct would also help preparc watcr master plans
and devclopment programs for thc major towns outsidc Freetown.
6.     Proicct Dcscription. The projcct would support a major rchabilitation of the water supply
system, rchabilitation of a small cxisting seweragc system and the establishment of a low-cost
sanitation prograrn. It would also improvc the public and private sector capacities for operating
and maintaining these systems. (1) Water SuDplv: (A) GVWC water system rehabilitation and
cxpansion: (i) rchabilitation of the Guma Dam intake tower and diversion of wet season flows
from small catchmunts into the Guma reservoir; (ii) rehabilitation of the Guma Water Treatment
Plant; (iii) construction of bulk pipelines to supply the growing castcrn areas of Freetown; (iv)
rehabilitation and expansion of the water distribution network; and (v) consultant services for
supervision; (B) GVWC institutional strengthening: (i) supply of computers and software for
accounting and management information systems; (ii) supply of vehicles and tools for maintenance;
(iii) technical assistance to implement computerized systems and to identify possible private sector
participation in water supply operations to help manage increased investment programs and
operations; and (iv) training of GVWC staff; and (C) improvement of water supply operations in
other major towns, including identifying a role for private sector involvement, through (i) provision
of consulting services for water master plan studies for the major towns and an organization and
finance study for the water sector and for the water supply operations in these towns; and (ii)
institutional support. (II) Sanitation: (A) technical assistance to plan low cost sanitation and to
provide ablution facilities in low income areas in Freetown, including the design of a conmnunity
outreach system involving NGOs and/or other private agencies; (B) rehabilitation and pilot scale
extension of the existing sewerage systern and extension of the outfalls; (C) management and
consultant services for supervision; and (D) institutional support including office equipment and
vehicles.
7.     Project Implementation. Project implementation will be handled mainly by GVWC and the
Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) through the existing Project Management and Coordination
Unit (PMCU) for the FIRP, both of which have demonstrated good implementation capacity.
GVWC will be responsible for implementing its own components and, on behalf of DOEP through
a management services contract, the sub-components for sewerage and studies for the major towns
outside Freetown. SLRA will implement the low-cost sanitation component.
8.     Project Sustainability. The FIRP is assisting GVWC to sustain water supply operations
over time. This assistance includes: (a) a capital restructuring through debt rescheduling, mainly
involving debt with the Commnonwealth Development Corporation, and conversion of some debt to
equity, (b) financing an intensive program of leakage detection and repairs; (c) implementation of
universal metering and computerized billing system; and (d) the reduction in high accounts
receivable through agreement with GOSL to settle its water arrars. GVWC will continue to be
strengtihened as a fully commercially-oriented utility under the proposed project. GVWC would
complete the meterng of domestic water supply and mamtain adequate water tarifts to be in a
financial position to operate and maintain properly its water supply system, including facilities to



3
bc provided under the projcct. Undcr the sanitation componcnt, efforts will bc made to involve
NGOs and the privatc sector in providing and maintaining thc facilities. Under the FIRP, the
finances and managcment. including maintenance capability, of the Freetown City Courcil arc
bcing stiengthcned to maintain sanitation facilities. Provision is also included in thc project to
transfer thc rcsponsibility for thc operation and maintcnancc of the seweragc system from DOEP
to GVWC.
9.     Lcssons from Prcvious Bank Involvemcnt. Two types of problcms havc affected
implementation and caused partial failurc of past infrastructure projccts: weak institutions and
inadequatc counterpart funding. GVWC's and SLRA's performance on the implementation of the
FIRP ha: bccn cxccllcnt. Early project preparation, well-planned procurement processing and
GVWC's and SLRA's demonstrated capacity should help to minimize implementation problems. In
addition, satisfactory countcrpart funding arrangements have been agreed.
10.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. Through IDA involvement under the FIRP, the
Government and GVWC have relied on the Bank for advice on water sector policy and institutional
development. IDA is also assisting GVWC and the GOSL to examine the management implications
of the projected large growth in the investment program and future operation and maintenance
needs. The proiect is consistent with the Country Assistance Strat ge (CAS) reviewed by the
Board on October 14. 1993. The IDA strategy for Sierra Leone strcsses the need to rehabilitate
ifrastructure, including water systems, and to promote sustainable development by improving the
capacity of agencies such as GVWC. Given limitations in the public sector, it recognizes the need
for private sector participation in providing many critical social services. The strategy also
supports the provision of basic needs such as water supply to poverty groups.
11.   Agreed Actions. Agreements reached with GOSL, GVWC and SLRA include: (a) GOSL
will announce its policy on metering of domestic water supply including a statement on the
resumption of domestic metering; (b) the institutional and finance study for the water supply sector
will be completed by June 30, 1996 and GOSL will prepare an action plan to implement the
recommendations of the study as mutually agreed with IDA; (c) the sewerage functions in
Freetown will be transferred from GOSL to GVWC by January 1, 1998 and an action plan for this
transfer will be updated by January 1, 1997 for review with IDA; (d) the sewerage charges to be
put in effect by GVWC will generate sufficient revenue to meet at the minimum cash operating
expenses and debt service related to the sewerage operations; (e) GOSL will establish two project
accounts for SLRA and GVWC with initial deposit of Le 50 million each; (f) GOSL, GVWC and
IDA will jointly review the recommendations of the study on possible role of private sector in
enhancing GVWC's operating efficiency by January 1, 1996, and GVWC will implement those
measures in accordance with agreed target dates; (g) SLRA will have the project accounts, special
accounts and statement of expenditures audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to
IDA; (h) a mid-term project review will be held by August 31, 1997; and (i) GOSL departnents
and agencies will make payments for water bills within 30 days of receipt. Agreements have been
reached with GVWC that: (a) it will resume the metering of domestic water supply by July 1,
1995, and complete the installation of meters for existing domestic connections by March 31,
1996; (b) it will implement a water tariff structre based on metered consumption by December 31,
1995 and adjust tariffs from time to time to enable the company to earn a rate of return on average
revalued net fixed assets in operation of not less than 1% in 1995/96, 2% in 1996/97, 4% in
1997/98, 6% in 1998/99, and 8% in 1999/2000 and thereafter; (c) it will revalue its assets
annually, and maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5%; and (d) GVWC's accounts
ill be audited anri--ail ' and will be submitted to IDA within 6 months after year end, and such



4
accounts and audits will also inclutlc thc projcet accounts, spccial account and statemcnt of
cxpcniditurcs.
12.   Conditions of Credit Effcctivcness are: (a) GOSL will cxccutc thc subsidiary loan
agrecment with GVWC which is satisfactory to IDA; (b) GOSL will cstablish thc two Project
Accounts with initial deposit of Lc 50 million each; and (c) GVWC will appoint a scwcragc
cnginecr to assist in the carrying out of the se w;ragc component.
13.   Environmcntal Aspects. All physical components of the project will have a positive impact
on the environment of Greater Freetown. An Environmental Impact Asscssmcnt (EIA) was carried
out and made available by GVWC to the public in Frcetown, as well as through the Bank's Public
Information Ccnter (PIC). The EIA concluded that thc cnvironmental impacts of raising the
spillway levcl by 1.5m would be minimal since the reservoir has already bcen cleared some 2.5m
higher than the new proposed lcvcl of the spillway. The impacts of the: diversion of water into the
Guma rcservoir would be minimal. The construction of trunk distributioni mains and sewerage
system rehabilitation would cause temporary social disruptions which would be minimized by
contractual conditions. The construction of pipc sea outfalls to serve the immediate requirements
of the city would provide significant environmental improvements.
14.   Prgrams of Special Emphasis. The project will assist in alleviating poverty and in
improving public health by ensuring access to clcan and reliable water supply to all sectors of the
comnnunity including the poor. The project will also creatc lower level construction jobs and some
environmental improvements will also form part of the project.
15.   Proiect Benefits. Thc water supply component would improve the management and
operations of GVWC and expand supply capacity in order to meet medium-term demand in Greater
Freetown, to improve public health conditions and to enable industrial development in areas now
without water supply. The project would also assist in developing an institutional framework for
the water supply sector by supporting an organization and finance study for the sector. The
sanitation component would rehabilitate the existing sewerage system and assist in the planning and
implementation of low cost sanitation measures in priority areas in Greater Freetown. Economic
analysis for the GVWC water supply component, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the
works under the project, yields a rate of retum of about 8%. Sensitivity analyses indicate that with
a 10% increase in costs, the rate of return would be 7%. A two-year implementation delay due to a
lack of counterpart funds would also reduce the rate of retum to 7%. The use of economic rate of
return in water supply projects may underestimate benefits since consumer surplus and
externalities, such as improved public health, are unlikely to be fully captured.
16.    Project Risks. The main risk is associated with the capacity of GVWC and SLRA to
implement their respective project components. GVWC, with its long history of capable technical
performance and its successful implementation of the water supply component of the ongoing
FIRP, is expected to manage well the implementation of the water supply component of the
proposed project. SLRA, through its existing Project Management and Coordination Unit
(PMCU/FIRP), has demonstrated its capability in implementing its components of the FIRP.
Another main risk is related to counterpart funding. GVWC's financial projections indicate that
GVWC would be able to generate sufficient funds to meet its counterpart obligations. For the
other components, the Government would be required to make agreed initial deposits into project
accounts established before credit effectiveness and to make quarterly deposits into this account
during implementation. For the longer term, GVWC may face the risk of sustaining its viability in



5
thc light of our experiencc that most of the water utilities in Africa are met with ope ational and
finanicial difficulties. This risk would be minimized througlh the Government's and Bank's
continucd support for the autonomy of GVWC and modcrnization and strengthcning of GVWC's
opcrations and through thc dcvclopmcnt and implementation undcr thc proposcd project of a
stratcgy for increasing privatc scctor participation in GVWC's operations.
17.   The low-cost sanitation componcnt has an elcment of risk duc to the difficulty of
promoting and sustaining community-based activitics. This risk is being reduced bv using the samc
6mplcmcnting agcncy (SLRAIPMCU) that has gained pcrtinent experiencc through the
implementation of the urban upgrading components of the FIRP and by ensuring the involvement
and commitment of the communities. If the security situation in Sierra Lcone deterioratcs in the
futurc, it may also affect projcct implemcntation especially in the carrying out of the water master
plans and organization and finanec study for major towns outside Greater Frectown.
18.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreemcnt of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
