raise incomes and increase foreign exchange earnings through\n            expanded production and exports of cottage and small\n            industry products. The project would upgrade private and\n            public sector technical, marketing, and credit services and\n            redirect Government incentives affecting the cottage and\n            small industry sector. As a first phase program, the project\n            would focus on the Kathmandu Valley and the Gandaki Zone,\n            testing, developing and improving the various institutions\n            and services. By clarifying the responsibilities of the\n            various agencies, including an expanded role for the private\n            sector, and providing significant technical assistance and\n            training, the project would reduce the risks associated with\n            undertaking such multi-component ventures. Each component\n            includes a strong monitoring and evaluation system, which\n            should facilitate response and corrective action in the face\n            of unforeseen difficulties."}, "docdt": "1981-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
