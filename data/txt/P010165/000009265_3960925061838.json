The project achieved\n            its lending component objectives satisfactorily with most of\n            its quantitative targets being either achieved or surpassed.\n            Its impact has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and both the Bank and Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, effective\n            appraisal procedures, intensive supervision, and enforcement\n            of credit discipline in the repayment of sub loans and the\n            institutionalization of a credit guarantee scheme are\n            important elements in successful project-based lending.\n            Second, measures have to be taken to compel credit\n            discipline among large sub-borrowers, including the\n            requirement and enforcement of partial securities and\n            circulating a list of defaulters to all PCI branches. Third,\n            in the export development component, more time than\n            anticipated was needed to resolve the material supply,\n            product design, and marketing problems limiting export\n            expansion. Lastly, CIDB needs to evolve its approach to\n            training by providing substantial training to trainers to\n            enable them to upgrade the skills of existing artisans. The\n            upgrading of skills should be based on local sustained\n            demand for consumer products."}, "docdt": "1989-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
