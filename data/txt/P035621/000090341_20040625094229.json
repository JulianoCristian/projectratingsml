substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that the Pilot\n            Female Literacy Project (PAPF) proved that large scale\n            programs for reaching illiterate populations can be\n            successfully implemented in a relatively short period of\n            time by using the outsourcing approach if the project is\n            well designed and implementation arrangements are\n            appropriately tightened. Mechanisms to simulate and control\n            unit costs, conduct cost-effectiveness analysis, and\n            follow-up on progress of literacy programs based on an\n            agreed set of indicators are key to sound monitoring and\n            evaluation system. In countries similar to Senegal, it is\n            important to stimulate providers' participation in the\n            program through a set of incentives (i.e., institutional\n            support and training). These incentives are of great\n            importance particularly when providers are in limited number\n            or lack the capacity to deliver this type of sub-projects.\n            The involvement of local women's associations in\n            project implementation is important for the success of the program."}, "docdt": "2004-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
