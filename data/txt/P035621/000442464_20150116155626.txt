Teaching Women to Read and Write in Senegal                                                              July 1, 2002
                      It is widely acknowledged that educating women—given the pivotal role they play in teaching children
                      and keeping them healthy—is one of the most effective ways to reduce poverty.

                      In Senegal’s countryside, the majority of women aged 15 to 39 cannot read or write.  Not surprisingly,
                      children of illiterate mothers in Senegal are more likely to die young and less likely to attend school.

                     The Senegal Pilot Female Literacy project developed an approach for non-governmental organizations
                     to expand their programs with the aim of lowering the illiteracy rate to about 40 percent overall in
Senegal, and to 47 percent for women.  The project succeeded in surpassing Senegal’s target of teaching 135,000 adults to
read and write.

The project proved to have a positive impact on the social conditions of communities and in increasing female involvement in
civic life.  Over 80 percent of all participants were women, and the dropout rate has greatly improved over traditional
programs.  Helped by the World Bank and other donors like the Canadian International Development Agency, the Senegalese
government is on track toward its goal of halving the female illiteracy rate by 2005.  The government is stepping up efforts on
monitoring and evaluation.
