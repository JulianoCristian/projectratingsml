10-year\n            program which aims to reduce the illiteracy rate of the age\n            group 10-39 years old from an estimated 55 percent in 1995\n            to 25 percent by the year 2005, and form 66 percent to 30\n            percent for women. The main objective of the first phase\n            (1995-2000) is to lower the illiteracy rate to about 40\n            percent overall, and to 47 percent for women, by supporting\n            literacy providers to offer programs to a total of about\n            300,000 beneficiaries, 75 percent women. Other objectives\n            include: 1) ensuring the sustainability of literacy skills;\n            and 2) strengthening the capacity of the private sector to\n            deliver effective programs, and the capacity of the public\n            sector to monitor, evaluate and coordinate public\n            investments in literacy programs. The project will consist\n            of the following components: 1) literacy and post-literacy\n            sub-projects, including: (a) a minimum of 250-300 hours of\n            instruction which is necessary to attain a level of literacy\n            (fourth grade equivalent) where skills are actually acquired\n            and, therefore, can be maintained; (b) meaningful content\n            for adult learners; (c) materials appropriate for adults;\n            (d) teachers knowledgeable about the content and trained in\n            adult education approaches; (e) regular in-service teacher\n            support; and (f) participation of beneficiaries in program\n            design and implementation; and 2) project management and\n            capacity building in program delivery, management, and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1996-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
