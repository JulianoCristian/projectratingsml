sector\n            finances; (c) expand energy conservation and demand\n            management programs; and (d) improve sector institutional\n            arrangements. The project comprises the following\n            components: (a) transmission investment and rehabilitation\n            programs of selected power utilities for the period\n            1990-1993 including construction of transmission lines and\n            installation of transformer capacity at power substations;\n            and (b) Part A (1990-1991) of the National Electric Energy\n            Conservation Program including works (installation of more\n            efficient public lighting fixtures, loss reduction schemes),\n            studies (load management, system loss reduction, improvement\n            of efficiency industrial processes), research (improvement\n            of electrical equipment performance, use of improved\n            insulation material and construction technique for\n            building/houses) and training."}, "docdt": "1990-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
