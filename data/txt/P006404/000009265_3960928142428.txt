BRAZIL
NENORANDDW  AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO CENTRAlS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS S.A. (RLRTRORRAS)
ITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR AN ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation  on a proposed loan to
ELETROBRAS for US$385 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repaid over 15 years, including five years grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The loan would help finance an
electricity transmission and conservation project.
Background
2.       Brazil has  a  large,  complex,  and  technically  well  run power
sector. Although its tariff structure is generally in Xine with long-run
marginal cost (LRMC), its level failed to keep up during the 1980s with
accelerating inflation and increasing LRMC, so that average electricity
billed (basic tariff plus related taxes) for 1989 was equivalent to only
about 652 of LRMC.   As  a  result,  (a) the  financial health of the power
companies deteriorated, (b) important investments in transmission and
distribution were deferred, creating an unbalanced system with relatively
too much generation capacity (in the early 1980's, 63Z of investment was in
generation, and only 221 in transLission; investments in transmission are
beiiig increased to 30S of the total, while those in generation are reduced
to 46Z), (c) excessive consumption was encouraged, causing both economic
and environmental losses, and (d) the sector became a major net contributor
($6 billion by 1987) to Brazil's large and growing fiscal deficit, ar-d
hence, indirectly, to its accelerating inflation.
3.       Given the importance of the  power sectar in economic development,
the Government is continuing its efforts to financially rehabilitate power
utilities and enhance the quality and availability of electricity supply.
The measures being undertaken includes (i) substantially increasing power
utilities' internal cash generation, primarily through tariff adjustments;
(ii) optimizing the allocation of financial resources to high priority,
high return projects included in the least cost expansion program;
(iii) strengthening  the  institutional   arrangements  and  capability  of
ELETROBRAS  and  power  utilities;   and   (iv) rationalizing  the  use  of
electricity through comprehensive programs of loss reduction, demand
management and end-use conservation.
4.       The Government is also  implementing and periodically updating the
guidelines in the Environmental Master Plan (EMP), prepared in conjunction
with the Power Sector Adjustment Loan (Loan 2720-BR/1986), and the Bank is
monitoring the implementation. The EMP has resulted in: (a) improvement in
the environmental, resettlement and Indian assistance programs carried out
by ELETROBRAS and the electric power sector ccmpanies; (b) introduction of



- 2 -
environmental considerations in the investment selection process, and (c)
substantial strengthening of the environrmental analysis capacity of the
sector institut i one.
5.       ELETROBRAS, the overall financial and planning institution for the
power sector, is a mixed (public and private) corporation under the
Ministry of Infrastructure (formerly the Ministry of Miz.;s and Eaergy).  It
functions as (a) a holding company of four major generating subsidiaries
and two distribution companies; and (b) the sector development bank. It
also  owns  minority   stock   interests   in  the  state-owned  utilities.
ELETROBRAS analyzes expansion plans for major generating and transmission
facilities, and coordinates and supervises the interconnected public power
system. The Departamento Nacional de Aguas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE),
within the Ministry of Infrastructure, is the sector regulatory agency. It
(a) grants  licenses  for   generating   plants;  (b) assigns  concessions;
(c) approves  expansion  plans;  and   (d) sets  tariff  levels  under  the
principle of service-at-coot plus an adequate return on capital, and tariff
structures on the basis of  LRMC.    Under the Power Sector Adjustment Loan
(2720-BR), the Government drafted a review of the institutional structure
and certain policies of the electric power sector -- the "Revisao
Institutional do Setor  Eletrico'  (REVISE).    Areas  studied under REVISE
includeds (i) the overlapping functions and the high concentration of
responsibility; (ii) the need for a better definition of the roles and
degree of autonomy of the various sector entities and concerned Government
agencies;  (iii) problems  experienced  in   implementing  the  scheme  for
equalizing the rate of remuneration for all electric utilities, under the
existing system of uniform national tariffs; and (iv) the potential for
increased private participation in  the  sector.    The new Government will
review the recommendations of REVISE and then propose specific action
plans.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
6.       The Bank's assistance strategy  in  Brazil  is to support policies
and investments that encourage economic growth and social development in a
context of macroeconomic stability.   Our emphasis is on efficient resource
allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector and in natural
resource management, and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support
systems to the poor. The power sector is a key element in this strategy: a
secure and efficient supply of electricity is indispensable to economic
growth and social welfare.    Bank  involvement promotes efficiency through
pricing reforms, balanced sector investments, international competitive
bidding, independent review of institutional, financial and technical
issues, and implementation of environmental and conservation measures.
7.       From 1949 to 1985, the  Bank  made 39 specific investment loans to
Brazil, for a total of US$3.1 billion.   The physical scope of each project
was  narrowly  defined,  and  funds   were   allocated  to  one  or  a  few
beneficiaries. Disbursement was often slow, which raised serious concerns
within both the Government and the Bank regarding the efficiency of this
approach. Furthermore, this approach was not very effective in dealing
with sectorwide issues. In 1986, the Bank switched to sector adjustment
lending (Loan 2720-BR), largely in order to provide quick disbursing
support for  the  Cruzado  Plan  stabilization  effort.    Under this loan,
particular progress was  made  on  environmental  issues,  but the size and



complexity of the  sector male  such  a  comprehensive approach diffjcult.
Furthernore, efforts to process a second sector adjustment loan were
derailed by (a) the complexity of the sector, (b) the difficwiltiee in
achieving the financial targets of Loan 2720-BR, Ic) Brazil's transference
of uneconomic nuclear plant construction to the power sector, and (d) the
deteriorating macroeconomic situation.
8.       Based on these experiences, the large size of the country, and the
complexity of the Brazilian power sector, a sub-sector lending approach has
been  formulated,  to   finance   time-slices   of   the  transmission  and
distribution investment programs  o.  several  power  utilities, and to pay
particular emphasis to energy conservation.    This will enable the Bank to
monitor  closely  and  deal  effectively  with  sectoral  issues  such  as
allocation of resources, financial performance, institutional arrangements,
and technical and environmental aspects; however, it would not be as
complex and comprehensive as a sector investment or adjustment loan. The
proposed project has been designed in this context and contains measures
which address the above issues.
Proiect ObAectives
9.       The principal objectives of the proposed loan are tos (i) optimize
investment in the power sector through increased funding for high priority
transmission works; (ii) improve sector finances through tariff increases
and other measures; (iii) expand energy conservation and demand management
programs through the implementation of the National Program for Electric
Energy  Conservation  (PROoEL);  and   (iv) improve  sector  institutional
arrangements through the  implementation  of  the  REVISE.   These measures
would complement che continued implementation and monitoring of the sector-
wide conditionality in Loan 2720-BR, and maintain the Bank's dialogue with
the power sector during a difficult political and economic period.
Proiect Descrintion
10.      The project would comprise:  (i) a  time-slice of the transmission
investment and rehabilitation programs of selected power utilities for the
period 1990-1993 including construction of about 11,400 km of H.V.
transmission lines and installation of about 25,400 MVA of transformer
capacity at power substations; and (ii) Part A (1990-1991) of PROCEL being
implemented by ELETROBRAS, which includes works (installation of more
efficient public lighting fixtures, loss reduction schemes), studies (load
management, system loss reduction, improvement of efficiency industrial
processes), research (improvement of electrical equipment performance, use
of  improved   insulation   materials   and   construction   technique  for
building/houses) and  training.    The  strongest  and most capable sector
utilities (ELETROSUL, LIGHT, CESP, ELETROPAULO, CPFL, CENIG, COPEL, COELBA
and CERJ) have been tentatively pre-selected by the Bank and ELETROBRAS for
participation in the transmission component. Detailed eligibility criteria
have been incorporated in a Manual and agreed upon for the final selection
of both beneficiaries (based on technical, financial and implementation
capability) and their suLb-projects (based on considerations such as
priority, least cost principles, power market demand and environmental
impacts).    The  project would  be  executed  under  the  supervision  of
ELETROBRAS, which has created a high calibre Project Implementation Unit
that will review sub-project proposals, determine continuing eligibility of
beneficiaries, and generally supervise and monitor this program. Loan



- 4 -
proceeds would be onlent by ELETROBRAS to the beneficiaries on the same
terms and conditions as the Bank loan plus an annual administration fee
equivalent to  one  half  of  one  percent  on  the  amounts  disbursed anu
outstanding. Sub-borrowers would bear the full foreign exchange risk.
11.      About US$340  million  equivalent  (88Z)  of  the  proceeds of the
proposed loan would finance equipment and civil works for transmission
facilities. About US$30 million (8Z) would be used by ELETROBRAS in
connection with the PROCEL program.   About US$15 million (4X) will finance
interest during construction and other financial charges on the Bank loan
during the first two years of project implementation. The estimated cost
of the beneficiaries' 1990-1993 transmission expansion plans and the PROCEL
program, including physical and price contingencies as well as interest
during construction on the Bank loan, amounts to US$3,852 million, of which
US$1,570 million, or about 41Z, is the overall foreign exchange component.

Actions Asreed
12.      The following has been agreed with ELETROBRAS and the Government:
Prior to  Loan  Effectiveness:    The  Government  will submit satisAT-.ctory
evidence that: (i) tariff levels have been increased to the target levels
agreed under the Rate  Adjustment  Plan  (USS54/MWh);    (ii) at least five
beneficiaries and their corresponding sub-projects have been selected by
ELETROBRAS in accordance with the criteria in the Manual, and approved by
the Bank; and (iii) the Project Implementation Unit within ELETROBRAS is
fully operational.
Prior to Loan Disbursement for the sub-projects of each beneficiary,
ELETROBRAS will submit signed copies of an acceptable subsidiary loan
agreement between ELETROBRAS and the respective beneficiary.
Other Covenants: The Government will take all actions, including tariff
increases, necessary to maintain yearly average tariff levels at the agreed
level of US$54/MWh, and review with the Bank by November 30 of each year
the financial performance of  the  sector.   ELETROBRAS will: (i) seek Bank
concurrence for borrowing if its total debt coverage ratio is less than 1.1
or its ratio of debt to equity is greater than 60Z to 40Z; (ii) conduct its
operations in conformity with a financial investment ratio of not less than
1; (iii) carry-out the project based or. the criteria included in the Manual
for Selection of Beneficiaries and Sub-Projects, and submit for review and
approval  by  the  Bank   the   beneficiaries  and  sub-projects  selected;
(iv) maintain the Project Implementation Unit fully operational during
project execution in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (v) ensure that the
beneficiaries  do  not   enter   into   contractual  arrangements  for  the
implementation of generation and transmission facilities costing in excess
of  US$200  million   until   their   technical,   financial  and  economic
justification had been confirmed in a manner satisfactory to the Bank;
(vi) utilize and cause the beneficiaries to utilize standardized bidding
documents for procurement of goods and services; and (vii) cause the
beneficiaries to comply with the agreed financial, technical and managerial
performance indicators.

Benefits
13.      The pA:oposed project would allow  the utliities to: (i) meet their
power market needs; (ii) economically transmit the electricity generated at
the different hydroelectric plants to the main consumption centers;
(iii) increase system efficiency; (iv) improve their financial situation,
and (v) bolster managerial and administrative capabilities. The estimated
IRR's of the indiv.dual utilities' investment programs are over lZ. The
PROCEL project component would lead to significant peak power and energy
savings through improved end-use energy demand management and conservation,
involving the coordinated use of price and non-price policy instruments.
Typical subcomponents of the PROCEL program would provide a benefit-to-cost
ratio of at least 1.5.
Risks
14.      No special physical  risks  are  expected, as similar transmission
and conservation works have been successfully completed in the past. The
main risk derives from financial difficulties resulting from electricity
tariffs which have  often  been  below  adequate  levels.   These financial
difficulties are being addressed through specific measures (regarding
tariffs, equity contributions and borrowings) under the selected power
utilities financial programs, vhich are designed to improve their financial
performance. FaU.lure to implement such measures may adversely affect the
utilities' finances and may result in delays in the execution of the
proposed project. To reduce this risk, a condition of loan effectiveness
and continued disbursements is that tariff actions and financial measures,
based on the needs derived from the beneficiaries investment and financial
programs, should have been implemented and maintained.
Recosmendatio
15.      I am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan would  comply with the
Article of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
