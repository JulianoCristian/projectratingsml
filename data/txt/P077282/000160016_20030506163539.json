strategy, are\n            expected to place Chile on the path to a knowledge-based\n            economy: First, and foremost, the project will support the\n            development of an effective innovation system. I t will do\n            so by establishing a strong and coherent policy framework,\n            promoting high-quality and relevant science and technology\n            activities and by supporting key interfaces in the\n            innovation system, especially between the public and private\n            sector as well as international linkages. Second, and\n            subordinate to the first goal, the project will improve the\n            stock of human capital in the Chilean science and technology\n            sector, a development objective which is highly\n            complementary to the establishment of an effective\n            innovation system and per se a critical precondition for\n            establishing a competitive knowledge-based economy. The\n            project development objectives will be pursued through the\n            implementation of three components: (i) improving\n            Chile's science, technology and innovation system; (ii)\n            strengthening Chile 's science base, and (iii)\n            enhancing public-private linkages."}, "docdt": "2003-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
