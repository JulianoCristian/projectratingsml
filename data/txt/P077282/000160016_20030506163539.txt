A. 
Program Purpose 
and 
Project Development Objective 
1. 
Program 
purpose 
and 
program 
phasing: 
This 
program 
will 
support 
Chile’s  transition 
to 
a 
knowledge-based economy 
by 
investing 
in 
the 
innovation 
system 
and the stock 
of 
human 
capital. The overarching 
goals 
are 
to diversify 
the Chilean 
economy, 
reduce 
its 
vulnerability 
to 
external 
shocks, 
and, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
provide 
the  basis 
for 
sustainable 
growth. 
The program 
goes 
to 
the 
heart 
of 
what 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
a 
critical 
ingredient 
of 
high productivity 
and 
growth: 
The 
need 
for 
integrated 
innovation 
and human 
capital policies 
and systems 
(De 
Ferranti, Perry 
et 
al., 
2002 and 
2003). 
Chile 
is 
among 
the 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
best 
prepared 
to 
take 
a 
leap 
forward 
in 
this 
area 
and 
follow 
other 
nations that 
have 
achieved 
long 
term 
growth 
through well-matched education 
and 
technology policies. 
Given 
the 
long-term 
vision 
necessary 
to 
consolidate 
institutional 
and 
behavioral 
changes 
in 
the 
S&T 
sector, 
a program 
approach 
is 
proposed 
using 
the 
Adaptable Program 
Lending (APL) 
instrument. 
The 
program 
will 
comprise 
two 
phases. 
The 
first 
phase 
will 
cover a 
3% year 
period 
(2003 
- 
2007) and 
will 
support the establishment 
of 
a 
coherent 
policy 
strategy and 
a strong 
policy 
framework. 
It 
will 
also 
provide 
for 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative 
and 
a 
further 
strengthening 
of 
the 
science 
base 
by 
scaling up 
funding 
for 
research, 
develop 
public-private 
linkages 
in 
Chile’s  national 
innovative 
system 
and 
enhance 
the 
R&D 
capacity 
of 
companies. Based 
on a 
positive 
evaluation 
and 
the 
attainment 
of 
predefined triggers, 
the 
second 
phase 
(2007-2010) 
will 
continue 
activities 
to 
strengthen 
Chile’s 
science 
base 
and 
scale 
up 
funding 
for 
initiatives 
launched 
in 
the 
first 
phase, 
especially 
with 
a 
view 
to 
enhancing 
private 
sector 
R&D 
activities. 
2. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
project 
seeks 
two 
development 
objectives, which, 
in 
agreement 
with 
the Government’s 
strategy, 
are 
expected 
to 
place 
Chile 
on the 
path 
to 
a knowledge-based 
economy: 
First, 
and foremost, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
the 
development 
of 
an 
effective 
innovation 
system. 
It 
will 
do 
so 
by 
establishing a strong 
and coherent 
policy 
framework, 
promoting 
high-quality 
and 
relevant 
science 
and 
technology 
activities 
and 
by 
supporting 
key 
interfaces 
in 
the 
innovation 
system, 
especially between 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sector 
as 
well 
as 
international 
linkages. 
Second, 
and subordinate 
to 
the 
first 
goal, 
the 
project 
will 
improve 
the 
stock 
of 
human 
capital 
in 
the 
Chilean 
science 
and 
technology 
sector, 
a development 
objective 
which 
is 
highly 
complementary 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
effective  innovation 
system and 
per 
se 
a 
critical 
precondition 
for 
establishing a 
competitive 
knowledge-based economy. 
The 
project 
development 
objectives 
will 
be 
pursued through 
the 
implementation 
of 
three components: 
(i) 
Improving Chile’s 
Science, 
Technology and 
Innovation 
System; 
(ii) 
Strengthening 
Chile 
’s 
Science Base, 
and 
(iii) 
Enhancing 
Public-Private 
Linkages. 
See 
section 
C.l 
for 
a 
detailed  description 
of 
the 
components. 
3. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
A 
number 
of 
indicators 
will 
be 
monitored 
in 
order 
to 
assess 
the 
long-term impact 
of 
the 
project. 
These 
indicators 
are 
not 
expected 
to 
fully 
materialize 
within 
the 
project, 
but 
considerable 
change 
is 
nevertheless expected 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project implementation 
period. 
The 
program 
will 
contribute 
to 
improvement 
in 
the 
following

Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
goal 
supported 
by 
the project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
23329 
The 
project 
will 
in 
particular contribute 
to 
the 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS)  goal 
of 
sustaining 
overall 
economic 
growth 
and 
social 
progress 
in 
Chile. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
the 
ongoing  modernization 
of 
the 
state 
by 
(i) 
supporting core 
capacities 
such 
as 
strategic 
policy 
formulation 
and 
monitoring 
and evaluation, 
and 
(ii) 
identifying 
main 
obstacles 
to 
innovation 
and 
human 
capital formation 
and 
providing 
capacity 
building 
to 
key 
government 
institutions 
where appropriate. 
Finally, 
the 
proposed 
project 
will, 
together 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
higher 
education improvement 
project 
( 
MECE-SUP), 
the 
Bank’s 
Lifelong 
Learning  project 
(Chile  Culifca), 
and 
IADB’s 
efforts 
in 
the 
technology 
sector, 
form 
a 
coherent 
set 
of 
intervention 
policies 
and investments 
that 
would 
improve 
Chile’s 
competitiveness.

Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
This 
section 
deliberately 
frames 
the 
Chilean 
science, 
technology and 
innovation 
sector 
in 
the 
context 
of 
its 
global 
rather than 
regional 
competitors 
(Brunner, 
2003), 
since 
Chile’s  ambition 
is 
to 
reach 
OECD 
levels 
of 
competitiveness, 
productivity, 
and 
social development. 
The 
Need 
for 
Increased 
Application 
of 
Knowledge 
in 
the 
Economy 
Unlike 
most 
developed 
economies, 
the Chilean 
economy 
is 
to 
a large extent 
based 
on 
natural 
resources, 
notably 
mining, fishing,  forestry 
and 
agriculture. 
Copper, 
for 
example, accounts 
for 
more 
than 
10% 
of 
GDP 
and more 
than 
40% 
of 
export 
earnings. 
Likewise, 
exports 
from 
the 
fruit 
sector 
grew 
at 
a rate 
of 
20% annually 
in 
the 
period 
1974-1994. 
Application 
of 
knowledge 
is 
equally  important 
for 
the 
exploitation 
of 
natural 
resources 
as 
it 
is 
in 
High-tech 
sectors such 
as 
information 
and 
communication. 
As 
pointed 
out 
in 
the 
recent 
World 
Bank 
publication, 
From 
Natural 
Resources 
to 
the Knowledge 
Economy 
(World 
Bank, 
2002g), 
it 
is 
important 
to 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
knowledge economy 
is 
primarily 
targeted 
at 
“how”  the 
economy 
produces, 
rather than 
“’what”. 
Evidence 
shows 
that 
productivity 
gains 
from 
technology 
can 
be equally 
high 
and 
even 
higher 
in 
natural resource 
sectors 
(such 
as 
agriculture) 
than 
in 
manufacturing. 
Science and 
Technology 
strengthens 
comparative 
advantages 
in 
three 
ways: 
(i) 
create 
niches 
in 
existing 
areas 
of 
comparative 
advantage; 
(ii) 
codify 
and 
commercialize 
tacit 
knowledge 
in 
existing 
comparative 
advantages, 
and 
(iii) 
build 
new comparative 
advantages 
in 
connecting 
multidisciplinary 
areas 
of 
existing 
knowledge. The development 
path 
followed 
by 
countries 
like 
Australia, 
Sweden, 
and 
Finland 
is 
a clear 
testimony 
to 
these 
facts.

In 
Chile,  the natural 
resource 
sectors 
are 
to 
some 
extent 
based 
on the 
application 
of 
sophisticated 
technology. 
Chile 
has 
boosted 
productivity 
and 
output 
of 
these sectors 
by 
adapting 
and 
improving 
new 
technologies. Development 
of 
the 
mining 
sector 
was 
facilitated 
by 
Australian and 
Canadian 
know-how 
and 
investments. 
Likewise, 
the 
fruit 
sector owes 
its 
success 
to 
private 
sector 
agents, 
who successfully 
adapted 
foreign 
technologies 
to local 
conditions. 
Hence, 
the 
achievements 
of 
both 
sectors 
underscore the 
importance 
of 
innovation 
and 
technological 
development. 
Despite 
these 
success 
stories, 
the  Chilean 
economy 
is 
in 
need 
of 
further 
development. 
Chile’s 
manufacturing valued 
added 
per 
capita, 
although higher than 
the 
regional 
average, 
is 
still 
much 
lower 
than 
that 
of 
the 
OECD 
countries (Agapitova 
and 
Holm-Nielsen, 
2002 
and 
Brunner, 
2003). 
This 
is 
partly 
due 
to 
the 
domination 
of 
Chile’s 
economy 
by 
micro, small and 
medium 
enterprises, 
which 
lag 
behind 
in 
terms 
of 
technological  development 
and 
knowledge  formation. 
In 
consequence, 
high-tech  products 
constitute a 
low 
share 
of 
total 
export 
earnings compared 
to 
economies 
such 
as 
Argentina, 
Mexico 
and 
Brazil, 
and 
growth 
is 
to 
a 
high 
extent 
based 
on factor accumulation rather than 
innovative 
approaches 
to 
production. 
Therefore, 
Chile 
must 
embrace 
the 
knowledge 
economy. 
The 
Four 
Pillars 
of 
the 
Knowledge Economy 
The 
“knowledge 
economy” 
is 
a broad complex 
concept 
coined 
in 
recent 
years 
to 
indicate 
that 
learning 
and 
knowledge increasingly 
has 
become 
the 
critical 
conditions 
for 
commercial 
success. 
At 
its 
core, 
the 
concept 
stresses 
the 
role 
of 
knowledge 
as 
a  determinant 
of 
economic  growth.  The 
essence 
and 
complexity 
of 
the 
concept 
is 
captured 
in 
the 
World 
Bank 
framework, 
“the 
four pillars 
of 
the knowledge 
economy”, 
pioneered 
by 
Dahlman 
(2000). 
The 
assumption 
is 
that 
for 
a knowledge economy to 
be 
successful, the 
following 
conditions 
must 
be 
met: 
(i) 
An 
efficient policy 
framework  and strong economic incentives 
which 
induce human 
capital formation 
and 
innovation; 
(ii) 
a 
high 
level 
of 
human 
capital 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
scientific 
and 
technological 
progress; 
(iii) 
an 
efective 
innovation 
system, 
which 
adapts 
existing  innovations 
successfully 
to 
the 
economy 
and  expands 
the 
existing  frontier 
of 
knowledge,  and 
finally 
(iv) 
a 
high 
penetration 
of 
information  and communications technologies, 
which 
reduces 
the 
costs 
of 
transaction and 
increases 
flows 
of 
information. 
The 
following 
four 
sub-sections 
present 
the 
main 
issues 
within 
each 
pillar. 
Policy 
framework 
and 
economic incentives 
At 
the  most basic 
level, 
Chile 
benefits 
from 
an 
institutional 
framework 
far 
better than 
most 
LAC 
countries. The 
rule 
of 
law, 
for 
example, 
is 
consolidated and 
property 
rights 
are 
well 
protected. 
Likewise, 
levels 
of 
corruption 
are 
less 
serious 
in 
Chile 
than 
in 
most other 
LAC 
countries 
and the 
government 
continues 
to 
improve 
these 
fundamentals 
of 
development. 
Chile 
was 
the 
first 
LAC 
country 
to 
abandon 
the 
import 
substitution 
strategy 
and 
open 
the economy 
to 
foreign 
trade 
and 
investment. 
Hence, 
for 
more 
than 
two 
decades 
the 
Chilean 
economy 
has 
been 
subjected 
to 
intense 
international 
competition. 
This 
has 
increased the 
incentive 
to 
improve 
productivity 
and 
has 
prepared Chilean 
companies 
well 
for 
the 
global 
market 
(Brunner, 
2003). 
Notwithstanding 
these 
strengths, 
Chile’s 
policy 
framework 
and 
incentives 
for 
innovation 
and human 
capital formation 
are 
inadequately 
functioning 
in 
the 
following 
areas: 
Insufficient 
coherence 
in 
sector 
policies 
and strategies. 
First, 
of 
all 
Chile 
lacks 
a 
coherent 
government 
strategy 
for 
human 
capital 
formation 
and 
innovation. 
As 
pointed 
out 
in 
Agapitova 
and 
Holm-Nielsen 
(2002), 
no 
single 
high-level 
body 
is 
responsible 
for 
coordinating 
science, 
technology and 
innovation 
policies 
in 
Chile 
and 
public 
S&T 
policies 
have consequently 
evolved 
in 
an ad-hoc 
manner. 
Given 
the 
fact that 
human 
capital 
formation 
is 
critical 
to 
the development 
of 
a 
high 
quality 
S&T 
system, 
it 
is 
also 
lamentable that Chilean 
policy 
makers 
do 
not 
coordinate 
policies 
across 
different 
sectors. 
One 
of 
the 
implications 
has 
been 
low 
relevance 
of 
science 
to 
society and 
insufficient 
private-public 
knowledge 
flow. 
The 
development 
of 
a 
holistic, 
coherent 
government 
strategy 
is 
therefore 
critical. 
Weak 
Intellectual 
Property Rights 
regime. 
Chile’s 
intellectual 
property regime 
is 
judged 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
best 
in 
the 
LAC 
region. 
Even 
so, 
a 
survey 
by 
the 
World 
Economic 
Forum 
reveals that 
the 
level 
of 
-5- 
Page  10
intellectual 
property 
protection 
is 
inadequate. 
Recent 
initiatives 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
GoC 
to 
amend 
the 
LPR-regulation 
are 
unlikely 
to 
bring 
the regime 
fully 
into 
agreement 
with 
WTO-regulations (Agapitova 
and 
Holm-Nielsen, 
2002). 
ZnsufJicient 
access 
to 
risk 
capital. 
In 
general 
terms, 
the 
financial 
markets 
in 
Chile 
and 
the 
bank 
system 
are 
well 
consolidated. 
However, investors 
are 
highly 
conservative 
and risk-averse, 
which 
puts 
a 
damper 
on 
innovation 
and 
business 
diversification 
in 
Chile. 
Although 
recent 
initiatives 
such 
as 
matching 
grants 
offered 
by 
the 
Government through 
COW0 
call 
for 
optimism, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
provide 
greater 
access 
to 
venture 
capital 
(Dahlman, 
Hanna, 
Leipziger, 
Motta 
et 
al., 
(2003) 
and 
Agapitova 
and 
Holm-Nielsen, 
2002). 
Existence 
of 
administrative barriers. 
Obstacles 
to 
set 
up 
new 
businesses 
are less 
prevalent 
in 
Chile 
than 
in 
most other 
LAC 
countries. However, 
the 
time 
and cost 
of 
business 
registration 
far 
exceed 
the 
OECD 
average, 
hampering 
attempts 
to 
foster 
a 
culture 
of 
entrepreneurship 
(Djankov 
et 
al., 
2001). 
The 
Chilean 
Patent 
Office 
has 
also 
been 
criticized for 
operating 
in 
an 
bureaucratic 
and 
inflexible 
manner, 
reducing 
the 
incentive 
of 
private 
sector 
agents 
to 
solicit 
patents and 
invest 
in 
R&D. 
ZnsufJicient 
monitoring 
and evaluation. 
Finally, 
as 
a crosscutting 
concern, 
it 
should 
be 
pointed 
out 
that 
the Chilean  administration  lacks 
experience and 
tradition 
for  monitoring 
and evaluating 
policies 
on 
science, 
technology and innovation. 
This 
in 
turn follows 
from 
the 
fact that 
these 
areas 
have 
enjoyed 
less 
prominence than 
other 
policy 
areas, 
such 
as 
basic 
education 
where 
a successful 
monitoring 
system 
(SIMCE) 
is 
in 
place. 
The 
implication 
is 
that 
S&T 
policies 
and 
programs 
that 
do not 
lead 
to 
the 
desired 
outcome 
can 
continue and 
thereby reduce 
the 
quality 
and 
efficiency 
of 
S&T 
expenditure. 
Human 
capital 
Human capital 
is 
a 
key 
ingredient 
in 
the 
knowledge 
economy. 
Thus, 
a constant 
flow 
of 
skilled 
workers 
is 
a 
necessity 
if 
an 
economy 
is 
to 
take 
full 
advantage 
of 
constantly 
improving 
technologies. Enhancing 
Chile’s  innovation 
capacity  especially  calls 
for 
relevant 
and 
high-quality  tertiary 
education 
and 
post-graduate 
training. Chile’s education 
system 
is 
a product 
of 
numerous 
policy 
reforms launched over 
the 
past 
decades. 
Various  objectives 
have 
guided 
these  changes. 
The 
first 
wave 
of 
reforms 
was 
introduced 
in 
the early 
1980s 
with 
a 
view 
to improving 
cost-efficiency 
and enrollment. 
Subsequent 
reforms 
have, 
by 
contrast, been 
more focused on educational output 
and 
have 
significantly contributed 
to 
increasing 
the 
quality 
and relevance 
of 
education. 
However, 
numerous 
challenges remain. 
The 
stock 
of 
researchers 
is 
low. 
The Chilean 
system 
suffers 
from 
a 
lack 
of 
research 
personnel. 
The 
supply 
of 
PhDs 
is 
very 
low 
compared 
to 
leading 
LAC 
economies and 
a 
critical 
mass 
of 
highly 
skilled 
scientists 
is 
yet 
to 
emerge. 
The 
annual 
PhD 
production 
has 
been 
increasing over the last 
years, 
but 
the 
number 
of 
doctoral 
graduates 
in 
engineering  and  technology 
is 
significantly 
behind 
the  levels 
of 
countries 
such 
as 
Argentina, 
Cuba 
and 
Mexico. 
Consequently, 
the 
attempts 
to 
increase 
the 
stock 
of 
PhDs 
need 
to 
be 
further 
supported 
if 
Chile 
is 
to 
establish a 
“critical 
mass” 
of 
researchers 
and 
scientists. 
Inadequate human 
capital 
decreases 
the 
knowledge  absorptive capacity 
of 
Chilean 
firms 
and 
their 
tendency 
to 
collaborate 
in 
R&D, 
which 
hampers 
innovation. 
Low 
professional 
level 
of 
S&T  teachers 
in 
basic education. 
Chile 
is 
among 
the 
regional 
leaders 
as 
regards 
years 
of 
schooling 
of 
teachers 
in 
basic 
education 
(World 
Bank, 
1999b). 
Accordingly, 
Chile 
has 
experienced 
substantial improvement 
of 
student 
performance 
in 
mathematics and 
science 
during 
the 
last 
decades. 
However, 
further 
improvements 
are 
impeded 
by 
mediocre 
S&T 
training 
of 
teachers 
in 
teacher 
colleges. 
As 
a 
result, 
students 
in 
basic 
education 
do 
not 
acquire satisfactory 
levels 
of 
proficiency 
in 
hard 
sciences 
and 
are 
reported 
to 
be 
ill 
prepared 
for 
advanced 
tertiary 
education 
in 
S&T. 
A 
recent 
international 
TIMSS-test 
benchmarking the 
mathematics and science 
ability 
of 
students 
at 
the eighth 
grade 
level 
revealed that Chilean 
pupils 
rate 
far 
below 
the 
mean 
international 
score 
and 
notably behind 
comparable 
countries 
in 
Asia 
and 
Eastern Europe 
(World 
Economic Forum, 
2002). 
Along 
with 
recent 
improvements 
to 
the 
science 
curriculum 
designed 
to 
give 
science 
a 
higher 
profile 
in 
primary 
and 
-6- 
Page  11
secondary 
schools, 
Chile 
is 
likely 
to 
benefit 
from 
improving 
the 
science 
skills 
of 
teachers 
in 
basic 
education. 
Quality 
and relevance 
of 
tertiary 
education 
varies considerably. 
As 
pointed 
out 
in 
World 
Bank 
(1998) 
the 
quality 
of 
tertiary 
education 
differs 
substantially 
in 
Chile 
with 
public 
universities generally 
ahead 
of 
private 
universities. 
Local 
variations  notwithstanding, 
it 
remains 
without 
doubt 
that 
the 
quality 
of 
Chilean tertiary 
education lags 
far 
behind 
the 
levels 
of 
OECD 
countries. 
University 
education 
in 
Chile 
“meets 
the 
needs 
of 
a competitive 
economy” 
to 
a higher 
degree 
than 
in 
other 
LAC 
countries 
such 
as 
Mexico, 
Brazil 
and Argentina 
(IMD, 
2001). 
Still, 
the 
relevance 
of 
Chilean higher education 
is 
far behind 
countries 
such 
as 
Israel, 
Finland, 
Ireland 
and 
USA. 
Moreover, 
Chile 
has 
been 
relatively 
unsuccessful 
in 
supplying 
“skills 
for 
the knowledge economy” and 
fall 
behind 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
development 
of 
higher 
order 
skills 
in 
science 
and engineering. 
By 
contrast,  there 
has  been 
a 
proliferation 
of 
“soft  study” 
programs 
such 
as 
journalism, 
law 
and 
business 
administration. 
As 
pointed 
out 
by 
Brunner 
(2001), 
the 
lack 
of 
hard 
skills 
constitutes a 
major 
bottleneck 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Chilean 
economy. 
Innovation 
system 
Analyses 
of 
technological development 
have 
traditionally 
focused on 
input 
factors 
such 
as 
the absolute 
level 
of 
R&D 
expenditures 
and 
the 
different 
actors 
in 
the 
system: 
The 
enterprise 
sector, 
universities 
and 
public 
research 
institutions.  However, 
when 
Lundvall 
(1992)  elaborated 
the 
concept 
of 
a “national 
innovation 
system”, 
the 
intention 
was 
to 
promote a 
systemic 
approach, 
which 
in 
addition 
to 
traditional 
concerns 
draws attention 
to 
the importance 
of 
interactions among 
the 
different 
actors 
in 
the 
system. 
The 
rationale 
is 
that 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
an 
innovation 
system 
will 
increase 
if 
stakeholders 
have 
access 
to 
the 
existing 
pool 
of 
knowledge and cooperation 
is 
widespread. 
In 
consequence, 
government 
policies 
should 
also 
focus 
on 
mobility 
patterns, 
cooperation  and 
stimulation 
of 
knowledge 
flows. 
The 
following 
paragraphs 
highlight 
the 
main 
issues 
in 
the 
Chilean 
innovation 
system. 
Total 
R&D 
expenditures 
lag 
OECD 
levels. 
A 
precondition 
for 
an 
effective  innovation 
system 
is 
the 
availability 
of 
sufficient 
resources. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Chile, expenditures 
for 
R&D 
do 
not 
only 
lag 
the 
most 
developed 
countries, 
but 
are 
also 
behind 
a 
number 
of 
countries 
in 
the 
region. 
Hence, 
Chile 
spends 
less 
than 
both 
Brazil 
and Costa 
Rica 
in 
terms 
of 
expenditures 
as 
share 
of 
GDP, 
and 
is 
even 
further 
behind 
countries 
such 
as 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Korea, 
which on 
average spend 
around 3% 
of 
GDP 
on 
R&D, 
whereas 
Chile 
spends 
0.5% 
of 
GDP. 
Inadequate 
quality 
of 
research. 
Chile’s  scientific  community 
is 
well 
respected 
in 
the 
region 
and 
worldwide. 
In 
several 
areas, 
Chilean 
researchers 
are 
among the 
international 
leaders. 
However, 
while 
progress 
has 
been 
substantial 
it 
has 
not 
been 
sufficient 
for 
the 
country’s 
aspirations 
and 
much remains 
to 
be 
done. 
Firm 
level 
data 
suggest 
that 
the 
quality 
of 
Chile’s 
scientific 
institutions 
is 
lower 
than countries 
such 
as 
Korea 
and 
India 
and 
far 
behind, 
for 
example, 
Finland 
and 
the 
United 
States 
(Maloney, 
2003). 
Mediocre quality 
of 
science 
significantly 
reduces 
incentives 
for 
the 
globally 
competing 
private 
sector 
to 
cooperate 
with 
public 
researchers 
and 
consequently 
diminishes 
innovation. 
Deficient 
participation 
in 
international 
networks. 
The Chilean 
trade and investment regime 
provides 
for 
a considerable transfer 
of 
technology 
from 
international 
trade 
and 
investment 
partners. 
As 
already 
indicated, 
this 
has 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
developing 
the natural 
resource-based 
sectors 
in 
Chile. 
Despite 
its 
integration 
into 
the 
world 
economy, 
Chile 
is 
yet 
to 
take 
full 
advantage 
of 
international 
knowledge networks 
as 
a 
source 
of 
innovation 
(Maloney, 
2003). 
The 
number 
of 
Chilean 
scientific 
articles 
with 
international 
co-authorship 
has 
grown 
in 
recent 
year, 
indicating 
a 
rising 
level 
of 
international 
cooperation 
by 
academia 
in 
Chile. 
Still, 
the 
growth 
rates 
observed 
in 
Chile 
are 
lagging 
the 
levels 
of 
other 
LAC 
countries 
such 
as 
Argentina 
(NSF, 
2002). 
Noteworthy 
is 
also 
the 
low 
international 
labor-mobility 
of 
well-educated Chileans. 
A 
recent 
survey 
by 
the 
Institute 
for 
Management Development 
reveals that 
Chile 
ranks 
second 
lowest 
in 
terms 
of 
international 
labor-immobility 
within 
a 
sample 
of 
49 
middle 
and 
high 
income countries 
(IMD, 
2001). 
While 
it 
is 
promising 
that 
Chile 
is 
able 
to 
retain 
most 
of 
-f- 
Page  12
its 
highly 
skilled 
labor 
force, 
the 
propensity 
to 
stay 
in 
Chile 
does 
at 
the 
same 
time 
imply 
that 
knowledge 
import 
and 
export through 
international 
mobility 
is 
dismal. 
InsufJicient  relevance 
of 
research 
and  lack 
of 
cooperation. 
Chile’s 
public 
R&D 
system 
has 
been 
successful 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
Chile 
scores 
higher than other 
Latin 
American countries 
in 
terms 
of 
scientific 
publications per 
resident. 
Still, 
the added 
value 
of 
this 
research remains 
questionable 
and 
has 
been 
of 
little 
use 
to 
the 
private 
sector, 
directly 
and 
indirectly. 
The 
number 
of 
resident patent applications, 
for 
example, 
has 
remained 
low 
throughout 
the 
1990s. 
This 
reflects 
the 
inward 
orientation 
of 
the academic 
personnel, 
which 
traditionally 
has 
paid 
little 
attention to the 
needs 
of 
the 
enterprise 
sector 
(Lundvall, 
2002b). 
Symptomatically, 
cooperation 
and 
interaction 
between 
the 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
Chilean 
innovation 
system 
has 
left 
much 
to 
be desired. 
Although 
on 
the 
rise, 
partnerships 
and 
joint 
ventures 
are 
still 
not 
seen 
as 
crucial 
drivers 
for 
growth 
by 
firms 
and 
academia. 
By 
contrast, 
a 
recent survey reveals 
that 
most 
firms 
consider 
their 
own 
personnel 
to 
be 
the 
chief 
source 
of 
innovation 
(Melo, 
2001). 
Weak 
patterns 
of 
cooperation 
and 
low 
private 
sector 
activity 
translate 
into 
low 
labor 
mobility 
between 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sectors 
of 
the 
system 
and, 
in 
turn, 
insufficient diffusion 
and 
application 
of 
knowledge. 
Limited 
private 
sector 
R&D. 
Presently, 
the 
bulk 
of 
Chilean 
research 
is 
financed 
by 
the 
Government 
and 
carried 
out 
by  public 
research 
institutions 
and 
universities.  The 
private 
sector 
is 
responsible 
for 
executing 
only 
about 10% 
of 
the 
total 
R&D 
expenditures 
in 
Chile, a 
share, 
which 
is 
significantly lower 
than that 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
Argentina 
(29.5%), 
Brazil 
(43.5%) 
and 
the 
United 
States 
(75%). 
Thus, 
there 
is 
a considerable 
potential 
for 
improving 
Chile’s  innovation 
system 
by 
complementing 
public 
research 
with 
a boost 
in 
private 
sector 
R&D. 
This 
constitutes a 
significant 
challenge 
and 
it 
may 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to 
reform 
the 
institutional  framework 
and 
provide 
strong economic incentives. 
A 
change 
of 
mind-set 
and 
a 
stronger 
knowledge absorption capacity 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
may also be warranted. 
Information 
and communications 
infrastructure 
A 
highly 
developed 
information 
and 
communication 
infrastructure 
reduces 
the cost 
of 
transactions 
and 
increases 
the 
flow 
of 
information, 
thereby 
supporting 
innovation 
processes 
and 
knowledge 
diffusion. 
In 
addition 
to 
being 
the communication 
and 
transaction backbone 
of 
the 
knowledge 
economy, 
information 
and 
communication  technologies 
(ICT) 
are 
in 
themselves 
key 
products/services 
that 
result 
from 
a 
knowledge 
economy. 
As 
pointed 
out 
by 
Dahlman, 
Hanna, 
Leipziger, 
Motta 
et 
al. (2003), 
an 
early 
and sustained 
commitment 
to 
ICT 
by 
the 
GoC 
has 
led 
to 
considerable results.  Chile’s 
information 
infrastructure 
in 
its 
different 
dimensions 
(service 
rollout, 
quality, 
costs, 
and 
efficiency) 
compares 
well 
with 
developed countries 
in 
the 
region 
(Argentina, 
Brazil, 
Mexico 
and 
Uruguay) and countries 
in 
the 
world 
with 
a 
similar 
income level. 
Notably, 
impressive 
growth 
rates 
in 
mobile 
telephony and the 
Internet 
has 
been 
achieved. 
As 
regards 
ICT 
skills, 
a 2001 
survey 
by 
the 
World 
Economic 
Forum 
revealed that 
Chilean 
employers regard 
the 
domestic 
supply 
of 
ICT-workers 
to 
be 
among 
the 
best 
in 
Latin 
America. 
Despite 
advances 
in 
the 
information 
and 
communications 
infrastructure 
several 
issues 
remain 
to 
be 
addressed. 
Private 
sector 
use 
of 
ICT 
such 
as 
e-commerce and 
e-business 
is 
limited, 
software 
production 
is 
low 
and 
disparities 
in 
access 
to 
ICT 
are 
deeper 
in 
Chile 
than 
in 
comparable countries, 
mainly 
because 
of 
income inequalities 
and 
low 
population 
density 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Whilst 
of 
high 
importance, 
these 
issues 
are 
not 
believed to 
be 
significantly 
hampering Chile’s 
innovation 
and knowledge 
formation 
capacity. 
Government 
strategy 
The 
Lagos administration 
focuses 
on securing 
sustainable 
and equitable 
growth 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
a conducive 
macroeconomic 
framework,  strong 
public 
institutions, 
investments 
in 
human 
capital 
and 
social 
protection. The 
private 
sector 
is 
seen 
as 
the 
driver 
of 
economic growth, 
and 
the 
public 
sector 
as 
a 
facilitator for 
growth 
in 
the 
private 
sector. 
Education 
is 
one 
of 
the  core 
elements 
in 
this 
strategy 
and  the 
GoC 
is 
consequently 
committed 
to 
-8- 
Page  13
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
education 
and 
has, 
inter 
alia, 
expressed 
the 
need 
for 
expanding 
access 
to 
tertiary 
education through 
student 
loans 
and 
scholarships. 
The 
government 
is 
also 
emphasizing 
the 
need 
for 
stimulating innovation 
and 
technological development. 
Chile’s 
investments 
in 
S&T 
doubled 
during 
the 
nineties, and 
the present 
Government 
has 
stated 
as 
its 
target 
to 
double 
the 
country’s 
S&T 
investments 
from 
0.5% 
of 
GDP to 
1.2% 
by 
the 
year 
2006. 
Chile 
currently 
features 
a 
number 
of 
funding 
mechanisms 
designed 
to 
promote 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation, 
notably 
FONDECYT, 
FONDEF, 
FONTEC, 
FONDAP 
and 
MSI. 
They 
all 
apply 
competitive 
funding 
mechanisms, 
which 
in 
turn 
have 
stimulated a 
competitive 
culture 
in 
the 
sector. 
Despite 
the 
fact that 
the 
GoC 
has 
pledged 
to 
increase 
R&D 
spending 
significantly, 
Chile 
faces 
severe 
fiscal restraints, 
which 
in 
turn 
jeopardizes 
the 
possibilities 
for 
supporting the 
national innovation 
system 
with 
sufficient 
funds. 
It 
is 
against 
this 
background, 
the  current  program 
has 
been 
proposed 
as 
stated 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Development Program 
dated 
March 
31, 
2003 
attached 
as 
Annex 
13 
to 
this 
document. The 
letter 
has 
been 
endorsed 
by 
CONICYT 
in 
a 
letter 
dated 
April 
3, 
2003. 
The 
performance triggers 
for 
the 
launch 
of 
the 
program’s 
second 
phase 
has 
been 
provided 
in 
a 
letter 
of 
April 
3, 
2003 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
These 
letters 
are 
in 
the 
project 
file. 
It 
is 
of 
critical 
importance 
to 
support the current 
initiatives 
of 
the 
GoC 
by 
securing continuous 
and 
adequate 
flows 
of 
investment 
to 
the 
Chilean 
science 
base, 
strengthening 
the 
stock 
of 
human 
capital 
and 
stimulating 
the 
critical 
interfaces 
in 
the 
innovation 
system. 
Countries 
often 
fail 
to capitalize 
on 
their 
investments 
in 
S&T 
because 
of 
interruption 
of 
funding. 
The 
best 
of 
science 
cannot compete 
internationally 
in 
a 
“stop-go” 
system. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
Drawing 
on the 
four 
pillar 
framework 
of 
the 
knowledge-economy, the proposed 
project 
will 
address 
the 
following 
sector issues: 
(i) 
insufficient 
coherence 
of 
sector 
policies 
and strategic 
framework; 
(ii) 
lack 
of 
critical 
mass 
of 
high-quality scientific 
research 
of 
high 
relevance 
to 
society due 
to 
inadequate 
availability 
of 
R&D 
personnel and 
state-of-the-art equipment, 
and 
(iii) 
low 
research 
capacity 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
poorly 
developed linkages between the 
public 
and the 
private 
sector. 
Efficient 
policy 
framework 
and 
strong 
economic 
incentives 
As 
pointed 
out 
it 
is 
paramount that a more coordinated approach 
to 
S&T 
is 
adopted 
in 
Chile. 
This 
entails 
stimulating  horizontality 
in 
government and 
improving 
the 
ability 
to 
collaborate 
across 
sectors 
to 
establish 
an 
efficient 
policy 
framework 
with 
strong economic incentives 
and feed-back 
mechanisms. 
Coherent 
strategy 
for 
innovation 
and 
human 
capital. 
In 
full 
agreement 
with 
the 
Government’s 
development 
strategy, 
it 
is 
proposed 
that 
key 
public 
and 
private 
stakeholders 
are 
brought 
together 
to 
establish a 
coherent 
policy 
framework 
in 
support 
of 
innovation 
and human 
capital 
formation. 
Priority 
will 
be 
given 
to 
strengthening 
the 
Government’s  capacity 
to 
formulate  long-term 
policy 
visions 
supported 
by 
concrete 
policy 
measures. 
Conducive innovation 
policies 
and instruments. 
Accordingly, 
it 
is 
proposed 
to 
review Chile’s 
current 
policies 
and 
instruments 
pertaining 
to 
Science 
Technology and 
Innovation. Particular 
attention 
will 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
need 
for 
a strong IPR-regime 
based 
on 
flexible 
management, 
removal 
of 
administrative 
barriers 
for 
business 
registration, 
promoting 
of 
knowledge intensive foreign direct 
investment 
and 
fiscal 
incentives 
for private 
sector 
R&D. 
Focus 
will 
also 
be 
placed 
on policies 
that support 
the 
maturation 
of 
innovative 
ideas 
and 
improve 
access 
to 
risk 
capital. 
Continual monitoring 
and evaluation. 
Finally, 
the development 
of 
a comprehensive 
policy 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation mechanism 
will 
be 
supported. Based 
on 
both 
qualitative 
and 
quantitative indicators, 
the 
objective 
is 
to 
assess 
the 
societal impact 
of 
implemented 
S&T 
initiatives 
with 
a 
view 
to 
targeting 
-9-

resources 
and 
improving 
effectiveness. 
High 
level 
of 
human 
capital 
The 
basic 
education 
system 
in 
Chile, 
encompassing 
primary 
and 
secondary 
education, 
has 
already 
been 
successfully 
addressed 
in 
two 
major 
World 
Bank 
projects 
(see 
World 
Bank, 1999a and 
2001), 
which 
in 
turn 
has 
contributed 
to increasing educational attainment 
as 
well 
as 
quality 
and 
relevance. 
In 
regard 
to 
tertiary 
education 
and 
lifelong 
learning 
there 
are 
two 
active 
World 
Bank 
projects: 
(i) 
MECE-SUP 
stimulates 
relevance, 
quality, 
governance 
and 
efficiency 
in 
tertiary 
education; 
and 
(ii) 
Chile 
Califica 
facilitates 
policy-coherence,  expansion 
and 
formal 
skills 
formation 
for 
the 
adult 
population. 
Notwithstanding 
these measures, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
paying 
greater 
attention 
to 
expanding 
the 
stock 
of 
high-quality 
research 
personnel 
in 
Chile 
and 
increasing 
the 
supply 
of 
“hard 
skills”. 
Increasing 
the 
number 
of 
doctoral 
graduates. 
The 
quality 
of 
the 
public 
S&T 
system 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
a 
number 
of 
financially 
attractive 
PhD 
scholarships. 
Providing 
a 
sound 
financial 
basis 
for 
pursuing 
studies 
at 
the 
doctorate 
level 
is 
expected 
to 
enhance 
the 
availability 
of 
skilled 
research personnel. 
The 
scholarships 
will 
be 
distributed 
on 
a 
highly 
competitive 
basis, 
ensuring that 
the 
best 
candidates 
are 
selected 
for 
the program. 
Awareness 
and 
high 
quality 
S&T 
education. 
The 
inadequate 
supply 
of 
workers 
with 
training 
in 
natural 
and exact 
sciences such 
as 
technical workers 
and 
engineers 
is 
believed, 
in 
part, 
to 
be 
a result 
of 
low-quality 
basic 
science 
education and a 
lukewarm 
perception 
of 
hard 
sciences 
in 
the 
Chilean 
population. 
For 
this 
reason, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
efforts 
to 
improve 
science and 
technology 
awareness 
in 
the 
Chilean population 
at 
large 
and 
specifically 
in 
the 
business 
community. 
To 
supplement 
this 
effort, 
the 
Chilean 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
has 
expressed 
its 
intention 
to 
launch a 
program 
aimed 
at 
upgrading 
science 
and 
technology 
skills 
among 
teachers 
in 
basic education. 
Increased 
skills 
and 
awareness 
of 
sciences are 
expected 
to 
stimulate enrollment 
in 
S&T 
programs and 
a perception 
of 
R&D 
as 
a 
driver for 
economic growth. 
Effective 
innovation 
system 
In 
framing 
this 
project, 
due 
account 
has 
been 
taken 
of 
the 
need 
for 
public 
sector 
S&T 
activities. 
As 
pointed 
out 
in 
OECD 
(2000) 
the 
optimal level 
of 
research 
and 
development 
is 
unlikely 
to 
be 
achieved 
without 
public 
sector 
intervention, 
seeing 
that 
the 
private 
costs 
of 
conducting 
R&D 
in 
many 
cases 
outgrow 
the 
private 
benefits. 
This 
is 
particularly 
the 
case 
for 
basic 
research 
activities. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
strategy acknowledges 
the 
need 
for 
realigning 
the 
public 
sector research 
agenda 
with 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
private 
sector, 
enhancing linkages 
in 
the 
innovation 
system 
and 
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
current 
research 
(Brennan, 
1994). 
State-of-the-art scientific  community. 
The 
quality 
of 
the 
public 
S&T 
system 
will 
be 
improved 
through 
the 
support 
of 
institutions 
of 
excellence 
and research 
teams. 
This 
will 
allow 
the 
selected 
institutions 
to 
attract 
highly qualified 
researchers 
for 
long-term 
projects,  a 
necessary 
condition for 
establishing  a 
critical 
mass 
of 
scientists. 
Further, 
the 
existing scientific 
equipment 
will 
be 
upgraded 
to 
reach 
world 
standards. 
The 
awards 
of 
funds 
will 
take 
into 
account 
two 
key 
priorities: 
(i) 
the 
need 
for 
relevance, and 
(ii) 
the 
desire 
of 
an 
equitable 
regional 
development. 
Thus, 
preference 
will 
be 
given 
to 
proposals, 
which 
are 
attuned 
to 
the 
R&D 
needs 
of 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
to 
research centers 
outside 
of 
the 
capital. 
Providing 
access 
to 
international 
knowledge networks. 
The 
international 
linkages 
of 
the 
innovation 
system 
will 
be  strengthened 
by 
explicitly  prioritizing 
the 
participation 
of 
Chilean 
researchers 
in 
international 
research ventures. 
This 
in 
turn 
will 
facilitate 
the 
flow 
of 
knowledge 
to 
and 
from 
Chile, give 
researchers 
valuable 
insight 
and 
experience, and 
help 
bring 
Chilean 
Science 
to 
the 
global 
knowledge 
frontier. 
Enhancing 
public-private 
linkages. 
Interaction 
and 
transfer 
of 
knowledge 
between 
sectors 
are 
paramount 
to 
create synergies 
in 
Chile’s 
national innovative 
system and 
increase the relevance 
of 
research 
carried 
- 
10- 
Page  15
out 
in 
public 
institutions. 
To 
enhance 
linkages, support 
will 
be 
given 
to 
a 
number 
of 
cooperative 
research 
consortia. 
These 
consortia 
will 
comprise 
both 
public 
and 
private 
researchers 
and 
will 
be 
co-financed 
by 
participating  private 
companies. 
Along  with 
new 
developments 
of 
importance 
to 
Chile’s  industry, 
cooperative 
research 
consortia 
will 
provide 
cases 
of 
good  practice 
and  hence  pave 
the 
way 
for 
cross-sectoral 
research 
collaboration 
in 
all 
sectors 
of 
the 
Chilean 
economy. 
Boosting 
private 
sector  research 
capacity. 
Making 
world-class  knowledge  and discoveries 
of 
high 
relevance available 
to 
Chilean 
companies 
is 
necessary, 
but 
not 
sufficient 
to 
bolster 
innovation 
and 
growth. 
To 
bring 
about 
first-mover 
advantages 
and 
exploit 
comparative 
advantages, 
the 
private 
sector 
must 
have 
the 
capacity 
to 
develop 
and 
commercialize products and 
services. 
To 
stimulate 
industry R&D, 
it 
is 
proposed 
to 
support 
the 
employment 
of 
young 
PhDs 
in 
Chilean 
companies 
to 
conduct 
research. 
Insertion 
grants 
are 
expected 
to 
promote a 
culture 
of 
innovation 
in 
private 
enterprises 
and 
provide 
for 
a 
substantial transfer 
of 
knowledge 
from 
the 
public 
S&T 
system 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
through the 
mobility 
of 
highly skilled 
labor. Moreover, 
experience 
from 
other countries 
shows 
that 
researchers 
benefiting 
from 
time-limited 
insertion 
grants 
are 
likely 
to 
find 
long-term 
employment 
in 
the 
private 
sector, 
leading 
to 
an 
enduring 
increase 
in 
the sector’s 
R&D 
capacity. 
High 
penetration 
of 
information 
and 
communications 
technologies 
The 
proposed 
project 
will 
not 
contain 
measures 
directly 
targeted 
at 
increasing 
the 
penetration 
of 
ICT-technologies 
in 
Chile. 
First, 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
Chile, 
in 
cooperation 
with 
foreign 
investors, 
has 
already 
been 
quite 
successful 
in 
pursuing 
this 
objective. 
Second, 
the 
GoC 
has 
committed 
itself to 
expand 
the 
number 
of 
computer-literates 
(Business 
Latin 
America, 
2001, 
p.6.). 
So 
far, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
significant 
policy 
initiatives 
is 
the 
Enlaces 
program, 
which 
is 
delivering 
computers 
and Internet connection 
to 
public 
schools. 
In 
consequence, 
almost 
75 
percent 
of 
primary 
schools and 
more 
than 
90 
percent 
of 
secondary 
schools have 
access 
to 
computers and 
the 
Internet. 
Finally, 
the 
Inter-American 
Development Bank 
(IADB) 
is 
involved 
in 
projects 
in 
this 
particular 
field 
in 
Chile. Approved 
in 
November 
2000, 
the 
IADB 
Technology Development and 
Innovation 
Program 
aims 
at 
increasing 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
the 
Chilean 
economy 
by 
supporting technological 
innovation 
and 
development 
in 
strategic 
areas 
of 
the 
national 
economy. 
Especially,  focus 
is 
given 
to 
transferring 
new 
technologies 
to 
the 
entrepreneurial 
sector, 
particularly 
among 
Chile’s 
vast 
number 
of 
SMEs. 
Out 
of 
a 
total 
investment 
of US$200 
million, 
30 
percent 
is 
earmarked 
to 
accelerate and 
encourage 
the 
introduction 
of 
information 
and 
communications technologies 
in 
the 
productive 
sector.

Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a detailed description 
and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
To 
address 
the  key 
development 
objectives, 
this 
proposed  project  includes 
the 
following 
three 
components: 
(i) 
Improving 
Chile’s 
Science, 
Technology and 
Innovation 
System; 
(ii) 
Strengthening 
Chile 
’s 
Science 
Base, 
and 
(iii) 
Enhancing 
Public-Private 
Linkages. 
(i) 
Improving 
Chile’s 
Science, 
Technology 
and 
Innovation 
System. 
This 
component 
is 
designed 
to 
help 
Chile 
develop  a 
coherent 
policy 
framework 
and 
an 
enabling  environment 
for 
innovation. 
It 
will 
consolidate 
and 
modernize 
the 
country’s 
existing 
instruments 
and programs 
in 
science 
and 
technology 
to 
achieve higher levels 
of 
internal 
and 
external 
efficiency 
among 
researchers 
and 
their 
organizations and to 
nurture a more collaborative 
research 
culture 
among 
Chilean 
scientists. 
The component 
consists 
of 
three 
sub-components: 
(a) 
establishment 
of 
an 
independent 
Advisory 
Board 
and 
support 
for 
project 
management 
and 
implementation; 
(b) 
development 
of 
a 
coherent 
strategy, 
conducive polices 
and 
S&T 
awareness, 
and (c) development 
of 
a 
monitoring 
and evaluation capacity. 
This 
component 
will 
finance 
technical 
assistance  and 
capacity-building 
measures 
including 
operating 
costs 
of 
committees  and 
associated 
secretariats 
plus 
goods 
and 
services  necessary 
to 
help 
related 
groups  achieve  the 
set 
objectives. 
(ii) 
Strengthening 
Chile’s 
Science 
Base. 
Chile’s 
science 
base 
comprises 
its 
scientific 
and 
technological 
research 
personnel, 
its 
research 
infrastructure, 
and 
its 
capacity 
to 
access 
in 
a 
timely 
fashion 
the 
knowledge 
generated 
in 
other 
countries. 
This 
component 
will 
increase 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
science 
base 
and 
accordingly contribute 
to 
Chile’s 
social 
and 
economic development 
as 
the 
country 
moves 
toward 
a 
knowledge 
economy. 
The  objectives 
will 
be 
achieved through 
three 
competitive 
programs 
for: 
(a) 
excellence 
in 
science, 
(b) 
advanced 
human capital, 
and (c) 
improvement 
the research 
infrastructure. The 
component 
will 
finance 
grants, 
scholarships and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
program 
for 
major  scientific 
equipment. 
(iii) 
Enhancing 
Public-Private 
Linkages. 
This 
third 
component 
will 
support 
activities 
that strengthen 
linkages 
between 
the 
Chilean 
scientific 
community, 
industry 
and 
public 
sector 
users 
of 
research 
findings 
and 
build 
private 
sector 
research 
capacity. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved through the establishment 
of 
three 
competitive 
programs 
for: 
(a) 
cooperative 
research 
consortia; 
(b) 
researchers 
in 
industry, 
and  (c) 
international 
cooperation 
in 
research.

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
proposed 
program 
will 
support 
a number 
of 
ongoing 
policy 
reforms 
in 
Chile, 
some 
of 
which 
have 
been 
initiated 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Bank. 
First, 
the 
program 
will 
focus on 
policy 
visions and 
the 
need 
for 
strategic 
planning 
and coherence 
across 
policy 
areas. 
It 
is 
considered 
critically 
important that the 
GoC 
and 
local 
stakeholders discuss 
and 
formulate 
a 
vision 
for 
Chile’s  future 
development, 
which 
in 
particular 
specifies 
how Chile 
can 
develop 
into 
a 
productive 
and 
competitive 
knowledge 
based 
economy. 
This 
strategy must 
be 
supported 
by 
a 
plan 
of 
action, 
with 
a clear 
division 
of 
labor, 
explicit 
milestones 
and 
the 
support 
of 
competent 
policy 
bodies. 
Accordingly, 
the 
project 
will 
not 
only 
support a 
much 
needed 
policy 
discussion 
but 
will 
also 
lend 
support 
to 
key 
Government bodies 
involved 
in 
promoting 
human capital formation, 
science, 
technology and 
innovation 
in 
Chile. 
Second, 
the 
program 
will 
focus 
on 
a  number 
of 
specific 
policies 
and 
institutions 
pertinent 
to 
the 
development 
of 
advanced 
human 
capital 
and 
a 
competitive 
innovation 
system. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
recently completed 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative, 
a number 
of 
initiatives 
have 
already 
been 
launched 
to 
improve 
the 
policy 
framework 
for 
science, 
technology and innovation. 
These 
initiatives  include 
the 
establishment 
of 
competitive 
funding 
mechanisms and 
a 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
process, 
which 
allows 
policymakers 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
to 
evaluate 
policy 
initiatives 
and 
trace recent 
developments 
in 
the 
sector. 
Realizing 
that 
this 
is 
a 
long-term 
process 
which 
calls 
for 
behavioral 
change at 
all 
policy 
levels, 
it 
is 
suggested 
to 
continue 
this 
effort 
within 
the proposed 
program 
by 
offering 
further 
training,

capacity 
building 
and 
access 
to international 
fora 
for 
policy 
discussion 
for 
key 
Government 
bodies. 
3. 
Benefits 
and 
target population: 
The 
project 
has 
a 
number 
of 
tangible, immediate beneficiaries 
as 
well 
as 
long-term 
benefits. 
Conducive 
innovation policies 
and increased 
investment 
in 
R&D 
and human 
capital 
is 
expected 
to 
facilitate 
Chile’s 
transition 
to 
a 
knowledge-based economy. 
The 
improved innovative 
environment 
and 
the 
resulting 
economic 
growth 
will 
benefit 
the 
Chilean society 
at 
large.

4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
Project implementation 
period for 
the 
full 
program 
will 
be 
6% 
years: 
2003-2010. 
An 
independent 
Advisory  Board 
at 
the 
government 
level 
will 
be established 
by 
Presidential 
decree. 
It 
will 
be 
chaired 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Education 
and 
include 
three 
other ministers (Economy, 
Agriculture 
and 
Mining), 
three 
high 
level 
representatives 
from 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
three 
high 
representatives 
from 
the 
scientific community. 
The 
Advisory Board 
will 
(i) 
have oversight functions 
for 
the entire operation; 
(ii) 
advise 
on 
public-private 
interfaces 
in 
order to 
bring 
out 
the 
innovative potential 
of 
the 
private 
sector; 
(iii) 
and 
in 
particular provide 
guidance 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
component 
1. 
CONICYT 
has 
been 
designated 
by 
the  government 
as 
the 
project  implementing 
agency. 
A 
project 
coordination 
team 
will 
be established 
within 
CONICYT 
to 
oversee 
the 
daily 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
relation 
to 
project 
administration 
and 
management, 
the 
following 
criteria 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
account: 
the 
management 
should 
have 
the  capacity 
to 
operate 
a 
transparent 
competitive 
selection 
and 
allocation 
procedure, 
which 
must 
include international 
peer 
review; 
the  support 
of 
the 
best 
scientists 
in 
Chile 
must be 
flexible, 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
a clear 
and 
effective timeline 
for 
submission 
of 
proposals, peer 
evaluation, 
allocation 
of 
funds, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation; 
long 
term 
sustainability 
will 
depend 
on 
how 
the 
Government 
decides 
to 
move 
from 
a 
system 
of 
largely 
ad 
hoc 
procedures 
to 
a  consolidated 
management 
system, 
which 
included 
specific, 
but 
minimal 
rules 
and 
regulations 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
project’s 
objectives; 
and 
the 
Advisory  Board 
should 
be 
maintained independently 
of 
the 
formal location 
of 
the 
project 
to 
preserve 
the 
project’s 
credibility 
and 
autonomy.

Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
Supply 
side 
versus 
demand 
side 
interventions. 
The 
team 
considered 
the 
possibility 
of 
increasing focus on 
demand 
side 
interventions. 
It 
was 
agreed 
to 
incorporate  a 
sub-component 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
cooperative 
research 
consortia 
with 
significant private 
sector 
participation 
and 
a 
sub-component that 
supports the 
private 
sector 
in 
building 
adequate 
human 
capital 
for 
R&D. 
Two 
arguments 
speak 
strongly 
for 
the fact that 
the 
agreed 
action 
lines 
are 
optimal given 
the 
economic 
and 
institutional 
framework 
for 
the 
project: 
(a) 
economic: 
OECD 
and 
Bank 
research 
underlines 
that 
an 
inadequate 
level 
of 
R&D 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
can 
be 
traced back 
to 
a 
combination 
of 
low 
technological absorption capacity 
of 
domestic 
firms, 
failures 
in 
technology 
transfer 
between 
sectors, 
and 
insufficient 
high 
quality, 
relevant 
science, 
which 
is 
a prerequisite 
for 
public 
science 
and 
technology 
to 
be 
attractive 
for 
the 
private 
sector 
competing 
on a 
world 
market, 
and 
(b) 
institutional: 
as 
the 
implementing 
agency, 
the 
government 
has 
designated 
CONICYT, 
which 
has 
no 
mandate 
or 
experience 
with 
demand 
side 
interventions. 
Hitherto 
such 
interventions 
pertain 
to CORFO under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy, 
which

in

and 
development. 
Only 
investment 
in 
basic 
science versus 
sectoral approach. 
It 
was 
considered 
to 
continue 
the 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative 
and 
similar 
basic 
science 
programs 
without  introducing  additional 
components. 
However, 
such 
a 
stand 
alone 
measure 
is 
not 
supported 
by 
international 
best 
practice  and 
was 
recommended against 
by 
the 
Bank's 
external evaluation 
of 
the 
global 
MSI, 
which 
called 
for 
a 
holistic 
approach encompassing 
mutual supportive 
components. 
On 
these 
grounds 
the proposal 
was 
rejected, and 
a sectoral 
component 
was 
introduced 
in 
order 
to 
coordinate 
investments, 
policies 
and 
competences 
within 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation, 
notably 
between the 
private 
and 
public 
sector 
as 
well 
as 
within 
the  government. 
This 
component 
would 
be 
key 
for 
increased 
coordination 
and  enhanced 
regulation 
of 
the 
national innovation 
system. 
Reorient  existing  programs  and 
concentration 
of 
resources 
on 
most 
effective  instruments 
versus 
increasing 
resources 
to 
unmodified 
programs. 
Only 
increasing 
resources 
to 
unmodified 
programs 
were 
rejected on 
the 
ground 
that 
efforts 
to 
create 
knowledge 
and human capital relevant 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
productive 
sector 
as 
well 
as 
interaction 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
could 
be 
strengthened. 
It 
was 
decided 
to 
reorient 
existing 
programs 
towards 
the 
above-mentioned goals among other 
things 
by including 
PhD 
scholarships and 
cooperative 
research 
consortia, 
and 
thereby 
avoiding 
the  creation 
of 
new 
funding 
instruments. 
Further, 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
target 
financing 
to 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
instruments 
which 
are 
likely to 
become 
highly 
effective, thereby 
maximizing 
impact 
and 
achieving 
economy 
of 
scale 
in 
the 
S&T 
sector. 
Further, 
this 
strategic 
choice 
will 
improve 
complementarity  and organization 
of 
funding 
instruments 
in 
the 
program 
portfolio. 
Focus 
on 
the 
innovation  capacity 
of 
SMEs. 
It 
was 
considered 
to 
focus  the 
project 
on  knowledge 
formation 
and 
innovation 
in 
SMEs, 
considering  their 
dominance 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
limited 
capability 
to 
undertake 
R&D. 
The 
proposal 
was 
rejected 
due 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
several programs 
run 
by 
CORFO 
(under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy) 
with 
a strong 
involvement 
of 
the 
Inter-American 
Development 
Bank, 
targeted 
at 
supporting 
technological 
innovation 
and development and 
their 
transfer 
to 
SMEs 
(IADB, 
2000).

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
The 
proposed 
project 
takes 
a 
holistic 
approach 
to 
the 
knowledge 
economy. The 
project 
design 
reflects 
lessons 
learnt 
from 
various 
Bank 
projects 
in 
Chile, 
notably 
the 
MSI 
and 
the 
MECE-SUP 
project. 
Lessons 
have also 
been 
included 
from 
a 
recent 
review 
by 
the Operations 
Evaluation 
Department (OED) 
of 
World 
Bank 
operations 
in 
Chile 
in 
the 
period 
1985-1999: 
Chile:  Country 
Assistance 
Evaluation, 
and 
from 
the 
Bank's 
portfolio 
of 
projects 
in 
post-secondary 
education,  and 
science and 
technology 
in 
the region, 
particularly 
in 
Brazil 
and 
Mexico. 
First, 
the 
MSI 
completion 
report  and 
the 
recent 
MECE-SUP 
mid-term 
review 
stress 
the  need 
for 
sustainability. 
It 
is 
critical 
to 
consolidate the emerging 
trends 
of 
a 
competitive 
culture 
in 
Chile 
and 
ensure 
that 
scientists 
for 
example, 
have a 
time horizon sufficiently 
long 
to 
commit 
fully 
to 
the 
project. 
This 
in 
turn 
is 
a 
necessity 
for 
attracting 
a 
critical 
mass 
of 
scientists. 
It 
is 
for 
that 
reason 
that 
the 
project 
proposes 
to 
continue 
to 
support 
these 
activities. 
Second, 
several 
policy 
recommendations 
from 
"Closing 
the 
Gaps 
in 
Education 
and Technology", 
World 
- 
17- 
Page  22
Bank 
(2002), 
are 
fully 
reflected 
in 
the 
proposed 
project 
design. 
The 
most 
important 
are: 
(i) 
need 
for 
accelerating 
human 
capital  accumulation: 
(ii) 
high 
complementarity  between 
human 
slulls 
and 
technological 
development; 
(iii) 
concentration 
of 
skills 
in 
networks 
and, 
(iv) 
increase 
knowledge 
diffusion 
between 
the 
public 
research 
providers 
and 
private 
enterprises 
in 
order 
to 
boost 
private 
sector 
R&D. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
specific program 
components, 
the 
project integrates 
numerous 
lessons 
from 
the 
MSI 
and the 
MECE-SUP 
project 
as 
well 
as 
the 
OED 
review 
of 
World 
Bank 
assistance 
to 
Chile. 
The 
need 
to 
promote 
long 
term 
strategic 
planning 
and coherent 
policy 
visions 
was 
highlighted 
in 
reviews 
of 
the 
MSI 
project, 
for 
example. 
The decision 
to 
address 
institutions 
and economic 
incentives 
is 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
OED-report, 
which 
points 
to 
the 
need 
for 
strong 
institutions 
and economic incentives 
for 
private 
sector 
participation. 
The 
rationale 
is 
that 
the 
private 
sector, 
given 
the 
right 
circumstances, 
is 
in 
a better 
position 
than the 
public 
sector 
to 
deliver 
services and 
manage 
natural 
resources 
in 
an 
efficient 
and 
effective 
way. 
The 
high 
importance attributed 
to 
competitive 
grants 
reflects the 
positive 
evaluations 
given 
to 
these 
grants 
in 
the 
MSI 
and 
MECE-SUP 
reviews. 
Thus, 
the 
MSI 
implementation 
completion 
report 
concludes 
that 
even 
limited 
investments 
can have 
a strong impact upon performance and 
productivity 
in 
the 
S&T 
system, 
if 
funds 
are 
allocated according 
to 
transparent, 
objective 
and 
competitive criteria. 
In 
other 
words, 
applicants 
and 
other  stakeholders  have  responded 
positively 
to 
being 
judged 
on 
transparent  and 
competitive criteria, 
even 
when they 
did 
not 
qualify 
for 
funding. 
Once 
the 
World 
Bank 
has 
ensured 
that 
the 
bidding 
process 
is 
transparent and 
fair, 
it 
should 
be 
left 
to 
the 
borrower 
to 
decide 
which 
activities 
should receive 
support. 
This 
ensures 
ownership 
of 
the 
project 
and 
increases 
efficiency 
by 
reducing 
bureaucratic 
barriers. 
The 
mid-term 
review 
of 
the 
MECE-SUP  program 
likewise 
notes  that 
the 
introduction 
of 
a competitive 
fund 
has 
spurred 
a 
change 
of 
mind-set towards 
competition 
in 
the 
Chilean 
university 
sector. 
In 
consequence, 
the 
Bank 
has 
very good experience 
with 
introducing 
competitive 
funds 
in 
Chile 
and 
letting 
the 
borrower 
take 
responsibility 
for 
selection 
of 
grantees  once 
they  have 
been 
properly 
set 
up. 
The decision 
to 
include private 
sector 
insertion 
grants and 
highlight 
private 
sector relevance 
on 
the 
public 
S&T 
system 
reflects 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
MSI 
implementation 
completion 
report, 
which 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
Chilean S&T 
system 
had reduced 
implications 
for 
the enterprise 
sector 
and that 
the 
private 
and 
public 
sector appeared 
to 
be 
isolated 
from 
each 
other. 
Proposed components 
take 
account 
of 
experience 
from 
the 
region showing 
that 
private 
sector components 
are 
inherently 
difficult 
to 
design. 
Insufficient 
private 
sector 
R&D 
stems 
not 
primarily from 
unavailability 
of 
funds, 
but 
is 
also 
a symptom 
of 
deficient 
private 
sector 
R&D 
capacity. Projects supporting 
private 
sector 
R&D 
in 
Brazil 
and 
Mexico 
were 
recently 
restructured, 
acting 
on 
the 
fact that 
less 
than 
20 
percent 
of 
matching-funds 
were disbursed 
after 
five 
years. 
Drawing 
on 
lessons 
learned, 
this 
project 
would 
boost 
private 
sector 
R&D 
demand and 
absorption  capacity 
by 
supporting 
industry 
R&D, 
encouraging 
outreach 
activities, 
promoting 
cross-sectoral 
researcher 
mobility 
and 
fostering 
a 
culture 
of 
partnership between 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sector.

Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and ownership: 
The 
Lagos  administration 
has 
frequently 
emphasized 
the 
need 
for 
stimulating  innovation 
and 
technological 
development. 
As 
pointed 
out 
above, 
Chile’s 
investments 
in 
S&T 
increased 
during 
the 
nineties, 
and the 
present 
Government 
has 
stated 
as 
its 
target 
to double 
the 
country’s 
S&T 
investments 
from 
0.5% 
of 
GDP 
to 
1.2% 
by 
the 
year 
2006. 
This 
strong 
backing 
was 
one 
of 
the 
crucial 
factors 
behind 
the 
highly 
satisfactory implementation 
status 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative 
and 
the 
MECE-SUP 
projects.  Further, 
the 
commitment 
is 
equally 
underscored 
by 
the 
government 
of 
Chile’s 
invitation to 
the 
Bank 
to 
assist 
in 
designing 
and 
implementing 
this proposed 
follow-on 
project 
of 
the 
MSI. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
World 
Bank 
has 
had 
a 
long 
and 
positive 
cooperation 
with 
Chile 
in 
various 
sectors. 
One 
of 
the 
core 
intervention 
areas 
has 
been, 
and 
still 
is, 
human 
capital 
and 
education. 
Hence, 
the proposed 
project 
lies 
in 
continuation 
of 
previous Bank 
operations 
in 
Chile 
and 
capitalizes, 
as 
pointed 
out 
above, 
on 
the 
many 
lessons 
which 
the 
bank 
has 
accrued over 
time. 
In 
consequence 
of 
this 
long 
and 
fruitful 
engagement 
in 
Chile, 
the 
Bank 
has 
established 
a valuable 
network 
and 
has 
made 
contacts 
with 
most stakeholders 
in 
the 
Chilean education 
and 
science 
and 
technology 
sectors. 
This 
in 
turn 
gives 
the 
bank a unique 
opportunity 
to 
be 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
developments 
in 
Chile 
and 
correctly 
address 
the 
needs 
for 
assistance 
within 
these 
sectors. 
At 
a more 
general 
level, 
the 
Bank benefits 
from 
its 
extensive experience 
in 
supporting 
human 
capital 
development 
and 
S&T 
in 
various 
countries. 
Thus, 
the 
Bank 
is 
able 
to 
draw 
on 
a 
vast 
reservoir 
of 
experience 
and 
consequently 
put 
the 
most 
effective 
solutions 
in 
place. 
As 
a 
case 
of 
best 
practice, 
components 
developed 
for 
this 
project 
are expected 
to 
inspire 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
to 
take 
similar 
steps 
to 
embrace 
the 
knowledge economy. 
Involvement 
of 
the 
Bank 
will 
facilitate 
the 
dissemination 
of 
lessons 
learned 
in 
Chile. 
In 
particular,  the 
Bank 
will 
be 
able 
to 
advise 
countries 
currently 
involved 
in 
science 
and 
technology projects 
in 
the 
region (Mexico, 
Colombia, 
Brazil 
and 
Venezuela) and elsewhere 
in 
regard 
to 
coherence 
of 
S&T 
policies, 
monitoring 
and 
stimulation 
of 
private 
sector 
innovation. 
E. 
Summary 
Project 
Analysis 
(Detailed 
assessments 
are

the 
project 
file,

(see 
Annex 
4) 
First, 
the 
economic 
annex 
argues 
based 
on  economic 
history, 
growth-accounting 
exercises 
and 
case-studies 
that 
the 
ability 
of 
a society  to 
understand, 
produce, 
adapt, 
diffuse, 
and 
commercialize 
scientific 
and 
technological knowledge 
is 
critical for 
continuous 
productivity 
improvements, 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
and 
improved 
quality 
of 
life. 
Second, 
the analysis 
discusses 
market failures, 
such 
as 
the 
high 
uncertainty 
of 
outcomes, 
information 
symmetries, 
appropriability 
problems, 
economies 
of 
scale, 
need 
for 
knowledge 
diffusion 
and 
existence 
of 
non-sellable knowledge, 
which 
rationalizes 
the 
large 
sums 
that developed countries invest 
in 
Science, 
Technology 
and 
Innovation-in 
many 
cases 
up 
to 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP-to 
benefit  optimally 
from 
knowledge transfer and creation. 
- 
19- 
Page  24
Third, 
it 
is 
shown 
that 
R&D 
investments 
attract substantial social 
return 
that range 
from 
20 
percent 
to 
100 percent decreasing 
with 
level 
of 
development and 
increasing 
with 
the reliance 
of 
natural 
resources 
in 
the economy. 
For 
a country 
with 
the 
income 
per 
capita 
of 
Chile, 
the return 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
higher 
than 
50 
percent. 
Fourth, 
the 
annex presents 
empirical 
economic 
analysis on the 
determinants 
of 
the 
production 
of 
national 
innovation 
systems. 
These 
investigations 
find 
that 
a country’s 
science 
base 
plays a 
crucial 
role for 
innovation 
through 
three 
factors: 
(i) 
Overall 
R&D 
investments; 
(ii) 
Quality 
of 
basic 
science, 
and 
(iii) 
Advanced human capital.  Private-public 
collaboration 
is 
found 
to 
influence, 
but 
not 
always statistically 
significantly,  commercial knowledge 
creation. 
Further, 
educational attainment, specific factors related 
to 
Latin 
America 
and ICT-penetration 
are 
found not 
to directly 
impact innovative activity. 
The 
proposed 
program 
is 
fully 
aligned 
with 
these 
findings. 
The 
analysis 
benefited tremendously 
from 
economic 
research 
by 
Maloney 
and 
Lederman (forthcoming) 
on 
the 
national innovation 
systems 
in 
Latin 
America 
and the Caribbean. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
The project 
is 
expected 
to 
invest 
US$ 
50 
million 
in 
Science, 
Technology 
and 
Innovation 
over 
a 3% 
year 
period. 
This 
will 
raise 
total 
Science, 
Technology and 
Innovation 
spending 
from 
the 
current 
level 
of 
US$ 
450 
million 
in 
2001 
(0.5 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
to 
approximately 
US$ 
500 
million 
per 
year. 
Per 
capita 
spending 
will 
rise 
from 
US$ 
29.0 
in 
2001 to 
US$ 
33.3, 
which 
compares 
to 
US$ 
41.7, 
36.1 
and 917 
in 
Brazil, Argentina 
and 
USA, 
respectively. 
Given, 
the 
above 
reported 
estimates 
of 
returns 
to 
investments 
in 
science and 
technology 
of 
approximately 
50 
percent, 
it 
is 
found 
that 
the 
project 
has 
a 
small 
and 
manageable short 
term 
negative fiscal 
impact, 
and 
potentially 
a 
large long-term 
positive 
impact 
on 
the 
country’s 
gross 
national 
product, 
tax 
base 
and 
government 
revenue. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
technical content 
of 
the 
project 
has 
been 
extensively 
reviewed 
in 
several 
Bank 
studies 
of 
Chile’s 
national 
innovation 
system. 
In 
order 
to 
effectively 
address 
technical 
issues 
in 
each 
component, 
state 
of 
the 
art  instruments 
have 
been 
identified 
on  the 
basis 
of 
international 
best 
practice. 
Some 
of 
the 
instruments, 
which 
have been 
given 
special attention, 
are: 
Competitive 
funds. 
An 
open, 
competitive

Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
CONICYT, 
the 
National 
Commission 
for 
Science 
and 
Technology, 
which 
is 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
has 
been chosen 
by 
the 
Government 
as 
the 
implementing 
agency. 
CONICYT 
has 
a 
well-structured 
and 
efficient 
organization 
and 
has 
long 
experience 
in 
implementing 
programs 
in 
the 
science 
and 
technology 
field. 
The complete organigram 
of 
CONICYT 
is 
in 
the 
project 
file. 
Given 
the 
objective 
of 
redirecting 
science 
towards 
areas 
of 
economic importance, 
CONICYT 
will 
be guided 
by 
an 
Independent 
Advisory 
Board 
established 
to 
have 
oversight 
of 
the 
project 
(see 
C.4). 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
The administration 
and management 
of 
the 
project 
is 
conducted 
by 
CONICYT. 
The implementing 
agency 
is 
responsible 
for 
collecting 
all 
relevant 
information 
from 
universities 
and 
other awarded 
research 
entities 
and 
submitting 
consolidated reports 
to 
the 
World 
Bank. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
A 
procurement capacity 
assessment was 
carried out 
of 
the 
proposed organization 
and 
staffing 
of 
the 
CONICYT 
as 
well 
as 
the project  implementation 
arrangements; 
both 
were deemed 
satisfactory. The 
implementing 
agency 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
carrying 
out 
and/or 
exercising 
quality 
control 
over 
all 
procurement 
activities 
and 
for 
technical coordination, planning, 
monitoring 
and evaluation. The 
Project 
Operational 
Manual 
will 
include 
procurement 
procedures. 
No 
special  procurement  problems 
are 
anticipated 
while 
implementing 
the 
project. 
CONICYT 
will 
receive technical 
assistance 
from 
the 
Bank 
on 
procurement 
procedures. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
implementing 
agency, 
CONICYT, 
has 
extensive 
prior 
experience 
implementing 
S&T 
projects, 
including 
development 
projects 
(IADB 
financing)  together 
with 
a cadre 
of 
high level 
professional 
staff 
warrant 
satisfactory 
arrangements 
for 
the 
financial 
management 
concerns 
of 
this 
new project. 
CONICYT’s 
present 
organization structure 
responds 
to 
the 
multiple 
activities 
it 
carries out 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
science 
and 
technology. 
CONICYT 
has 
not 
had 
direct 
experience 
with 
Bank 
financed  projects. 
Nevertheless, 
during project 
preparation 
and 
at 
appraisal, 
staff 
assigned 
to 
the 
financial 
management 
area 
of 
the 
new 
project 
quickly 
grasped 
the 
essentials 
on 
the 
subject, 
thus 
anticipating 
an 
effective 
and 
efficient 
operation 
in 
this 
regard 
during 
project 
implementation. 
The 
additional workload 
stemming 
from 
the 
new operation may 
cause 
delays 
in 
the administrative 
and 
financial 
processes. 
As 
a 
part 
of 
CONICYT’s 
continuous 
efforts 
to 
rationalize 
the 
organizational 
structure 
and 
in 
agreement 
reached 
with 
the 
Bank 
during 
negotiations, the 
management 
of 
CONICYT 
is 
reviewing 
the 
function 
of 
the 
Finance  and 
Administration 
Department 
with 
a 
view  to 
increasing 
efficiency, 
assuring 
adequate 
staffing 
and 
improving 
the 
integration 
of 
the  Department 
into 
the 
organization. 
These 
efforts 
will 
be 
closely monitored 
by 
the 
Bank 
team. 
During 
the 
FM 
Assessment, 
agreement 
was 
reached 
on the 
format 
for 
the 
FMRs, 
which 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
on  a 
quarterly 
basis. 
FMRs 
will 
be  prepared 
for 
information 
purposes 
only, 
not 
for 
disbursements, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
project 
implementation.

As 
it 
is 
customary 
in 
Chile, 
the 
government 
will 
prefinance 
project 
expenditures 
and 
request 
reimbursement 
for 
the 
Bank's 
share 
of 
financing. 
Requests 
for 
reimbursement 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
of 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
specifically 
designed Statement 
of 
Expenditure 
(SOE)/modified 
FMR 
for 
the 
Grants component, 
format 
and 
content 
of 
which 
have 
been agreed 
upon 
during 
negotiations, 
and attached 
to 
the 
Minutes. 
The 
Loan 
Agreement 
provides 
for 
the 
Special  Account 
(SA) 
facility, 
should  the 
government 
require 
one 
during 
the 
execution 
of 
the 
project. 
CONICYT 
will 
inform 
the 
Bank 
if 
such 
need 
arises 
during 
project 
implementation, 
and 
the 
Bank 
will 
notify 
its 
consent. 
Independent audits 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
the 
Chilean 
Supreme 
Audit 
Institution 
(Controlaria General 
de 
la 
Rep6blica) 
under terms 
of 
reference acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank.

Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and disclosure) and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis.

acts. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
Support 
will 
only 
be 
provided 
to 
programs 
that 
are 
environmentally 
sound 
with 
respect 
to 
their 
societal 
purpose  and  operation.

and have 
been 
found 
to 
be 
in

with 
international 
best 
practice. 
Environmental 
safeguard 
measures 
will 
be 
reviewed 
during 
implementation 
to 
ensure 
effectiveness. 
Accordingly, 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
a neutral

6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, and specify the project's social 
development 
outcomes. 
The 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
reinforce 
and consolidate 
the 
social 
learning 
stemming 
from 
the 
MSI 
project 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
fair 
and 
open 
competition 
for 
resources, 
merit-based 
awards 
and 
transparent 
administration. 
The 
MSI 
project 
has 
created 
a general intolerance 
for 
the 
traditional, 
less 
efficient 
means 
of 
awarding 
and 
administering 
grants. 
This, 
in 
turn, 
has 
lead 
to 
the 
adoption  of 
competitive 
principles 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
Chilean scientific 
community. 
Focusing on 
cross-sectoral 
linkages 
is 
expected 
to 
have far-reaching 
ramifications 
for 
the 
value 
attributed 
to 
public-private 
cooperation 
among 
researchers. 
Highlighting 
the value 
and necessity 
of 
cooperation 
is 
likely 
to 
foster a 
culture 
of 
collaboration 
and a 
greater 
acceptance 
among 
researchers 
of 
the 
need 
to 
engage 
in 
outreach 
activities. 
Hence, 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
bolster 
the 
emergence 
of 
an 
open 
public

research 
environment, 
which 
places 
higher 
priority 
on 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
private 
sector. 
Supporting  improvements 
in 
basic 
science 
education 
and 
outreach activities 
is 
anticipated 
to 
raise 
awareness 
of 
S&T 
and 
its 
importance 
for 
economic 
growth 
among the 
general 
population 
and members 
of 
Chile's 
business 
community. 
The 
likely 
effect 
include a 
greater 
receptivity 
to 
new knowledge 
and 
technology,  a  higher  focus  on 
issues 
pertaining 
to 
innovation 
and 
increases 
in 
science 
program 
enrollment 
rates at 
the 
secondary and 
tertiary level. 
The 
task 
team 
has 
evaluated barriers 
to 
the 
Chilean 
higher 
education 
system and hence 
to 
entry 
into 
the 
S&T 
sector 
as 
researcher, 
and 
found 
no 
legal or 
institutional 
discrimination 
in 
access. 
Furthermore 
Chile 
has 
established 
a targetted scholarship program 
for 
indigenous people 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
access 
its 
higher education 
system 
for 
disadvantaged groups 
(see 
annex 
13). 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The 
main 
stakeholders 
of 
the Chilean 
S&T 
sector 
are 
involved 
and consulted 
at 
all 
stages 
of 
the 
project. 
First, 
the 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative 
has 
been 
thoroughly 
evaluated, 
involving 
feedback 
from 
the 
government, 
the 
private 
sector, 
grants 
recipients and 
the 
scientific community 
at 
large. 
Second, 
many site 
visits 
to 
funded 
research centers 
has 
been 
conducted, 
which 
has 
provided 
important inputs 
to 
the 
project 
design 
from 
Chilean 
scientists. 
Third, 
a 
seminar 
is 
scheduled 
for 
2003, 
where 
major 
stakeholders 
(scientists, 
rectors, 
and 
private 
sector 
representatives) 
will 
participate. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
seminar 
is 
to 
forge a 
sector 
wide 
consensus, 
which 
will 
subsequently 
allow 
CONICYT 
to 
establish a 
coherent sector 
strategy 
with 
broad 
support 
in 
the 
science 
and 
innovation  community.  Finally, 
along 
with 
project 
implementation,  annual 
science 
surveys 
will 
be 
conducted, 
which 
will 
provide 
valuable  evaluative 
feedback 
from 
key 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
S&T 
sector. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
See 
6.2 
6.4 
What 
institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes? 
To 
ensure 
competitive 
allocation 
of 
resources, 
robust 
administrative 
structures have 
been 
established 
in 
CONICYT 
in 
accordance 
with 
practices  consolidated 
by 
the 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative 
and 
MECESUP. 
A 
scientific 
community 
prioritizing 
cross-sectoral 
collaboration 
will 
be supported 
by 
the 
establishment 
of 
Cooperative 
Research 
Consortia. 
Bringing 
together 
researchers 
from 
universities,  government 
laboratories 
and 
private industry 
or public-sector 
agencies, 
in 
collaborative 
arrangements 
is 
expected 
to 
provide 
a 
solid 
framework 
for 
development and education 
activities 
that 
achieve outcomes 
of 
national 
economic 
and 
social significance. 
The 
formation 
of 
skills 
and 
awareness 
of 
sciences 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
a program aimed 
at 
updating 
the 
professional 
level 
and 
pedagogical 
methods 
of 
science 
teachers 
in 
basic education. 
Moreover, 
funded 
research 
institutions 
will 
be required 
to 
engage 
in 
outreach 
activities 
targeting 
the 
Chilean 
population 
at 
large 
and 
private 
businesses 
in 
particular. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social development 
outcomes? 
- 
23 
- 
Page  28
A 
wide 
range 
of 
instruments 
will 
be 
used 
to 
monitor 
performance. 
First, 
a 
number 
of 
quantitative 
performance indicators 
will 
be 
used 
to 
assess 
impact. 
Second, 
an 
annual 
science  survey 
will 
be 
conducted, 
aiming 
at 
evaluating 
the 
function, administration 
and 
financing 
of 
the 
project. 
Finally, 
a 
panel 
of 
independent 
expert 
scientists 
will 
carry out annual 
qualitative 
evaluations 
of 
research 
institutions 
and 
the 
project 
in 
general 
(see 
annex 
1 
and

Sustainability: 
Sustainability 
is 
closely 
linked to 
(i) 
government 
ownership,  and 
(ii) 
project 
success. 
As 
indicated 
above, 
the 
government 
of 
Chile 
has 
a strong ownership 
of 
the 
project,  and 
with 
regards 
to 
project 
success, 
a 
careful

Chile’s 
policy 
framework 
and 
environment 
for 
innovation. 
Consolidating 
and 
modernizing existing 
instruments 
and 
programs 
in 
science 
and technology 
will 
create 
the 
conditions 
for 
achieving 
high 
levels 
of 
internal 
and external 
efficiency 
among 
researchers 
and 
a 
collaborative 
research 
culture 
among Chilean scientists. 
This 
first 
component consists 
of 
three 
distinct 
sub-components: 
(a) 
project 
oversight, 
management 
and 
implementation; 
(b) 
development 
of 
a

and 
(c) 
development 
of

capacity. 
The 
component 
will 
finance 
technical 
assistance 
and 
capacity-building 
measures 
including 
operating 
costs 
of 
committees 
and 
associated 
secretariats 
as 
well 
as 
goods 
and

necessary 
to 
help related 
groups 
achieve 
the 
set 
objectives. 
Sub-component

- 
Oversight, Management 
and 
Implementation 
This 
sub-component 
will 
support 
capital 
and 
operating 
expenses 
for 
project 
oversight, 
management 
and 
implementation. 
An 
independent 
Advisory  Board 
at 
the  government 
level 
will 
be 
established 
by 
Presidential 
decree. 
It 
will 
be 
chaired 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Education 
and 
include 
three other 
ministers 
(Economy, 
Agriculture 
and 
Mining), 
three 
high 
level 
representatives 
from 
the 
private 
sector, 
and three 
high 
representatives 
from 
the 
scientific 
community. 
The Advisory Board 
will 
(i) 
have oversight functions 
for 
the 
entire operation; 
(ii) 
advise 
on 
public-private 
interfaces 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
out  the 
innovative

will 
be 
established 
within 
CONICYT 
to 
oversee 
the 
daily 
implementation 
of 
the  project. 
The 
sub-component 
will

the relevant 
stakeholders 
to 
develop 
an 
overall vision 
and  strategy 
for 
Chile’s 
path 
toward 
a  more  knowledge-based  economy. 
This 
would 
include 
the 
formulation 
of 
a 
coherent 
policy 
framework 
for 
expanding human capital, expanding 
research 
capacity 
in 
science and 
technology, 
and 
fostering

policy 
modifications. 
Policy 
instruments 
and 
activities 
will 
include 
not 
only 
supply but 
also demand 
mechanisms 
aimed 
at 
enhancing 
innovation 
and 
knowledge absorption 
in 
all 
sectors. 
Areas 
of 
focus 
may 
include Intellectual 
Property Rights 
(with 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
patenting), 
tax 
incentives, 
risk 
capital, 
seed 
funding, 
firm 
creation, 
commercialization 
of 
products and 
processes, 
business 
registration 
and 
licensing,  technology 
transfer, 
spin 
offs,  technology forecasting 
as 
well 
as 
analyses 
and suggestions 
regarding 
national 
science and 
technology 
policy 
and 
budget; 
and 
(iii) 
improve 
the 
general basis 
for 
technological penetration 
by 
enhancing 
S&T 
awareness 
throughout 
the 
Chilean society 
and 
in 
particular 
within 
the 
business 
sector. 
In 
addition,  this 
sub-component 
will 
support 
Chile’s 
participation 
in 
the 
OECD 
Committee 
for 
Science, 
Technology 
and 
Industry 
to 
improve 
the 
country’s 
exposure 
other 
innovation 
regimes  and 
enhance 
access 
to 
international 
best 
practice 
in 
the 
area 
of 
ST&I. 
This 
sub-component 
will 
finance 
the 
cost 
of 
commissioned  studies, 
consultants,  workshops, 
travel 
and 
disseminating 
activities. 
Sub-component 
3 
- 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Capacity 
This 
sub-component 
will 
develop a 
framework 
for 
collection 
of 
data 
necessary 
to 
trace 
the 
effect 
of 
strategy 
implementation. 
The 
OECD 
“Frascati and 
Oslo 
manuals” together 
with 
an 
established 
set 
of 
qualitative 
and 
quantitative indicators 
will 
serve 
as 
a major 
point 
of 
reference 
(see 
Annex 
11). 
Data 
and 
analysis 
provided 
through 
this 
M&E 
initiative 
will 
be 
shared 
among government 
agencies 
and 
key 
stakeholders 
to 
facilitate 
an 
informed 
policy 
discussion 
and 
inform 
decision 
makers 
as 
well 
as 
the general 
public. 
This 
sub-component 
will 
finance 
the 
cost 
of 
upgrading 
Chile’s 
M&E 
system, 
consultants, 
necessary 
software 
and 
hardware.

Annex 
2(B): 
Monitoring and Evaluation Framework 
CHILE: 
Science 
for 
the Knowledge Economy 
This 
annex  establishes 
a 
framework 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluating 
the  Science 
for 
the 
Knowledge 
Economy project 
in 
Chile 
with 
a 
view to improving 
implementation 
and 
impact. The objective 
is 
to 
(i) 
measure 
the 
outcome; 
(ii) 
assess 
the 
need 
for 
corrective 
action; 
and 
(iii) 
collect 
lessons learned. 
Measuring 
the 
impact 
of 
project 
components 
on Chile’s 
national innovation 
system 
and 
stock 
of 
human 
capital 
is 
a  complex 
matter. 
No 
measure 
alone  captures 
all 
aspects. 
Consequently, 
a  number 
of 
quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
performance indicators 
will 
be 
used 
in 
combination 
to 
monitor 
and evaluate 
implementation and impact. 
In 
line with 
the 
evaluation practice 
installed 
by 
the 
MSI-project, qualitative 
evaluations 
of 
Institutions 
of 
Excellence 
and 
the 
project 
in 
general 
will 
be carried out 
by 
a panel 
of 
independent expert scientists. 
Experts 
will 
conduct site-visits on 
an 
annual 
basis 
and subsequently 
submit a 
written 
evaluation report. 
To 
get 
a 
full 
impact 
assessment 
by 
key 
stakeholders, 
annual 
surveys 
of 
Chilean 
firms 
and researchers 
will 
be 
conducted. 
The 
survey 
of 
researchers 
will 
aim 
at 
evaluating the function, 
regulation 
and 
financing 
of 
science 
in 
Chile.  Likewise, 
the 
survey 
of 
firms 
will 
measure 
the 
perceived 
relevance 
of 
conducted 
research and 
obstacles 
to 
increased 
co-operation 
with 
science 
institutions.  Preferably, 
the 
firm 
survey 
will 
be attached 
to 
an 
existing 
survey 
of 
Chilean 
firms. 
For both 
surveys, 
the 
application 
of 
recognized 
sampling 
techniques 
will 
ensure 
collection 
of 
a representative 
sample, 
which 
in 
turn 
will 
allow 
general 
conclusions 
to 
be drawn. 
A 
number 
of 
quantitative performance indicators 
will 
equally 
be 
utilized 
to 
assess 
impact. Rather than 
focusing 
on 
inputs, indicators 
are 
developed 
to 
measure 
outputs 
and 
societal effects 
that 
stem 
from 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project and 
its 
components. Emphasis 
is 
given 
to 
create 
clear, 
balanced, 
relevant 
and 
measurable 
indicators 
for 
each 
component 
in 
the 
project 
with 
a 
view 
to 
(i) 
aligning 
goal achievement 
and 
incentives; 
(ii) 
ensuring 
accountability; 
and 
(iii) 
improving 
the 
basis 
for 
management 
decisions 
and 
policy 
making. 
This 
annex 
provides a 
gross 
list 
of 
possible indicators, 
which 
may 
form 
the 
backbone 
of 
the 
indicator 
selection 
process. 
The 
final 
M&E 
framework 
including 
baselines 
and targets 
for 
indicators 
will 
be 
established 
in 
the 
Operational 
Manual 
prior 
to 
effectiveness. 
Data collection 
may 
rely 
on 
information 
collected 
and 
consolidated 
by 
the 
project coordination 
team 
as 
well 
as 
reliable 
secondary 
sources. 
Illustration 
2B-1 
provides 
an 
overview 
of 
how 
outcomes and 
objectives 
are 
believed 
to 
be 
linked 
(the 
use 
of 
strategy 
maps 
is 
inspired 
by 
Kaplan, 
2001). 
Each 
arrow 
represents 
an 
alleged 
causal 
relationship. 
For 
reasons 
of 
simplicity, 
the 
illustration 
predominantly depicts 
direct 
relationships and 
hence 
does 
not 
give 
full 
justice 
to  how 
outcomes  are 
interrelated 
and 
mutual 
supportive. 
Particularly, 
the 
impact 
of 
component 
3 
is 
expected 
to 
rest 
on 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
component 
1 
and 
2.

Annex 
2(C): 
Environmental Guidelines 
for Laboratory Research 
CHILE: 
Science 
for the Knowledge 
Economy 
This 
annex 
discusses 
the 
environmental 
aspects 
of 
the 
project 
with 
a view 
to 
ensuring 
adherence 
to 
sound 
environment guidelines 
for 
laboratory 
research. 
Under 
component 
2 
and 
3, 
the 
project 
would 
support 
a number 
of 
competitive 
funds 
for 
research. 
Research 
grants 
will 
be  awarded 
to 
Institutions 
of 
Excellence, 
Research 
Teams 
and  Cooperative 
Research 
Consortia. 
In 
addition, 
private 
sector 
R&D 
will 
be 
supported 
through 
the 
insertion 
of 
young 
researchers 
into 
industry. 
Part 
of 
the 
research 
could involve 
laboratory activities, 
in 
which 
potentially 
environmental 
hazardous 
materials 
are 
applied. 
For 
this 
reason 
the 
project 
may 
involve 
a 
marginal 
environmental 
risk. 
Against this 
background, the 
project 
team 
has 
requested 
environmental guidelines 
from CONICYT, 
the 
National 
Commission 
for 
Science 
and Technology. 
As 
part 
of 
project 
implementation, 
CONICYT 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
ensuring compliance 
with 
environmental guidelines 
for 
laboratory 
research. 
In 
regard 
to 
support 
of 
R&D 
activities, 
CONICYT 
are 
constraining 
researchers 
and 
institutions 
to 
comply 
with 
national  and 
international 
regulations 
in 
every 
aspect. 
CONICYT 
and 
the 
funded 
research 
institutions 
operate 
under 
the 
law 
and guidelines 
issued 
from 
Comisidn 
Nacional 
del 
Medio 
Ambiente, 
CONAMA, 
which 
regulates, 
monitors 
and evaluates 
the 
disposal 
of 
material 
potentially 
damaging 
for 
the 
environment. 
In 
particular, 
CONICYT 
is 
adhering 
to 
Decreto 
351 
and 
Decreto 
609 
that  regulate 
neutralization 
and 
purification 
of 
chemical residuals. Support 
will 
only 
be 
provided 
to 
programs that 
are 
environmentally 
sound 
with 
respect 
to 
their 
societal 
purpose 
and 
operation. Consequently, the 
project 
will 
not 
support 
activities 
that 
could 
harm 
the environment. 
Research 
projects 
will 
be 
carried 
out  under  reinforcement 
of 
Chilean 
rules 
for 
bio-safety  and 
environmental 
protection 
acts. 
National 
guidelines 
for 
laboratory 
safety, 
disposal 
of 
reagents 
and other 
hazardous 
material, bio-ethics 
and 
bio-safety 
have 
been 
reviewed 
by 
the 
project 
team and 
have been 
found 
to 
be 
accordance 
with 
international 
best 
practice. 
The 
relevant 
Chilean regulation 
is 
available 
in 
the project 
file. 
CONICYT 
will 
continually monitor 
and, 
if 
necessary, 
enforce the compliance 
of 
environmental 
grantees. 
Moreover 
the 
project 
team 
will, 
as 
a natural 
part 
of 
supervision, 
follow-up 
as 
regards 
adherence 
to 
national 
environmental guidelines 
for 
laboratory 
research. 
Although, 
the 
financed 
research 
may 
involve 
the 
use 
of 
environmental 
hazardous 
material, 
the 
area 
of 
research 
includes 
improved 
environmental 
management. 
Experience 
from 
the 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative 
shows 
that 
support 
of 
research  centers 
and 
science 
nuclei 
within 
bio-diversity 
and 
bio-technology 
improved 
the 
Chilean knowledge 
base 
and 
involved training 
of 
advanced 
students 
in 
areas 
of 
high 
relevance 
for 
better  understanding 
of 
the 
environment. 
This 
is 
economically 
and 
environmentally important 
knowledge 
for 
Chile 
given 
its 
reliance 
on 
natural 
resource-based 
production. 
The 
experience 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
scaled 
up 
with 
this 
follow-on 
program, 
which 
could 
improve knowledge 
formation 
within 
forestry, 
mining, 
marine-biology 
and 
bio-diversity. 
This 
would 
create 
knowledge 
and 
awareness 
regarding environmental 
management, 
and 
as 
such 
promote 
environmental 
sound 
production. 
The 
aspects 
are 
therefore 
expected 
to 
improve 
the 
basis 
for 
sustainable development 
in 
Chile.

Economic Analysis 
CHILE: 
Science 
for 
the 
Knowledge Economy 
This 
annex 
succinctly 
summarizes 
existing 
economic 
evidence 
of 
the importance 
of 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation 
(S, 
T 
and 
I) 
for 
development 
of 
economies 
based 
on 
the 
exploitation 
of 
natural 
resources 
like 
that 
of 
Chile. 
Subsequently, 
it 
critically 
reviews 
the 
rational 
for 
public 
investment 
in 
S, 
T 
and 
I. 
This 
leads 
to 
considerations 
of 
the 
rate 
of 
return 
on 
investments 
in 
technological development 
including 
the 
retum 
on investments 
under 
this 
program. 
Further, 
the 
analysis provides 
the 
underlying 
economic 
reasoning 
for 
this 
program’s 
set 
of 
chosen 
investment instruments 
in 
order 
for 
the 
program’s 
limited 
resources 
to 
most 
appropriately stimulate output 
of 
the 
Chilean 
national innovation 
system 
and 
economic 
growth. 
This 
annex 
collects 
economic 
evidence 
from 
various 
sources. 
In 
particular, 
the 
analysis 
benefitted 
tremendously 
from 
economic 
research 
by 
Maloney 
and 
Lederman on 
the 
national innovation 
svstems 
in 
Latin 
America and 
the 
Caribbean. 
This 
work 
is 
forthcoming 
in 
a 
serie 
of

Further, 
the 
annex 
relies on 
research 
by 
Dahlman 
et 
al. 
(forthcoming), 
OECD 
and  the 
project 
team’s 
own 
investigation 
of 
the 
Chilean  innovation 
system: 
Agapitova 
and 
Holm-Nielsen 
(2002), 
Hansen;

Vukmirovic, 
and

(2002), 
and 
Hansen 
and 
Holm-Nielsen 
(2002). 
1. 
The 
ability 
of 
a 
society 
to 
understand, produce, 
adapt, 
diffuse, 
and 
commercialize 
scientific 
and 
technological  knowledge 
is 
critical 
for 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
and 
improved  quality 
of 
life. 
Countries 
that adopted 
science 
and technology-led 
industrialization 
early-and 
where other 
conditions 
such 
as 
market 
incentives 
and 
strong 
institutions 
were  present-now 
have 
economies that 
are 
deeply 
permeated 
by 
science, 
technology, and innovation. 
These are 
also the countries that 
have 
grown 
steadily 
and 
become 
increasingly wealthy. 
This 
is 
the 
underlying 
reason 
for 
Chile 
to 
reinforce 
its 
science 
and 
technology 
sector. 
The 
increased exposure 
to 
fierce global 
competition, 
rapid 
technological 
progress and 
Chile’s continued 
heavy 
dependence 
on 
natural 
resources, 
amplify 
the 
gains 
of 
strengthening the 
Chilean 
national innovation 
system. 
Value 
of 
Science, 
Technology 
and 
Innovation 
for 
Economic 
Growth 
It 
is 
by 
now 
a well-established 
fact 
that a broad 
definition 
of 
technological 
progress 
accounts 
for 
a large 
part 
of 
economic 
growth. 
For 
example, 
Easterly 
and 
Levine 
(2000) 
using 
the 
growth 
regression 
methodology, 
estimate 
that 
up 
to 
80 
percent 
of 
cross-country 
variation 
in 
economic 
growth 
can be 
attributed to technological 
progress. 
The 
findings 
from 
such 
macro-growth 
accounting 
exercises  are 
corroborated 
by 
larger 
historical 
assessments 
based 
on diverse 
methods. 
For 
the 
Latin 
American 
and Caribbean 
region, 
the 
World 
Bank 
report 
“From 
Natural 
Resources 
to 
the Knowledge 
Economy” 
finds 
that 
knowledge 
and 
technology 
is 
a 
critical 
determinant 
for 
growth 
in 
the region, especially 
because 
of 
the countries’ 
dependence 
on 
natural 
resources. 
It 
stresses 
that 
productivity 
growth 
in 
agriculture 
has 
outpaced that 
of 
manufacturing 
in 
both 
developed 
and 
developing countries. 
Productivity 
growth 
in 
agriculture 
in 
Latin 
America 
has 
increased 
significantly 
after 
trade 
reform. 
In 
short, 
natural 
resource-based 
activities 
can 
lead 
to high productivity 
growth,  technical spillovers,  and 
forward 
and 
backward linkages, 
as 
much 
as 
modem manufacturing. 
Such 
activities 
can  become 
knowledge 
industries.  They 
are 
in 
no 
way 
incompatible 
with 
the  new 
knowledge 
economy. 
The 
key 
to 
success 
is 
to 
complement 
natural 
resource 
wealth 
with 
good institutions, 
human 
capital, 
and 
knowledge. 
Developing 
dynamic 
natural 
resource-based 
sectors 
is 
not incompatible, 
either, 
with building 
new comparative 
advantages 
in 
footloose and 
high-tech 
manufacturing. 
The 
report 
- 
48 
- 
Page  53
underscores 
that 
rich 
endowments 
of 
natural 
resources, 
combined 
with 
the  aggressive 
pursuit 
and 
adoption 
of 
new 
technologies, 
is 
a proven 
growth 
recipe. 
Further, 
the 
evidence 
strongly indicates that 
technological development 
does 
not 
preclude the development 
of 
manufacturing 
or 
other 
activities 
in 
the 
“knowledge” 
economy. 
In 
a nutshell, countries that 
have 
“played 
to 
their 
strengths” 
have done 
well. 
Equally, 
what 
is 
important 
is 
not 
so 
much 
what 
is 
produced, 
but 
how 
it 
is 
produced. 
Taking 
advantage 
of 
global 
technological 
progress 
is 
essential 
in 
every 
field, 
and 
it 
cannot be 
done 
cheaply. 
The 
recurrent 
lesson 
of 
the 
successful 
natural 
resource developers, and 
of 
contemporary 
theory, 
is 
the 
necessity 
of 
engendering 
a 
high 
level 
of 
human 
capital  and 
developing 
a  capacity 
for 
“national” 
learning 
and 
innovation, 
de 
Ferranti, 
Perry, 
Lederman 
and 
Maloney. 
(2002).

I 
is 
warranted 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
several 
major market failures 
in 
the 
market 
for 
knowledge: 
Rational 
for 
Public Investment 
in 
Science, 
Technology 
and 
Innovation 
Uncertainty 
of 
outcome. 
Research 
is 
by 
definition 
an 
investigation 
into 
the 
unknown,  and 
the 
outcome 
is 
highly 
uncertain, especially 
with 
a 
view 
to 
commercialization 
of 
research. 
For-profit 
agents 
are 
therefore 
likely 
to 
refrain 
from 
fundamental 
research, 
except 
in 
markets where 
knowledge 
intensity 
of 
products borders the knowledge 
frontier, 
which 
is 
only 
the 
case 
in 
segments 
of 
the 
pharmaceutical, 
telecommunication 
and 
computing 
industries. 
Information 
asymmetries. 
The very 
long 
run 
and 
risky 
nature 
of 
R&D 
further 
compounds standard 
problems 
of 
information 
asymmetries. 
A 
firm 
may 
have a hard 
time 
knowing 
if 
a 
researcher 
conducting 
basic 
research 
is 
incompetent, 
or 
whether 
the 
problem 
is 
simply 
extremely 
difficult. 
Appropriability problems 
impede 
innovation 
and 
diffusion. 
Given 
the 
difficulty 
of 
excluding 
others 
from 
ideas, 
innovators 
will 
not appropriate the 
full 
social benefits 
of 
their work. 
This 
has 
given 
rise 
to 
intellectual 
property 
right 
protections, 
such 
as 
patenting 
that 
creates 
a market 
for 
new 
ideas. 
However, 
the 
social 
value 
of 
the 
innovation 
is 
itself 
a 
function 
of 
the 
degree 
and 
speed 
of 
diffusion 
which, 
in 
some 
dimensions 
is 
impeded 
by 
the 
IPR 
system- 
the 
cost 
of 
using 
the 
innovation 
is 
higher 
than 
the 
marginal 
cost 
of 
its 
diffusion. 
Lumpiness 
and 
scale economies 
dictate specialization. 
R&D 
and 
innovation 
are 
characterized 
by 
economies 
of 
scale 
and lumpiness. 
To 
be 
effective, 
resources 
need 
to 
be 
concentrated 
in 
a 
manner 
beyond the capacity 
of 
the 
individual 
firm. 
This, 
combined 
with 
the 
fact that 
even 
patents 
are 
not 
effective 
at 
resolving 
the 
non-appropriability  problem 
in 
“pure 
science” 
provides a 
rationale 
for 
institutions 
dedicated 
to 
R&D 
and 
innovation 
efforts, 
such 
as 
research centers 
and universities. 
This 
also 
speaks 
for 
the 
need 
for 
a 
national 
innovation 
strategy 
grouping 
a (small) nation’s 
competences 
around core 
competitive 
areas 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
critical 
mass 
and 
competitiveness. 
Innovation 
and 
knowledge developed 
by 
those 
institutions tend 
to 
be nonexclusive 
and 
are made 
available 
to 
all 
and 
any 
interested parties, guided 
by 
an 
appropriate 
allocation 
of 
property 
rights. 
The 
issues 
there 
are 
then 
how 
those 
institutions 
are 
developed and 
how 
are 
they financed. 
Even 
more relevant, 
because 
the 
knowledge 
is 
produced 
by 
non-end-users 
and 
hence 
used 
by 
others, 
incentives 
for 
knowledge 
diffusion 
in 
funding 
become 
crucial 
for 
the 
system’s 
performance. 
Innovation, 
diffusion, 
and application 
require 
collaboration among 
many 
institutions and 
firms. 
Although innovation 
is 
sometimes the 
product 
of 
one 
firm 
alone, 
the 
more common pattern 
is 
one 
of 
joint 
efforts, among 
various 
firms, 
or 
among 
firms 
and R&D-related 
institutions. 
Further, 
progress 
does 
not proceed 
linearly 
from 
pure 
science 
to 
applied 
technologies, 
but 
moves 
in 
both 
directions 
(Nelson 
and Rosenberg 
1993); 
and 
feedback 
from 
frontline 
users 
of 
technology 
to 
researchers 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
refinement 
of 
products and 
production 
processes 
(Rosenberg 
2001). 
In 
many 
industrial 
countries, 
these 
issues 
have 
given rise 
to 
national  institutions 
devoted 
to 
fomenting  or

Social 
returns 
Taking 
into 
account 
the 
impact 
of 
one 
firm’s 
R&D 
on the 
entire 
economy 
through 
knowledge spillovers 
improving 
other 
companies’ 
products 
and 
production 
techniques 
through 
copying, adapting 
and 
learning, 
the 
return 
to 
R&D 
rises 
several 
fold. 
Available 
estimates 
suggest 
a 
social 
return 
around 
70 
percent 
to 
100 
percent. 
These 
estimates 
point 
to 
a massive 
under-investment 
in 
R&D 
up 
till 
five 
to 
ten 
times 
the 
5.0 
-

-

existing 
level. 
These 
estimates 
should 
be taken 
with 
a grain 
of 
salt 
given 
the 
difficulties 
mapping and 
quantifying 
knowledge spillovers. 
Nevertheless, 
even 
an 
over-estimation 
in 
the magnitude 
of 
two 
implies 
that 
investments 
in 
science 
and 
technology carry returns substantially 
above 
the 
price 
of 
the 
resources 
provided 
through 
this 
loan. 
Further, 
the 
findings testify 
to 
the 
important 
impact 
of 
market 
failure 
on 
the 
market 
for 
knowledge, 
which 
if 
left 
without 
public 
regulation, 
intervention 
and 
financing 
would 
produce 
around 
one 
fourth to 
one 
fifth 
of 
the socially 
optimal 
knowledge 
for 
the 
economy.

Three findings 
are 
key 
for 
this 
project: 
0 
Social 
Returns 
to 
R&D 
exceed 
by 
far 
the 
retum to 
investments 
in 
physical 
capital 
by 
a factor 
6 
to 
10 
depending 
upon 
the 
initial 
level 
of 
income per 
capita. 
Returns 
to 
RbD 
increase 
with 
the 
intensity 
of 
natural 
resources 
in 
the 
economy. 
Chile, 
and 
other 
countries 
heavily 
relying 
on 
its 
natural 
resources, 
enjoys 
higher 
returns  on 
R&D 
than  a  more 
manufacturing-based 
economies. 
Formation 
of 
advanced human 
capital 
as 
measured 
by 
tertiary 
education 
is 
a 
prime 
drive 
of 
technical 
progress, 
and 
appears 
to 
be more 
important 
than 
basic 
education. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
quality 
basic 
education 
is 
a 
precondition 
for 
tertiary 
education and 
for 
equitable growth. 
Figure 
1 
plots 
the estimated 
returns 
to 
R&D, 
physical 
capital and 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
two 
returns. 
Returns 
to 
R&D 
consistently 
exceeds 
gains 
from 
physical 
capital, 
at 
early 
stage 
of 
development 
by 
60 
percent 
point, 
declining 
to 
10 
percentage 
point 
for 
high-income countries. 
Noteworthy, 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
two 
returns 
remain 
fairly 
constant 
around 
2.5. 
For 
Chile, 
the 
calculations 
suggest 
a social 
return 
to 
R&D 
above 
50 
percent.

The 
above 
returns 
on 
R&D 
in 
Chile 
of 
50 
percent 
is 
obviously 
suggestive 
and indicates 
an 
average 
return 
to 
the 
average 
investment 
in 
R&D 
in 
a country at 
Chile's 
level 
of 
development. 
The 
actual 
return 
to 
the 
resources 
invested 
by 
this 
project 
evidently 
and 
crucially 
depends 
on context specific 
circumstances 
such 
as 
institutional 
arrangements, 
incentive 
structure and choice 
of 
intervention. 
This 
section 
briefly 
presents 
empirical 
results 
pointing to 
the 
critical 
importance 
of 
(i) 
increasing 
Chile's 
science 
base 
and 
(ii) 
its 
linkages 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
order 
for 
the 
country 
to 
accelerated knowledge 
production 
and reap the 
above discussed 
golden benefits 
associated 
with 
R&D 
expenditures. 
Economic 
Rational 
for 
Choice 
of 
Interventions: 
Performance 
of 
national innovation 
systems 
(NIS) 
is 
most frequently 
measured 
by 
number 
of 
patents 
filed 
internationally.  Although, 
this 
indicator 
is 
the 
best 
available, 
it 
remain imperfect, 
since 
it 
merely 
captures 
innovations 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
global 
stock 
of 
commercial 
knowledge  and  neither 
reflects 
adaptations 
and 
transfer 
of 
knowledge 
from 
the 
global 
pool 
to 
the 
country 
nor 
transfers among 
the 
system's  elements. 
Alternatively, 
experts 
measure 
internationally 
published 
scientific 
articles 
as 
an 
indicator 
of 
scientific 
production. 
Lederman 
and 
Maloney  (forthcoming)

The 
findings 
shed 
light 
on 
the importance 
of 
a 
solid 
science 
base 
with 
a 
critical 
mass 
of 
S&T 
personal 
and 
adequate 
funding 
for 
an 
effective 
national 
innovation 
system: 
Impact 
of 
the 
Science base: 
Amount 
of 
R&D 
expenditure 
matters 
greatly 
for 
commercial knowledge 
production. 
This 
is 
a rather 
evident 
result 
and 
corroborates 
findings 
by 
Stem, 
Porter 
and 
Furman 
(2000), 
Quality 
of 
basic 
research 
is 
essential 
for 
patenting. 
Without 
world-class 
research 
firms 
and 
entrepreneurial 
scientists are 
incapable 
of 
bringing 
new 
science 
based 
products 
to 
the 
global 
market 
place. 
Similarly,  empirical 
evidence-see 
figure 
2-suggests 
that 
quality 
of 
science 
equally 
is 
a 
precondition 
for 
interaction 
with 
the  private. 
Once 
again, 
it 
is 
believed 
that 
below 
world 
class 
scientific 
and 
technological  solutions 
are 
uninteresting 
for 
companies 
competing 
on 
the 
world 
market. 
Advanced 
Human 
Capital 
stimulates 
innovation. 
The 
regression 
clearly 
suggest 
that 
higher 
enrolment 
into 
tertiary 
education 
leads 
to 
larger

the

system. 
Impact 
of 
Private-Public 
Collaboration: 
Collaboration 
between 
private 
and 
public 
sector 
seems 
to 
influence 
innovative productivity. 
Despite, 
the 
collaboration  variable 
turns 
statistically 
insignificant 
when 
equally 
controlling 
for 
quality 
of 
science 
and 
ICT-penetration, 
it 
is 
firmly 
believed 
that 
lack 
of 
collaboration 
plays a key 
role 
for 
Chile's 
failure 
to 
capitalize 
adequately 
from 
its 
S&T 
investments. 
Although, 
the 
lack 
of 
collaboration 
partially 
stems 
from low 
private 
demand 
due 
to 
inadequate 
quality 
of 
science 
- 
as 
discussed 
above 
- 
private 
sector 
representatives argue 
that 
lack 
of 
collaboration  equally 
derives 
from 
a 
culture 
of 
isolation 
within 
the 
scientific 
community, 
lack 
of 
incentives 
for 
outreach 
to 
the 
private 
sector and 
inadequate 
private 
sector 
R&D 
capacity.

Impact 
of 
context variables: 
e 
Educational  attainment,  other 
regional factors, 
and 
ICT-penetration  are 
not 
directly  linked 
to 
innovative 
activity. 
Whilst 
being 
a 
precondition 
to 
tertiary education, 
secondary 
education 
seems 
not 
to 
increase 
patenting.  The 
Latin 
American 
shortfall 
in 
innovation 
is 
explained 
for 
by 
the above 
three 
factors accounting 
for 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
science 
base. 
Similarly, 
ICT 
penetration 
seems 
unrelated 
to 
patenting 
activity. 
However, 
as 
cautioned 
above, 
the 
regressions 
only 
express one 
role 
of 
the 
national 
innovation 
system, 
the 
propensity 
to 
produce new 
world 
commercial innovation. 
It 
does 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the 
innovation 
system's 
role 
in 
augmenting 
existing 
process techniques 
and 
catching 
up, 
where 
ICT, 
collaboration, 
and general 
educational attainment 
are 
expected 
to 
play 
an 
economically 
significant role. 
Overall, 
these 
results 
point to 
the 
key 
importance 
of 
a 
sufficiently 
educated, 
well-connected and 
financed 
science 
base 
for 
innovation 
to 
take 
place. 
This 
link 
is 
equally 
confirmed 
when 
looking 
at 
the 
correlation 
between 
scientific 
output-measured 
by 
internationally published 
articles-and 
innovation, 
gauged 
by 
number 
of 
patents,

The 
graph 
in 
Figure

shows that  the 
relationship 
between 
these 
two 
proxies 
of 
innovation 
outcomes have 
a strongly non-linear 
relationship 
with 
the 
level 
of 
development. 
The 
number 
of 
scientific 
publications, 
which 
is 
best 
interpreted 
as 
a 
proxy 
of 
the 
output 
of 
basic research 
(i.e., 
not 
necessarily 
applied 
research) tends 
to 
decline 
initially with 
development, 
but 
rises 
quickly 
after 
a certain 
point. 
The 
close 
relationship 
suggests 
that 
scientific 
development 
goes 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
development 
of 
the 
innovation 
system. 
Chile 
is 
situated 
right 
around 
the 
“take-off’ 
point 
where 
both 
curves rises steeply.

for 
these 
works 
are foreseen. 
Contracts 
for 
works 
(all 
estimated 
to 
cost 
less 
than 
US 
$ 
5.0 
million 
equivalent per contract), 
will 
be 
procured 
using 
National 
Competitive

It 
includes expenditures 
for 
cost 
of 
tuition, 
event 
venues, 
food, and 
traveling 
for 
the 
beneficiary 
research 
institutions, 
and 
for

in 
OECD 
workshops 
and committees. 
Training 
services 
are 
estimated 
to 
cost 
US$730,000

Sub-projects 
will 
be 
financed through competitive 
grants 
under 
component 
2 
and 
3 
of 
the 
project. 
Procurement 
would 
be 
carried out 
by 
the 
grantee’s 
research 
institutions. Beneficiaries 
will 
sign 
agreements 
with 
CONICYT 
for 
grants estimated 
to 
total 
up 
to 
US 
$25.0 
million 
equivalent 
per 
year. 
Institutions 
will 
decide 
investments 
to 
make 
in 
minor 
infrastructure, 
equipment, 
information 
resources and 
/ 
or  staff 
development 
and 
outreach 
activities 
and 
develop proposals 
in 
accordance 
with 
their 
strategic 
plans. 
Any 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
works 
and 
contracting 
of 
consultants 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
institutions 
according 
to 
the 
Bank’s 
Procurement 
Guidelines. 
The 
procedures 
will 
follow 
the 
procedures 
outlined 
in 
the 
OM, 
with 
the 
same 
threshold. 
Operational 
Costs: 
Sundry 
items, 
office 
utilities 
and 
support 
staff 
would 
be financed on a 
declining 
basis 
and 
procured 
using 
the 
CONICYT 
administrative  procedures 
which 
were 
reviewed and 
found 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
Bank 
will 
finance 
70% 
of 
expenditures 
made 
until 
twelve 
months after the 
Effective 
Date 
and 
not 
exceeding 
in 
the 
aggregate 
$800,000; 
and 
30% 
thereafter. 
2. 
Procurement 
Planning. 
CONICYT 
will

plans 
detailing 
the 
goods, 
works,  consultants, 
operating 
expenses, 
the 
estimated 
cost,

method 
and 
time 
table. 
No 
procurement 
will 
be 
carried 
out unless 
the 
Annual 
Plan 
has 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
Bank. 
3. 
Prior review: 
The proposed thresholds 
for 
prior 
review 
are 
based 
on 
the 
procurement capacity

and 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table

CONICYT 
has 
experience 
with 
an 
IDB 
project, 
which 
supports 
similar activities 
to 
the 
proposed 
loan. 
The 
procurement 
unit 
within 
CONICYT 
is 
well 
organized and 
has 
qualified 
and 
competent 
staff 
in 
procurement 
in 
accordance 
to 
local 
procedures. 
Record  keeping,  contract  administration,  internal 
controls,  procurement 
monitoring 
and 
the 
general 
procurement  environment 
is 
also 
satisfactory. 
Procurement under the 
grants 
will 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
each 
beneficiary 
institution 
in 
accordance 
with 
the procedures established 
in 
the 
OM 
and 
under 
CONICYT 
supervision. 
Likewise, 
each 
beneficiary 
institution, 
will 
be 
required 
to 
keep 
records and 
report procurement 
progress. 
CONICYT 
will 
consolidate 
information 
from 
the 
beneficiary institutions and report 
it 
to 
the Bank. 
A 
capacity 
assessment 
of 
CONICYTs 
procurement 
unit 
was 
prepared 
based 
on 
the experience 
of 
the 
personnel 
with 
IDB 
projects 
and 
local 
procedures. 
This 
will 
be 
the 
first 
time 
for 
CONICYT 
to 
have 
experience 
with 
a  Bank  financed  project. 
The 
assessment 
includes  a 
review 
of 
the  procurement 
organizational 
structure 
of 
CONICYT 
and 
an 
Action 
Plan 
agreed 
upon 
during 
Negotiations. 
The 
Action 
Plan includes 
the 
following 
aimed 
at 
reinforcing 
the 
implementing 
capacity 
of 
CONICYT 
(i) 
hiring 
a 
procurement consultant knowledgeable 
of 
Bank 
procurement 
policies 
and procedures; 
(ii) 
drafting 
of 
standard 
biddings 
documents 
for 
NCB 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and works; 
(iii) 
developing a computer 
base 
methodology 
for 
preparation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
uniform 
annual  procurement  plans 
by 
beneficiary 
research 
institutions 
that 
can 
be 
easily consolidated 
by 
CONICYT; 
(iv)  developing 
a 
chapter 
within 
the 
OM 
for 
procurement 
under 
the 
grants consistent 
with 
the 
procurement 
provisions 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement; 
(v) 
training 
of 
at 
least 
two 
weeks 
for 
CONICYT 
procurement staff, 
and 
(vi) 
developing 
and 
implementing 
a project 
filing 
system 
and 
providing 
adequate 
space. 
In 
order 
to 
reinforce 
the 
action 
plan 
a 
project 
launch workshop 
will 
be 
organized 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
in 
Project Implementation 
to familiarize 
the 
implementing 
team 
and 
the 
other 
institutions 
involved 
in 
the 
execution 
of 
the projects. 
The 
workshop 
will 
cover procurement, 
disbursement, 
reporting 
and 
auditing 
requirements and 
will 
be 
follow-up 
by training. The General Procurement 
Notice 
will 
be 
published after 
Negotiations. 
The 
principal 
risks 
identified 
in 
the 
assessment 
are: 
(i) 
the 
use 
of 
staff 
inexperienced 
in 
Bank 
procurement procedures, and 
(ii) 
some 
existing 
practices 
observed 
in 
the 
Chilean Education 
projects that 
are 
not 
in 
conformity 
with 
Bank 
procedures. 
The 
OM 
will 
address 
shortcomings 
in 
existing 
practices 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
special procurement 
provisions 
listed 
below. 
A. 
The 
following 
principles 
of 
procurement 
shall 
expressly govern 
all 
procurement 
of 
works 
and 
goods 
under 
National 
Competitive 
Bidding: 
1. 
All 
documents 
pertaining 
to 
a 
bid 
shall 
be 
submitted 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
Bidders shall 
not 
be 
required 
to 
submit 
bid 
securities 
or 
other documents 
in 
advance and separately 
from 
their 
bids. 
2. 
Contracts 
shall 
be 
awarded 
to 
the 
bidder  who 
meets 
the  appropriate 
standards 
of 
capability 
and 
resources and whose 
bid

recommend 
one 
full 
supervision mission 
to 
visit 
the 
field 
to 
carry out 
post-review 
of 
procurement 
actions. Based 
on 
the 
overall 
risk 
assessment 
(AVERAGE) 
the post-review

the

Financial 
Management 
1. 
Summary 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
CONICYT’s 
long 
experience 
in 
implementing 
programs 
in 
the 
science and 
technology 
field, 
including 
development 
projects 
(IDB 
financing) 
together 
with 
a 
cadre 
of 
high 
level 
professional  staff  warrant 
satisfactory 
arrangements 
for 
the 
financial 
management 
concerns 
of 
this new project. 
CONICYT’s 
present 
organization structure 
responds 
to 
the 
multiple 
activities 
it 
carries out 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
science 
and 
technology. 
CONICYT 
has 
not 
had 
direct 
experience 
with 
Bank 
financed  projects. 
Nevertheless, 
during 
project preparation 
and 
at 
appraisal, 
staff 
assigned 
to 
the 
financial 
management 
area 
of 
the 
new 
project 
quickly 
grasped 
the 
essentials 
on the 
subject, 
thus 
anticipating 
an 
effective 
and 
efficient 
operation 
in 
this 
regard 
during 
project implementation. 
CONICYT 
needs 
to 
review 
its 
level 
of 
staffing 
to 
address 
the increased 
workload 
stemming 
from 
the 
new 
project  activities.  Discussion 
held 
with 
upper 
management 
indicate 
the 
entity 
will 
carry  out  a 
comprehensive 
review 
of 
their 
financial 
management 
functions 
and 
responsibilities 
to 
determine 
the 
real 
need 
of 
additional staff 
to 
handle 
the new 
operation’s 
administrative 
and 
financial 
activities. 
During 
the 
FM 
Assessment, 
agreement 
was 
reached 
on the 
format 
for 
the 
FMRs, 
which 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
on 
a  quarterly 
basis. 
FMRs 
will 
be 
prepared 
for 
information 
purposes 
only, 
not  for 
disbursements, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Adequacy 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management and Disbursement Arrangements 
The 
Financial 
Management 
Department 
of 
CONICYT 
(DAF) 
will 
have 
a 
leading role 
in 
all 
fiduciary 
responsibilities 
pertaining 
to 
the 
Project. 
DAF 
will 
be 
the 
sole 
link 
between 
the 
Government 
and 
Beneficiaries 
in 
connection 
with 
fund 
transfers. 
DAF 
will 
account 
for 
both 
funds 
received 
from 
the 
Government and 
funds transferred 
to 
Beneficiaries. 
A 
Project Coordination 
Team, 
composed 
by 
a 
Coordinator 
General 
and three 
Deputy 
Coordinators 
(one 
for 
each 
component) 
will 
perform 
the 
day-to-day 
tasks 
of 
implementing 
the 
Project. Consideration 
is 
also 
been 
given 
to 
the 
inclusion 
of 
a 
fourth  Deputy 
Coordinator,  responsible 
for 
the 
overall 
financial 
management 
concerns 
of 
the 
immediate project. 
This 
Group 
will 
also 
maintain 
the detailed accounting 
records 
from 
which 
the 
FMRs 
will 
be prepared 
quarterly. Balances 
of 
records 
maintained 
by 
the 
Project 
Coordination Team 
will 
be 
reconciled 
with 
those 
maintained 
by 
DAF 
on a 
monthly 
basis. 
The 
positions 
for 
these 
three/four 
Deputy 
Coordinators have 
been 
identified 
but 
as 
of 
the 
date 
of 
drafting 
of 
this 
report 
they had 
not 
been 
engaged. 
CONICYT 
maintains appropriate accounting 
systems, 
prepares 
timely 
financial 
statements 
and 
provides 
relevant 
financial  information 
to 
its 
higher 
management. 
A 
core 
of 
well 
trained  professionals 
in 
the 
administrative 
and 
financial 
area 
warrant satisfactory 
arrangements 
for 
the 
forthcoming Bank 
financed 
project. 
A 
chart 
of 
accounts 
discriminating 
expenditures 
by 
Component 
and 
major 
activities 
was 
prepared 
to 
record 
and 
serve 
as 
basis 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
project financial 
statements. 
Disbursements 
will 
be 
prepared 
by 
the Finance and 
Administration 
Department, 
following 
Bank policies 
and 
procedures. 
An 
experienced 
officer 
working 
at 
another 
Bank 
finance 
project 
at 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
will 
provide 
support and guidance 
on 
disbursement 
and 
procurement 
matters 
at 
the 
initial 
period 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Project financial 
management 
and disbursement 
and procurement 
arrangements 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
Operational Manual.

details on 
these 
topics

Questionnaire completed and

Results 
of 
the 
assessments 
of 
inherent 
risks 
and 
control 
risks 
suggest 
a comfortable 
level 
at 
CONICYT, 
primarily 
due 
to 
its 
long 
standing operational record 
and 
wide recognition 
as 
a 
competent, 
efficient 
and 
effective entity, 
leader 
in 
the 
promotion 
and 
dissemination 
of 
best 
practices 
in 
the context 
of 
Science 
and 
Technology. The 
financial 
management 
action 
plan 
presents 
the 
areas 
relating 
to 
the 
project financial 
management 
arrangements 
requiring 
further improvements 
to 
be 
in 
compliance 
with 
Bank 
standards. 
Significant 
risks 
The 
additional workload 
stemming 
from 
the new operation 
may 
cause 
delays 
in 
the 
administrative 
and 
financial 
processes. 
As 
a  part 
of 
CONICYT’s 
continuous 
efforts 
to 
rationalize 
the 
organizational 
structure 
and 
in 
agreement 
reached 
with 
the 
Bank 
during 
negotiations, the 
management 
of 
CONICYT 
is 
reviewing 
the 
function 
of 
the  Finance  and 
Administration 
Department 
with 
a 
view  to 
increasing 
efficiency, 
assuring 
adequate 
staffing 
and 
improving 
the 
integration 
of 
the  Department 
into 
the 
organization. 
These 
efforts 
will 
be 
closely 
monitored 
by 
the 
Bank 
team. 
Control 
environment 
and 
procedures 
The 
control 
environment: 
CONICYT 
is 
an 
Agency 
that 
operates 
under the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education. 
As 
such, 
it 
is 
required 
to 
observe 
the 
Chilean 
budget 
law 
and  related 
procedures and 
regulations. 
There 
is 
little 
if 
any 
room  for 
deviation 
from 
these 
standards. 
Central 
Government 
surveillance 
in 
this 
regard 
is 
efficient 
and 
effective.  The 
philosophy 
and operating  style 
of 
project 
management 
is 
appropriate 
for 
the 
type 
of 
activities carried 
out 
by 
this 
entity. 
A 
group 
of 
prominent 
personalities 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
science, 
academia and 
public 
service 
will 
constitute a Supervising Board, 
providing 
guidance 
on operational 
policies 
and 
major project  activities.  Project entity’s 
methods 
of 
assigning 
authority 
and 
responsibility 
have been 
proven 
during 
the 
long 
life 
of 
this 
organization (over 
30 
years). 
The 
control 
procedures: 
Management 
has 
established 
appropriate 
reporting 
standards 
although 
not 
uniformly 
applied 
in 
all 
of 
the 
entities activities. 
For 
the 
Bank 
financed 
project 
FMRs 
will 
be 
prepared 
quarterly. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Finance 
and 
Administration 
Department 
will 
prepare 
monthly 
financial 
reports 
to 
review 
project financial 
activity 
in 
preparation 
for 
the 
analytical 
work 
required 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
FMRs. There 
is 
appropriate 
segregation 
of 
duties 
among 
financial 
staff 
and 
access 
is 
limited 
to 
records 
and 
selected 
financial 
reports. 
Management 
is 
regularly 
provided 
with 
statements 
on 
the basis 
of 
which 
comparison 
and analysis 
of 
financial 
progress 
with 
budgeted 
amounts 
is 
carried 
out. 
Risk 
assessment 
Inherent 
risks 
at 
this 
new operation 
are 
minimal 
if 
not 
nil. 
Good 
Govemance 
prevails 
throughout 
the 
public 
sector 
in 
Chile. 
Although 
lately 
there  have 
been 
indications 
of 
irregular 
practices 
in 
certain 
agencies, 
the 
legal 
system 
has 
reacted 
energetically 
and 
appropriate actions 
are 
being 
taken. 
Funds 
flow 
procedures 
in 
the 
government 
are 
adequately 
established  and  appropriate  norms 
safeguard 
these 
operations. 
The 
salary 
structure 
of 
public 
servants, 
although 
significantly below 
those 
of 
private 
sector, 
still 
retains workers 
for 
long 
tenure 
in 
their 
positions. 
Technical 
management 
is 
normally 
independent 
from 
politics. 
The 
accounting profession 
observes 
international 
standards. 
Control 
risks: 
CONICYT 
is 
an 
organization 
with 
a 
proven 
efficient 
and 
effective 
operational 
record. 
During 
the 
over 
thirty 
years 
since 
initiating 
operations 
in 
the 
area 
of 
science 
and  technology, 
management 
has 
maintained 
high 
standards 
of 
transparence 
and execution 
of 
programs 
to 
convey 
the 
image 
necessary 
to 
function 
in 
this 
environment. 
The 
entity 
also 
operates 
programs financed 
by 
the 
Inter 
American Development 
Bank 
and other 
Donors. 
Hence, 
the requirements 
of 
international 
organizations 
are 
known 
to 
management 
through 
direct 
experience.

Primary 
strengths and 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
system 
- 
actions 
required 
The 
institutional 
strength 
of 
CONICYT 
provides 
assurances 
that 
adequate 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
will 
be 
established 
for 
the 
new  project. 
The 
entity 
has 
qualified 
staff,  appropriate 
accounting 
system 
observes 
generally 
accepted 
internal controls 
and 
has 
provided timely 
and 
pertinent 
information 
on administrative 
and 
financial 
concerns 
to 
its 
upper 
management. 
The 
issue 
indicated 
under 
Significant 
Risks regarding 
the 
pending 
definition 
on 
staffing 
arrangements 
constitutes 
the 
single 
most 
important 
concern, 
which 
may 
result 
in 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
overall financial 
management arrangements 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
submission 
of 
a Project Operational Manual, 
which 
will 
include 
a Section 
on 
Project 
Financial 
Management, acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank, 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
for 
the effectiveness 
of 
the 
Loan. 
2. 
Audit 
Arrangements 
Independent 
audits 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Chilean 
Supreme 
Audit 
Institution 
(Controlaria 
General 
de 
la 
Repdblica) 
under 
terms 
of 
reference 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
3. 
Disbursement 
Arrangements 
As 
it 
is 
customary 
in 
Chile, 
the 
government 
will 
prefinance 
project 
expenditures  and  request 
reimbursement 
for 
the 
Bank's 
share 
of 
financing. 
Requests 
for 
reimbursement 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
of 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
specifically 
designed Statement 
of 
Expenditure 
(SOE)/modified 
FMR 
for 
the 
Grants component, 
format 
and 
content 
of 
which 
have 
been 
agreed 
upon 
during 
negotiations, 
and attached 
to 
the 
Minutes. 
Based 
on 
SOEs, 
the Bank may require 
withdrawals 
from 
the 
Loan 
Account, 
all 
under 
such terms 
and 
conditions 
as 
the 
Bank 
shall  specify 
by 
notice 
to 
the 
Borrower 
(a) 
for 
goods 
under 
contracts 
not 
exceeding 
$350,000 
equivalent per contract; 
(b) 
for 
services 
of 
consulting 
firms 
under 
contracts not exceeding 
$1 
00,000 
equivalent 
per 
contract; 
(c) 
for 
services 
of 
individual 
consultants 
under 
contracts not exceeding 
$50,000 
equivalent 
per 
contract; 
(d)

: 
Science, Technology and Innovation in Chile 
CHILE: 
Science 
for 
the Knowledge Economy 
(This 
summary 
is 
based 
on 
Agapitova, 
Natalia 
& 
Lauritz 
Holm-Nielsen, 
2002. 
Science, Technology 
and 
Innovation 
in 
Chile. 
Washington, 
DC: 
World 
Bank) 
The 
most recent 
volume 
of 
the 
Latin 
American 
Competitiveness 
Report 
makes 
the 
following 
observation: 
“The main 
competitive 
weakness 
of 
the 
Chilean 
economy 
is 
the 
country’s lack 
of 
ability 
to 
innovate 
and 
adopt 
technological 
change” 
(Vial 
& 
Cornelius, 
2002: 
176). 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
value-added 
in 
manufacturing 
is 
almost 
eight 
times 
lower 
in 
Chile 
than 
in 
most 
developed countries 
and 
export 
of 
high-technology products 
represents 
only 
5% 
of 
total 
exports; 
a 
share 
which 
is 
significantly below 
the 
levels 
of 
other 
Latin 
American 
economies 
and 
most 
OECD 
countries. 
In 
consequence, 
the development 
path 
followed 
in 
Chile 
has 
diverged substantially 
from 
that 
of 
more 
developed 
countries: 
The 
share 
of 
agricultural production 
has 
increased 
steadily; 
whereas 
manufacturing 
and services 
have 
been 
in 
decline. 
This 
paper 
takes 
the 
position 
that  a 
weak 
capacity 
for 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
reasons 
why 
Chile 
lags 
the 
more developed countries 
in 
terms 
of 
productivity 
and 
technological 
development. 
Hence, 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
current 
paper 
is 
to 
benchmarks 
Chile’s  capacity 
for 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation 
and, 
subsequently, 
offer 
a 
number 
of 
explanations why 
Chile 
has 
been 
relatively 
unsuccessful 
in 
developing 
its 
capacity 
for 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation. 
Seven 
areas 
are 
examined: 
(i) 
Political 
organization; 
(ii) 
expenditure 
level 
and 
composition; 
(iii) 
public 
policies; 
(v) 
intellectual 
property protection; 
(vi) 
foreign 
investments; 
and, 
finally 
(vii) 
access 
to 
venture capital. 
Benchmarking 
Chile: 
Science, 
Technology 
and 
Innovation 
Scientific 
Publications 
and 
Research 
Personnel 
The 
number 
of 
scientific  publications 
increased 
steadily 
in 
1990-1998, 
particularly 
in 
specialized 
scientific 
databases 
like 
biological 
sciences, 
which 
in 
tum 
reflects 
the 
existence 
of 
knowledge intensive 
fruit 
and 
wine  industries 
in 
Chile.  However,  Chile’s 
scientific 
contribution 
is 
still 
limited: 
In 
1998 
Chilean 
researchers 
were 
mentioned 
only 
in 
0.19% 
of 
SCI-Search 
citations 
(Science 
Citation Index 
Database) and 
0.17% 
of 
citations 
in 
the French 
scientific 
database 
PASCAL. 
In 
the 
same 
year, 
Brazil’s 
contribution 
to 
the 
same 
databases 
amounted 
to 
1.06% 
and 
1.04% 
respectively, 
while 
Mexico 
and 
Argentina 
were 
cited 
in 
around 
0.42% 
of 
publications 
in 
both 
databases. 
Still, 
Chile’s 
performance 
looks 
better 
in 
relative 
terms 
(publications 
for 
every 
100,000 
people), 
where 
the 
country 
is 
at 
the 
top 
of 
Latin 
America 
with 
12.4 
publications 
in 
SCI-Search, 
and 
the 
third 
best 
performer 
in 
Latin 
America 
for 
PASCAL 
with 
3.8 
citations 
in 
1998. 
Technology: 
Patents 
and 
Technological 
Transfer 
Patent-based 
statistics 
are 
the 
most 
widely 
used 
indicator 
for 
the 
output 
of 
innovation activity 
because 
of 
their 
importance 
for 
the 
commercialization 
of 
new products. Based 
on 
an 
examination 
of 
trends 
in 
solicited 
patents 
in 
Chile 
in 
1974-2000, 
the 
most 
obvious 
conclusion 
is 
that the 
innovative 
capacity 
of 
Chile 
seems 
to 
be 
less 
developed, 
and, 
especially, 
less 
dynamic than 
the 
scientific 
one. 
First 
of 
all, 
no 
progress 
has 
been made 
until 
the recent 
past 
when 
Chile 
opened 
its 
market 
to 
FDI: 
The 
number 
of 
solicited 
patents 
stagnated at 
around 250 per 
year 
for 
residents 
and 
500 
for 
non-residents. Since 
1991, 
the 
number 
of 
solicited 
patents 
has 
been 
rapidly 
growing, 
but 
only 
as 
a result 
of 
applications registered 
by 
non-residents. 
Therefore, 
the 
auto 
sufficiency 
rate 
of 
Chile 
is 
decreasing, 
emphasizing 
its 
growing 
dependence 
on 
foreign 
technology transfers. 
Another 
key 
characteristic 
is 
the 
ratio 
of 
granted 
to 
solicited 
patents, 
which 
is 
very 
low 
in 
Chile: 
Since 
1991, 
17% 
of 
non-resident 
solicited 
patents were 
granted 
and 
only 
9% 
for 
residents. 
As 
a 
result, 
Chile 
is 
(iv) 
cooperation 
and 
knowledge 
diffusion; 
-78- 
Page  83
a 
regional 
outsider 
in 
terms 
of 
absolute number 
of 
patents: 
Less than 
3,600 
patents were 
granted 
in 
Chile 
in 
1992-2000, compared 
to, 
approximately, 
15,000 
in 
Argentina, 
20,000 
in 
Brazil, 
and 
32,000 
in 
Mexico 
(RICYT, 
2000). 
Determinants 
for 
Chile’s 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation 
capacity 
Organization 
The organization 
of 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation policies 
in 
Chile 
seems 
to offer 
part 
of 
the 
explanation why 
Chile 
has 
not 
yet 
developed 
its 
capacity 
further: 
No 
single 
high-level 
policy 
body 
exists 
to 
examine 
and 
formulate 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation policies 
in 
Chile. 
Instead, 
a 
patchwork 
of 
policies 
and 
institutions 
deal 
with 
science, 
technology  and innovation,  notably 
CONICYT 
and 
the 
Presidential 
Advisory 
Commission 
on 
Scientific 
Matters. 
CONICYT’s 
(Comisidn 
Nacional 
de 
Investigacidn 
CientljCica 
y 
Tecnoldgica, 
Chilean 
National Council 
for 
Science 
and 
Technology)  main 
role 
is 
to 
advise 
on the 
planning 
of 
scientific 
and 
technological 
development. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
council 
is 
not 
structurally 
organized to 
provide 
advice 
seeing 
that most 
of 
its 
resources go 
into 
the 
day-to 
day 
administration 
of 
financial 
instruments. The Presidential 
Advisory 
Commission on 
Scientific Matters 
also 
has 
advisory responsibilities, 
with 
some 
limited 
functions 
in 
the 
science 
field 
(excluding 
engineering 
and 
technology). 
It 
has 
few 
resources 
for 
a 
secretariat 
function, 
which 
in 
turn 
limits 
its 
capacity to commission 
policy 
studies 
to 
underpin 
its 
discussions. 
Expenditure 
for 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation 
R&D 
expenditures 
have 
increased 
steadily 
in 
Chile 
throughout the last 
30 
years 
to 
a 
level 
of 
US$ 
450 
millions 
in 
2001, 
which 
in 
turn 
is 
40 
times more 
than 
in 
1975. 
On 
average, 
Chilean 
R&D 
expenditures 
have increased 
by 
17% 
each 
year 
in 
1975-2000. 
Likewise, 
Chilean expenditure per resident grew 
by 
approximately 
15% 
per 
year 
in 
1975-2000, 
which 
has 
implied 
an 
increase 
in 
expenditure 
per 
capita 
from 
US$ 
1.12 
in 
1975 
to 
US$29 
in 
2000. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
surge 
in 
R&D 
spending, 
Chile 
is 
still 
far 
from 
the 
level 
of 
benchmarking 
economies. 
Whereas 
Chile 
spent 
0.55% 
of 
its 
annual 
GDP 
in 
the 
period 
1985-2000, 
USA 
spent 
2.74%. 
The 
public 
sector 
accounts 
for 
the 
bulk 
of 
public 
expenditure. 
In 
1990-1999 
the 
Chilean 
government 
invested 
US$ 
2,265 
millions 
on 
R&D, 
which 
amounts 
to 
two 
thirds 
of 
total 
R&D 
expenditures 
in 
the 
period. Another US$ 
274 
millions 
were 
allocated 
to 
R&D 
purposes 
in 
higher 
education, 
which 
in 
turn 
brings 
total 
public 
expenditure 
to 
almost 
75% 
of 
national 
R&D 
spending 
(RICYT, 
2000). 
By 
contrast, 
private 
sector 
investments 
in 
R&D 
have been 
negligible, especially 
until 
1990. 
After 
1990, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
policy 
stability 
and 
improvements 
to 
the 
property 
rights 
regime 
have 
stimulated 
private 
R&D 
expenditure, 
which 
grew 
by 
four 
times 
over the 
1990s. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
still 
represents 
little 
more 
than 
one-fifth 
of 
Chilean 
R&D 
investments, 
which 
is 
lower 
than 
most 
other 
Latin 
American 
countries  and 
significantly  behind 
the 
developed 
OECD 
countries. 
In 
USA, 
for 
example,  business 
expenditures 
now 
represent 
68.5% 
of 
national 
R&D 
spending 
(RICYT, 
2001). 
The Chilean 
public 
authorities 
have become 
aware 
of 
the importance 
of 
private 
investment 
in 
R&D 
activities, 
and 
several 
funds 
such 
as 
FONDEF 
and 
FONTEC, 
now 
require 
a 
financial 
contribution 
from 
the 
private 
sector 
as 
a 
primary 
condition 
for 
project 
approval. Moreover, 
evidence 
indicates that 
some 
elements 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
have 
realized  that 
research 
has 
a 
major 
potential 
for 
the 
long-term 
sustainability 
of 
their 
business. 
In 
addition 
to 
domestic 
sources, 
foreign 
investors 
contribute 
a 
significant 
amount 
(US$ 
238 
millions 
in 
1990-1999) 
to 
national 
R&D 
spending. 
This 
is 
the 
highest 
number 
in 
Latin 
America 
and 
is 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
favorable investment environment 
created 
by 
the 
Chilean 
government. 
A 
breakdown 
of 
public 
R&D 
investment 
by 
type 
of 
research 
shows 
that 
basic research 
is 
clearly 
the 
government’s 
priority, receiving 
56.5% 
of 
total 
allocations 
in 
the 
period 
1979-2000. 
Allocations 
to 
the 
- 
79 
- 
Page  84
applied 
science 
have also increased 
in 
importance 
and 
rose 
from 
24.6% 
to 
31.6% 
in 
2000 (1992 
US$). 
Experimental 
development, 
which 
contributes 
to 
commercialization 
of 
scientific 
discoveries, received 
by 
contrast 
only 
13.1% 
of 
investments 
on 
average 
in 
the 
period 
1979-2000. 
This 
trend constitutes a 
major 
obstacle 
to 
the 
development 
of 
Chile's  innovative 
capacities 
and 
deviates 
clearly 
from 
the 
world's 
leading 
economies: 
While 
Chile 
and 
USA 
allocate 
similar 
shares 
of 
expenditure 
to 
applied 
research 
(30.5% 
in 
Chile 
vs. 
22.7% 
in 
USA 
on 
average 
in 
1990-1999), 
USA 
clearly  privileges 
experimental 
development (60.9% 
vs. 
13.4% 
in 
Chile 
on 
average 
in 
1990-1999) 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
basic 
research 
(16.4% 
in 
USA 
vs. 
56.4% 
in 
Chile 
in 
the 
same 
period). 
Policies 
Chilean 
policies 
have 
typically 
neither protected 
nor privileged 
any 
specific 
sector. 
As 
a result, 
the 
Chilean 
government 
has 
primarily 
focused on crosscutting 
science 
policies 
and 
less 
so 
on technology 
policies, 
leaving 
the 
need 
for 
innovation 
unattended. 
More 
recently, 
the 
Chilean 
government 
has 
become 
more 
aware 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
technological 
progress 
for 
the 
future 
development 
of 
the 
country 
and 
its 
competitiveness 
in 
the 
world 
market. 
This 
has 
resulted 
in 
a variety 
of 
programs, such 
as 
the Technology 
Innovation 
Program, 
the Production 
Promotion 
Program 
(SERCOTEC), 
and, 
finally, 
the 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative 
Project. 
The 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative 
Project 
(MSI) 
was 
launched 
in 
1999 
by 
the 
Chilean 
Ministry 
of 
Planning 
and 
the 
World 
Bank 
to 
revitalize 
the Chilean 
S&T 
system 
by 
supporting 
training 
of 
advanced 
human 
capital 
by 
world-class 
scientists 
engaged 
in 
cutting 
edge 
research. 
Based 
on 
the 
2002 
completion 
report, 
the 
project 
has 
succeeded 
in 
diverting 
the Government's attention 
to 
S&T 
issues; 
improving 
the 
productivity 
of 
the 
country's 
best 
researchers; 
and, 
finally, 
increasing 
the 
opportunities 
for 
advanced 
training 
and 
scientific 
collaboration. 
Whereas 
the 
Government 
operates 
a  number 
of 
policy 
programs 
in 
direct 
support 
of 
S&T, 
little 
experience exists 
with 
respect 
to 
indirect 
incentives. 
Still, 
a 
vast 
reservoir 
of 
international 
experience 
suggests 
that 
such 
policies 
have 
a major 
potential 
for 
stimulating 
S&T 
investments 
in 
the 
private 
sector. 
In 
consequence, 
the 
Government 
may 
want 
to 
experiment along 
these 
lines. 
A 
first 
step 
might 
be 
to 
refine 
the 
scheme 
for 
rewarding 
donations 
to 
universities 
by 
providing 
some 
form 
of 
tax 
benefit 
for 
donations 
aimed 
at 
supporting 
R&D. 
Currently, 
the 
only 
government 
incentive 
for 
funding 
research, 
apart 
from 
partnership 
in 
various 
funds, 
is 
the 
50 
percent 
tax 
deduction 
permitted 
for 
donations 
to 
universities. The 
response 
to 
this 
somewhat 
unfocused 
measure 
has 
been 
strong, 
with 
donations 
rising 
by 
a factor 
of 
20 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
1990s 
to 
a current 
figure 
of 
around 
US$ 
30 
million. 
Cooperation 
and 
knowledge 
diffusion 
It 
has 
become 
widely 
recognized 
in 
recent 
years 
that 
innovation 
processes 
are 
characterized 
by 
a 
considerable 
degree 
of 
interaction 
between 
different 
actors 
involved 
in 
scientific, 
technological 
and 
productive 
activities, 
i.e. 
networking. 
Science related 
policies 
developed 
by 
the 
Chilean 
government 
have 
strengthened the 
country's capacity 
for 
research 
and 
instilled 
a 
culture 
of 
open 
dissemination 
of 
research 
through  publications.  However, 
academic 
interests and  a  narrow 
disciplinary 
approach 
to 
research 
continue 
to 
separate 
discovery 
from 
exploitation 
and 
utilization 
(Mullin 
and 
al., 
2000). 
Moreover, 
coordination 
between 
different 
research 
performers 
such 
as 
the 
technological 
institutes and universities 
is 
insufficient. 
In 
other 
Latin 
American 
countries, 
by 
contrast, serious attempts are 
now 
being 
made 
to 
coordinate  technology-development 
activities 
within 
broadly  defined  "production 
chains" 
(cadenas 
productivas). 
The 
Acuerdos 
Sectoriales 
de 
Competitividad 
in 
Colombia, and 
the 
Agendas 
Industriales, 
Sociales 
y 
Regionales 
of 
CONICYT 
in 
Venezuela 
are 
two 
examples. 
In 
Chile,  cooperation between 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
research 
organizations 
is 
also 
limited. 
Some 
universities 
have 
set 
up 
offices 
to 
assist researchers 
in 
their 
dealings 
with 
clients. 
As 
a result, 
31.8 
% 
of 
firms 
acknowledged 
having 
benefited 
from 
innovations 
from 
universities 
and 
16.2 
% 
from 
public 
research 
institutes. 
Some 
25 
% 
of 
firms 
actually 
signed 
contracts 
with 
universities, and 
14 
% 
signed 
them 
- 
80 
- 
Page  85
with 
public 
research 
institutes. Furthermore, 
60 
% 
of 
firms 
reported 
having 
carried out 
some 
type 
of 
joint 
innovation 
with 
client 
firms. 
However, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
point 
out that external interactions 
were 
not 
assigned 
a 
crucial 
role by 
the 
firms 
themselves. 
Most 
firms 
reported 
that the 
principal 
source 
of 
new 
ideas 
was 
their 
own 
personnel (Melo, 
2001). 
One 
of 
the 
key 
obstacles 
to 
public-private 
cooperation 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
inward 
orientation 
of 
university 
researchers. 
Although 
there 
are 
some 
links 
between 
business 
and 
universities, 
particularly 
at 
the 
human-resources 
level 
(there 
is 
a 
tradition 
of 
part-time professorships 
being 
held by 
businessmen), 
the 
university 
mentality 
is 
generally 
not 
geared 
to 
solving 
problems 
within 
a 
business 
timescale. 
Lack 
of 
knowledge-diffusion 
mechanisms 
is 
another 
reason 
why 
Chile 
has 
been 
unsuccessful 
in 
developing a strong network. Even though 
the government 
has 
emphasized the strategic 
importance 
of 
knowledge, 
little 
has 
been 
done 
to 
diffuse 
it. 
IPR-protection 
Technology 
development 
in 
the 
industrial 
sector 
requires a 
patent 
rights 
system 
developed to 
motivate 
investment 
and 
provide 
access 
to 
the 
vast 
reservoir 
of 
knowledge 
globally 
available. 
Chile 
currently 
features 
a 
full 
legal framework 
with 
legal 
bodies 
to 
protect 
R&D 
investments 
(Lorenzini, 
1997). 
The regime 
has 
been amended 
several 
times 
in 
recent 
years. 
First, 
a new 
industrial 
property law, 
enacted 
in 
1991, 
has 
fixed 
a 
basic and 
common proceeding 
for 
the granting 
of 
patents, 
trademarks, 
utility 
models 
and 
industrial 
designs 
in 
order 
to 
streamline bureaucratic barriers. 
The 
same 
law 
created 
a special 
Court 
of 
Appeal 
for 
industrial 
property 
matters, 
which 
reviews,  revokes 
or  confirms 
any 
decision 
by 
the 
administrative authority. 
The 
next 
step 
forward 
was 
the 
copyright 
amendment 
law 
of 
1992, 
which 
inter 
alia 
provides 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a new 
private 
management system 
for collecting 
copyright 
fees 
from 
authors. 
Finally, 
in 
1999 
the 
GoC introduced 
a new 
IPR 
legislation draft 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
bringing 
Chile's 
intellectual 
property regime 
into 
agreement 
with 
the 
World 
Trade Organization 
(WTO) 
Agreement 
on 
Trade-Related Aspects 
of 
Intellectual 
Property Rights 
(TRIPS). 
Nevertheless, 
this 
legislation 
has 
still 
not 
been 
enacted and 
is 
reportedly 
not 
TFWS-consistent, 
even 
in 
its 
draft 
form 
(Inter-Agency Committee on 
Intellectual 
Property 
Rights, 
2001). 
Among 
other 
issues, 
the 
draft 
law 
does 
not 
provide 
adequate 
protection 
for 
confidential 
test  data. 
Inadequate 
enforcement 
against 
piracy 
and 
counterfeiting 
also 
remain 
serious 
problems, 
as 
does 
the 
large 
backlog 
of 
pending 
patent applications. Furthermore, 
Chilean 
Courts 
of 
Appeal 
have been 
supportive 
in 
cases 
where 
the trademark 
has 
been 
"stockpiled" 
but 
gone 
unused, 
but 
less 
so 
in 
cases 
where 
investments 
were 
made 
in 
use 
of 
the  trademark. 
In 
either 
case, 
proceedings 
can 
be 
lengthy (2-4 
years) 
and 
expensive ($5.000-$10.000) 
with 
a 
low 
success 
rate 
(Chile 
Country Commercial 
Guide, 
2002). 
In 
consequence, 
the 
current 
IPR 
systems 
needs 
to 
be 
further 
revised 
in 
order 
to 
stimulate investments 
in 
innovation 
and 
technology development. 
Foreign 
Direct 
Investment 
Foreign direct 
investment 
is 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
ways 
in 
which 
to 
participate 
in 
the knowledge 
revolution 
and 
facilitate 
transfer 
of 
technologies 
from 
the 
most 
developed 
economies. 
Chile, 
unlike 
most 
other 
Latin 
American 
countries, 
has 
a 
transparent 
and 
stable 
legal 
and economic environment 
in 
place 
to 
attract 
foreign 
investment. 
While 
many 
other  nations 
have 
placed 
significant 
restrictions  on 
foreign direct 
investment 
(FDI), 
Chile 
realized that 
providing 
foreign 
firms 
with 
fair, 
non-discriminatory 
rules 
was 
the 
best 
method 
to 
encourage 
investment. 
In 
fact, 
Chile 
was 
the 
first 
Latin 
American 
country 
to 
receive 
an 
investment-grade 
credit 
rating 
from 
international 
rating 
agencies, 
including 
Standard 
& 
Poor's 
and 
Duffand Phelps. 
More 
importantly, 
it 
has 
been able 
to 
maintain 
this 
rating 
throughout 
the 
recent 
financial 
crisis affecting 
all 
emerging 
economies, 
and 
currently holds 
the 
lowest 
risk 
rating 
in 
Latin 
America.

From 
1990 
to 
1992, 
annual 
foreign 
investments 
averaged 
US$ 
1.7 
billion, 
but 
from 
1993 
flows 
increased 
dramatically, reaching a record 
US$ 
10.3 
billion 
in 
1999 
(which 
represented 
an 
increase 
of 
45% over 
1998). 
In 
2000, 
foreign 
investment registered a drop, 
but 
soon 
recovered 
and reached 
US$ 
8.1 
billion 
in 
2001. 
Between 
1985 
and  2001,  investments 
in 
natural 
resource 
industries 
(Mining, 
Forestry,  Fishing, 
Aquaculture 
and 
Agriculture) 
represented 
34.6% 
of 
total 
materialized 
FDI, 
while 
service 
industries 
accounted 
for 
an 
additional 
22.9%, 
followed by 
the 
Electricity, 
Gas 
and 
Water industries 
(18.0%) 
and 
Manufacturing  (1 
3.4%) 
(Foreign Investment Committee). 
Thus, 
technology transfer 
via 
FDI 
is 
very 
limited, 
seeing 
that 
it 
is 
mainly 
oriented towards 
natural 
resources 
sectors, 
which 
are 
not 
very 
dynamic 
on the technology 
front 
and 
generate 
fewer spillovers than high-technology industries. 
Venture 
capital 
Despite a favorable 
legal 
framework 
and 
relatively 
healthy 
public 
finances, 
Chile 
has 
been 
unable 
to 
attract significant 
amounts 
of 
venture 
capital. Venture 
capital 
refers 
to 
equity 
investment 
in 
new 
firms. 
It 
is 
a 
major 
source 
of 
funding for 
new 
technology-based 
firms 
in 
countries 
like 
the 
United 
States 
and 
it 
is 
pivotal 
in 
promoting  radical 
innovations  often 
carried 
out 
by 
new 
firms. 
In 
consequence, 
the 
development 
of 
a mature 
venture 
capital market 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
challenges 
for 
Chile. 
Venture 
capital 
means 
risk, 
which 
doesn't 
go 
well 
with 
the 
Chilean 
business 
culture 
according 
to 
various 
accounts. 
According 
to 
Kathleen Barclay, 
the 
Senior 
Country 
Officer for 
Chase 
Manhattan 
Bank 
and 
vice 
president 
of 
AMCHAM. 
Chilean 
entrepreneurs 
usually 
start 
by 
using capital 
from 
friends 
and 
family 
and, 
once 
they 
are 
big 
enough 
and 
operate 
at 
relatively 
low 
risk, 
they 
switch 
to 
private equity 
financing, 
without 
passing through 
the 
intermediate 
financing 
steps, 
namely 
"seed 
capital",  "angel 
investors", 
Angel 
investors 
are 
successful entrepreneurs 
who 
invest 
in 
companies 
in 
the 
same 
line 
of 
business. 
This 
type 
of 
investment 
is 
very common 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
but 
rare 
in 
Chile, 
which 
is 
partly 
due 
to 
a small 
domestic 
market 
that doesn't 
allow sufficient 
risk 
diversification. 
and 
"venture 
capital". 
Still, 
recent developments 
call for 
optimism. 
Initiatives 
from 
organizations 
like 
Fundacion 
Chile 
and 
COW0 
(Chile's 
Economic 
Development  Agency) 
are 
only 
two 
indications 
that 
Chile 
is 
slowly 
developing a 
tradition 
for 
seed 
capital. CORFO, 
for 
example, 
is 
taking 
measures 
to 
improve 
the 
financial 
situation 
for 
entrepreneurs and support 
innovative 
ideas 
without 
finance. 
It 
has 
a program 
to 
match 
venture 
capital investments 
of 
up to 
approximately 
US$ 
54,000 
so 
that 
risks 
and 
benefits 
are 
shared. 
These 
projects 
are 
required 
to 
have 
a 
significant innovation 
angle and healthy 
growth 
perspectives. 
A 
number 
of 
funds 
dedicated 
to 
investing 
in 
small-  and medium-sized 
companies 
(SME) 
have 
also 
emerged 
in 
Chile. 
The 
funds, 
totaling 
about 
$100 
million 
in 
capital 
altogether, 
have 
all 
been 
publicly 
traded, and 
are, 
in 
part, designed 
to 
be a 
conduit 
for 
Chilean 
pension funds 
to 
invest 
in 
small 
business 
(Pitch, 
1995). 
One 
example 
is 
ChileTech 
Risk 
Capital 
Fund, 
which primarily 
invests 
in 
agribusiness, 
forestry 
and 
marine 
resources 
businesses. 
Its 
goal 
is 
to 
invest 
in 
highly 
innovative 
enterprises, 
which 
seek 
to 
be 
competitors 
in 
the 
global 
marketplace and 
those 
that 
face 
barriers 
to 
entry beyond 
financial 
resources. 
The 
strategic 
importance 
of 
venture 
capital 
is 
also 
acknowledged 
by 
President 
Lagos, 
who 
in 
his 
presidential 
address 
committed 
his 
administration 
to 
the development 
of 
venture 
capital 
markets. 
Still 
these 
developments 
do 
not 
change 
the 
shodmedium 
term 
assessment 
of 
Chile: 
Lack 
of 
risk 
capital 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
major 
obstacle 
to 
innovation 
and 
technological development.

Conclusions 
and recommendations 
Liberal 
policies, 
based 
on 
solid 
and 
reliable  institutions, 
have  succeeded 
in 
creating  a  favorable 
macroeconomic 
environment 
for 
science, 
technology and innovations 
in 
Chile. However, 
while 
scientific 
and, 
to 
a certain 
extent, 
technological development 
has 
made progress 
over 
the 
last 
decade, 
it 
remains 
disconnected 
from 
the 
economy and 
as 
such 
do not lead 
to 
continued product 
innovation 
and 
higher 
living 
standards. 
A 
number 
of 
factors 
help 
explain 
this 
situation, 
several 
of 
which 
should 
be 
addressed 
in 
the 
following 
years 
if 
Chile 
wants 
to 
significantly 
develop 
its 
capacity 
for 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation: 
Realign the 
institutional 
set-up 
and 
increase 
S&T 
expenditures. 
A 
high-level 
political 
body 
should be 
vested 
with 
the powers and 
means 
to 
set 
the 
agenda 
for 
science, 
technology 
and 
innovation 
in 
Chile. 
S&T 
expenditures should, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
be 
increased, 
which 
in 
turn calls 
for 
increased 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
addition 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
public 
sector spending. 
Promote innovation 
in 
small and 
medium enterprises. 
Target 
public 
S&T 
policies 
towards 
the 
needs 
of 
SME’s 
as 
well 
as 
the 
promotion 
of 
linkages between 
national 
R&D 
institutions 
and industry. 
For 
this 
end, 
a 
set 
of 
indirect 
incentives 
- 
similar 
to 
those 
found internationally 
- 
could 
be 
developed 
to 
reduce 
private 
costs 
of 
STI 
related activities. 
Strengthen 
cooperation 
and  knowledge  diffusion 
mechanisms. 
Attention could 
inter 
alia 
be 
given 
to 
incentive 
structures 
for 
researchers, 
and 
the 
need 
to 
stimulate 
mobility 
of 
personnel 
within 
the 
science 
system 
and  between 
science 
and 
industry.  The  other  important 
policy  tool  for 
the 
promotion 
of 
private-public scientific cooperation 
is 
the 
establishment 
of 
centres 
of 
excellence. 
These 
help 
create 
and 
diffuse 
knowledge 
and can 
act 
as 
the 
core 
of 
innovation 
networks. 
Stimulate 
risk 
capital. 
Risk 
capital 
can 
be 
accessed 
either 
via 
FDI 
of 
domestic 
sources. 
The 
current 
supply 
of 
investments, 
foreign 
and domestic, 
is 
insufficient. 
FDI 
flows 
do 
not 
target 
technology-intensive 
sectors 
and domestic venture 
capital markets 
are 
still 
in 
their 
infancy. The question 
is, 
however, 
how 
to 
nurture 
risk 
capital 
in 
Chile? 
As 
already 
pointed 
out, 
some 
of 
the fundamentals, 
such 
as 
a 
solid 
legal 
framework 
and 
an 
open 
investment regime 
are 
already 
in 
place. 
In 
consequence, 
one 
of 
the 
key 
obstacles 
could 
be 
lack 
of 
demand 
for 
seed 
capital, 
which 
in 
turn 
reflects 
a risk-averse 
business 
community.

CHILE: 
Science 
for 
the Knowledge Economy 
(This 
summary 
is 
based 
on

Hansen, 
Lauritz 
Holm-Nielsen 
& 
Patricia 
Garcia 
Zliiiiga,

Human 
Resources 
for 
the 
Knowledge 
Economy. 
Washington, 
DC: 
World 
Bank) 
This 
paper takes 
stock 
at 
the 
Chilean education 
system 
and 
the 
country’s 
endowment 
of 
human 
capital. 
The 
objective 
is 
to 
assess 
whether 
Chile 
is 
adequately 
equipped 
in 
terms 
of 
human capital 
to 
develop 
into 
a 
knowledge-based economy.  The  paper 
opens 
by 
examining 
the 
key 
characteristics 
of 
the 
Chilean 
educational 
system, 
such 
as 
political 
organization, expenditure, enrollment,  attainment 
and 
quality 
of 
education. 
Against 
this 
backdrop, 
the 
paper 
investigates the 
skills 
profile 
of 
the 
Chilean population 
in 
order 
to 
assess 
whether 
Chile 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
develop 
into 
a knowledge-based 
economy. 
The 
Chilean Education 
System 
Organization 
The 
political 
organization 
of 
the 
Chilean education 
sector 
was 
profoundly 
changed 
following 
reforms 
in 
the 
early 
1980’s: 
Responsibility 
for 
basic 
public 
education 
was 
delegated 
from 
the 
Ministry 
for 
Education 
(MINEDUC) 
to 
municipalities 
and 
education 
institutions, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
a 
vast 
number 
of 
private 
and 
semi-private 
schools 
came 
into 
existence. 
As 
pointed 
out 
by 
Vegas 
(2002), 
decentralization 
led 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
educational 
achievement 
at 
the 
primary 
level 
in 
schools 
which 
at 
the 
same 
time 
enjoyed extensive 
teacher 
autonomy. 
Nevertheless, many 
education 
institutions 
have 
not 
been 
sufficiently 
capacitated 
to 
lift 
this 
task. 
This 
problem 
has 
been 
further 
aggravated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
transfer 
of 
responsibilities 
has 
not 
been 
met 
by 
a corresponding 
rise 
in 
funding 
(Delannoy, 
2000). 
Like 
the basic 
education 
system, 
the 
tertiary 
level 
was 
reformed 
and 
decentralized 
profoundly 
in 
the 
early 
1980s 
following 
structural 
and 
financial 
reforms. 
Hence, 
the 
range 
of 
higher 
education 
institutions 
grew 
from 
originally 
eight universities 
into 
a 
total 
of 
257 
tertiary  institutions 
encompassing 
68 
universities 
(public 
and 
private), 
70 
professional institutes  (private) 
and 
1 
19 
technical 
training 
centers 
(private). 
Decentralization 
has 
had 
implications 
somewhat 
similar 
to 
those 
of 
the basic education 
system. 
First, 
the 
extensive 
autonomy 
means 
that 
MINEDUC 
and 
its 
division for 
higher 
education, 
DIVESUP, 
has 
limited 
possibilities 
to  control 
the 
course 
of 
the  higher  education 
sector. 
Second, 
not 
all 
of 
the 
tertiary 
institutions 
have 
been 
sufficiently 
capacitated 
for 
self-governance 
(World 
Bank, 
1998, 
p.4). 
This 
has, 
as 
the 
following 
sections 
will 
show, 
led 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a very 
heterogeneous 
tertiary 
sector. 
Finance 
for 
Education 
The 
overall 
level 
of 
public 
education expenditure 
decreased 
throughout the 
1980s 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
cost-efficiency  reforms. Over 
the 
1990s, 
by 
contrast, 
public 
expenditure gained 
momentum, 
which 
to 
some 
extent 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
a reaction 
to 
the reforms 
of 
the 
1980s. 
Still, 
the 
current 
level 
of 
public 
expenditure constitutes 
only 
3.7% 
of 
GDP 
(1998), 
which 
is 
significantly below 
the 
average 
level 
in 
low 
and 
middle-income countries 
(4.2%) 
and high-income countries 
(5.6%). 
The 
relatively 
low 
share 
of 
public 
expenditure 
relative 
to 
GDP 
is 
compensated 
by 
a very 
high 
level 
of 
private 
sector 
funding 
amounting 
to 
approximately 
2.7% 
of 
GDP. The 
role 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
is 
especially dominant 
with 
regard 
to 
higher education. 
Hence, 
government 
funding 
as 
share 
of 
total 
tertiary funding 
dropped 
from 
a 
level 
of 
100% 
prior 
to 
the reforms 
of 
the 
early 
1980s 
to 
a 
level 
of 
only 
27% 
of by 
1990. 
The 
rules 
guiding 
the 
allocation 
of 
public 
expenditures 
have been changed 
profoundly 
over 
the 
last 
- 
84 
- 
Page  89
decades. 
Hence, 
one 
of 
the most significant traits 
of 
the 
reforms 
in 
the 
1980s 
was 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
capitation 
system 
linking 
resources 
for 
basic 
education 
allocation 
to 
student 
attendance. 
This, 
in 
turn, 
has 
ensured 
a better 
fit 
with 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
system. 
The 
allocation 
rules 
guiding public 
expenditures 
for 
tertiary 
education 
have 
also 
been 
reformed 
in 
the 
past decades. 
Prior to 
the 
launch 
of 
the 
Government’s 
Higher  Education 
Improvement  Project 
in 
1998, 
50% 
of 
public 
funding 
for 
tertiary  education 
was 
allocated exclusively 
to 
25 
universities 
affiliated 
with 
the 
Consejo 
de 
Rectores 
(MINEDUC, 
1999). 
In 
consequence, 
this 
system 
was 
highly 
discriminatory to 
tertiary institutions not 
affiliated 
with 
the 
Consejo 
de  Rectores. 
Another 
significant 
share 
of 
public funding 
(9%) 
was 
allocated through the 
Institutional 
Development 
Fund 
(Fondo 
de 
Desarollo 
Znstitucional, 
FDI), 
which 
in 
turn 
consisted 
of 
four different 
competitive 
funds. 
FDI 
was 
heavily 
criticized for letting 
political 
criteria 
dominate 
the 
allocation 
of 
funds 
The 
higher education improvement 
project 
was 
launched 
in 
1998 
in 
order 
to 
level 
the 
playing 
field, 
by 
giving 
all 
tertiary 
education 
institutions 
equal 
access 
to 
direct 
subsidies 
and 
creating a US$225 
million 
competitive 
fund to 
replace the FDI-system 
(World 
Bank, 
1998, 
World 
Bank, 
2002f 
and 
CENDA, 
2001). 
Enrollment 
and 
attainment 
Chile 
has 
attained 
virtually 
universal 
coverage 
at 
the 
primary 
level. 
Chile 
has 
also 
seen 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
secondary 
enrollment 
from 
approximately 
50% 
in 
1980 
to 
more 
than 
80% 
in 
1998. 
Finally, 
Chile 
has 
seen 
a notable 
increase 
in 
tertiary 
enrollment 
by 
regional 
standards. Hence,  whereas 
LAC 
tertiary enrollment 
rose 
from 
14 
to 
20% 
in 
1980-1998, 
the 
Chilean 
number 
went 
up 
from 
12% 
to 
34%. 
However, Chilean 
tertiary 
enrollment 
is 
still 
behind 
the 
OECD 
average 
of 
51%. 
The 
growth 
in 
tertiary 
enrollment 
has 
been 
partly 
facilitated 
by 
the 
increase 
in 
tertiary 
education institutions, 
notably private 
universities 
and 
technical institutes 
(Teixeira 
& 
Amaral, 
2001, 
p.13ff). 
Moreover,  Beyer 
et 
al. (1999) 
points out that 
the 
private 
returns 
to 
tertiary 
education have 
been 
increasing 
relative 
to 
primary 
and 
secondary 
over 
the 
past 
three 
decades, 
which 
in 
turn 
can 
explain 
the increase 
in 
tertiary 
enrollment 
from 
1980 
to 
the 
mid 
1990s. 
A 
simple correlation 
between 
educational attainment 
and 
average 
labor income 
suggests 
that 
the 
earnings 
of 
tertiary 
graduates 
went 
up 
from 
2.4 
times 
the 
earning 
of 
secondary graduates 
in 
1980 
to 
3.3 
times 
by 
1996. 
More 
sophisticated regression analysis 
likewise 
documents that the 
skill 
premium 
has 
been 
increasing over 
the 
last 
decades, 
although 
there 
has 
been 
a 
slight 
decrease 
in 
the 
1990s 
(SAnchez-Pkamo 
& 
Schady,  2002). 
As 
pointed 
out 
by 
Beyer 
et 
al. 
(2001, 
p.121f.) 
this 
reversion may 
reflect 
the 
increase 
in 
supply 
of 
tertiary 
graduates, 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
drive 
down 
the 
price 
on 
highly 
skilled 
labor. 
Equity 
The 
gains 
in 
enrollment 
and 
educational attainment have 
not 
been 
equally 
distributed. 
Inequity 
cross 
income 
quintiles 
is 
especially  dominant 
with 
regard 
to 
tertiary 
education;  a 
trend, 
which 
has 
been 
increasing 
in 
recent 
years: 
Tertiary 
enrollment 
rose 
by 
almost 50% 
for 
the richest income 
quintile, 
but 
was 
stagnant 
for 
the 
lowest 
income 
quintile 
(Araneda 
& 
Marin, 
2002). 
As 
pointed 
out 
by 
Teixeira 
and 
Imaral 
(2001, 
p.15) 
this 
follows 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
poorest 
income 
quintiles 
cannot 
afford 
to enroll 
in 
the 
new 
private 
universities 
and 
find 
it 
difficult 
to 
be accepted 
to public 
universities, 
which 
are 
highly 
elitist 
in 
terms 
of 
academic 
admission criteria. 
In 
the 
legal 
framework 
of 
the 
institutions, 
there 
is 
no 
generalized social 
or 
ethnic 
discrimination 
in 
access 
to 
higher 
education and 
hence 
entry 
into 
the 
S&T 
sector 
as 
a 
researcher 
in 
Chile. 
Furthermore, 
the 
government 
has 
established a specific  scholarship 
program 
for 
indiginous 
people 
to 
access 
higher 
education.  Nevertheless 
the 
poor 
and 
people 
from 
minority 
backgrounds continue 
to 
be underrepresented 
among 
students 
and 
researchers, 
(Repetto 
and 
Holm-Nielsen, 
2003). 
High 
enrollment 
rates 
in 
Chile 
have  translated 
into 
increasing  educational 
attainment. Hence, 
Chile’s  attainment 
is 
according 
to 
Barro 
and 
Lee 
(2000) 
one 
of 
the highest 
in 
Latin 
America 
with 
7.9 
years 
of 
formal 
education 
almost 
equally  distributed 
between 
males 
and females. 
Chile’s domestic figures published 
by 
MINEDUC 
in 
the “Compendio  Estadistico 2000” 
present 
a 
10.17 
national 
figure for 
educational  attainment 
(with 
a 
range 
of 
8.43 
to 
1 
1.04 
between 
regions). 
This 
number 
- 
85 
- 
Page  90
is 
only 
exceeded 
in 
Latin 
America 
by 
Argentina 
with 
8.49 years 
and 
is 
well 
above the 
Latin 
American 
average 
of 
5.7 
years 
(Barro 
& 
Lee, 
2000). 
However,  a 
significant 
gap 
still 
exists 
to 
high-income 
countries, 
which 
feature 
9.5 
years 
of 
average 
educational attainment. 
Quality 
of 
Education 
Seen 
in 
a 
Latin 
American context, 
Chile 
has 
been 
in 
the 
avant-garde 
of 
Latin 
American 
countries 
in 
terms 
of 
developing 
and 
participating 
in 
quality 
assessments. 
In 
consequence, 
Chile 
today 
has 
access 
to 
a 
fairly 
wide selection 
of 
data 
on 
student 
performance. 
On 
a 
national 
level, SIMCE, 
Sistema 
de 
Medicidn 
de 
la 
Calidad 
de 
la 
Educacidn 
(System 
for 
the 
Measurement 
of 
Educational 
Quality) 
has 
been 
used 
consistently 
since 
1988 
to 
assess 
Spanish 
and Mathematics 
abilities 
of 
4th 
and 
8th 
graders. 
Following 
a 
negative trend 
in 
the 
198Os, 
the 
Spanish and 
Mathematics 
abilities 
of 
fourth 
graders 
in 
municipal 
schools 
have made 
significant 
progress over the 
last 
years 
(Cox 
& 
Lemaitre, 
1999, 
p.159). 
The 
national 
test 
average 
was 
around 
50 
in 
1988, 
but 
by 
1996 
the 
pupils 
had 
achieved 
a 
score 
of 
72. 
Moreover,  the 
progress applies 
across 
the 
board 
seeing 
that 
the 
gap 
in 
test 
average 
between urban 
and 
rural 
has 
decreased 
from 
30 
percentage 
point 
in 
1992 
to 
roughly 
10 
percentage 
points 
by 
1996 
(Delannoy, 
2000). 
Chile 
has, 
unlike 
most 
Latin 
American  countries, 
taken 
part 
in 
various 
regional 
and 
international 
assessments 
of 
student 
performance, 
notably 
the 
UNESCO/OREALC-assessment, 
and 
the 
international 
TIMSS-test. 
Chile 
emerged 
among  the 
top  four 
countries 
in 
the 
regional 
UNESCO/OREALC 
benchmarking, 
which 
was 
conducted to 
assess 
mathematics 
and 
language 
in 
the 
LAC 
region. 
Unlike 
the 
UNESCO/OREALC 
assessment, 
the 
TIMSS-test 
puts 
the 
performance 
of 
Chilean 
students 
into 
a 
truly 
global 
perspective. 
Hence, 
Chile 
participated 
as 
the 
only 
representative 
from 
the 
LAC 
region 
in 
the 1999 
TIMSS-test 
together 
with 
37 other countries 
mainly 
from 
North 
America, 
Europe 
and 
the 
Far 
East. 
The 
test 
was 
designed 
to 
benchmark 
the 
mathematics and 
science 
ability 
of 
students 
at 
the 
eighth 
grade 
level. The top performers 
in 
the 
sample 
were 
mainly 
Asian 
countries 
like 
Taiwan, 
Singapore and 
Korea. 
Chile 
on 
the 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
was 
rated 
below 
the 
mean score 
and 
notably behind 
several 
Central 
and 
East 
European countries 
like 
Hungary, the 
Czech and 
Slovak 
Republic 
and 
the 
Russian Federation. 
In 
conclusion, 
the 
quality 
of 
Chilean education 
is 
among the 
highest 
in 
Latin 
America, 
but 
significantly 
behind 
East 
Asian 
countries,  most 
East- and 
Central 
European countries 
as 
well 
as 
the 
majority 
of 
OECD-countries. 
Prevalence 
of 
outdated 
curricula 
and 
low 
priority 
of 
science 
education 
at 
the 
basic 
level 
helps 
explain 
why 
Chile 
is 
lagging 
behind. 
As 
pointed 
out 
by 
Arellano 
(2002), 
the 
Chilean 
science 
curriculum 
has 
been 
relatively 
limited 
in 
Chile 
compared 
to 
many other 
countries, 
notably 
the 
Far 
Eastern countries 
which 
have 
put 
extensive 
focus 
on 
the 
exact 
sciences. 
Likewise, 
Mullin 
et 
al. (2000) 
point 
out that 
science 
teaching 
in 
Chile 
has 
suffered 
from 
serious 
deficiencies.

Quality 
in 
higher 
education 
Compared 
to 
the 
primary 
and 
secondary 
level, very 
few indicators 
exist 
to 
track the 
level 
of 
quality 
at 
the 
tertiary level. 
Still, 
the 
educational 
level 
of 
faculty 
staff 
can 
give 
a 
rough 
indication 
of 
the 
quality 
level. 
1997 
data 
on 
faculty  staff 
in 
public 
universities  reveal that 
only 
12% 
of 
faculty  staff 
in 
Chile 
have 
PhD-degrees. 
Compared 
to 
most 
high-income 
OECD 
countries 
this 
numbers 
is 
very 
low, 
and 
indicate 
in 
turn 
that 
quality 
of 
faculty staff 
in 
Chilean universities 
is 
low 
(Garcia 
Guadilla 
in 
World 
Bank, 
1999b, 
p.36). 
A 
1998 
World 
Bank 
assessment 
further 
concludes 
that 
quality 
is 
very 
heterogeneous 
in 
the 
tertiary 
education 
sector. 
The 
public 
higher education 
sector 
is 
generally considered 
to 
be 
high 
quality, 
whereas 
quality 
levels tend 
to 
be 
lower 
in 
private 
sector 
institutions, 
notably 
IP’s 
(Professional Institutes) 
and 
CTF’s (Technical 
Training 
Centers). 
This picture 
of 
heterogeneity 
is 
arguably a result 
of 
a 
flawed 
quality 
framework. 
The 
absence 
of 
systematic 
quality 
assessments 
naturally 
prevents  policymakers 
from 
identifying 
the 
strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
of 
the tertiary 
system. 
Yet, 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
with 
the 
decision 
to 
make 
the 
Higher  Council 
for 
Education  responsible 
for 
developing 
a 
coherent  and 
all-encompassing 
quality 
system. 
These 
efforts 
are 
supported 
by 
the 
Higher 
Education Improvement 
project (MECESUP), which, 
inter 
alia, 
promotes 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
flexible 
accreditation 
system, 
which 
will 
authorities (and 
students!) 
to 
monitor 
and benchmark 
higher education 
institutions 
more 
closely. 
So 
far 
the 
results 
are 
encouraging. 
According 
to 
a 
recent 
Bank mission (20020, 
the 
changes have 
stimulated 
a 
sense 
of 
competitiveness between 
the 
different 
higher education 
institutions, 
which 
in 
turn 
gives 
them 
an 
incentive 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
and 
relevance 
of 
their programs. 
Diversification 
is 
a 
keyword for  improving 
the 
quality 
of 
educational output 
in 
the 
higher education 
sector. 
The 
strategy 
is 
to allow 
institutions 
to 
capitalize 
on 
their 
comparative 
advantages 
with 
a 
view 
to 
provide 
specialized 
high-quality  institutions 
rather  than 
“department-stores” 
with 
a 
full 
stock 
of 
educational 
programs. 
At 
the 
same 
time diversification 
strategies 
try 
to 
create a market, 
where 
public 
and 
private education suppliers 
compete, 
which 
in 
turn 
should induce 
them 
to 
cater 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
students. 
As 
such 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
1981 
reform 
of 
the 
higher education 
sector can 
be 
seen 
as 
a 
step 
ahead 
by 
allowing for 
a 
differentiation 
of 
higher  education 
institutions. 
Still, 
a 
1998 
World 
Bank 
evaluation 
pointed 
out that the 
diversification 
had 
led 
to 
widespread 
duplication 
leaving 
universities 
and 
CFTs competing 
for 
the 
same 
students 
rather 
than 
develop complementary  programs 
(World 
Bank, 
1998). 
Moreover, 
the 
enrollment 
figures 
indicate a 
lack 
of 
success 
among 
many 
of 
the new institutions. 
Whereas 
university 
enrollment 
has 
increased 
markedly, enrollment 
in 
technical 
training 
centers 
dropped 
17% 
in 
a 
three-year 
period. 
This 
is 
arguably 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
quality 
in 
these 
institutions. 
Moreover, 
the 
vertical 
integration  between 
secondary  and 
tertiary  technical  programs 
is 
very  poor. 
The 
lack 
of 
quality 
assessment at 
the 
tertiary 
level 
means 
that 
tertiary 
technical 
institutions 
operate 
with 
outdated curricula, 
which 
neglect 
the 
needs 
of 
the economy. 
In 
conclusion, there 
is 
no 
educational 
or 
economic incentive 
for 
secondary graduates 
to enroll 
in 
tertiary 
technical 
institutions. 
The 
Skills 
Profile 
The 
skill 
premium 
for 
tertiary 
graduates 
(relative 
to 
secondary 
and 
primary 
graduates) 
has 
been 
rising 
significantly 
over the last 
decades 
in 
Chile 
(Beyer 
at al., 
1999). 
This 
in 
turn 
indicates 
that 
knowledge 
and 
high 
skills 
are 
in 
strong 
demand. 
Still, 
this 
does 
not reveal 
which 
specific 
skills 
are 
in 
demand. 
Higher order 
skills 
Higher 
order 
skills 
encompass 
the 
ability 
to 
perform 
independent  analysis,  adapt 
quickly 
to  new 
situations and interact 
with 
other 
persons 
on a professional 
level 
and 
show 
tolerance 
and 
solidarity. 
Globally 
these 
skills 
are 
in 
increasing 
demand. 
This 
also applies 
to 
Chile, 
which 
due 
to 
its 
extensive 
economic 
openness 
is 
forced 
to 
react 
to 
a constantly changing 
international 
context. 
The 
1998 
International 
Adult 
Literacy 
Survey 
(IALS) 
can be 
used 
to 
approximate 
proliferation 
of 
higher

order 
skills 
in 
Chile. The 
survey 
targeted, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
ability 
to 
understand and 
use 
information 
from 
various 
text 
materials, the 
ability 
to locate 
and 
apply 
information 
from 
formats 
such 
as 
job 
applications, 
itineraries, 
tables 
and charts, 
and, 
finally, 
the 
ability to 
do arithmetic operations (OECD, 
2000). 
Clearly, 
these 
definitions 
do 
not 
encompass 
the 
full 
meaning 
of 
higher order 
skills, 
but 
they 
do 
capture, 
however, 
the 
ability 
of 
individuals 
to 
locate relevant 
printed 
information 
and 
make 
effectively 
use 
thereof. 
Chile 
was 
the 
only 
Latin 
America 
country 
to 
take 
part 
in 
IALS 
assessment, 
which 
in 
addition 
to Chile 
consists 
of 
18 
OECD-countries 
and Slovenia. 
Chile 
was 
located 
at 
the 
very 
bottom 
across 
all 
types 
of 
literacy. 
These 
results 
imply 
that 
only 
20% 
of 
the 
Chilean 
population 
have 
a reading comprehension 
sufficient 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
“the 
demands 
of 
everyday 
life 
and 
work 
in 
a complex 
advanced 
society” 
(Arellano, 
2002, 
p.680. 
A 
further 
breakdown 
of 
the 
results 
shows 
that 
the 
low 
literacy 
levels 
are 
especially prevalent among 
the 
older 
age 
cohorts, 
which 
in 
turn 
makes 
a 
case 
for intensifying training 
efforts 
targeting 
the 
older 
part 
of 
the 
workforce 
(see 
section 
on 
lifelong 
learning below) (OECD, 
2000, 
p.34). 
In 
consequence, 
Chileans 
still 
have 
a 
long 
way 
to 
go 
in 
developing higher order 
skills, 
and 
the 
economy 
will, by 
implication, 
remain vulnerable 
to 
external 
shocks. 
Hard 
skills 
Chilean high-technology products 
amount 
to only 
5% 
of 
total 
exports, 
a 
number 
which 
is 
significantly 
below 
the 
levels 
in 
other 
LAC 
countries 
such 
as 
Mexico 
(60%), 
Brazil 
(32%)  and 
Argentina 
(19%) 
(UNDP, 
2001). 
In 
sum, 
current 
demand 
for 
hard 
skills 
(scientists, 
engineers, 
technological workers 
etc.) 
seems 
to 
be 
lower 
in 
Chile 
than 
in 
most 
advanced 
OECD 
countries. 
This 
in 
turn 
is 
a 
serious 
obstacle 
for 
generating 
rapid 
technological growth. 
Enrollment 
in 
technical-vocational 
secondary 
programs 
has 
increased 
consistently  over the  last 
two 
decades, 
while 
enrollment 
in 
tertiary 
technical 
training 
centers 
has 
been decreasing 
(Araneda 
& 
Marin, 
2002). 
As 
pointed 
out earlier, 
this 
is, 
inter 
alia, 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
integration 
between technical programs at 
the 
secondary 
and 
tertiary level. 
Moreover, the expansion 
of 
private universities 
has 
favored soft 
skills 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
hard 
skills 
programs. 
Whereas 
basic science 
programs 
represent 12% 
of 
careers 
offered 
in 
traditional 
universities, 
it 
only 
takes 
up 
0.5% 
in 
the 
private 
universities. 
Social 
sciences, 
by 
contrast, 
represent 
27% 
of 
careers 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
only 7% 
in 
the 
traditional 
university 
sector. 
This 
arguably 
reflects  a 
lack 
of 
willingness  among 
privately  funded  institutions 
to 
engage 
in 
expensive 
programs; 
a 
low-risk 
behavior 
identified 
in 
most 
countries according 
to 
Teixeira 
& 
Amaral(2001, 
p.21). 
The hard 
skills 
profile 
of 
Chile 
is 
further 
weakened 
by 
a 
low 
turnover 
of 
PhD’s 
in 
hard 
skills 
fields 
such 
as 
natural and 
exact 
sciences, 
medical 
sciences 
and 
engineering 
and 
technology 
(RICYT, 
2001). One 
possible explanation 
for 
the 
low 
turnover 
of 
researchers 
could 
be the 
fact 
that 
potential 
researchers 
perceive that 
they 
exclude 
themselves 
from 
careers 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
by 
enrolling 
in 
PhD 
programs. 
Thus, 
research 
programs 
are 
chiefly 
associated 
with 
careers 
in 
universities 
and 
research 
institutions 
(Mullin 
et 
al., 
2000, 
p.86ff). 
In 
sum, 
Chile 
faces 
an 
important 
challenge 
in 
making 
PhD 
programs more 
attractive. 
This 
can 
be 
facilitated by bringing 
research 
programs 
in 
better 
agreement 
with 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
economy. 
This 
in 
turn 
would 
make 
PhD 
candidates 
more 
attractive 
to 
the enterprise 
sector 
and 
boost 
the 
skill 
premium 
to 
PhD 
doctorates. 
ICT-literacy 
ICT-skills 
appear 
to 
be 
in 
stronger 
demand 
in 
Chile 
than 
hard 
skills 
generally. 
Hence, 
Chile 
features 
a 
very 
high 
penetration 
of 
ICT-technologies, 
but 
is 
still 
behind 
the 
levels 
of 
most 
OECD 
countries. 
Still, 
as 
Agapitova 
& 
Holm-Nielsen 
(2002. 
p.6) 
point 
out, 
knowledge 
intensive 
services 
such 
as 
computing 
have 
experienced very 
rapid 
growth 
in 
Chile. 
Telecommunications 
is 
likewise 
a very dynamic 
sector, 
and 
has 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
privatization 
made 
impressive 
progress 
in 
terms 
of 
equipping 
the 
nation 
with 
fast 
and 
reliable 
means 
of 
communication. Currently, 
the sector 
thrives 
due 
to 
large 
investments 
in 
long-distance 
telephony 
and 
cellular 
and 
wireless communication.

As 
pointed 
out 
in 
a 
recent study 
by 
a 
Chilean 
presidential 
commission, 
the 
Chilean 
endowment 
of 
ICT-skills 
was 
far 
from 
sufficient 
by 
the 
late 
1990s 
(Comision 
Presidencial, 
1999,  p.61). 
Still, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
get 
a 
more 
detailed 
picture 
seeing 
that 
very 
little 
data 
is 
available. 
Some 
of 
the 
only 
data 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
Chilean 
ICT-workers 
has 
been 
provided by 
the 
World 
Economic Forum, 
who 
in 
a 
survey 
asked 
employers 
in 
a 
number 
of 
different 
countries 
to 
rate 
the 
quality 
of 
ICT-workers relative 
to 
other 
countries. 
Chilean 
employers 
rated 
the 
domestic  supply 
of 
ICT-workers 
among 
the 
best 
in 
the 
Latin 
America. 
In 
fact, 
Chile 
was, 
together 
with 
Costa 
Rica 
and 
Brazil, 
far 
above 
the 
mean 
value 
for 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
East 
Asia 
and the 
Pacific. 
High-income 
OCED 
countries, 
on the other 
hand, 
were 
rated 
superior 
to 
ICT-workers 
in 
all 
other 
countries 
(Arellano, 
2002). 
Additional 
survey 
data, 
likewise 
from 
the 
World 
Economic 
Forum 
(2002), 
indicates that the 
quality 
of 
IT 
education 
programs 
is 
second 
only to 
Costa 
Rica 
in 
Latin 
America. 
Still, 
this 
rating 
is 
only slightly 
above 
the 
global 
average 
and 
Chile 
is 
far behind the 
quality 
of 
ICT-education programs 
in 
avant-garde 
countries 
like 
Finland, 
the 
Netherlands 
and the 
US. 
In 
conclusion, 
there 
is 
still 
room for 
improvement 
of 
Chilean 
ICT-education. 
Expanding 
education: 
Training 
and 
lifelong 
learning 
As 
noted 
by 
the 
IALS 
survey, 
the 
skills 
of 
the 
Chilean workforce 
lag 
significantly 
behind 
those 
of 
more 
developed 
economies, 
especially 
so 
among 
the older cohorts 
of 
the 
workforce. 
4.5 
million 
adult Chileans 
have 
not 
completed their 
primary 
education and 
another 
2 
million 
adults 
have 
yet 
to 
complete 
secondary 
education. 
In 
sum, 
close 
to 
70% 
of 
the 
adult  population 
is 
without 
completed 
secondary 
education. 
Further, 
500,000 
adults 
are 
illiterates, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
4.3% 
of 
the 
adult 
population 
(World 
Bank, 
2002d, 
p.4). 
In 
consequence, 
Chile 
faces 
a 
major 
challenge 
in 
elevating 
the 
skills 
of 
its 
adult 
work 
force. 
Compared 
to 
most 
Latin 
American countries, 
Chilean 
companies 
seem 
to 
be 
fairly 
proactive 
with 
regard 
to 
investments 
in 
staff 
training. 
Hence, 
Chilean, 
Brazilian 
and Costa 
Rican 
companies 
are 
among 
the 
leaders 
in 
the 
region 
in 
terms 
of 
investments 
in 
training, 
whereas 
countries 
like 
Mexico 
and 
Colombia 
lag 
behind. 
Still, 
investments 
in 
Chilean 
companies 
are 
only on 
average 
in 
a 
global 
comparison, 
far 
behind 
several 
Western 
European 
countries 
and 
the 
United 
States. 
Further 
evidence 
points 
out that 
less 
than 
10% 
of 
the 
Chilean workforce 
have 
received 
training 
(World 
Bank, 
2002d, p.6). 
In 
conclusion, there 
seems 
to 
be 
a strong 
need 
for 
staff 
training 
in 
Chile 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
country 
compares 
well 
in 
Latin 
America. Moreover, 
the 
IALS 
survey 
found 
that 
Chilean 
professionals 
are 
far more 
likely 
to 
take 
part 
in 
training 
programs 
than 
blue-collar 
workers (OECD, 
2000, 
p.4lff). 
As 
pointed 
out 
in 
a 
recent 
World 
Bank 
assessment 
of 
Chile 
(2002d), 
lifelong 
learning policies 
must 
deal 
with 
numerous 
challenges, 
of 
which 
three 
are 
especially salient. 
First, 
many 
companies, 
notably 
SME’s 
cannot 
afford 
to 
supply 
training to 
their 
employees. 
Clearly, 
tax 
rebate 
schemes 
have 
had 
some 
success 
and 
have, 
for 
example, 
led 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the number 
of 
workers 
participating 
in 
training 
programs 
from 
approximately 
450,000 
in 
1996 
to 
more 
than 
620,000 
by 
2000 
(Araneda 
& 
Marin, 
2002, 
table 
2.1 
1). 
Still, 
the 
bulk 
of 
companies 
participating 
in 
the 
scheme 
are 
large 
companies 
who 
already make 
use 
of 
training 
in 
their 
strategies. 
Second, 
the 
current supply 
of 
training 
in 
Chile 
is 
not 
attentive to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
small 
firms 
and 
employees. 
Even 
though 
little 
evaluation 
has 
been 
done 
so 
far 
of 
Chilean 
training 
programs, Araneda 
& 
Marin 
(2002) 
point 
out that 
there 
is 
an 
emerging 
consensus 
that 
the 
quality 
and relevance 
of 
training 
programs 
is 
insufficient. 
This 
in 
turn 
can 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
information 
between suppliers and 
demanders 
of 
training, 
which 
serves 
to uphold 
current imbalances rather than correct 
them. 
Moreover, 
lack 
of 
indicators 
and systematic 
evaluations 
mean that 
suppliers 
of 
training 
face weak 
incentives 
to 
increase the 
quality 
of 
their 
programs. 
Third, 
SME’s 
do not generally 
appreciate 
the 
externalities 
associated 
with 
training 
programs and there 
has 
generally 
been 
very 
little 
interest 
in 
training 
programs 
in 
political 
and academic 
environments. 
This 
- 
89 
- 
Page  94
in 
turn 
begs 
for 
campaigns 
designed 
to 
raise the 
awareness 
of 
the benefits 
associated 
with 
training 
programs. 
So 
far, 
the 
Chilean 
education 
system 
has 
not 
been 
successful 
in 
supplying 
“skills 
for 
the 
knowledge 
economy”. 
The 
analysis 
has 
pointed 
out 
that Chileans 
lag 
behind 
with 
regard 
to 
higher 
order 
skills 
and 
hard 
skills. 
The 
supply 
of 
ICT-skills 
arguably also 
needs 
to 
be 
stimulated further. Moreover, 
as 
pointed 
out 
by 
Brunner, 
the 
low 
supply 
of 
hard 
skills 
constitutes a 
major 
bottleneck 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Chilean 
economy. 
Part 
of 
the 
reason 
is 
that the 
tertiary 
technical education 
system 
has 
been 
allowed 
to 
drift 
a part, 
which 
in 
turn 
has 
reduced 
the 
inventive 
to 
enroll. Moreover, 
the 
current 
training 
system 
suffers 
from 
substantial 
flaws 
and 
is 
not 
seen 
as 
a 
strategic 
tool 
by 
employers. 
Unattractive 
PhD 
programs 
likewise 
add 
to 
the 
picture 
of 
an 
education 
system 
in 
need 
of 
reform. 
In 
consequence, 
Chile 
could 
increase 
its 
education 
level significantly 
by 
making 
PhD 
and 
tertiary 
programs more attractive, especially 
in 
the 
hard 
skills 
area. 
Finally, 
and perhaps 
most 
important, 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
Chile 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be demanding 
hard 
skills. 
In 
consequence, 
a vicious 
circle 
has 
emerged, 
where 
the 
low 
demand 
for 
hard 
skills 
keeps 
Chile’s 
technological 
development deadlocked. 
The question 
is 
then; 
will 
Government 
intervention 
break 
this 
deadlock?

Wolfensohn 
President

World 
Bank 
1818 
H 
Street, 
NW 
F 
1227 
Washington, 
D.C. 
20433 
Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn, 
I 
am 
pleased 
to 
present 
you 
with 
this 
letter, 
outlining 
the  our 
strategies 
in 
the 
area 
of 
science 
and 
technology 
and 
the 
objectives 
that 
Chile 
seeks 
to 
achieve through 
the 
“Science 
for 
the 
Knowledge 
Economy Project”, 
currently being 
negotiated 
with 
the 
World 
Bank. 
Our relationship 
with 
the 
Bank 
is 
excellent, 
particularly 
in 
regard 
to 
investment 
in 
human 
capital 
and 
science. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
Bank 
and 
Chile 
have 
worked together on 
five 
different 
projects strengthening 
all 
levels 
of 
our education 
system. 
Active 
at 
this 
point, 
is 
a 
higher 
education improvement 
project 
and a 
project 
on 
lifelong 
learning and training. 
The 
Chilean 
Government 
is 
strongly 
committed 
to 
creating 
the 
conditions 
for 
continuous economic 
growth. The 
government 
believes that 
increased 
competitiveness 
in 
the 
global 
market 
place, 
productivity 
gains 
and 
social development 
is 
highly 
dependent 
of 
a strong knowledge 
base. 
For 
that 
reason 
it 
is 
paramount 
to 
place 
Chile 
among 
the 
world 
leaders 
in 
terms 
of 
production 
and 
application 
of 
knowledge 
and 
technology. 
The Chilean Government 
has 
already 
taken 
steps 
to 
strengthen 
the 
science 
base 
and the 
stock 
of 
human 
capital. 
In 
a 
joint 
effort 
with 
the 
World 
Bank, 
the 
Millennium 
Science 
Initiative 
has 
supported 
research 
in 
Centers 
of 
Excellence and 
Science 
Nuclei.  The project 
has 
helped 
revitalize 
Chile’s 
S&T 
system 
by 
attracting world-class scientists 
engaged 
in 
cutting-edge 
research. 
While 
much 
had 
been 
already 
accomplished, 
Chile 
is 
still 
lagging 
developed nations 
in 
terms 
of 
investment 
in 
research 
and 
development. 
To 
address 
this 
challenged, the Government 
has 
pledged 
to 
double 
the 
funds  allocated 
to 
S&T 
by 
the 
year 
2006. 
This 
entails  a 
significant 
increase 
in 
S&T 
-91 
- 
Page  96
investment 
from 
the 
current 
level 
of 
0.6% 
of 
GDP. 
This 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
place 
Chile 
among 
the 
world 
leaders 
in 
S&T. 
Increasing 
government 
funding 
for 
R&D 
will 
not 
suffice. 
Bringing 
Chile to 
the 
knowledge 
frontier 
and 
improving 
competitiveness 
necessitates 
a 
strong 
involvement 
of 
Chilean 
companies 
to 
R&D. 
Improving 
quality 
of 
research, 
strengthening 
human 
capital 
and 
reinforcing 
linkages 
is 
key 
to 
achieve 
this 
end. 
It 
is 
equally important 
to 
create 
a 
policy 
framework 
that provides incentives to 
engage 
in 
R&D 
activities. 
The 
proposed 
project 
“Science 
for 
the 
Knowledge 
Economy” 
is 
fully 
aligned 
with 
the 
government’s 
aim 
to 
strengthen 
Chile’s 
science 
base 
and 
innovative 
capacity. 
The 
main 
objective 
is 
to 
support 
Chile’s 
transition 
to 
a 
knowledge-based economy 
by 
investing 
in 
the 
national innovation 
system and the stock 
of 
human 
capital. 
The 
Government 
bases 
its 
commitment 
to 
the above 
objective on 
the 
following 
guiding 
principles.

The Chilean Government 
pledges 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
phase 
I 
of 
the 
program. 
This 
phase 
will 
invest 
in 
Chile’s 
science 
base, 
create 
a 
policy 
framework 
conducive 
to 
innovation 
and 
establish new 
mechanisms 
to 
increase 
private 
sector 
R&D 
activities 
and 
build 
linkages 
in 
the 
innovation 
system. 
The Government intends 
to 
continue 
collaboration 
with 
the 
World 
Bank beyond 
phase 
I. 
Phase 
II 
will 
continue 
activities 
from 
phase 
I 
and 
scale 
up 
funding 
for 
established 
mechanisms. 
Note 
has 
been 
taken 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
launch 
of 
phase 
II 
depends 
on the 
achievement 
of 
predefined performance triggers. 
Strengthening 
the 
national 
innovation 
system 
and 
the 
stock 
of 
human 
capital 
is 
a 
high priority. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
Chilean 
government 
is 
dedicated 
to 
provide 
adequate 
funding,  make 
the 
necessary 
policy 
changes 
and 
establish a 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
that 
will 
allow 
impact 
to 
be 
assessed 
on a 
continuous 
basis. 
We 
thank 
you 
for 
your consideration 
of 
the 
foregoing. 
Respectfully 
yours,
