Knowledge\n            Economy Project in Chile were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: The project needs to strengthen collaboration\n            among agencies. For an innovation system to be effective,\n            horizontal integration and collaboration between different\n            institutions within the wider system is essential. For a\n            large and decentralized innovation system, Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) is a core activity. The Project has\n            improved the basis for informed policy making through the\n            establishment of the Observatory for Science, Technology and\n            Innovation (KAWAX), a system for tracking national\n            indicators for science, technology and innovation using\n            international standards and methodologies. The Project acted\n            as a dynamic innovation center, identifying gaps, incubating\n            new instruments and programs, forging strategic alliances,\n            and spinning-off activities.The launch of new instruments to\n            promote innovation -- particularly programs targeted at the\n            private sector -- requires a process of learning and trust\n            building in Chile."}, "docdt": "2007-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
