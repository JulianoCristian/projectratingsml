From the implementation experience of\n            the project, a number of lessons can be drawn with\n            applicability in Cambodia and a wider context: (a) the\n            special circumstances of Cambodia in the early 1990s i.e. a\n            country whose human resource base and public sector\n            apparatus had been severely damaged must be taken into\n            account in any attempt to understand the rationale for\n            project design and the idiosyncrasies of project\n            implementation; (b) sustainability can be achieved only if\n            there is ownership within the institutions and interest on\n            the part of the key players; (c) in order to fill a void,\n            three elements of sub-sectoral strategy were identified to\n            be designed during the early years of the project and five\n            were added at the Mid-term Review and these have been\n            valuable in assisting the government and in encouraging an\n            informed dialogue between the government and donors; (d) it\n            is essential that preparatory work (e.g., base-line studies)\n            and system design should be done as part of project\n            preparation and that the monitoring system should function\n            from the beginning of a project; (e) where components were\n            implemented by Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and\n            Fisheries Departments, there tended to be a\n            \"double\" management structure and, hence, from\n            early in the project emphasis was given to the\n            \"main-streaming\" of APIP into the regular\n            structure of MAFF Department; (f) complex procedures\n            concerning the approval of expenditures that had already\n            been agreed to in annual work plans caused significant\n            delays, compounded by delays in the release of counterpart\n            funds; and (g) as a result of its complexity, with nine\n            components and eighteen sub-components, the IDA budget for\n            supervision was consistently inadequate to include the\n            required technical expertise in every supervision mission,\n            and as a result, some components could not receive\n            appropriate technical guidance."}, "docdt": "2006-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
