Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            include the following: in the future, the use of learning\n            instrument loans (LILs) or any instrument that circumvents\n            any of the usual safeguard investigation during preparation\n            should be subject not only to the normal tests of\n            eligibility, but also the test o f downside risks, be these\n            technical or the likelihood of adverse public opinion; where\n            the client is not familiar with Bank operations and\n            procedures or is confronting serious impediments to its\n            ability to act on that knowledge, continuous presence of\n            competent Bank representatives is a critical factor in\n            moving dialogue and operations forward; when ambiguity or\n            disagreements arise in implementation, particularly with the\n            evolving focus or importance of an activity, an agreed\n            strategy can become an effective management tool;\n            institutions generally respond more favorably to moderate or\n            gradual change than to radical innovation, particularly when\n            power or stature are being threatened; and finally, while\n            fiduciary accountability requires correct procedures and\n            oversight, the development impact o f the Bank's\n            approach to the issue is very much linked to the sensitivity\n            with which it introduces the qualities of transparency and\n            cost-effectiveness as desirable qualities in procurement transactions."}, "docdt": "2007-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
