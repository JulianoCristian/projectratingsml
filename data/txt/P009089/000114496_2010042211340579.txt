Re:
TURKEY: Loan No. 4355-TU
(Basic Education Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Mr. Karaoz,
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Basic Education Project) dated June 25, 1998 
between the Republic of Turkey (the Borrower) and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) as amended with a Letter of Amendment dated 
December 3, 1999.  
We have noticed an inconsistency in Annex to Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement 
for procurement methods for civil works and therefore we recommend paragraph C.1 in 
Section 1 of Annex to Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement to be amended as follows:
“National Competitive Bidding
Works under Part F1 of the Project estimated to cost more than US$500,000 
and less 
than US$5 million per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed 
US$20,000,000 
equivalent may be procured under contracts awarded in 
accordance with  the provisions of 
paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of the 
Guidelines.”
This amendment shall become effective upon your agreement to the foregoing.  
Please confirm your agreement by signing, dating and returning to us the enclosed copy 
of this letter.  A signed duplicate original of the letter is enclosed for your 
records.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
