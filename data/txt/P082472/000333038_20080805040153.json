follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was substantial, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project implementation in a conflict affected environment,\n            requires flexibility in deploying and redeploying staff;\n            good understanding of local social structures; an ability to\n            work with community leaders to ensure access to project\n            sites and security; good capacity to manage and supervise\n            community-based contracting, which, in volatile areas, might\n            be the most appropriate solution and the provision of\n            visible benefits to the population through short lead times,\n            employment creation, and quality infrastructure. Rapid\n            rotation of staff on both the client and the Bank sides\n            increases the need for robust fiduciary systems; and yet it\n            is difficult to attract to the country quality staff that\n            can develop and update such systems. Management expectations\n            need to be realistic. Risk is inherently higher in these\n            contexts, and expectations need to be adjusted in line with\n            what can be reasonably achieved during the initial\n            reconstruction phase."}, "docdt": "2008-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
