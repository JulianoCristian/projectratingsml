                              A. BACKGROUNDAND STRATEGY


 The Conflict,The Transition, And TheEmergency

 1.    Afghanistan is one of the poorest and longest suffering countries among members o f the
 World Bank-ravaged         by chronic conflict and political instability. An estimated 4 to 7 million
people remain vulnerable to hunger with a large number dependent on a massive inflow of food
 and humanitarian aid. Afghanistan's infrastructure has been destroyed or degraded; its human
resource base severely depleted; and its social capital eroded. Despite resilient public
 administrationstructures, majority o f the state institutions are not able to function effectively, and
the economy and society have become fragmented.

2.     The aftermath o f September 11, 2001, precipitated change in the political and military
situation in Afghanistan. The collapse o f the Taliban regime was followed by the conclusion on
December 5, 2001, in Bonn, Germany, o f the Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in
Afghanistan Pending the Re-establishment of Permanent Government Institutions (the Bonn
Agreement)-an        agreement, among the different groups in opposition to the Taliban regime on a
new structure o f government and a process that would lead to the election o f a fully representative
government within a period o f about 30 months.

3.     The Interim Administration peacefully took over central administration on December 22,
2001. After six months an Emergency Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) took place in June 2002.
This Loya Jirga elected a Transitional Administration' that is expectedto pave the way for a new
constitution and an elected, fully representative government within 2 years. This Transitional
Administration has the power to promulgate, repeal, and amend laws and regulations through a
decree.

4.     Despite being hampered by limited capacity and a difficult security situation in many parts
o f the country, the TISA has improved the quality o f governance and decision-making both at the
center and in the provinces. It has gained widespread international recognition and moral
authority. Basic government functions have been restored and international relations re-
established. The TISA has put forward a compelling vision and strategy for national
reconstruction embodied inits National Development Framework (NDF, April 2002).

5.     For about 80 percent o f Afghanistan's population that lives in rural areas, incomes are at
subsistence level due to high pressure2 on cultivable land, cyclical droughts (the last between
1999 and 2002) and destruction o f livelihoods as a result o f prolonged conflict and instability-
many families are effectively below subsistence level. A large number o f families have been
displaced internally or to neighboring countries. As part of the post conflict transition to peace,
large numbers o f people are returning to Afghanistan, putting additional pressure on resources.

' TheTransitional   Islamic State o fAfghanistan (TISA).
 About 75 percent o f Afghanistan's area is uninhabitable, (highly mountainous or desert); 14percent is
suitable for agriculture, and only 4 percent is cultivated inany givenyear (some areas remain fallow while
others are usedfor pasture). Part o f this arable land is innarrow mountain valleys and the rest is inflat
lowlands, mostly inthe country's northand west regions. Water is a limiting factor, so much so that
villages are sometimes defined as those households sharing a water source. A rural population estimated at
about 20 millionpersons (no census has beenundertaken for more than a decade) and a total land area o f
about 650,000 square km, results ina density o f about two persons per hectare o f arable agricultural land.

 Trading, a traditional activity, has been constrained but seems to be reviving. Still, some borders
 may not be crossed easily or at all, and insome places "tolls" are also being exacted. Outside o f a
 few cities, telecommunications and other utility services, taken for granted elsewhere, are almost
nonexistent in Afghanistan. Credit i s rarely available, via mortgages or suppliers' credits,
 implying high interest rates and hardly worth the risk. Inthe absence o f commercial banlung,
 transactions need to be in cash or barter, or through informal money transfer agents (the hawala
 system). Unemployment and underemployment are widespread. While imported grains are
needed, food aid i s reported to be depressing farm prices, and increasing the relative cost o f
 acquiringnonfarm goods by way o f selling crops.

 6.    Poor and deteriorated infrastructure further increases costs to rural populations and i s
retarding recovery o f the rural economy. For many years, public infrastructure has not been
maintained. Irrigation canals have accumulated sedimentation and in many places structures are
in need of repair. These conditions reduce water flows and hence agricultural productivity.
Unpaved provincial and district roads are poorly surfaced and hinder access, even if their total
length o f about 18,000 km may be adequate given the population's concentration in relatively
small areas. Some districts have totally lost direct access to markets and social services. The
3,000 km national paved network, almost circling the high mountains and with spurs to
neighboring countries, also i s in poor condition. These roads permit only low speeds; often a
short trip requires an overnight stay-many     rural areas have lost access to the market economy.
Hence despite long travel distances, non-motorized transport competes with motorized means in
many parts o f rural Afghanistan. War has not only devastated Afghanistan's existing
infrastructurebut also prevented maintenance and new investment from talung place-at         present
infrastructure requirements cover the entire spectrum o f possible interventions, i.e. maintenance,
rehabilitation, backlog reduction, andnewheplacement.

TheEmergencyRemains-The "Fragile"Post-Conflict Times

7.     Seventeen months after the Bonn Agreement, economic activity in Afghanistan i s showing
signs o f a start-up. The economy grew by nearly 10 percent last year. Agricultural production this
year i s projected to grow substantially above a depressed base due to significant rainfall and
snow, after a prolonged drought. Yet despite positive projections, Afghanistan remains among the
poorest countries o f the world-projections     indicate that 2003 GDP per capita would still only
reachUS$175 -US$220.

8.     There is an urgency to ensure that reconstruction and rehabilitation assistance can quickly
restore assets and production, improve livelihoods, and provide real hope for Afghans.
Expectations among the population for a "peace dividend" are high, and results on the ground
need to be deliveredrelatively quickly, otherwise the prospects for further progress and the peace
process will look dim. This in turns require rapid progress inaddressing major bottlenecks-poor
security, weak administrative and institutional capacity, non-existent financial systems, weak
donor coordination-in     order to stimulate economic recovery and growth, and provide holistic
solutions for improving livelihoods o f the vulnerable Afghan population.

9.     Significant progress has been achieved in starting the reconstruction and development
effort. Tangible results, in the past 12-1 8 months, include doubling of school enrollment,
improvements in female enrollment, polio vaccination reaching more than 6 million children,
improvements in water supply and sanitation in Kabul city, modest improvements in access to
small scale infrastructure, and increased food production (though primarily due to this year's
increased precipitation).




                                                   2

 10. But results are still far short o f meeting the enormous needs of the Afghan people.
 Livelihoods continue to be threatened and jobs are needed in the short-run to support the
vulnerable people, in general, and the returning displaced families and ex-combatants in
particular. Social indicators are still disma13--e.g., life expectancy, at 43, i s one o f the lowest in
the world, less than a quarter o f the population has access to safe drinking water, and only a fifth
have adequate sanitation. Physical access to social and economic services has not improved
much. The overall road network i s still only partially usable-and              many rural areas are still
without access to the market economy. Worst o f all, from the point o f view o fthe rejuvenationo f
the nation state, tangible effects o f the reconstruction effort are not visible to the Afghan people.
The government needs to reinforce its role in all parts o f the country and be apparent as the
facilitator o f a positive change.

Cross-Sector Needs And Sector Priorities


Livelihoods and Social Protection

 11. Despite recent improvements in agriculture, employment opportunities in rural areas are
limited. Border crossing restrictions with Iran and Pakistan have reduced opportunities for
Afghan migrant labor. Return o f refugees and internally displaced populations continues to
further stress the labor market. Little opportunity i s being afforded to the reintegration o f ex-
combatants under these circumstances-and             even less to the vulnerable female and disabled
population. The resultingrural to urban migration i s also stressing the cities.

 12. Based on experience inthe past eighteen months, there is a large range o fvulnerabilities4-
both at the individual and household level-including         food insecurity, disease, conscription, asset
stripping, physical assault, arbitrary detention, and forced displacement. Programs targeting
single vulnerabilities (such as food, shelter, etc.) are assessedby the Government as not the most
efficient means to make a timely and wide spread impact. Desperate and irreversible coping
strategiess are still being employed by many Afghans.

13.    Although food shortages are still being experienced in many parts o f Afghanistan, the
overall food security has improved. Field evidence suggests that emergency support to livelihood
reconstruction requires a more holistic approach through methods other than just food aid if
(estimated) 4-5 million vulnerable Afghans are to rebuild their lives and if the government i s to
further secure its reach outside Kabul. Investments are needed inbuilding livelihoods approaches
in multiple relevant sectors, and ensuring proper coordination, monitoring, and evaluation of
these approaches and actions.


Rural Access

14. Roads and airports provide the basis o f physical access in landlocked Afghanistan. The
road network comprises about 6,000 km o f national roads o f which 3,300 km are primary

 These strategies are reflected inthe following trendslinformation gathered during last year's vulnerability
assessment and mapping by WFP: higher land sales and mortgages; small farmers' indebtedness and
reliance on larger land owners; distress sales of household assets, tools, farming equipment, and livestock;
early marriage o fpre-pubescent daughters and indentures o f young boys for labor by families.


                                                      3

highways, including 2,400 km that were originally paved. The national primary road network
consists mainly o f the ring road (Herat - Kandahar - Kabul - Mazaresharif - Shibergan -
Maimana - Herat) and six international links to neighboring countries. The 615 km Shibergan -
Herat section i s only partly constructed and is generally unpaved. The remaining network
comprising o f 2,700 km secondary national roads, and 15,000 km provincial roads, is either
gravel or earthen. The tertiary roadnetwork consists o funpaved village access roads.

 15.   More than two decades o f conflict combined with a prolonged lack o f maintenance has
resulted in damage to long stretches o f roads and to many bridges and other critical structures.
Overall, the road network has been rendered only partially usable, and that too, at a significantly
hightransportation cost. Large sections o ftheroads inthe southandeast o fthe countryhavebeen
lost. Nearly all resources for road construction and maintenance have also been lost.

16.   As a landlocked country and with large mountainous regions, Afghanistan has to rely
significantly on civil aviation for international and domestic passenger movement as well as for
the supply o f emergency goods to the remote communities. The civil aviation infrastructure has
deteriorated extensively during the prolonged conflict. Immediate challenges include removing
major road transport bottlenecks and re-establishing safe civilian air traffic services to facilitate
the access o f the rural communities to social and economic services, and the movement o f
humanitarianaid, returning refugees and trade-related traffic.

Government Response and Strategy for Recovery

17.   The Transitional Government o f Afghanistan has elaborated a clear strategy for the
country's reconstruction through its National Development Framework (NDF), comprising
twelve National Programs (Annex 3). This strategy6recognizes the critical importance o fbuilding
Government institutionsto ensure the success o freconstruction and development efforts.

18.   The Government has emphasized the need to address the root causes of Afghanistan's
serious humanitarianproblems, not just the symptoms, while recognizing the need for continuing
humanitarian assistance in the short run. It has advocated a shift from a humanitarian to a
reconstruction focus, consistent with several related transitions that the government i s seeking,
including: a) from in-kmdcommodity aid to cash assistance (e.g. from food-for-work to cash-for-
work); b) from assistance directly to implementing agencies (outside the Government budget) to
aid that passes through government budget channels; and, c) from assistance that is "sole-
sourced" to specific entities to transparent, competitive contracting. The government has
identified good governance as a priority, recognizing the pivotal role o f governance in
establishing a transparent and accountable government and in enabling private sector
development.

19.   The shift from a humanitarian to a longer-term reconstruction and development focus as
described in the National Development Framework would also enhance government leadership
and open the way for better alignment o f international assistance with the government's
reconstruction strategy and budget. The Government i s using the budget to set priorities,
coordinate donor assistance and to allocate financial resources. It has strengthened processes for
compiling both the recurrent and multi-year development budgets, as well as for budget
execution.



 Information on the Government strategy is derived from the NationalDevelopment Framework and other
Government documents. See http://www.afghanistangov.com

Donor and Program coordination mechanisms inplace

 20.   The Government i s coordinating donor activities through a comprehensive development
 fkamework that i s built upon its budget. Consultative Groups have been formed inKabul for key
 sectors and themes to engage with international assistance partners and to align reconstruction
programs with Afghanistan's development priorities. Based on principles o f country-ownership
 and good governance, with a primary emphasis on the role o f the private sector, the Consultative
 Group process has been well received by the international community. Yet, ensuring that benefits
 are felt in a timely manner by the entire population o f Afghanistan, particularly by the poor and
vulnerable, remains a major challenge.


Livelihoods and Social Protection

21.    Livelihoods and Social Protection (LSP) i s a major theme inthe first pillar o f the NDF. The
Government's LSP Program aims to' "enhance human security and support sustainable rural and
urban livelihoods thereby promoting the elimination o f poverty through enhanced governance".
The Government realizes that in order to support the livelihoods o f poor people it i s necessary to:
a) address a wide range o f sectors (agriculture, health, education, water and sanitation, energy,
transport and communication, natural resource management, human security and safety, etc.); b)
ensure that the benefits o f growth are inclusive to different groups o f women, men, children and
young people, and that economic policy takes full account o f diverse vulnerabilities; c) ensure
that livelihood promotion and social protection are not treated as separate activities; d) coordinate
actions for delivery o f effective, nationally owned, policies and programs; and, e) ensure
involvement o fpublic, private, and civil society organizations.

22.    The primary agencies jointly responsible for delivering the LSP's objectives are the
Ministries o f Finance (MF), Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), Labor and Social
Affairs (MLSA), Women Affairs (MWA), Martyrs and Disabled (MMD), Frontiers and Tribal
Affairs (MFTA), and the National Disaster and Risk Management Authority (NDRMA). These
Ministries havejointly submitted the LSP Public Investment Program (PIP) for SY 1382-1384 as
part o f the National Development Budget (NDB). In addition, the Ministries o f Public Works
(MPW) and o f Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment (MIWRE) are also actively
executingLSP interventions inthe form o f workfare programs.

23.    Within the LSP program, national strategies and policy frameworks are being formulated
inthe following areas in 1382: Targeted Social Protection; Disaster Management; Reintegration
of Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs); National Emergency Employment
Program; Micro-Enterprise Development; Micro-Finance; Promotion o f Pastoralist Livelihoods;
and, Promotion o f Alternative Livelihoods in Poppy Growing Areas'.               Work in these areas i s
planned inthe investment budget through several sub-programs (Annex 4A).

24.    The National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP) i s the main investment for targeted
social protection for vulnerable groups inthe LSP public investment program (Annex 4B). NEEP
i s meant to provide a timely, efficient, self-targeting, and widespread, cash-for-work based social
safety net.    NEEP activities will involve a wide range o f sectors (roads, irrigation, urban
''NDFCode    1.4: Livelihoods and Social Protection Public Investment Program (SY 1382-1384)
  Whilst ruralrecovery programs will promote the development o f alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers
and workers, a coordinated strategy that phases law enforcement interventions together with initiatives
contributing to alternative livelihood promotion will have a more significant impact. Sub-program No. 5 o f
the SY 1382-1384 PIP specifically targets this area.


                                                      5

development, natural resource management, soil conservation, reforestation) and themes
(targeting women and disabled); and include capacity building to ensure effective planning,
delivery, monitoring and evaluation.

25.     Inaddition to NEEP, anumber of other activities will be central to social protection. These
include the protection o f children and young people, continuing development o f the National
Livelihoods Based Surveillance System through capacity building activities at the central and
provincial level, stakeholder consultations on the national vulnerability assessment, winterization
initiatives, food aid targeting, the development o f a national strategy for social protection, and
strengthening o f disaster management coordination.


Rural Access

26.     Rural access infrastructure lends itself well to large-scale workfare programs, and i s
therefore one o f the key sector investment sub-programs under the Government's NEEP. In
addition to its short-term employment benefits, investment in rural access infrastructure creates
assets that will have a lasting poverty reduction impact by improving access o f the rural poor to
economic opportunities and to basic services. These longer-term benefits can be enhanced and
made more sustainable if workfare programs are made an integral part o f a coherent rural access
strategy.

27.     A rural access strategy for Afghanistan has yet to be formalized, but efforts are underway
both under the NEEP (with the adoption o f integrated rural access planning approaches), and
more broadly in the context o f an overall transport sector policy, which the Government i s
preparing, with Bank assistance provided under the Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project
approved by the Board inFY03.

28.     Once the Government has formulated and adopted a vision and strategic plan for transport,
programs o f prioritized actions (policy changes, institutional development and capacity building)
and investments can readily be prepared and initiated. This should be done in an integrated
manner using a common framework for all transport modes and sub-sectors. It will, however,
take time to formulate and build consensus on a new policy framework, modify legislation and
regulations, and reorganize the sector. Meanwhile, existing government structures need to focus
on the implementation o f emergency repairs and rehabilitation work and related maintenance,
while preparing for more fundamental policy and organizational changes appropriate for each
sub-sector.

29.    Inthe short term, a Core Network Repairs and Stabilization strategy has been adopted by
the government to implement fast track projects aiming at removing critical bottlenecks
(collapsed bridges, disintegrated pavements, damaged tunnels, unsafe air traffic operations). This
strategy i s meant to rapidly restore normal traffic operations on key road arteries and inthe air, in
order to facilitate trade, humanitarian aid, reconstruction efforts in all sectors, and economic
integration. The related road works would also generate employment. The rural access program
under the NEEP will play an important part in this strategy, complementing other Government
transport programs focusing on the rehabilitation o f trunk roads, urban streets, civil aviation, and
customs posts.

The National Emergencv Employment Program

30.    During the last few years, various labor-intensive cash-for-work and food-for-work
infrastructure works projects have been implemented by multiple donors and NGOs. While these
interventions have mostly achieved their safety net objectives by creating much-needed
employment, their success in creating lasting infrastructure assets has been more uneven. Insome
cases, the assets created have been o f uneven quality, their delivery not appropriately prioritized,
and contracting and financing mechanisms have not been efficient. The Government i s trying to
build on the experience o f these projects while addressing their shortcomings by developing a
coherent planning, design and implementation framework under the NEEP, and encouraging
donors to channel funds through this framework.


Objectives

31.   The purpose o f the NEEP i s to (a) provide a safety net for vulnerable people by creating
productive employment opportunities, and (b) establish effective mechanisms for developing
infrastructure assets, through labor-based (Annex 5) methods and based on a private sector-led
approach. The Government i s implementing, and will continue to implement, NEEP through all
the concerned sector ministries and by developing replicable models and mechanisms to achieve
NEEP objectives.


Budget Execution

32.   Funding, resource allocation and the implementation o f projects under NEEP will follow
Government execution modalities. A funding mechanism through the national budget will be
established to ensure that funds are allocated in accordance with Government policies related to
social targeting, sector priorities, and geographical distribution. This framework will provide a
focused and transparent mechanismfor donors to contribute financial resources to specific sectors
and program areas that support Government priorities. The budget flowing through this
framework will be gradually expanded over the coming years, in concurrence with the
Government's management capacity. During the initial year, this framework will be mainly used
to correct resource allocation imbalances that result from insufficiently coordinated programs
funded through multiple donor channels.


NEEP Institutional Arrangements

33.   A National Inter-Ministerial Board (NIB)9will oversee the NEEP. The Board will be
chaired by the Minister for Rural Rehabilitation and Development and include representatives o f
other participating Ministers. The Board will be responsible for: (a) directing policy and strategy;
(b) resource allocation and programming; (c) project approval against agreed criteria inline with
national development priorities; (d) establishing appropriate financial modalities; (e) approval o f
the oversight mechanism for effective resource management; and (f) supervision o f the Joint
ProgramManagement Unit (JPMU).

34.   A Joint Program Management Unit, reporting to the inter-ministerial Board, will be
responsible for the daily management o f the Program. Its main roles and functions will be to: (a)
establish and maintain effective coordination systems; (b) manage the programming/resource
allocation mechanisms; (c) develop methods, standards and tools for programming, planning,

 Please refer to Annex 11for a proposed compositionand structure o fNIB.


                                                  7

implementation, and monitoring and evaluation; and (d) help build capacity within the
Government to implement NEEP. Qualified national and intemational agencies (and/or
individuals) will provide support through the Unit in the areas o f social process management,
community mobilization and capacity building, engineering,              contracting and financial
management.


Government's request to the Bank

35.     The Government attaches high priority to the NEEP, and sees the Bank as a key
knowledge and financing partner in the program's implementation. In its public investment
program, the Government has allocated US$53.5m for the NEEP in the current fiscal year (SY
1382).

36.    Out o f this, US$25.4m is funded from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF
NEEP-1Project signed in March 2003)-however,           there is a possibility that some part o f this
NEEP-1 commitment-up          to US$lOm-may     either be delayed or canceled due to paucity o f
funds inthe ARTF. Additional fundinghas beenrequested from IDA under the proposedProject,
which focuses on the rural access sub-sector o f the NEEP. Inparallel, the Government will seek
to interest other donors in supporting employment generation programs in other sectors under the
NEEP. To coordinate the overall program, the Government has also requested IDA to support
capacity building o f the NEEP JPMU. This project i s being prepared in response to these
requests.


                        B. BANK'S RESPONSEAND STRATEGY


37.    The World Bank responded initially to Afghanistan's reconstruction needs through
participation in a Needs Assessment carried out jointly with ADB and UNDP, which has led to a
program o f financial assistance and deepening advisory services. It has supported strategies in
different sectors, particularly through four IDA grants, totaling U S $ lOOm, which were approved
by the Board in FY 2002 for public administration, infrastructure reconstruction, community
driven development, labor intensive public works, and education.

38.    A new TSS for Afghanistan was presented to the Board inMarch2003. The reconstruction
strategy developed by the Government, and embodied in its National Development Framework
(NDF) and national budget, forms the framework for this TSS. The new TSS puts forward
priorities for Bank assistance based on the areas o f comparative advantage o f the Bank and where
other donors are engaged, in line with a Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF)
approach. Under this strategy, which also begins the transition from a short-run emergency
orientationto a longer-term development orientation, the Bank will focus on four areas.

           Improving Livelihoods: employment generation, community development, and the rural
           economy including water resources management.
           Fiscal Strategy, Institutions, Management: budget, role o f Ministry o fFinance, revenue
           and expenditure arrangements, central-local fiscal framework.
           Governance and Public Administration Reform: role o f state, financial transparency,
           good governance o fpublic administration, civil service reform.
           Enabling Private Sector Development: business climate, financial sector, infi-astructure,
           regulation, and trade.


                                                8

 39.   Based on the Government's identified priorities, the TSS includes project assistance to the
 Government in scaling-up the implementationo f the NEEP.

BankSupport to the NEEP

40.    Inlate 2002, the Bank supported a first NEEP initiative by financing labor-intensive road
 sub-projects on a pilot basis. This was funded through a component o f the FY02 IDA Grant for
Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (ECEPWP). The pilot i s
focused on rural road repairs and i s being successfully implemented. IDA supervision missions
have visited sub-project sites in several provinces and found the quality o f works to be good and
the labor selectiodemployment mechanisms to be robust. Some further improvements are being
made based on this early experience, with active support from monthly IDA supervision.
Additional financing for the NEEP, including expansion o f the rural roads program and pilot
labor-based investments in irrigation, was mobilized through the ARTF. Given the successful
startup o f the program, the magnitude o f the financing and capacity support needed to scale it up
to all provinces, and the NEEP's pivotal role in the Government's social protection strategy,
further Bank engagement i s identified as a priority area inthe TSS.

41.    Under the on-going IDA funded ECEPWP's public works component, and the ARTF
financed NEEP-1, US$42.6m o f approved financing i s under execution for the NEEP. It i s
expected that this funding will be entirely committed to sub-projects by August, 2003. In all
likelihood, some part-up     to US$lOm--of      the ARTF financing for NEEP-1 may either be
delayed or cancelled, due to the immense demands on the ARTF funds. To keep the program's
momentum and its credibility in the provinces, and avoid funding gaps which would cause restart
costs and delays, further financing should be programmed now. The proposed Project will
provide this supplementary financing (US$39.2m), and help buildup the overall capacity o f the
NEEP's management unit in planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation for the
program.


Disbursements and impacts to-date

42.   A total o f US$7.91m (46 percent) has been disbursed under the ECEPWP labor-intensive
public works component. The component includes two sub-components, one for secondary roads
executed by MPW with United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) as implementation
partner, and another (multi-sector, but with about 70 percent expected to be spent on rural road
subprojects) executed by MRRD with implementation support provided by CARE and other
NGOs. Implementationo f the MPW subcomponent started inJanuary 2003. Since then, US$3.8m
(out o f US$8.75m available under the component) have been committed to 193 rural road repair
subprojects, now under implementation in 18 provinces. These sub-projects, directly contracted
with communities, have an average completion period o f 3 months, average cost just under
US$20,000, and average labor content o f 70-80 percent. They are expected to generate 1.52
million person-days o f employment, and will repair 2,3 16 km o f rural roads. This i s satisfactory
progress in four months. Disbursements and employment creation under this component are
expected to accelerate substantially, as a batch o f larger sub-projects (average cost of
US$lOO,OOO) contracted competitively to local area contractors and NGOs, are just getting
underway. The US$5m MRRD subcomponent i s also progressing well, with over 75 percent o f
the funds already committed, and completion expectedby August 2003,




                                                 9

43.    Additional grant funding of US$25.4m from the ARTF was committed in March 2003.
This financing    includes US$3.4m for a pilot program of labor intensive repair and rehabilitation
works on irrigation systems, implemented by MIWRE.The main component, for US$22m, will
finance rural road works, to be executed by MPW with UNOPS as Implementation Partner, and
incoordination with MRRD.The contract betweenMPW andUNOPS hasbeensigned, and sub-
projects are expected to start within a month's time. There i s a provision in this contract for
UNOPS to support some limited start-up costs for the NEEP's joint program management unit
(JPMU). The JPMU has already been established and has started working, initially with ILO
assistance.

44.    Projections based on the current rate of progress indicate that the remainder of the
ECEPWP funds available for labor-intensive works will be committed within the next 2 months,
and that the funds available under the ARTF NEEP-1 for rural road sub-projects from the
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) will be fully committed by the end of August
2003. Additional funds are requiredto continue the programbeyond August.

45.    Together, the available IDA and the ARTF funds are projected to provide nearly 8 million
person-days o f labor by undertaking 763 sub-projects that will repair nearly 5,740 km of rural
roads and tracks. The projecteddelivery cost to the government of the NEEP pilot is expected to
be around US$ 1,500-2,500 per labor-year o f employment provided, which compares favorably
with similar programs inother post-conflict countries.


Lessons from Early NEEP Experience

46.    Some areas for improvement have been identified during IDA supervision of the NEEP
component under ECEPWP. More work needs to be done to ensure that wage levels are set
appropriately, primarily to enable self-targeting of vulnerable groups. The system o f project
selection, while being relatively transparent, needs to be strengthened in order to improve
targeting. The program also requires the support of a more rigorous vulnerability assessment".
The entire sub-project labor employment cycle, while assessed as being satisfactory, could be
further improvedby addingdetails inthe project implementationmanualregardinglabor payment
methods and timeliness, safeguarding labor intensity; and, monitoring labor selection and
rotation.

47.    The quality o f works, and the maintenance and rehabilitation strategies in use, need to be
improved to increase the sustainability o f the assets produced. Cross-drainage structures-such
as bridges, culverts, and causeways-are          a key to sustainability o f access improvements. Repair
of these structures i s often not incorporated inthe sub-projects due to their highercosts and lesser
labor intensity. Repairs o f cross-drainage structures should be included in the road repairs sub-
projects to increase sustainability and appropriate labor-based equipment supported technologies
should be applied to achieve, both, highlevels o f labor input and minimumlife cycle costs. The
repaired roads need to be handed over to the accountable administration, and their maintenance
included infuture budgets (providing opportunities for second-round employmentbenefits).




loThe revisionto World FoodProgram (WFP) 2002 Vulnerability Assessment Mapping is underway for
2003. AREU along with WFP, MRRD, and other stakeholders, including the Bank, are providing inputs to
revisioninthe field data collection methodology, to improve the quality o f data collected and for better
assessing the vulnerabilities and risks facing the Afghan society, This revised data collection exercise will
be carried out from August 2003.

48.    A significant share of the road works executed in the pilot stage consists of spot
improvements such as pothole filling, drain repairdreshaping, surface leveling, etc. While such
interventions are highly labor-intensive, low cost, and effective in enabling motor-able access,
the repairs may last only 6-12 months. Over time, and as capacity develops, such repair and
maintenance works should become part of a maintenance program funded from sustainedrevenue
streams, such as user charges collected in a road fund. Under its emerging transport policy
formulation process, the Government has shown interest in designing and building such long-
term institutional arrangements, but it would be unrealistic to expect them to be in place at the
current stage of Afghanistan's reconstruction.

49.    While limiting the sub-projects to roads i s sound, other sectors can be targeted in future for
such works equally effectively. Rural road works allow for relatively fast implementation, and
employ more unskilled labor than most other public works-in              contrast with say building
construction, which would require extensive inputs from artisans and sktlled labor. Based on the
experience gained inECEPWP, it was found more effective to focus the proposed Project on this
sector only. Includingother sectors such as large-scale irrigation programs would have required
substantial preparation time to design effective implementation arrangements and address the
institutional, social and environmental issues specific to these sectors. However, by strengthening
the JPMU, in charge of the overall NEEP, the project will indirectly help build capacity for
similar programs in other sectors. The Government has expressed interest in future IDA
involvement innon-roadprograms of the NEEP, especially inthe irrigation sector.

50.   Other lessons from IDA'S early experience with NEEP include the need for targeted
employment opportunities for women and disabled in the sub-projects; and a need to strengthen
monitoring and evaluation, including through an improved MIS. These lessons are incorporated
inthe proposedProject, inparticularthrougharevisedProjectImplementationManual.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

51, The government considers the Bank to be a key partner through provision of advice based
on it's global experience of social funds and post-conflict reconstruction, and through finance to
support its livelihoods and social protectionprograms.

52.   Through its involvement inECEPWP, the Bank has already gained operational experience
indevelopingmechanisms to deliver such a social protection program inAfghanistan, whichhas
been incorporated into the design of this project. The Bank, together with the European
Commission, i s also the focal point nominatedby the government for the Consultative Group on
Livelihoods and Social Protection program, which i s chaired by the MRRD.(Annex 6 provides
details about the CDF basedConsultative Groups structure.)

53.   The Bank has substantial experience o f similar emergency social protectionprograms using
labor-intensive public works in other post conflict countries (among others East Timor, Bosnia-
Herzegovina, West Bank and Gaza), and in the monitoring and evaluation of Active Labor
Market Programs (ALMP).

54.   The proposed project is in line with the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) presented in
March 2003 to the Executive Directors. The TSS highlightsImproving Livelihoods as one of four
pillars o f Bank assistanceto Afghanistan.

Objectives

55.    The proposed National Emergency Employment Program for Rural Access (NEEPRA)
project aims to assist the Government in providing targeted social protection, and in the
improvement o f key rural access infrastructure, for improving livelihoods o f the rural poor in
Afghanistan through: (i) provision o f emergency short-term employment opportunities for the
                            the
poor on labor-based rural access infrastructure improvement subprojects; and, (ii)             technical
assistance for the implementation o f NEEP. A secondary objective o f the project i s to repair key
rural access infrastructure and assist the Government inmobilizing donor support for its National
Emergency Employment Program. The project will achieve this objective through labor-based
rural access infrastructure subprojects, and technical assistance to the NEEP.


Project Performance Indicators

56.    To track project performance, a set of indicators havebeen identified duringappraisal. Key
indicators include days o f employment provided; total cost per labor-year o f employment
provided; km o f roads repaired; number and length o fbridges and culverts repaired; and, amount
of incremental nonBank funds channeled through NEEP. A detailed list o f indicators i s provided
inAnnex 7.

57.    The Credit portion will finance the reconstruction o f secondary rural access
infrastructure-primarily     bridges. The Grant will finance the rehabilitation o f tertiary rural access
infrastructure and technical assistance to the Government for implementing the NEEP. The
Project is expected to create a minimumo f 6,000,000 unskilled labor days o f employment, and to
rehabilitate a minimumo f 2,000 kmo f ruralroads and 2,300 mo fbridges.


The Project:NationalEmergencyEmploymentProgramfor RuralAccess (NEEPRA)

58.      The project development objective will be achieved by: a) the creation o f productive,
self-targeting, emergency employment opportunities in maintenance and rehabilitation o f the
rural access infrastructure, b) using appropriate labor-intensive methods in order to ensure high
labor content o f the works to be financed, yet at the same time trying to improve the quality and
extend the life o f the infrastructure produced; and c) buildingcapacity o f JPMU to implement and
manage the NEEP.

59.    The Government wishes to allocate the Credit and Grant proceeds distinctly-while
recognizing that in principle funds are fungible-to       ensure that Credit proceeds target more
sustainable infrastructure rehabilitationheconstruction and that the Grant proceeds are targeted
towards achieving greater direct social impact. Therefore the entire Credit portion o f the Project
financing will be spent on reconstructiodrehabilitation o f larger, more sustainable secondary/
primary rural access infrastructure-primarily    bridges. While the Grant will fund components o f
the project with immediate/direct social impact, i.e., more labor intensive works, and technical
assistance.




                                                  12

 60.    The project will comprise two components: A) labor-based rural access sub-projects; and,
B) technical assistance to support the Government's overall National Emergency Employment
Program (NEEP).


 Component A: Labor-basedRuralAccess Infrastructure(LJS$34.2m)

 61. This component will finance sub-projects for labor-based maintenance and rehabilitationo f
rural access infrastructure-primarily        secondary and tertiary roads, bridges and other cross-
drainage infrastructure associated with these roads. These sub-projects will be spread over all
provinces.


Sub-componentA (I):Sub-projects Grants for tertian rural access infrastructure (US$13.8m)

62.    This sub-component will finance sub-project grants (US$11.Om) for maintenance and
rehabilitation o f tertiary access infrastructure, and will be implemented by MRRD. This sub-
component will also finance consulting services, training and audit, equipment and goods, and
incremental operating costs to implement the sub-projects.


Sub-componentA (2): Sub-projects Grants for secondaw rural access infrastructure (US$20.4m)

63,    This sub-component will finance sub-project grants (US$15.3m) for secondary rural access
infrastructure in all provinces and will be implemented by MPW. This sub-component will also
finance consulting services, training and audit, equipment and goods, and incremental operating
costs to implement the sub-projects. As part o f the goods, this component will also finance
provision and erection o f removable bridges (approximately US$l.3m)-these               will be used for
restoration o f rural access at critical locations where, e.g., the expected construction costs (and
project durations) for permanent bridge structures are beyond the scope o f this project.               A
preliminary list o f proposed bridges received from Ministry o f Public Works i s attached in
Annex-9.

Component B: TechnicalAssistancefor theNEEP(LJS$S.Om)

64.    The TA component will finance technical assistance services, studies, surveys, training and
audit, incremental operating costs, goods and works to establish and strengthen the NEEP's
JPMUand its provincial structures.

65.    The project will finance a NEEP Coordinator who will manage the JPMU, and will be
assisted by a team o f international and national specialists. The team will be comprised o f
specialists on (i)Social Protection and Gender; (ii)          Planning, Monitoring & Evaluation; (iii)
Roads/Transport Engineering and Contracts Management; (iv) Irrigation and Environmental
Engineering; (v) Management Information Systems; and (vi) Training. In addition to the
international TA, national consultant staff will be recruited under the project in the fields o f
Management Information Systems (2 staff) and training (1 staff). Government counterpart staff
will be assigned by the participating line ministries. Preliminary TOR o f the key Specialists" are


''These  TOR are not as per the final agreed skills midjob-descriptions contained inthe text here. These
are indicative TOR that will be consolidated and finalized into the seven TOR required for the NEEP
JPMUspecialists-including     the JPMU Coordinator.

 attached in Annex 10. These TOR will be finalized with the Government before their final
 procurement.

 66.   The Project TA will assist in the establishment o f provincial support structures for
 implementation o f the NEEP. At the provincial level, MRRD will assign Provincial NEEP
 Coordinators (PNCs) who will be responsible for the coordination and monitoring o f NEEP
 activities in the provinces. Advisors (national) to the PNCs will be recruited under the Project,
 with each advisor coveringfour provinces (eight intotal).

 67.   The TA will also assist the JPMU in the identification, design and implementation o f
 surveys and studies that will be requiredto further develop the NEEP strategy and its operational
procedures and guidelines. Studies and surveys being considered for fundingunder Component B
of the Project include (i)studies to determine appropriate wage rate levels; (ii)   transport studies
for planning and assessment o f the impacts o f interventions under NEEP; (iii)studies to
determine appropriate labor productivity norms; (iv) inventories o f the rural roads network and
the irrigation infrastructure and their condition; (v) studies o f livelihoods strategies and coping
mechanisms o f pastoralists, to enable a more effective targeting o f this vulnerable group under
NEEP; (vi) monitoring and evaluation surveys to assess the effectiveness o f the NEEP strategies
and operational procedures and to provide an input in further refining and modifying them; (vii)
development o f an integrated rural access planning approach for Afghanistan; and (viii)
translation o f key labor-based techniques and IRAP into local languages and their introduction
into the curriculum o f technical universities inAfghanistan.




 D. INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTSAND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION


68.    The project will be implemented over a 39 month period, with the expectation o f faster
implementation in most provinces. Two ministries will lead the implementation o f this project:
MRRDandMPW.

ComponentA: Labor-basedRuralAccess Infrastructure(US$34.2m)


Sub-component A (I):Sub-uroiects Grants-for tertiary rural access infrastructure (US$l3.8ml

69.    This sub-component will be implementedbythe MRRD.MRRDwill utilize the services of
an implementation consultant, ina manner similar to the arrangement between MPW and UNOPS
for implementation o f the labor-based roads repair component o f the existing ECEPW project. In
this arrangement, the implementation consultant (to be contracted by MRRD)will facilitate sub-
project identification, carry out surveys, bid out works and make payments to communities and
small contractors. The implementation consultant will work in close collaboration with the staff
o f MRRDat the central, provincial, and local levels.

70.    The overall allocations to the provinces will be decided by the NEEP's Board, after detailed
consultations based on poverty and vulnerability, population, security, accessibility, and other
relevant parameters. Once the allocation per province has been decided, the sub-projects will be
identified through a consultative mechanism involving the MRRD, the JPMU, the Provincial and
District Administration, and communities-but       always with basic consideration to the fact that
the selected sub-project should target the poorest and most vulnerable areas, should provide



                                                 14

 employment/labor opportunities to communities in the vicinity o f the sub-project, and should
 maximize economic and social returns to the target communities.

 71.   For selecting the implementation consultant (IC) for this component, MRRD will invite
proposals from two or more UNAgencies'* involved in such operation services in Afghanistan,
 and select the Agency that can effectively and rapidly scale up its operations in Afghanistan in
 order to ensure that sub-projects implementation i s not delayed and employment benefits can
reach the poor inthe shortest possible time. An additional selection criteria will be the quality o f
the UN Agency's team in terms o f its ability to maximize the delivery o f employment benefits
without compromising the quality/sustainability o f the infrastructure repaired. Based on the
assessment of the appraisal mission, it i s most likely that UNOPS and the International
Organization for Migration (IOM) will be the two Agencies requestedto submit proposals for this
assignment.


Sub-comuonent A (2): Sub-proiects Grants for secondagi rural access infrastructure KJS$20,4m)

72.    This sub-component will be implementedby the MPW. MPW will utilize the services o f an
implementation consultant as described above for sub-component A(1). M P W has proposed
continuingwith UNOPS for implementing the proposedproject.

73.    The experience with UNOPS to date, under the existing ECEPW project, has been
satisfactory. Prior to having started disbursements to UNOPS, IDA reviewed and provided no
objection to the use o f the operating guidelines and procedures o fUNOPS (including for financial
management and disbursements), for activities executed by them. This arrangement addresses the
disbursement bottlenecks related to the nascent banking services in Afghanistan. Direct payments
to UNOPS allows expedient and timely disbursements and project payments to contractors.
UNOPS has been working well with MPW and has carried out extensive training o f M P W
counterpart staff. One o f its achievements to date under the ECEPW project has been to revive
the Design Unit in MPW. Counterpart MPW Engineers are carrying out surveys and preparing
designs for most o f the larger labor-based public works. UNOPS engineers work closely with
their MPW counterparts, both inthe center and inthe provinces.

74.    The overall allocations to the provinces and the selection o f sub-projects will be decided on
the basis o f the Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning (RAP) technique (Annex S), or a similar
technique, by the NEEP EMU.The final decision on the sub-projects to be undertaken will be
taken by the NEEP National Inter-ministerial Board, the Provincial and District Administrations,
and will incorporate results o f prior community consultations.

ComponentB:TechnicalAssistancefor the NEEP(US%S.Om)

75.    To provide an effective framework for coordination and decision-making, an Inter-
ministerial Board (the NIB)has been established and i s awaiting cabinet endorsement. The Board
i s expected to be the Govemment's mandated body for policy development and decision-making
for the NEEP. The Joint Program Management Unit will be responsible for the day-to-day
management o f NEEP. At the Provincial level, Govemment-led Technical Support Units(TSUs)




12 The reason for solicitingproposals only from UNAgencies is that the Bank can make direct payments to
UNAgency Accounts at the requestofthe Government. This ensuresrelatively smooth delivery offunds
for employment creation o n the sub-projects.

will coordinate and supervise the implementation o f the infrastructure works. Annex 11 (Draft
NEEP Strategy 2003) presents the proposedinstitutionalframework for NEEP.

76.    The National Inter-ministerialBoard will be chaired by the Minister o f Rural Rehabilitation
and Development and will include representatives o f other relevant Mini~tries'~.Key donors and
UN agencies will be invited to the bi-monthly Board meetings as observers. The specific
responsibilitiesandauthorities o f the Board will be:
       0   Providing policy and strategy direction;
       0   Allocating and programming resources;

       0   Establishingappropriate financial modalities;
       0   Approving the oversight mechanism for resource management;
       0   Supervisingthe Joint ProgramManagement Unit.

77.    The Joint Program Management Unit (JPMU), anchored at MRRD,will be responsible for
the day-to-day management o f NEEP, including the proposed project (NEEPRA). Key line
Ministries represented in the Board will be invited to have a representation in the JPMU. With
support from partners, the JPMU will establish, develop and manage the Program. Main roles and
functions o f the JPMU will be to:
       0   Establishand maintain coordination systems;
       0   Manage the programmingand resource allocationmechanisms;
       0   Buildcapacity withinthe Government to implementNEEP;
       0   Develop strategic options for future programs;
       0   Report to the Inter-ministerial Board; and
       0   Develop methods, standards and systems for:

           o Planning;
           o Implementation;
           o Monitoring; and,
           o Evaluation.

78.    The JPMU will be staffed by government employees and by technical assistance
contractors in the fields o f process management, community mobilization, capacity building,
physical planning, designing, cost-estimation, supervision and monitoring o f the physical
infkastructure works.

79.    At the Provincial level, Technical Support Units (TSU) will be established to oversee
implementation of the labor-based infrastructure development projects. The TSUs will be
composed o f the Provincial Directors o f the line ministries that are represented inthe JPMU, the
representatives of the Provincial Governors, and staff of key implementing consultants. The TSUs
will be responsible for supervising the implementation o f NEEP projects. Specific roles and
functions o f the TSUs will be to oversee:

targeting mechanism will be wage rate-within        reasonable limits. The wage rate will be based on
prevailing wage rates for unskilled agricultural labor during the agricultural slack season, to
promote self-targeting to the most needy. This will be coupled with other strategies to incorporate
women and the disabled where possible. Based on these approaches, the project i s expected to
have a satisfactory level o f social targeting.

83.    However, social targeting will need to continuously improve during the course o f
implementation. A number o f resource allocation and targeting issues are presented in the
following paragraphs. These issues will be monitored during implementation and may lead to
changes inimplementationmechanisms as required.

84.    Although various vulnerability assessments have been conducted in Afghanistan,
uncertainty remains about their accuracy. These assessments predominantly focused on food
security aspects o f vulnerability and left out important other aspects. For example, the adaptation
o f livelihood strategies in the present unsettled situation i s not reflected in the existing
vulnerability analysis nor is coherent information available about actual needs and preferences o f
the targeted vulnerable groups. The lack o f accurate and complete information, and o f an
effective targeting strategy, are constraints to the effectiveness o f the present social protection
interventions.


Vulnerability Assessment

85.    A precondition for an effective social targeting strategy i s a database that provides the
information required. Comprehensive vulnerability assessments are expected to be undertaken on
a yearly basis within the framework o f the recently established National Livelihoods and Social
Protection Surveillance System. Through these assessments, information on key indicators o f
vulnerability will be collected. This includes quantitative indicators o f accessibility to
infrastructure facilities, services and assets. To the extent that this information becomes available,
it will form the basis for the programming and resource allocation, in combination with data on
the geographical distribution o f the population in general and o f the targeted vulnerable groups in
particular.


ResourceAllocation

86.    To avoid inequity in resource allocation, projects under NEEP will be initially targeted to
those areas that are not yet served by other major programs (such as the National Solidarity
Program which provides block grants and technical support to communities, and the National
Area-Based Development Program). To ensure an equitable distribution o f NEEP's available
resources among the targeted beneficiaries, specific resource allocating formulae will be used.
The data on food-insecure population, district-wise and province-wise, available with the World
Food Program (WFP), will be assessed for integrity and used as a proxy tool to estimate
vulnerable populations by province and to help determine NEEP allocations by province. Subject
to the availability o f data, similar formulae would be used for resource allocation within the
districts o f a province.

87.    To ensure an appropriate balance between NEEP's social objective and its infrastructure
development objective, it i s envisaged that on average at least 60% o f NEEP's investment
resources per province should be allocated for the payment o f wages.




                                                   18

Equal Opportunity andAccess to Jobs

88.   Core principles in developing effective social targeting mechanisms relate to the principles
o f equal opportunity and access to work, and equal pay for work o f equal value. These principles
have to be translated into practical guidelines that especially target the most vulnerable people.
These include the disabled and handicapped, returnees, IDPs, pastoralists, female-headed
households, the elderly and destitute women. Women are also often excluded from public labor-
based projects because o f religious and traditional norms and values (refer to Annex 13). To
promote the participation o f these groups inNEEP projects, the followingmeasures are proposed.


      0    There will be national-level resource allocations o f NEEP's budget for wages to
          vulnerable groups. The proposed allocations reflect currently available data on the
           composition o f the most vulnerable groups:
            o   510% to vulnerable disabled men and women who can participate inthe works;
            o   5% to vulnerable disabled men and women who cannot participate inthe works;
            o   5% to vulnerable pastoralists;
            o   5% to vulnerable returnees;
            o   510% to destitute women and other vulnerable female-headed households;
            o   65-75% to vulnerable able-bodied men and women, including ex-combatants.

          These are minimums rather than absolute targets. These minimums may be modified
          basedon analysis o f vulnerability data being collected.


      0   To promote participation o f women and disabled under NEEP, at least 20 percent o f
          funds at the district level may be earmarked for activities involving exclusively women
          and disabled people. Some examples o f activities where women and certain groups o f
          disabled can participate, are:
            o   Routine maintenance o f tertiary and secondary roads;
            o   Preparing dressed stones for road paving within a confined compound in the
                village;
            o   Weaving gabion mattresses for gabion boxes within a confined compound inthe
                village;
            o   Supervision o f the labor gangs;
            o   AssistingGovernment staffwith surveys and measurements;
            o   Keeping attendance registers and muster rolls o f the labor-force;
            o   Storekeeping for construction materials and tools;
            o   Managing tree nurseries that supply seedlings for forestation or soil conservation
                activities; and
            o   Plantationand care-taking o f seedlings.

89.   Equal opportunity in access to jobs can only be achieved if the targeted population i s well
informed about the possibilities and conditions o f employment, highlighting the need for an
information & communication campaign.

90.   Transparency in recruitment procedures i s expected to reflect the principle o f equal
opportunities in access. If there are more job seekers than jobs, a monthly job rotation can be
applied.




                                                19

Timing, Scale and Location of Activities

91.   Proper timing and scaling o f activities are important considerations inrelation to the social
targeting objective o f NEEP. The Program should not compete with other demands for casual
labor. During the agricultural peak season, ministries and their implementation consultants will
have to assess the local situation o f labor supply vis-&vis requirements. If necessary, operations
should be scaled down duringthis period or even be suspended.

92.   Works are to be located in the vicinity o f the areas where the targeted population lives, in
order not to increase the suffering o f vulnerable populations. Experience indicates that works
should be locatedwithin a radius o f 5-8 kilometers from the targeted community.


 WageRates and Payments

93.   Wage rates and payment modalities constitute important social targeting instruments. Ifthe
wage rates are set too high, the social targeting objective would not be achieved (refer to Annex
13). High wage rates lead to excess demand for employment opportunity and this leads to
rationing. Rationing i s problematic as it can lead to unfair practices. If the rates are set too low,
productivities may decrease and the Program may not achieve sufficient infrastructure
rehabilitation. Wage rates will be set and paid in accordance with the following conditions.

      0    Inrelationto measurableproductiveoutput.
      0    M e n and women shouldreceive equal pay for work o f equal value.
      0    Wage rates will be set at the provincial level and will be based on prevailing wage rates
           for unskilled agricultural labor during the agricultural slack season-a         maximum
          national "cap" will also be agreed for the project.
      0    The preferred payment modality o f wages i s cash. Where food and cash resources are
           available, at least 50% o f the daily wages shall be paid in cash. Overall it shall be
           ensured that the total package (cash plus food) i s equivalent to the established
           minimumwage rate for the sub-project area.
      0   Wages shall be paid on time and in full. The preferred frequency o f payments i s bi-
           monthly.

94.   NEEP projects should not be implemented (at a minimum they should be significantly
scaled down) where, or when, daily wage rates for unskilled labor are significantly higher than
the set daily wage.

95.   Mixed, or complete, Food-For-Work schemes will be limited to areas with acute food
insecurity. The location and timing of construction activities under such schemes should reflect
the seasonal variation in food insecurity. In the identification o f projects, preference would be
given to those that can absorb large numbers o f targeted people, without inducing undesired
migration to the worksites.

96.   The NEEPPMU,as part o f its donor and resources coordination activities, will ensure that
wage rates across sub-projects financed by various sponsoring agencies are kept consistent to
minimize distortions. A general consensus needs to be developed over the wage rate in workfare
programs inAfghanistan.




                                                 20

Labor Productivity

97.    To ensure that men and women receive equal pay for work o f equal value, payments need
to be linked to established labor-productivities. This will also improve transparency and increase
productivity. The advantage o f a remuneration system based on productivity, over one that i s
based on daily wage payment i s that it ensures cost predictability, minimizes supervision,
maximizes productivity and maximizes income and flexibility for workers. Pending the outcome
o f a planned labor productivity survey, the labor productivity norms as applied by the
Government/UNOPS will be the reference standard.


Infrastructure Development Issues

Sustainability

98.   As mentioned earlier in this Technical Annex, the project is an employment creation and
asset restoratiodmaintenance project. It i s not the right instrument to address broader, long-term,
sustainability issues in the sector o f rural access infrastructure. Within these limitations, the
project will endeavor to improve sustainability o f its interventions. Part o f the Technical
Assistance will include development and implementation o f a management information system
(MIS). A part o f this M I S could eventually be developed into a road network management and
maintenance planning tool.

99.   The project will introduce other operational measures that may later become part o f a
sustainability strategy for the sector o f rural access infrastructure. Examples include storing
maintenance capacity by stockpiling and storing broken stones for use in post-project
maintenance or spot rehabilitation works, and other innovations inmaintenance methods.

100. A number o f constraints hamper the development o f the country's rural infrastructure. The
Technical Assistance Component o f the project will support the government in implementing the
followingmeasures to address these constraints.

Project Scope

 101. As discussed earlier inthis Technical Annex, the scope o f sub-projects (physical works) to
be implemented under this project (NEEPRA) i s limited to physical rural access infrastructure.
However, the NEEPRA i s also supporting, through the TA component, development o f
management capacity for the overall NEEP delivery mechanism. Other sectors included in the
NEEP include labor-based rehabilitation o f small and medium scale irrigation systems, labor-
based forestry, etc.


Project Performance Indicators

102. These will be developed early on during project implementation and agreed with the
Government and its implementationpartners. The Project's performance will be monitored using
specific indicators such as: number o f unslulled labor-days o f employment created; kilometers o f
roads repaired; length of bridges, culverts and causeways repaired; and amount o f incremental
non-World Bank funds channeled through the NEEP. Key indicators initially agreed during
appraisal are presentedinAnnex 7. An outline o fproposed M&Earrangements i s presentedinthe
section on Monitoringand Evaluation.




                   E. FINANCIALAND ECONOMICJUSTIFICATION


Project Rationale

103. Many destitute families needpaid employment as assets have depleted. Labor-based works
under this project are expected to provide employment opportunities (thereby high social returns
inthe short run)andbetter accessibility to remote districts (thereby economic progress inthe long
run).Since the project will create safety nets to reduce incomevulnerability, andwill rehabilitate
infrastructure, the Project has strong economic merit.




                                                 22

InfrastructureBenefits


Roads

 104.    While detailed cost benefit calculations have not been carried out as part o f this
emergency project preparation, international experience has shown that maintenance and
rehabilitation o f rural roads and cross-drainage structures have a very high rate o f return. The
component for secondary rural access infrastructure (US$20.4m for MPW) will primarily focus
on removal o f key access bottlenecks. These will primarily be the repair and restoration o f
bridges, causeways, and culverts-all     with minimum 10 to 20 year initial service life-and          thus
will provide highlife-cycle returns despite the risk o flow routine maintenance inthe future.

 105. Improved accessibility will help integrate the village economy with the regional and
national markets. It will also lead to better allocation o f resources, technology transfer and
realization o f higher productivity and outputs. It may also facilitate expansion o f rural non-farm
activities. Diversification o f household income sources will minimize the household vulnerability
risks.


outputs

106. It i s expected that 2,000 km of roads and 2,30014 m o f bridges (cross-drainage structures)
will be rehabilitated under thisproject.

107. A specific priority will be to improve radial access between provincial and district centers,
and from district centers to main villages. The distance between villages can be as little as 5 km
or as much as 20 or more km, especially in mountainous areas. Some villages have only 20 or so
compound houses, or many more compounds, often in several sub-clusters. Only local roads
serving significant populations will be eligible for fundingunder the program. In some instances,
tracks may be upgraded; in others roads requiring rehabilitation after years o f neglected
maintenance-although      light traffic and drought have somewhat contained deterioration. District
roads built to 4 mwide plus shoulders should suffice where traffic i s light-lsewhere        7 mwidths
may be justified. Even though motorized traffic i s currently low, motorcycle and pickup traffic i s
expected to increase as soon as roads are passable, especially if water becomes more available
and agricultural productionincreases.

108. Main district roads should also have good surface conditions for non-motorized transport,
such as carts, bicycles, and pedestrians. Sealing would be desirable; it may be required on slopes
or be justified to protect a fine granular surface topping. Given the harsh climate, the expected
low maintenance requirements, and the closeness o f Iran (from where asphalt products can be
supplied at low costs), surface sealing i s expected to cost much less than incountries further away
from supplies. However, sealing will also depend on funding availability, and the option will
have to be evaluated in each case, based on each road's individual merits. It i s estimated that
upgrading 1 km of gravel road, 4 m wide, would require some 4,000 unslulled labor-days, and
cost about US$12,000 equivalent, or more than US$20,000 ifa bitumen seal coat i s applied.

(average based onvarious degrees ofrehabilitation and reconstruction-as these vary from site to site).


                                                  23

EmploymentBenefits

 109. The needy and vulnerable districts will be selected through a consultative process. There is
little risk o f geographic mis-targeting, as most areas are in need. The wages to be offered are
expected to serve as a self-targeting instrument for the poorest. However, because job rationing
i s likely as a result o f the large number o f very poor people, institutional mechanisms are
proposed under the project to ensure that priority i s given to the most vulnerable. Options for
women to participate in the work-force will be promoted, such as production o f building
materials from the home or other socially acceptable locations. A review o f the wage level
switching point will be made as part o f the project.

110. Assuming that labor costs represent on average 45 percent o f subproject costs, US$26.6m
in district sub-project grants would provide at least 6.0 million unskilled labor-days, plus
employment for Afghan engineers and other skilled workers. If there are 2 million rural
households in Afghanistan, and one person from each household i s eligible to work, excess up-
front demand for employment opportunities should be expected even as other programs operate.
The wage i s expected to vary from US$1.50 to US$2 equivalent per day, because o f regional
variations in the labor market. Limitingthe number o f labor-days o f individual households may
be necessary, as demand for employment opportunities i s likely to exceed the project's capacity.
Rationing and sequencing may thus be required.

111. Looking into the future, after a decade o f equitable growth, labor-based public
infrastructure projects may be less justified than in the current circumstances. Better wages may
be forthcoming from agriculture or other private sector activities. But this i s not foreseen in the
short to medium term. For some years to come, excess demand for employment opportunities by
unskilled laborers is expected to persist. Project monitoring and evaluation will include a review
o f costs and benefits to define prospects o f future programs. Employment-based development that
leads to increased access will be a catalyst for economic and social progress.

Risks andProject Alternatives

112. The project builds on IDA experience inAfghanistan with different ministries and agencies
including MPW, MRRD, UN Agencies, and NGOs. Nevertheless, the project carries significant
risks o f misallocations or inefficient use o f funds given the dispersed nature o f activities and the
limited amount o f central government control over certain areas. Another risk i s that equipment in
support o f the labor may be unavailable within the short lead and implementation times dictated
by employment objectives. Despite the risks, the project design is preferredto other alternatives
given the importance o f the employment objectives. The other alternatives considered during
project design include:

       (i)Apossiblealternativetolabor-basedworkscouldbewelfarepayments-cashtransfers
           without the infrastructure benefits. These have the advantages that all funds would go
           to needy families; that no energy would be spent on working on public schemes which
           necessitate more food intake; and that organizational requirements are lower under a
           subsidy distribution system. However, international experiences show that leakages
           related to targeting errors under welfare payments tend to be higher, resulting in high
           transfer costs. Further, welfare payments erode pride and lessen morale.

       (ii)Foodforworkisnotanattractivealternativebecauseofagriculturedistortionsthatthe
           approach creates. Monetizing food aid would be preferable. Moreover, the logistic cost
           o f food aid tends to be high, more than that o f labor-intensive works on a cashpayment


                                                   24

            basis, and i s even higher when including the costs o f transporting food from remote
            international locations. Food aid would be justified in areas where crops have failed
            due to drought, are not in excess o f the amounts that normally would have been
            harvested, or to areas o f absolute food shortage where production prices would not be
            depressed by the aid.

113. A summary o f other risks i s highlightedhere.

114. The security situation could deteriorate (either throughout the country or in parts of the
country) - This i s outside the scope o f the project design. However, the project's modular design
will allow the project to cease activities inone or more unstable areas without stopping work in
areas where there are no or few security risks.

115. Intervention by local warlords could divert funds from their intended uses - The project
design includes a series o f socialization workshops with Government inthe center, provinces, and
in the districts, and with local leaders and beneficiary representatives. A key message of these
workshops will be that the project includes a policy stipulating that failure to justify the use o f
funds ina transparent way will leadto the immediate withdrawal o fthe project from that area.

116. Use of project funds in poppy cultivation - The project, by design will not attempt to
compete for employment provision in poppy cultivating areas. The project will also seek
assurance that participating communities do not engage in poppy cultivation. Project funding
would be terminated for districts and communities which do not comply with these arrangements.

117. Corruption - For the sub-projects, corruption controls are expected to function through
public participation and transparency, by linkingdisbursements to outputs, and by utilizing UN
agencies as implementation consultants. Control over corruption for the labor-based works
schemes will be through engineers o f the implementation consultants and by independent
monitoring by consultants.

118. The Government's ability to disburse project funds - Due to systemic issues and limited
capacity in the government institutions (line ministries, ministry o f finance, and D a Afghanistan
Bank), there have been delays in govemmental payments to contractors, consultants, and
suppliers. The Bank and the Government are agreeing actions to remedy the situation. Inthe case
o f this project, this risk will be mitigatedby making direct payments to implementingconsultants,
who in turn will use their existing systems for transferring funds to the provincial and district
levels, which to date have worked effectively.

119. Capacity for accounting for and reporting on project funds - For the past one year,
reporting on the use o f project funds has been insufficient. IDA i s supporting a number o f
initiatives to improve project accounting and reporting to donors. However, for the proposed
project, as disbursements will be made directly to the UN Agencies, govemed by their contract
provisions and the requirements o f the Blanket Withdrawal application, reporting to the World
Bank and to the implementing agencies i s expected to be timely and appropriate.

120. Project auditing - An existing IDA-financed project (the Emergency Public Administration
Project  - EPAP)     i s providing technical assistance to the Auditor General's office for auditing
project accounts according to acceptable audit standards.

ComplementaryPrograms

 121. Other complementary projects under the Government's NEEP are: Employment Generation
Infrastructure Project (SIDA, EO); Labor Intensive Infrastructure Development (EC-CARE);
Community Based Irrigation (ADB-MRRD); and, Rebuilding Afghan Markets Program
(USAID).

122. Various National Road Rehabilitation Projects are proposed for priority areas of the 3,000
kmpavedroadnetwork. Theprojects will bemore equipment-intensive.

123. Various village development projects are being implemented by other agencies, including
food for work and opium eradication programs. Villagers who have obtained funds from these
programs will not have priority for employment underthis project.

MonitoringandEvaluation

124. The NEEP JPMU will monitor the various subprojects, and physical outputs will be closely
compared to financial results. The Technical Assistance component of this project aims to
develop M&Esystems for the overall Government's NEEP includingthe on-going IDA-financed
project and the proposed NEEPRA project.

125. Sanctions are expected to be applied wherever monitors, supervisors, or other reviewers
find a lack of transparent information. Engineers involved in corruption will be fired and
subproject funding will be discontinued. The Project will also seek assurances that participating
communities do not engage in poppy cultivation. Project funding would be terminated for
communities which do not comply with these agreements. The people working on these
subprojects will be aware of these sanctions as they will be a part of the information campaign
that will precede the commencement of work.

126. Under NEEPRA, an ex-post review of sample projects will be carried out 6-9 months after
sub-projects implementationhas started.

127. Evaluation will be done by an independent organization mutually agreed between the
Government and the Bank during the project. Annual evaluations will provide data on outputs
and on processes, and will help inmaking design modifications wherever necessary.

128. Quarterly financial monitoring reports will be produced showing: (i)    sources and uses o f
funds by disbursement category and project component; (ii)   physical progress; and (iii) of
                                                                                        status
procurement activities. These will be submitted to the Association within 45 days o f the end of
the quarter.

129. A quarterly progress report will be prepared and submitted to IDA that consolidates
progress on activities, as further detailed in the Project's procurement plan and detailed
monitoring indicators. Responsibility for this reporting rests with the AACA, with MMRD and
MPW providing requisite inputs.

                  F. ENVIRONMENTALAND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS

130. This project falls under an Environmental Category B (partial assessment). The principles
governing social and environmental management will be applied through an Environmental and
Social Safeguards Framework (the Framework) which i s attached inAnnex 14.The Framework i s
applicable to all activities financed by the proposed Project, and includes (i) policy principles
                                                                              key
for social and environmental management, (ii)      tools to guide the screening o f subprojects for
significant social and environmental impacts, and to assist in the mitigation o f such impacts, (iii)
procedures to ensure that these principles and tools are appropriately applied, and (iv) guidelines
and an action plan for capacity building and monitoring. The Framework will be operationalzed
through the proposed Project's arrangements for implementation, capacity building and
monitoring.

131. The relevant safeguards for this project are Environmental Assessment (OP4.01),
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP4.12), Indigenous Peoples (OD4.20), and Cultural Property
(OPN11.03). Because individual subproject investments are not known in advance, the Project
will adopt a programmatic approach, with the following characteristics:


      0   Environmental Impacts: N o significant environmental impacts are anticipated.
          Impacts are expected to be those associated with the rehabilitation o f rural roads and
          reconstruction o f very small infrastructure (i.e. culverts, stream crossings, retaining
          structures,   etc.).  Such impacts will be addressed by incorporating standard
          environmental operating procedures into the project manual, contract documents,
          technical training courses, and monitoring systems. Environmental Codes o f Practice
          (ECOPs)     will be developed to address environmental issues at the design,
          implementation and maintenance stages. Implementation consultants will be
          responsible for applying these ECOPs as well as carrying out preliminary
          environmental screening. Potential induced impacts in environmentally sensitive areas
          will be assessed and documented in the sub-project planning/appraisal format and
          mitigation measures designed and implemented, if applicable. Inparticular, the project
          should minimize the risk o f further depletion o f forest areas potentially resulting from
          improved access.


      0   Land Acquisition and Resettlement: The activities to be undertaken under the
          proposed Project involve rehabilitation o f existing secondary and tertiary roads and
          other related rural access infrastructure that are not likely to involve any land
          acquisition or have any other adverse social impacts. Even if additional LIPW
          activities, such as those proposed above involving rehabilitation o f irrigation systems,
          afforestation, and repair o f public buildings (schools, clinics, and administrative
         buildings) are included in the project, these activities would also not be likely to
          involve any land acquisition, resettlement, or have any other adverse social impacts
          (afforestation activities would require that existing resource utilization rights are
         understood and addressed). In terms o f the Environment and Social Safeguards
         Framework agreed between the Government and the Bank, the proposed project can be
         categorized as S-3, i.e., as not being expected to have any land acquisition,
         resettlement, or other adverse social impacts, but on the contrary having significant
         positive social impacts regarding improved livelihoods. The experience o f LIPW under
         the on-going ECEPWP has also been reviewed with regards to land acquisition, and it
         i s assessedthat the S-3 categorization i s applicable.




                                                 27

           Inthe current socio-political context inthe rural areas, involuntary land acquisition is
           unlikely for the lund o f small-scale activities to be undertaken under the proposed
           project, since the costs in terms o f decreasing security deriving from local resistance
           would in all likelihood deter local authorities from attempting to acquire land against
           the will o f those affected. If minor pieces o f land are needed in connection with
           construction o f road structures, or minor changes in road alignments to eliminate
           hazards to traffic or to ensure year-round pass-ability, these would only be obtained if
           they are govemment lands free o f encroachments and other encumbrances, or through
           voluntary donation (local authorities do not have funds to purchase land). The sub-
           project planning/appraisal format in the Project's Technical Manual (or similar to the
           Project ImplementationManual for the UNOPS under ECEPWP) will include a check-
           list recording any amount o f land provided by the govemment or privately donated,
           ensuring that the land i s free o f squatters or other encumbrances, and in the case o f
           private land donations, providing written proof that it i s presented as a voluntary
           donation (see Attachment 2(ii) in Annex 14-the     Environmental and Social Safeguards
           Framework).


      0    Minoritiesandvulnerablegroups

           The project will not cause any adverse impacts on ethnic minority groups, and the
           overall project design which involves targeting o f vulnerable districts within each
           province will help ensure that different ethnic groups participate in the project and
          receive benefits from it. Within districts, inclusion o f different ethnic groups as
           beneficiaries in terms o f both income generation through labor contracts and improved
           connectivity will be addressed through the selection o f specific sub-projects, so that
           these include roads that serve villages inhabited by different ethnic groups. After the
           first year o f implementation, an assessment will be made o f whether this approach has
           succeeded in providing benefits to different groups in ethnically mixed districts.
          Results and recommendations from these studies and project monitoring in minority
           areas will be an agenda item in project annual reviews. Project monitoring will also
           assess whether within-village       minorities are being included among project
          beneficiaries.


      0    Cultural Property. Procedures will be adopted to ensure appropriate handling and
          monitoring o f archeological finds, and to address other potential impacts on
          archeological sites (See Annex 14, Attachment 3).


      0   Mine Risk Management. Subprojects will not be implemented without appropriate
          mine-risk management. A procedure for mine risk management, based on practice
          evolved duringimplementation o f ongoing World Bank fundedprojects, i s attachedin
                                                                     -
          Attachment 5 o f Annex 14 and i s a part o f the overall agreed framework. All risk
          assessment and clearance tasks shall be implemented in coordination with the Mine
          Action Center for Afghanistan (MACA). These procedures may need to be amended in
          the future, depending on evolving circumstances.

132. The initial version o f the Framework-applicable          for all Bank supported projects in
Afghanistan-was     translated into local languages (Dari and Pushto) and disclosed inAfghanistan
and at the Bank's Public Information Center (PIC) in the Spring o f 2002. Thus, it was agreed that
the disclosure o f the original Framework meets the disclosure requirements o f this project. This
Framework has now been revised-without         changing the basic principles-to  meet the specific



                                                 28

requirements o f the proposed National Emergency Employment Program for Rural Access
(NEEPRA)project. The draft Framework has been finalized and disclosed.

                             PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS


1.       GENERAL DESCRIPTION

         The project development objective will be achieved by: a) the creation o f productive
emergency employment opportunities in maintenance and rehabilitation o f the roads
infrastructure, thereby also providing a social safety net for poor people in Afghanistan; b) using
appropriate labor-intensive methods in order to ensure high labor content o f the works to be
financed; and c) buildingcapacity o f government to implement the project and manage its overall
NEEP.

         Given the above, the project will comprise two components:

         Component A: Labor-based Rural Access Infrastructure
         Component B: Technical Assistance for Government's NEEP

         The total allocation for component A will be US$34.2m, o f which US$13.8m will be a
    grant for tertiary rural access infrastructure, where each sub-project i s estimated to cost less
    than $200,000; and US$20.4m will be an IDA credit for secondary rural access infrastructure
    (cross drainage structures, i.e., bridges, culverts, etc.), where each sub-project i s estimated to
    cost inthe range US$500,000 - 1,000,000.

         The total allocation for component B will be US$S.Om inthe formo f a grant.

         In view of the dispersed nature of works to be executed in remote location in a
decentralized manner under component A, and given the post-conflict environment in the
country, the procurement risk i s considered high. Project supervision will include procurement
expertise in most missions over the life o f the Project. Threshold limits described below have
been set inaccordance with the nature o f the project.


2.       PROCUREMENTMETHODS

         Procurement under the IDA Grant and Credit will be carried out in accordance with the
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits" (January 1995, revised in January
and August 1996 and September 1997 and January 1999) and "Guidelines for Selection and
Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, revised in September
1997, January 1999, and M a y 2002). Procurement o f goods, works and services will follow IDA
approvedlstandard documents.

office furniture and vehicles. For the reasons o f economy and efficiency, wherever possible, items
which are similar innature and are planned to be procured at almost same time should be grouped
under one contract package and biddquotations shall then be invited for the whole contract
package. National Competitive Bidding (NCB), International/National Shopping (IS/NS),           and
Direct Contracting (DC) procedures will be used for procurement o f goods.

        National Comuetitive Bidding(NCB): This will be used for goods estimated to cost more
than US$50,000 or equivalent per contract, but less than US$200,000 or equivalent, up to an
aggregate amount not to exceed US$900,000 or equivalent, following the criteria stipulated under

quickly and with limitedprocurement and desigdcosting. The value o f each sub-project shall not
exceed US$30,000. Community organizations will be responsible for implementing Level 1 sub-
projects through the following procedures for physical works (inaccordance with paragraph 3.15
of the Bank Guidelines):

        (i)     Execute the works themselves by employing labor and by procuring the needed
                materials; or
        (ii)    Award the whole or part o f work on Direct Contract to community organizations
                or NGOs; or

3.       IMPLEMENTINGAGENCIESAND THEIR CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT:

         Two ministries will be involved in the implementation o f the Project: The Ministry o f
Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) and the Ministry o f Public Works (MPW).
However, due to lack o f capacity, the concerned ministries have proposed to hire UNagencies as
implementationconsultants for implementation o fthe Project components.

Sub-Component A(1) will be implemented by the MRRD. For selecting the implementation
consultant for this component, MRRD will invite proposals from two or more UN Agencies
involved insuch operation services inAfghanistan, and select the Agency that can effectively and
rapidly scale up its operations in Afghanistan in order to ensure that sub-projects implementation
i s not delayed and employment benefits can reach poor in the shortest possible time. An
additional selection criteria will be the quality o f the UNAgency's team in terms o f its ability to
maximize the delivery o f employment benefits without compromising the qualityhstainability o f
the infrastructure repaired. Based on the assessment o f the appraisal mission, it i s most likely that



                                                   36

 UNOPS and International Organization for Migration (IOM) will be the two Agencies requested
 to submit proposals for this assignment. Like UNOPS, IOM also has wider coverage throughout
 Afghanistan in implementing rural access infrastructure sub-projects and i s maintaining a very
 strong relationship with MRRD.The reason for soliciting proposals only from the UNagencies i s
 that the Bank can make direct payments to the UNagency account. This will ensure, under the
 prevailing payment procedures o f the Borrower, that sub-project disbursements start immediately
 after the Project becomes effective.

Sub-ComponentA.2 will be executedby the MPW with the assistance o f an implementation
 consultant. MPW has proposed for single-source selection o fUnited Nations Office for Project
 Services (UNOPS) basedon the followingjustifications: a) UNOPS are already operational and
 implementing sub-projects similar to this sub-component under ECEPWP LIWP for M P W and
have successfully established all required field procedures for needs identification, consultation,
 contracting, supervision, disbursement o f funds, and auditingknancial management, and for
coordination with MPW and other provincial and district entities which i s a significant
achievement inthe post conflict emergency reconstruction scenario; (b) UNOPS i s usinga
balanced mix o f local and international staff and partnering very well with local agencies' staff
duringsub-projects implementation which has helpedthem inperforminginthe field and in
gaining the trust o f the Borrower; and (c) UNOPS can ensure that sub-project disbursements start
immediately after the Project becomes effective, hence, ensuring that employment i s provided
almost immediately inthe areas proposedunder this project. This i s essential as this i s an
emergency employment program that aims to provide a social safety net to Afghans and raise the
acceptance o f the TIGA inall the provinces--a huge political payoff. According to MRRD,no
new implementation partner currently inAfghanistan or abroad can help achieve this objective in
the given time frame under this project.

         MRRD shall sign an agreement with UNOPS only after receiving the Association's
clearance in this regard.

          Sub-Component B will be executed by MRRDwith the assistance o f an implementation
consultant. Because o f LO'S expertise and experiences in providing similar services, and its
strong presence inAfghanistan, MRRDhas proposed to select EO, on single-source basis, as the
implementation partner for this component. Although the Component B consists procurement o f
goods, works and services, ILO will be primarily responsible for procurement o f services. For
procurement o f goods and works, ILO will sign an inter-agency memorandum of agreement with
UNOPS, who will carry out the procurement of goods and works under this component.

         MRRDshall sign an agreement with ILOonly after receivingthe Association's clearance
inthisregard.

4.       PROCUREMENT BYIMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANTS:

         The United Nations Agencies, as the implementation consultants, may use their own
procurement documents. However, they will follow the procurement methods stipulated under
paragraph 2. IDA'Sprior and post review requirements, as mentioned under paragraph 6 below,
will be applicable to procurement carriedout by the implementation consultants.

5.       PROCUREMENTPLANNING

         Prior to implementation o f any community driven sub-projects, issuance o f any
invitations to bid for goods/works or initiating selection process o f any consultants services, the



                                                 37

procurement plan for goods, works and services shall be furnished by the responsible
implementation consultants to IDA for its review and approval, in accordance with the provisions
o f paragraph 1 o f Appendix 1 to IDA'SProcurement Guidelines. The procurement plan shall be
prepared following the Bank provided format.


6.       PRIOR AND POSTREVIEW

6.1.     Prior Review

         The first three Level 1 sub-projects and the first three Level 2 sub-projects under
Component A.l, the first two sub-projects for secondary rural access infrastructure under
Component A.2; and sub-projects for works contracts above US$500,000 will be subject to
Bank's prior review.

         Consulting services contracts estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO or more for firms and
US$50,000 or more for individual consultants, and any selection o f consultants, including the
implementation consultants, on a Single-Source basis will be subject to IDA's prior review and
approval.

        All contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$lOO,OOO or more
irrespective o f procedures, and all procurement through direct contracting will be subject to
IDA's prior review.

6.2.    Post Review

        All other contracts, not governed by paragraph 6.1, will be subject to selective post-
review by IDA during supervision missions. The project provides for audits to be conducted by
independent auditors to be hired by the ministries for expenditures incurred as well as asset
verification. In addition, the project provides technical audits by independent consultants for
community construction works on a sample basis.


7.      PROCUREMENTINFORMATION

        The implementation consultants will submit quarterly Procurement Status Reports to the
concerned ministries and to the Bank within two weeks o f the next quarter in the format which
will be providedby the Bank. The Procurement Status Reports will indicate:

            0   number o f contracts signed so far, contract amounts, contractor'shpplier'sl
                 consultant's names, delivery/contract completion dates
            0   revised cost estimates for contracts yet to be processed;
            0   revised timings o f procurement actions including advertising, bidding, contract
                award, and completion.

   FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT,DISBURSEMENT,AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS

CountryIssues

         Since there i s no Country Profile o f Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there i s inadequate documented
knowledge o f country issues and related strengths and weaknesses. However, IDA has gained
substantial experience in implementing three projects over the past one year. The overall
assessment i s that though the country's financial management system i s not fully functional,
appropriate mitigation measures, general and project specific, are being taken. General measures
include the engagement o f the Financial Management Agent and project specific measures
include the engagement o f the UN Agencies for assisting line ministries with project
implementation.

Strengths

         The engagement o f the Financial Management Agent; the government's commitment to
transparent and accountable financial management, and the use o f UN agencies for assisting the
line ministries with project implementation and supervision, are the primary strengths o f the
project's financial management system.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

         The Project will follow standard government financial management policies and
procedures, including using the Chart o f Accounts developed by the Financial Management
Agent to record Project expenditures. In addition, the selected UN Agencies, will be required to
report to IDA on a quarterly basis according to formats to be incorporated in their contract
agreements with the line ministries. The use o f these procedures will allow for adequate recording
and reporting of Project expenditures.

         Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in the Ministry o f Finance, in particular,
the Grant Management Unit (GMU), with support from the Financial Management Agent, and
consolidated Project financial statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o f Project
funds.

Audit Arrangements

        The accounts o f the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with the support o f
the Audit Agent, with terms o f reference satisfactory to the Association. The annual Project
financial statement to the Association would include a summary o f funds received (showing
funds received from all sources), and a summary o f expenditures shown under the main Project
components/ activities and by main categories o f expenditures. The format o f the annual Project
financial statements will be similar to the Financial MonitoringReports (FMRs). The audit o f the
Project accounts would also include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy o f the accounting and
internal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate documentation for transactions; and
(c) the eligibility of incurred expenditures for Association financing. The annual Project financial
statements audited by the Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, would be submitted
within 6 months o f the close o f fiscal year, i.e. by September 22 o f each year. The following
audit reports will be monitoredinthe Audit Reports Compliance System (ARCS):

Financing Percentage.       Since collection o f tax revenue has just begun and i s sporadic,
disbursement percentages have been set at 100% with the understanding, however, that MOF will
submit withdrawal applications on a net-of-tax basis. The tax structure o fthe government will be
reviewed periodically by IDA and decision made whether standard disbursement percentages
needto be set and financing percentages amended accordingly.

Disbursement Method.        Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with
fulldocumentation or against statements ofexpenditures as appropriate).

Blanket Withdrawal Method: As project activities will be executed by UN Agencies (UNOPS,
ILO, and IOM), the Blanket Withdrawal application procedure can be followed, thereby enabling
direct disbursements to the UN Agencies. On this basis, the UN Agencies will be given an
advance, and thereafter, will report to IDA on a quarterly basis on the use o f funds and the
estimated forecast for the next six months, and seek direct disbursements. Although reporting will
be to IDA and disbursements will be made directly to the UNAgencies' bank accounts, the UN
Agencies will be requiredto keep the line ministriesinformed at all times on financial progress o f
the project. The use of Blanket Withdrawal procedure, however, does not preclude the line
ministries from disputing direct disbursement requests made by the UNAgencies to the IDA, at
any given time.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be made on the basis o f SOEs for
all contracts for sub-grants under Component A(1), sub-grants for civil works less than
US$500,000 equivalent under Component A(2), goods less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent,
consultants' services for firms less than US$lOO,OOO, for individual consultant less than
US$50,000 equivalent, all training, audits and incremental operating costs. These SOE thresholds
are applicable for procurement made, ifany, outside o f the UN Agencies contracts. For all
contracts with UN Agencies, reimbursements thresholds and reporting requirements as to be
specified inthe specific contracts, will apply.

Incremental Operating Costs means the incremental expenses incurred on account o f Project
implementation and management, including the installation, operation and maintenance o f
vehicles, computers and office equipment, communication and insurance costs, office
administration costs, Special Account banking charges, utility charges, domestic travel and per
diem, but excluding salaries o f the officials o f the Recipient's civil service.

Special Account. Should there be a need for a Special Account at any given time duringthe life o f
the project, the MOF should write to IDA and make a request. The Special Account will opened
and maintained in D a Afghanistan Bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association;
and would be operated by MOF-GMUin accordance with the Association's operational policies.
The Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account would be set not to exceed US$1 million.

Minimum application size.      Applications for replenishment to the Special Account will be
submitted (a) monthly, regardless o f amount, or (2) when the Special Account balance i s reduced
by 40%, whichever comes first. The minimum application size for withdrawal applications for
reimbursement, direct payment, or for applications for Special Commitments i s 20% o f the
Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account.

Inthe caseofBlanketwithdrawal applications, this minimumapplicationsize does not apply.

Authority to withdraw Grant funds.         MOF-GMU will retain the right to sign and submit
withdrawal applications to the Association.

Action Plan

        IDA has reviewedthe operating procedures, including financial management procedures,
o f UNOPS, and found them to be satisfactory. As regards other UNagencies to be selected, IDA
will needto review the operatingprocedures o fthese agencies, prior to making disbursements.

Supervision Plan

        From a financial management perspective, the Project will need intensive supervision.
The focus during supervision will be on the internal control arrangements of the selected UN
Agencies for their internal functioning o f accounting, financial reporting and auditing. IDA will
review them inorder to ensure that they are incompliance with the operating guidelines reviewed
and accepted by IDA at the time o f the implementing agency's signing o f the contract with the
selected UNAgency.

                     THE NATIONALDEVELOPMENTFRAMEWORK


Developed and presented in April 2002 by the Afghanistan Interim Administration, the draft
National Development Framework provides the basis for the Government's reconstruction
planning, and prioritizesprograms for support.

The NDF is based on three pillars:
0  Pillar One - Humanitarian Assistance and Human and Social Capital recognizing the
                                                                                -
   continuing humanitarian crisis and the need to address the pressingneeds o f the vulnerable,
   including the refugees, programs will focus on creating the conditions for people to live
   productive and secure lives through community development and developing social capital.
0  Pillar Two PhysicalReconstructionand Natural Resources - supporting reconstruction
                -
   activities to expand physical infrastructure and provide employment opportunities as well as
   laying the basis for a private sector-led strategy for growth.       Programs include urban
   development and attention to municipal development, roads, transport, water and sanitation.
0  Pillar Three - Private Sector Development - developing a competitive export-oriented
   economy, to provide an engine for growth and instrument o f social inclusion through the
   creation o f opportunities.

Under these three pillars, the Government has put forward Twelve National Programs being
prepared through a consultative process led by key ministries and involving relevant agencies and
donors.

       Media and Sports

Inaddition three important cross-cutting themes have been identifiedto be addressed within each
program:


0  Governance, financial management and administrative reform - efforts will include
   creating an enabling environment for cavity society development, ensuring equitable
   development by addressing provincial needs and those o f urban and rural areas, and
   developing systems for financial management and public administration that are transparent
   and efficient.
0  Human Rights, Security and Rule of Law - without security and peace it i s acknowledged
   that development efforts will have little chance o f taking hold.      A priority will be the
   development o f a national police force and army, re-absorption o f combatants through
   vocational training, and reviving the judicial system. This cross-cutting issue also recognizes
   the broader meaning o f security in removing barriers to inclusion and providing equal
   opportunity.



                                               47

 e   Gender - this will have a two pronged approach     - first to restore the rights o f women and
     girls that were removed under the Taliban, particularly with regard to income eaming
     opportunities, and second, to undertake a process o f assessment across sectors - political,
     economic and social -to ascertain how to promote the inclusion o f women inthese sectors.


The Twelve NationalProgramsof Afghanistan'sNationalDevelopmentFramework

The following provides a summary o fthe twelve national programs o f the Government's National
Program for Reconstruction.       Information has been obtained from Govemment documents
including the National DevelopmentFramework and the National Development Budget.

Refugee Return: With an unprecedented number o f refugees retuming to Afghanistan and
settling in urban centers, facilities and services - already severely pressed to serve current
residents - are being stretched beyond capacity. This program aims to improve information,
registration and documentation o f refugees, and provide support to the neediest and their host
communities. Specific measures are being taken to cater to the needs o f the most vulnerable
duringthe cold winter months. The programwill also address policy and institutional issues and
develop the capacity o f government agencies aimed with assisting refugees and coordinating their
reintegration.

Education: Given the appalling conditions o f the education system in the country, evidence o f
which i s population's education indicators-among     the worst in the world-and     the destruction
o f much o f the country's educational institutions, development o f an education system i s a vital
need for future growth and development in Afghanistan. The education program covers a range
o f essential areas including policy reform, improving education infrastructure, teacher
development, increased primary and secondary school enrolment with a particular focus on
female enrollment, as well as vocational training and early childhood development.

Health and Nutrition: Suffering from highinfant, child and maternal mortality rates as well as
the prevalence o f communicable diseases and poor nutrition, the health situation for much o f
Afghanistan's population i s bad. This program will focus on decreasing mortality rates through
provision o f a basic package o f health services, and increasing the capacity o f government to
develop necessary systems and policies, as well as implementing a number o f specific
interventions including safe motherhood, and nutrition.        Issues o f civil service reform and
financial planning and management are also key priorities. The expected results are quantifiable
improvements in health indicators as well as improvements in health infrastructure and
institutional capacity within relevant agencies.

Livelihoods and Social Protection: Aimed to address the risk and deprivation experienced by
large parts o f the rural Afghan population, this program will focus on five areas: institutional
strengthening, macroeconomic regeneration, community-based development, protection o f lives
and livelihoods and income generation. It is hoped that these activities will support sustainable
rural livelihoods and, through the National Solidarity Program and Emergency Public Works
Program, identified as a priority sub-program for immediate implementation, citizens and
communities will be empowered through directly designing and implementing reconstruction
efforts in their communities. This program will also address issues o f the disable who comprise
nearly 4 percent of the population.

Cultural Heritage, Media and Sports: Recognized as a key element in consolidating a common
Afghan identity, particularly during the transitional period, this program will promote a number



                                                 48

of activities including the preservation o f Afghan cultural heritage, rehabilitation o f sports
infrastructure, and rehabilitation o f the media, with participation o f women encouraged in all
areas.

Transport and Telecommunications: The vital role o f good communication and transport
networks to economic development and national integration form the basis o f this program.
Suffering significant destruction and neglect through years o f war, large investments are planned
in these networks.      In addition to physical infrastructure, this program will also create a
regulatory environment to promote private sector participation inthe transport sector and address
policy and institutional issues. Inthe area o f communications, telephone, IT, intemet and postal
services will be addressed, as will the regulatory environment for private sector involvement and
the development o f technology for distance education inpriority areas.

Urban Management:         With Afghanistan's urban population estimated at around 30 percent o f
the total population, this program aims to create cities as viable economic hubs around the
country. The program will address rebuilding in cities destroyed by war, provision o f services to
housing areas, waste water and sanitation services, new land acquisition for housing as well as
attention to policy issues such as town planning and management and standards, procedures and
legislation.

Energy and Mining: As in other areas, the power and mining sectors have suffered severe
neglect after years o f war. The energy and miningprogram, which recognizes the significant role
of the private sector in this area, aims to secure cost-effective power supply to urban areas and
expansion to rural areas where it i s cost-effective and practical. The role o f government will
focus on regulation o f the sector and development o f a policy environment for private sector
participation rather than direct involvement inoperational activities.

Natural Resource Management: Focusing on community management o f natural resources and
improvements in livelihoods, this program will rehabilitate and enhance the development o f
sustainable agriculture, horticulture and livestock production, including identification o f viable
substitutes for poppy production. Resource protection measures will include sustainable water
usage and protection o f existing forests as well as new planting through agro-forestry program.
Additionally, environmental laws and policies will be developed and awareness campaigns
conducted to reachout to the population.

Trade and Private Investment: Private sector development lies at the heart o f the government's
development plans, and the trade and investment program will lay the basis for developing an
environment conducive to foreign and domestic investment. Activities will include assistance for
small business development, efforts to improve governance, creation o f laws in areas such as
competition, direct and foreign investment and standards and certification.       The challenging
issues o f divestiture and privatization o f state owned enterprises will also be included in this
program,

Public Administration: The Public Administration program focuses on three key areas: the
establishment o f an effective civil service system; rehabilitating the physical infrastructure o f
government; and developing an organizational structure that permits the government to deliver
the needed goods and services to the Afghan public in an effective manner. In addition to
physical infrastructure, the program will aim to rationalize the number o f ministries, ensure that
donor assistance i s integrated into the budget process and reduce the number o f government
corporations. Within this program an important sub-program will focus on mainstreaming gender
inpublic administration.



                                                 49

Security and Rule of Law: Numerous specific activities relating to security are covered under
this program. To address the rule o f law, activities will improve the domestic justice system to
ensure independence o f the judiciary, and will include efforts to rebuild the administration o f
juvenile justice, prison and law enforcement systems. Among the activities to be carried out are
the establishment o f new courts and the strengthening of legal aid services within the
organizational structure of the Supreme Court.

                       DEFINITION OF LABOR-BASEDTECHNOLOGY



         A construction technology which aims to apply a labodequipment mixthat gives priority
to labor, but supplements labor with appropriate equipment where necessary for reasons o f
quality or cost. While producing or maintaining infrastructure to a specified standard in a cost-
effective manner, people are employed with fair worlung conditions.

         Ifapieceofinfrastructure istobe constructed or maintained, achoice canbemadeto use
either labor or equipment as the predominant input in the process. Any decision should be
objective and will depend on factors such as:

         0    the type o f construction or maintenance;

         0    the relative costs o f labor and equipment (true and un-subsidized) in the country or
              locality where the work i s to take place;

         0    the availability o f labor and equipment;

         0    the technical specifications for the completed works;

         0    policy objectives or directives on technology choice.

         It is important to distinguishbetweenan optimum and efficient use o flabor (labor-based)
and a maximum, and possibly inefficient, use o f labor (labor-intensive). However, a maximum
use o f labor may be preferred to efficiency where income generation and job creation are the
over-riding, short-term objectives    - forinstance disaster relief, or food-for-work projects.

         The term labor-based on the other hand indicates that a flexible and optimum use i s made
o f labor as the predominantresource, accompanied by appropriate light equipment to ensure cost-
effective and quality aspects in construction. Labor-based technology therefore implies properly
planned use o f labor in an economically efficient, humanly fair, and hence sustainable manner. It
must produce technically sound results and be socially and economically competitive with
alternative equipment-based methods.

         The use of labor-based methods also implies the increased use o f associated local
resources. These may include locally available materials, tools and equipment, skills and
knowledge as well as finance. For example if in certain countries the agricultural sector i s
flourishing, then it should be possible to tap into and use the tools and equipment produced
locally for agriculture, with perhaps some adaptation to make it suitable for use in labor-based
infrastructure provision. This reinforces the amount o f investment which remains in the country
and often inthe locality o f the works, and reduces the dependence on costly imports.

           INTEGRATEDRURALACCESSIBILITY PLANNINGTECHNIQUES

         The Oxford dictionary defines access as "the opportunity to reach, use or visit." In the
rural social and economic development context, the concept o f accessibility can be applied to the
access to basic needs like drinlung water, energy, employment and basic services like education,
health care and markets.

         In the rural areas of many developing countries, travel and transport consume a large
portion o f the household budget in terms o f money, energy and time. Due to the generally poor
condition o f the road network, entire areas can become isolated for long periods o f the year. This
makes it difficult for rural households to access their basic needs. In this situation, paid
employment opportunities are virtually nonexistent. The result i s often that rural people are
forced to migrate to the urban centers. This further compounds social problems.

         The IRAP process identifies prioritized investments that maximize the impact to those
most in need. This may involve the improvement o f the road network or the improvement o f the
distribution and location o f services. Providing the population with access to a range o f goods and
services and local employment creates the platform for economic and social development. This
can reverse the cycle o fpoverty and outward migration.

         I"identifiesaccessneedsattwospatiallevels:

             Within the settlement area: Destinations usually within walking distance for the
             majority o f the households, like potable water supplies, fuel wood sources,
             agricultural land and cultural and social facilities like primary schools and communal
             buildings.

             Outside the settlement area: Destinations usually requiring the use o f a wide range
             o f public and private transport modes, like the market, secondary education facilities,
             health care facilities and administrative centers.

         For every sector studied, the IRAP procedure first assesses the existing assets.
Information on travel time, travel cost and frequency i s then gathered. Villages are then ranked
according to their level o f ease, or difficulty, in gaining access to Basic MinimumNeeds (BMN)
and services. This serves to identify areas most in need o f development. Through consultation
with the stakeholders a prioritized investment framework is then developed. By comparing the
sector plans, an integrated accessibility plan i s then created. Using this multi-sector approach,
investments that conflict or are complementary can be taken into account.

        The IRAP process develops around a series o f participatory workshops. The workshops
occur at both commune and district levels. The outcomes o f these workshops are processed and
the results are analyzed. Then stakeholders verify the analysis in follow up workshops. The
stakeholders taking part in the planning process are: village leaders, religious leaders, women
committee representatives, elderly people, Development Committees, local leaders, district
officials and representatives o f the departments o f health education, public works, rural
development, teachers, health workers and NGO representatives. The following steps are taken to
carry out the IRAPcycle.

 a)     Asset AssessmentandDataCollection

        A situation analysis is made o f the district. It identifies access problems and target areas.
This process starts with an assessment o f the condition and the location o fthe rural roadnetwork
Transport Infrastructure Inventory (TII), other public infrastructure assets, Rural Infrastructure
Asset Inventory (RIAI) and the location o f all villages, commune centers and natural resources.
After the inventory i s completed, village level information i s collected on access, using secondary
sources and data supplied by key informants at commune workshops. Most o f the information i s
collected making use o f manual maps and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. This
serves as a basis to update the GIS maps.

b)      AccessibilityAssessment,IndicatorBuildingandMapping

        The data i s processed and analyzed for each settlement and accessibility indicators are
calculated at the village and the commune levels. The difficulty o f access to specific goods and
services i s quantified, in terms o f travel time, travel cost and fi-equency. Based on these
indicators, villages and communes are ranked according to their levels o f access to basic
minimum needs and services. Manual maps and GIS maps are produced to show the spatial
distribution o f the accessibility ranlung. Poor accessibility ranlungs can then be used to highlight
areas most in need o f development. The collected information is compiled into a document
referredto as the District Accessibility Profile (DAP).

c)      IdentificationandPrioritization

        The accessibility indicators for all o f the settlements are compared during a district
workshop using manual thematic maps. The stakeholders identify and prioritize areas and
locations, like transport routes, schools, health centers for possible interventions. A target village
or area with the poorest accessibility in a particular sector gets the highest priority for access
interventions inthat sector.

d)      InvestmentPlanningof AppropriateInterventions

        The stakeholders at the district and commune levels define the sector objectives for
access interventions. These interventions attempt to meet the BMN standards that the MRD uses
to monitor poverty. Using the BMNthresholds and other planning criteria, like buffer zones and
service areas, the sector priorities are compared with each other and integrated into an investment
framework. Maintenance o f existing assets i s considered first before identifyingrehabilitation and
new construction.

e)      CostingandDesignof AppropriateInterventions

        A more detaileddesign andcostingexercise is then carriedout to estimate the costs o fthe
proposed infi-astructure works. Standard unit rates are usedto estimate the costs.

0       Submissionofthe AccessibilityActionPlan

        Duringa final planning workshop the stakeholders study the investment framework and
the cost estimation and agree upon the final version o f the district plan. Then the Accessibility
Action Plan (AAP)i s prepared. It i s subsequently submitted to the Provincial Rural Development
Committee (PRDC) for integration into the provincial plan. Through the PRDC, it i s presentedto
government departments and development agencies.



                                                  59

g)      FacilitationofFundingandImplementation

        The local authorities then make decisions about what interventions will be supported. The
design o f the interventions can then be finalized, tender documents prepared and individual
projects within the plan implemented.

Summary


         The IRAP process enhances the integrated nature o f planning. It i s a simple and easily
applied participatory planning method. The resulting Accessibility Action Plan, although
primarily transport oriented can be expended to other sectors. The maintenance and upgrading of
existing assets are considered first in the investment planning, followed by the need for new
assets. IRAPi s participatory innature at every level and incorporates stakeholder perceptions into
the investment priorities.


         Where local planning processes produce village development and commune development
plans, IRAP has proved to facilitate the effective integrationo f these plans at district level, which
makes them complementary.

   At the provincial level, the IWdistrict plans serve as the basis for the creation o faprovincial
infrastructure master plan. This provincialplan ranks the district sector prioritiesbased on relative
accessibility, the population served, socio-economic cost-benefit analysis and environmental and
geographic criteria.

Rationalefor the PlanningandM& EAdvisory input
The absence o f a rational process for project planning and selection, based on objectively
verifiable social and economic indicators, seriously affects the effectiveness o f investments made
ininfrastructure works. Another major problem is the lack ofeffective monitoring andevaluation
system. At present the Government i s not in a position to monitor the performance o f the
implementing partners and contractors and lacks information about the effects and impacts o f the
investments made in infrastructure works. To address these major constraints, the Transitional
Islamic Government o f Afghanistan has request the input o f a Planning and M & E Advisor for
the JPMU.

Initially an input o f 12 person months i s scheduled. Considering the complexities related to the
establishment o f effective planning and M & E procedures and methodologies, and based on the
currently available slulls and resources inthese areas, the current lack o f effective methodologies,
data and systems, an extension o f the consultancy i s foreseen.

GeneralDutiesandResponsibilitiesof the PlanningandM& EAdvisor
The Planning and M & E Advisor will be assigned to the NEEP JPMU and shall work under the
overall direction o f the Program Director o f the JPMU. The Advisor will report to the NEEP
Program Adviser He/she will work in close collaboration and coordination with the Government
staff assigned to NEEP, other NEEP Specialists, key stakeholders, implementing partners and
other relevant programs. Together with his/her JPMU Government counterpart, the Advisor will
be responsible for the overall coordination and implementation o f activities related to the
development and implementation o f effective planning and M & E methodologies and
procedures. Together with hisher JPMU Counterpart he/she will also be responsible for the
design and implementation o f a human resource development plan inthe field o fplanning and M
& E. Within these overall responsibilities, the Planning and M & E Advisor and hisher
Government Counterpart will be specifically responsible for the coordinationand implementation
o f the following activities:

SpecificDuties andResponsibilitiesof the PlanningandM& EAdvisor
     Inventory and review o f the current planning and M& Eprocedures and methodologies
     Review and analyze the quality and comprehensiveness o f available data, identify
     shortcomings inthe data and inthe data collection systems and define data requirements.
     Based on the review o f the existing planning and M & E methodologies and the analysis o f
     data and data collection systems, develop effective planning and M & E systems to cover the
     various stages o f the project planning and implementation cycle. Planning systems and M &
     E systems have to be developed inline with the overall NEEP strategy and should take into
     account available personnel capacities. The Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning (IRAP)
     procedure that has been developed by the ILO and that provento be a very effective model in
     various countries will be the basis for the development o f the planningmethodology.

Rationalefor the M I S Advisory input
A precondition for the effective implementation ofNEEPactivities inthe areas o fprogramming,
resource allocation, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, i s the establishment
and operation of a functional management information system (MIS). Although various donors
and implementing partners operate sub-databases, there i s not a single system in place that
provides the Government with comprehensive and accurate information that is required for NEEP
to execute its roles and functions efficiently and effectively.

An input o f 12 person months is foreseen. However, the current level o f skills and resources
within the various organizations, and the present lack o f data and systems may necessitate an
extension o f the consultancy.

NEEP, other NEEP Specialists, key stakeholders, implementing partners and other relevant
programs. Together with hisker JPMU Government counterpart the NEEP M I S Advisor will be
responsible for the overall coordination of activities related to the design, establishment,
development and implementation o f a comprehensive MIS for NEEP in particular and for the
development o f a M I S master plan for the involved Government institutions in general. A
bottom-up approach will be used (developing one sub-system at a time) but at the same time top-
down issues (design of the overall MIS) have to be considered. In line with the capacity
development objective o f NEEP, the Advisor and hisker Counterpart will also be responsible for
the development o f a comprehensive human resource development plan and coordinate activities
formulated inthis plan.

SpecificResponsibilities andDutiesof the M I S Advisor

Rationalefor the IrrigationEnvironmental EngineeringAdvisory input
The economic development objective o f NEEP is to provide increased livelihood opportunities
for the poor through increased access to public and productive infrastructure services, facilities
and assets. This should be achieved by developing and maintaining the country's rural and urban
physical infrastructure works through labor-based methods and technologies. At present a wide
array o f infrastructure works programs and projects are implemented but their effectiveness i s
seriously hampered due to a multitude o f constraints in the current planning, preparation,
contracting, implementation and supervision of these works. To address these constraints, the
Government has requestedthe input o f an Irrigation / Environmental Advisor to the NEEP JPMU.
Within the overall strategy that has been prepared for NEEP, specific issues related to the
development and maintenance o f the physical infrastructure need to be resolved and effective
labor-based methodologies, approaches and technologies need to be developed and implemented
to ensure an optimum return to the investments made invarious physical infrastructure sectors. In
the allocation of available resources, high priority will be given to the establishment and
implementation o f systems for the maintenance o f still maintainable infrastructure. During the
financial year 1382 a part o f the National Development Budget for NEEP will be allocated to the
irrigation sector and to environmentalprotection works related to NEEP's infrastructure activities
inthe roads- andirrigationsector

Initially an input o f 12 person months i s scheduled. Considering the multitude o f current
constraints related to the development and implementation of appropriated labor-based
approaches, methodologies and technologies in the rehabilitation, (re-) construction and
maintenance o f physical infrastructure works, an extension o f the Advisory input is foreseen.

General Duties and Responsibilitiesof the IrrigationEnvironmental EngineeringAdvisor

                   6. Terms of Reference - Social ProtectiodGender Advisor
                                 (Initially for a period o f 12months)


Rationale for the Social ProtectiodGender Advisory input
The social objective o f NEEP i s to provide increased social protection for an estimated 5-6
million o f the most vulnerable people in Afghanistan through the provision o f employment
opportunities inthe development and maintenance o f public and productive infrastructure works.
At present no effective or coherent mechanisms are in place that ensure that the targeted
population will effectively benefit from such infrastructure works programs. Vulnerable groups
include refugees, retumees, IDPs, destitute women and female-headed households, the disabled,
the elderly and ex-combatants. To ensure that these groups will benefit to the extent possible fi-om
NEEP's interventions, realistic and effective strategies, resource allocation mechanisms,
programming modalities, planning-and implementation methodologies and monitoring and
evaluation procedures have to be developed, tested and implemented. For the development o f
strategies, mechanisms and operation procedures the Government has requested the input of a
Social ProtectiodGender Advisor to the NEEP JPMU.

Initially an inputof 12 person months i s scheduled. Considering the complexities related to social
targeting, currently available skills and resources, and the present lack o f effective methodologies,
data and systems, an extension o f the consultancy i s foreseen.

The strategy outline for the National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP) as presented in this
document reflects the outcome o f initial discussions between concerned Government institutions and an
appraisal o f identified key issues vis-a-vis the program's objectives. The strategy proposed inthis worlung
document does not represent the official view o f the Transitional Islamic Government o f Afghanistan.
The purpose o f this paper i s to facilitate further discussions between concerned Govemment institutions,
UNagencies, InternationalOrganisations, ImplementingPartnersandDonors inthe process ofdeveloping
an effective and comprehensive strategy for NEEP.

Chapter one provides the background and rationale for the program. In Chapter two the contextual
framework o f NEEP in relation to the Government's National Development Framework i s described.
Chapter three outlines the core principles o f the proposed strategy. Chapter four presents the identified
strategic issues and gives an overview o f the proposed strategic interventions. InChapter five the specific
activities and inputs that are required to develop and implement the proposed strategic interventions are
presented. This chapter also includes a proposed timeframe for implementation.

Operational guidelines and directives related to the program management o f NEEP and the planning,
selection, implementation and monitoring o f specific infrastructure projects inthe various sectors covered
byNEEP, will be presentedina separate volume.

                                           Executive Summary

Background

At the 2002 Tokyo Conference the Government of Afghanistan outlined its vision for a prosperous and
secure Afghanistan. Basedon this vision, the Government's priorities were articulated through 12National
Programs. As an interimmeasure, pending the finalization of the National Development Budget inMarch
2003, 6 national priority sub-programs were identified. These programs represent the nation's highest
priorities for donor fundingand needs were considered too urgentto allow implementationdelays.

Objectives

One o f the national priority sub-programs i s the National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP). This
Program i s anchored within the National Development Plan for Livelihoods and Social Protection. The
purpose o f NEEP i s to develop replicable models and mechanisms to achieve its objectives; (i)   provide a
safety net for the most vulnerable people by creating productive employment opportunities; and (ii)
establish effective mechanisms for developing public and productive infrastructure assets, through based-
based methods andbasedon a private sector-led approach.

Execution

Funding, resource allocation and the implementation of projects under NEEP will follow Government
execution modalities. A Trust Fund will be established to ensure that funds are allocated in accordance
with principles and directions of the Government's policies and strategies related to social targeting,
sectoral priorities and geographical distribution. The Fund will provide donors with a focused and
transparent mechanism to contribute financial resources to specific sectors and program areas that reflect
Government priorities. Ifdonor funds are not channeled through the Fund, projects will only be prioritized
inthe NationalDevelopment Budgetifcompliance to Government execution is assured.

The budget of the Trust Fundwill be gradually expanded over the coming years, in concurrence with the
Government's management capacity. During the initial year the Fund will be mainly used to correct
resource allocation unbalances that are the result o f the current lack o f transparency and coordination of
funds programming through donor channels. An oversight consultant will be assigned to assist the
Government in developing its Trust Fund management capacity. The oversight consultant will also
support the Government inexecuting its financial and technical control of the Trust Fund.

National Inter-Ministerial Board
An Inter-Ministerial National Board will be chaired by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and
Development and represented by the relevant Ministers. The Board will be responsible for; (i)     providing
policy and strategy direction; (ii)  resource allocation and programming; (iii)     project approval against
agreed criteria and in line with National development priorities; (iv) establishing appropriate financial
modalities; (v) approval o f the oversight mechanism for effective resource management; and (vi)
supervision o fthe Joint Programmed Management Unit.

Joint ProgramManagementUnit

A Joint ProgramManagement Unitwill beresponsible for the daily managementofthe Program. The Unit
reports to the Inter-Ministerial Board. Designated representatives of the concerned Ministries, with
support from key partners, will jointly establish, develop and manage the Program. Main roles and
functions o f the Unit will be; (i)establish and maintain effective coordination systems; (ii)manage the
programmingh-esource allocation mechanisms; (iii) functional and appropriate methods, standards
                                                     develop

 and tools for programming, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation; (iv) build capacity
 within the Government to implement NEEP; and (v) report to the Inter-Ministerial Board. Supporting
 partners will provide assistance based on their comparative strength. Qualified national and international
 agencies shall provide support in the areas o f social process management, community mobilization and
 capacity building. Other agencies and firms will have a leading role in providing technical assistance in
 engineering, contracting and financial management.

 Main Issues

 Social targeting: Various vulnerability assessments were conducted but uncertainty remains about their
 accuracy. The adaptation o f livelihood strategies in the present unsettled situation i s not reflected in the
 analysis nor i s coherent information available about actual preferences and needs o f the targeted
vulnerable groups. In this context it i s important to develop effective social targeting mechanisms that
relate to the principles o f equal opportunity and access to work, and equal pay for work o f equal value.
K e y elements in developing such mechanisms relate to; (i)specific financial resource allocations
proportional to the targeted populations; (ii)transparent information campaigns and recruitment
procedures; (iii) the selection o f appropriate construction activities that maximize the participation o f the
targeted groups; and (iv) establishment o f appropriate wages rates and payment modalities.

Coordination and Communication: A wide array o f coordination mechanism and management structures
exist but these are not firmly embedded within the Government structure. They are often donor-driven and
fragmented, and do not always have a transparent, output-oriented and time-bound, agenda. This
complicates the effective coordination by the Government at strategic and operational level and leads to
high costs and low effectiveness. NEEP's institutional set-up and the Trust Fund modality will be
instrumental inimproving the (cost-) effectiveness and efficiency o f coordination and communication.

Information: Various projects and programs have their own data collection and information management
systems and methodologies. But there i s not a single system in place that provides the Government
decision-makers with key information that i s required for developing strategies, and for programming,
budgeting, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Available information i s scattered
throughout the international assistance community, i s not consolidated inone comprehensive database and
is not structurally accessible to the Government. The importance o f developing a comprehensive
management information system within the Government i s crucial. Without it, the effectiveness and
efficiency o f coordination, programming and the utilization o fresources will remain limited.

Capacity Development: Over the last years the international assistance community has primarily focussed
on the direct implementation o f programs and projects. Providing assistance to the Government and the
private sector to buildtheir capacities, has received less priority. Capacity buildingi s a key element inthe
strategy. This relates to the development o f effective methodologies, the establishment o f effective
supporting systems and technical guidelines, and strengthening the human resource capacity through
training and skill development.

Project Planning: Planning is a participatory and iterative process, simultaneously bottom-up and top-
down. At national level resourcing takes place and project planning, implementation and monitoring
guidelines are established. At local level coherent and transparent selection tools have to be applied. These
tools should include economic indicators. Sometimes it i s argued that participatory decision-making
processes can replace the economic selection process. But as the "wish-list" will typically be greater than
available resources, a rational process, using economic criteria, should be used to help priorities alternative
investments




                                                      83

Project Implementation: Based on the results of the planning process, activities will be undertaken that
best reflect NEEP's social objectives, implementation capacities, and the required functionality and (cost-)
effectiveness o f the works. A wide range of infrastructure construction works is captured under NEEP's
umbrella. These should all conform to the principles and guidelines that are being established by the
Program. But time i s requiredto provide a solid management capacity within NEEP. Given the current
time constraints and capacity limitations, the Program will initially focus on the development of planning
and implementation mechanisms in those sectors where a maximum effect, impact and visibility can be
achieved.

Reporting. Monitoring and Evaluation: It i s essential to establish a simple and effective reporting,
monitoring and evaluation system within the Government. Implementing partners should follow this
system. This will enable the Government to monitor and evaluate the physical and financial progress of
projects and their effects and impacts. This information will be processed and analysed through a
computerized Management Information System. This will facilitate the process of decision-making within
the Government on the basis o f factual and comprehensive information.

Norms and Standards: There i s a mosaic of norms, standards and procedures that are being applied by
different partners in planning and implementinginfrastructure works. These relate to wage rates, labor
productivity norms, design specifications, biddingand contracting, quality standards and monitoring. The
lack of uniformity and the frequently observed sub-standard project planning and implementation
adversely affect the return on the investments in the public- and productive infrastructure sector. Clarity
and agreementon standards and procedures i s essential.

StrategyDevelopment

Short-term Strategy: The short-term resource allocation strategy will be based on available information
and data, and on capacities for planning, design and implementation. Whereas NEEP will promote the
application of its principles and approaches throughout the various relevant infrastructure sectors, the
Program will initially target particular sectors in developing, testing, implementing and monitoring its
operational procedures. Inthis regard NEEP will primarily focus on public secondary and tertiary roads
and on selected large-scale irrigation projects during 1382. Associated soil conservation activities and
environmental protection works will be included as well. Routine maintenance activities will receive high
priority. Maintenance activities will be exclusively done through Cash For Work. No activities will be
selectedthat would have negative environmental impact.

Long-term Strategy: The short-term strategy for NEEP will lay the foundation for the development o f a
long-term strategy that will be the focus on; (i)developing methodologies (targeting, programming,
planning, labor-based approaches, reporting, monitoring and evaluation); (ii)   developingresources(human
resources and skills, financial resources, equipment and transport, office facilities); and (iii)the
development o f management systems and procedures (operational manuals and guidelines, pilot projects,
reporting formats, monitoring and evaluation procedures, base-line studies and surveys)

Time frame: Subject to the availability o f funds, staff and space, the Joint ProgramManagement Unit will
have a core establishment by the end o f May 2003. Mid-June 2003 guidelines for the planning and
implementation o f infrastructure works should be prepared for use by the Government authorities and
implementingpartners duringthe 1382 constructionseason. The implementation of the guidelines will be
closely monitored and evaluated. Based on the outcome of this evaluation, and the results of various
surveys that will be conducted, the long-term strategy will be developed.

1.       BACKGROUNDAND RATIONALE

Two and a half decades o f armed conflict have devastated the livelihoods o f millions o f Afghan
people. The recent four years o f severe drought has further exacerbated the crisis. Available
information indicates that more than five to six million Afghan people don't have the means for
securing the minimumnecessities o f life. They have lost all or nearly all o f their stocks and assets
and have been stretched beyond their household coping and survival strategies.

The response o f households in the context o f a war and a black market economy, confounded
with drought, resulted in multi-layered livelihood changes. Before the drought, households
diversified into low-risk activities aimed at maintaining assets and assuring food security in what
was a high-risk environment. The drought deepened these strategies, pushing many households
into depletion o f essential assets -land, livestock - and o f social and human capitals.

Vulnerability interms o f food insecurity i s one dimension inthe context o f livelihood hazards in
the rural and urban economy but it i s also very important to understand that not all vulnerabilities
relate to food security. A major structural determinant o f vulnerability i s the inaccessibility to and
the destruction o f the productive, public and private infrastructure and assets inmany areas o f the
rural and urban economy.

Caution i s necessary inorder not to confuse the apparent recovery in selected agricultural sectors
with the situation o f all rural livelihood systems. Improvements for some may have deepened the
vulnerability o f others, e.g. the drilling o f boreholes that may threaten the water sources o f more
vulnerable farmers or the access to potable drinking water for certain groups. Likewise, the
landless poor are not necessarily more vulnerable than farmers who mainly depend on their
livelihood from this agricultural land. The landless may have developed a more diversified
pattern o f on-farm and off-farm income sources than the farmer who mainly depends on his
agricultural production.

With the understanding that livelihoods are dynamic and complex realities, it should be realized
that their composition cannot be assumed or taken for granted. The range o f vulnerabilities i s
vast, deep and potentially expanding and changing, and these concerns have to be addressed
systematically. In this context, building knowledge, developing sectoral and inter-sectoral
policies and strategies, strengthening government coordination and monitoring mechanisms, and
establishing functional management information systems within the Government are key
requirements. Inthis context it i s considered to be o f key importance that structural synergies are
established and maintainedbetween the various national programs.

General consensus exists between the Government and the international partners about the
importance o f an employment-based safety net, through labor-based public works interventions.
This is reflectedinthe Government's National Investment Plan and inthe assistance providedby
the international humanitarian and assistance community. Duringthe last couple o f years various
labor-intensive Cash For Work (CFW) and Food For Work (FFW) infrastructure works projects
were implemented. It i s recognized that these interventions have achieved their purpose as a
safety net. But these programs were less effective from a developmental point o f view.

There i s an increasing need to relate the safety net function o f these labor-intensive public works
programs to the development objectives o f the Government. Re-building and maintaining the
country's public infrastructure should be undertaken within a coherent functional framework that
enables the durable development and sustainable maintenance o fthe infrastructure assets.

2.       NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

2.1      The NationalDevelopmentFramework

The Government's development priorities are reflected in the National Development Framework (NDF).
The development strategy i s basedon three pillars:

         1. Humanitarian assistance and social policy to create conditions for the people to live secure
            and to lay the foundations for the formation of sustainable human capital.
         2. External assistance to build the infrastructure in the country and to develop its natural
            resources ina way that lays the basis for a private sector-led strategy o f sustainable growth.
         3. Development o f a competitive private sector, which becomes both the engine o f growth and
            the instrument o f social inclusion through the creation o f opportunities.

The Government identified twelve National Programs to articulate its development priorities within the
NDF. Within the context o f these National Programs a series o f priority sub-programs, and specific
projects within these sub-programs, were identified and these are elaborated inthe National Development
Budget (NDB).


2.2      TheNationalEmergencyEmploymentProgram

One o f the Government's national priority sub-programs i s the National Emergency Employment Program
(NEEP). This sub-program i s anchored within the National Development Plan (NDP) for Livelihoods and
Social Protection (LSP), which i s embedded in the first pillar o f the NDF. NEEP i s among the
Government's highest priorities for donor funding as the needs to be addressed under NEEP are
considered o f vital importance. The Government's high priority to NEEP i s reflected in the SY 1382
National Development Budget. US$ 41.8 million has been resources for NEEP under the Budget for
Livelihoods and Social Protectionfor SY 1382

NEEP will be the Govemment's main instrument to link the establishment o f a viable and
effective safety net for the vulnerable and deprived, to the development and protection o f the
country's rural public and productive infrastructure. The long-term development objective, to
which NEEPwill contribute, i s formulated as follows:

    Development of the localproductive capacity in the perspective of longer-term
      economic growth, based on investment policies steered towards employment
  creation for the poor and the development of the country's physicalinfrastructure
                              through a private sector-led strategy.

The contribution o f NEEP to the long-term development objective should thus not only be
perceived in relation to the provision o f short-term employment opportunities. Through NEEP
increased and improved access to local markets, schools, clinics and productive agricultural land
will be provided and natural resources will be protected and developed. This will have a
significant positive effect and impact on the social and economic well being o f the population.

Within this overall development objective, NEEP's specific objectives are:
I. SocialProtectionobiective:Increasedsocialprotectionforanestimated5-6millionofthe
      most vulnerable people inAfghanistan through the provision o f employment opportunities.

11. Economic Development objective: Increased economic livelihood opportunities for the
      poor through increased access to public and productive infrastructure services, facilities and
      assets.

111. Capacitv Development obiective: Increased technical and management capacity in the
      government sector and the private sector with regards to resource allocation, planning,
      implementation and monitoring o f infrastructure works.

NEEP will not able to address the entire spectrum o f livelihoods issues that needto be resolved.
With interventions limited to the development andmaintenance o f physical infrastructure, not all
the vulnerable groups can be directly reached through NEEP. Construction activities under NEEP
primarily require the input o f an able-bodied workforce and there may be less scope for the
disabled to participate in the mainstream o f these works. Other types o f programs and projects
may be more suitable to reach these groups (like small entrepreneur development, vocational and
skill development). A key element in NEEP's strategy however should be a focus on approaches
that specifically target the disabled and other particularly vulnerable groups.

3.       CORE PRINCIPLES OFTHE STRATEGY

The NEEP strategy i s based on a number o f general principles and principles related to
institutional sustainability, social targeting and infrastructure development. The general principles
apply to the various NEEP-specific principles.

1. General principles
    1.1, Accountability and transparency
    1.2. Effectiveness and competitiveness
    1-3. Coherence

    3.4. Equality inopportunity for the targeted population
    3.5. Adherence to international labor standards and conventions
    3.6. Setting wage rates at level o f unskilledagricultural labor inagricultural slack season
    3.7. Timing, location and size o f activities designed to avoid competition for unskilled labor
    33. Specific targeting through the selection o fappropriate labor-based activities
    3.9. Specific targeting through piece work and task work implementationmodalities

4. Infrastructuredevelopmentprinciples
    4.1. Quality and durability
    4.2. Functionality
    4.3, Available capacities for planning,implementationand supervision
    4.4. Competitive biddingincontracting works to private contractors or NGOs
    4.5. Multi-year planning and resource allocation mechanisms linking physical planning and
          available resources
    4.6. Planning, prioritisation and selection based on rational processes, including economic
          criteria and usingobjectively verifiable information.
    4.7. Labor productivity as basis for costing infrastructure works and the payment o f laborers
    4.8. Infrastructure works' life-cycle costs to be considered, including maintenance costs
    4.9. Prioritisation o f still maintainable infrastructure

All above principles should be considered in the strategy. Chapter four describes current issues
relatedto these principles outlines strategies to address these issues.


4.    STRATEGIC ISSUES AND APPROACHES

4.1      InstitutionalIssues

There i s insufficient      Government ownership in coordinating, directing and executing
development activities. Existing coordination mechanisms exist among the international
assistance community but these are not very transparent and do not always have an output-
oriented and time-bound agenda. The coordination structures are fragmented and are not
consideredto be very effective and efficient interms o f institutional sustainability. There i s a lack
o f accountability, coherence, cost-effectiveness and quality in programming, planning and
implementingdevelopment programs and projects.

The current system o f donor-channelled resource allocation for infrastructure investments lacks
transparency and i s not very efficient or effective in ensuring a balanced programming and funds
allocation. There i s also insufficient compliance by donors to Government executingmodalities.

Due to the absence of effective information and reporting systems inthe Government, the quality
o f decision making at strategic level i s negatively affected. This leads to a sub-optimum


                                                   89

 allocation o f available resources. At operational level there i s a lack o f quality and uniformity in
 standards, guidelines and procedures. This leads to a low cost-effectiveness o f the investments in
infrastructure works, a reduced lifetime and increased maintenance costs. Problems are further
aggravated because o f the limited capacity within the Government. As institutional capacity
buildingwithin the Government is a prerequisite for sustainable development, it is required that
more assistance is provided by the international donor community for capacity building.Figure 2
presents a flow chart indicating the relation between the four core institutional issues and the
various steps inthe NEEP cycle.

4.2.1    Coordination and Management

To provide an effective framework for coordination and decision-malung, an Inter-ministerial
Board will be established. A Joint Program Management Unit will be responsible for the day-to-
day management o f NEEP. External support will be provided by qualified agencies and
organisations. At Provincial level Government-led Technical Support Units will coordinate and
supervise the implementation of the infrastructure works. Figure 3 presents the proposed
institutional framework for NEEP.

The Joint Program Management Unit (JPMU)will be responsible for the day-to-day management
o f NEEP. Key line Ministries represented inthe Board will be invited to have a representation in
the JPMU. With support from key partners, the JPMU will establish, develop and manage the
Program. Main roles and functions o f the JPMU will be:

Supporting partners will provide assistance based on their comparative strength. Qualified
national and international staff will give support in the fields o f social process management,
community mobilization and capacity building. Other agencies will have a leading role in
providing technical assistance with regards to physical planning, designing, cost-estimation,
supervision and monitoring o f the physical infrastructure works. An oversight consultant will be
appointed for contract management to ensure that sound, and internationally acceptable,
competitive biddingsystems are applied. The oversight consultant will also provide assistance to
the Government inexecuting its financial control o f the Trust Fundthat will be established.

At the Provinciallevel Technical Support Units(TSU) will be establishedto implement the labor-
based infrastructure development projects within the NEEP framework. The TSUs will be
composed of the Provincial Directors o f the line ministries that are represented inthe JPMU, the
Provincial Governors and key implementingpartners. The TSUs will be responsible for managing
and supervising the implementation o f NEEP projects. Specific roles and functions o f the TSU
will be:

4.2.2    ExecutingModalitiesandFundingMechanism

In executing projects within the NEEP structure, the Implementing Partners will follow the
Government's principles regardingthe execution o f the National DevelopmentBudget. Two main
principles apply:

1, All funds are channelledthrough the NationalDevelopmentBudget (NDB);
2. If donors don't course funds through NDB, they will accept the Government's executing
     authority

Projects inthe National Development Budget will be prioritised according to adherence to above
principles. Where neither principle i s agreed, the project will not be prioritised.

The Government will establish a Trust Fundto ensure that funds are allocated and distributed in
accordance with the principles and directions provided inthe strategy. Funds channelled through
the Government or directly sourced by donors to NGOs or other non-Government implementing
partners, should be used efficiently and effectively. Intermediate sub-contracting layers should be
avoided. The already operational Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund(ARTF) will be used as
the Trust Fund for NEEP. A transparent system o f multi-year planning and budgeting will be
applied, linkmgphysical planningto financial resource allocation.

Through NEEP and its Trust Fundmechanism, the Government will gain control inprogramming
and allocating funds for infrastructure development. The Government National Development
Budget for NEEP reflects the intention to gradually increase its control over this process. During
SY1382 the proposedbudget is relatively small to allow the NEEP structure to be established and
to develop.

Duringthis first year, programmingand fundallocationthrough NEEP's structure will enable the
Government to allocate sufficient funds to prioritisedvulnerable groups and to sectors. Itwill also
give the Government an instrument to correct unbalances in fund allocations caused by the
currently fragmented way in which donors and implementing partners operate. Gradually, the
Government will expand the budget o f the Trust Fundand NEEP will become more the steering
mechanism.

The Trust Fundwill eventually be comprised o f a general fund and sectoral sub-funds.This will
enable donors, who target resources sectorally, to fund directly and have specific sets o f criteria
for allocation and disbursement. In case o f national emergencies (like earthquakes) or shifting
Government priorities, NEEP's National Board will review potential re-allocations between the
sectoral sub-funds.

Apart from the general fund and the sectoral sub-funds, the Trust Fundwill also include a limited
Quick Response Fund (QRF). This QRF will be used to meet funding requirements o f high
priority projects that require a quick response and cannot be accommodated within the framework
o f the NEEP regular planning and implementation cycle. During 1382 the Trust Fund will be
mainly a general fund to enable the Government to direct resources in geographical areas or
sectors that are relatively under-resourced. A schematic presentation o f the Trust Fund set-up i s
presentedinfigure 4.

4.2.3   CapacityBuilding

To enable an efficient, transparent and effective management and coordination o f NEEP,
sufficient resources will have to be allocated for capacity building activities. Capacity building
will focus on strengthening and developing methodologies, supporting systems andresources.


    A. Methodologies: Effective and uniformmethodologies will be developed for:

    9 Financialcontrol
    P Strengthening anddeveloping the informationdatabase
    9 Datacollectionandprocessing(including progressreporting)
    9 Beneficiary targeting (including vulnerabilityheeds assessment and programming
        methods)
    9 Planning, designing, cost-estimation andcontracting labor-basedinfrastructure works
    9 The involvement of the private sector in the implementation of infrastructure works
        through internationallyaccepted competitivebidding.

4.3       SocialTargeting Issues

Although various vulnerability assessments were conducted, much uncertainty remains about
their quality and accuracy. In addition, these assessments predominantly focussed on the food
security aspects of vulnerability. The adaptation of livelihood strategies in the present unsettled
situation i s also not reflected in the vulnerability analysis nor i s coherent information available
about actual needs and preferences of the targeted vulnerable groups. The lack of accurate and
complete information and the absence of an effective targeting strategy are serious constraints to
the effectiveness ofthe present social protectioninterventions.


4.4      SocialTargeting Strategy

4.4.1    Vulnerability Assessment

A precondition for an effective social targeting strategy is a comprehensive database that will
provide information requiredfor the development of effective social targeting methodologies and
approaches. Within the framework of the recently established National Livelihoods and Social
Protection Surveillance System, comprehensive vulnerability assessments will be undertaken on a
yearly basis. Through these assessments, key indicators o f vulnerability will be collected. Those
include quantitative indicators of accessibility to infrastructure facilities, services and assets. This
information, in combination with data on the geographical distribution of the population in
general and the targeted vulnerable groups inparticular, will form the basis for the programming
and resource allocation.

4.4.2    Resource Allocation

To ensure an equitable distribution of NEEP's available resources among the targeted
beneficiaries, specific resource allocating formulae will be used. Inthe absence of comprehensive
and consolidated vulnerability indicators at Provincial and District level, resource allocations will
initially be based on total Provincial population figures. A distinction i s made between rural and
urban areas. For fund allocations to rural areas the followingprocedure will be applicable:

         Collect, validate and consolidate available information on the size of the ruralpopulation
         per Provinceand calculate the proportionofthe Provincial population(P,) as a fraction of
         the total population (PJ;
         Collect, validate and consolidate quantitative information at Provincial level about
         current and committed wage resource allocations (inUS$) that are not covered under the
         NEEP budget for the different physical infrastructure sectors. Calculate the wage
         resource allocations per Province (W,) and summarize the wage resource allocations of
         all the Provinces (Wp-total);
         Add the NEEP national rural budget for wages        (WNEEp)   to W,+,,~.  This gives the total
         national available budget for wages in rural labor-based physical infrastructure
         development works;
         Calculate the Provincial NEEP Budget (NEEPprovincia1),applying the following formulae:




Subject to the available o f data, the same procedure can subsequently be applied for resource
allocation within the Districts of a Province. The resource allocation procedures can be further
refined once comprehensive and quantitative information will be available at Provincial and
District level on vulnerability indicators and needs assessments.



                                                  96

To ensure an appropriate balance between NEEP's social objective and its infrastructure
development objective, it i s envisaged that at least 60% of NEEP's investment resources per
Province should be allocated for the payment of wages. NEEP pilot projects with a particular
purpose may be exempted from this overall directive.

Inurbanareas arelatively limitedNEEPwill beimplemented. During1381approximately twenty
million labor-days of work were generated through labor-intensive public works programs, of
which 10%was generatedthrough urban-basedprograms. For 1382 also about 10% of the NEEP
National Development Budget will be allocated for urban public infrastructure development
works. This will benefit an estimated 70,000 urban families through the provision o f employment.
Resource allocation procedureswill be similar to those for rural areas.

4.4.3    EqualOpportunityandAccess to Jobs

Core principles in developing effective social targeting mechanisms all relate to the principles of
equal opportunity and access to work, and equal pay for work of equal value. There should be no
discrimination against persons in their employment on the basis of their race, colour, sex,
religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin, or on any other basis set out in
national legislation.     These principles are related to human rights and are laid down in
international labor conventions, many o f which have been ratified by the Government o f
Afghanistan.

These principles have to be translated in guidelines that especially target the most vulnerable
people. These include the disabled and handicapped, returnees, IDPs, pastoralists, female-headed
households, the elderly and destitute women. For these vulnerable groups there are generally less
opportunities to participate in physically demanding infrastructure works. Women are also often
excluded fiom public labor-based projects because of religious and traditional noms and values.
To promote the participation of these groups in NEEP projects, the following measures are
proposed:

1. Specific national-level resource allocations o f NEEP's budget for wages to vulnerable
    groups. The proposed allocations reflect currently available data on the composition of the
    most vulnerable groups:

         5-10%to vulnerable disabled men and women who can participate inthe works
    ...
    ..
    .    5% to vulnerable disabled menandwomen who cannot participate inthe worksI6
         5% to vulnerable pastoralists
         5% to vulnerable returnees
         5-10% to destitute women and other vulnerable female-headedhouseholds
         65-75% to vulnerable able-bodied menand women, including ex-combatants.

2. Promoting the employment o f women and the disabled by carefully exploring the scope for
    incorporating activities where these groups can participate. Should women wish to participate
    in construction activities, up to 50% of the funds for wages will be allocated for female
    workers. Some examples o f activities where women and certain groups o f disabled can
    participate, are:
    .... Routinemaintenance of tertiary and secondary roads;
         Preparing dressed stones for road pavingwithin a confined compound inthe village
         Weaving gabion mattresses for gabion boxes within a confined compound inthe village
         Supervision o f the labor gangs


l6For infrastructure works that facilitate access for the disabled to facilities and services.

                                                       97

     ..
     .   Assisting Government staff with surveys and measurements
         Keeping attendance registers and muster rolls o fthe labor-force
     .   Storekeeping for construction materials and tools
         Managing tree nurseries that supply seedlings for forestation or soil conservation
         activities
         Plantationand care-taking o f seedlings

3. The introduction o f a task work system and a piecework system. A task i s a defined output
    over a certain period o f time for a certain activity (e.g. cleaning the side ditches along a
    defined section o f a road within a period o f seven days). A piece i s a defined unit o f output
    (e.g. one dressed stone with defined specifications). Under the task work system and the
    piecework system, wage payments will be related to the labor productivity (or output). This
    system will provide flexibility in workmg hours, as payments are not based on fixed working
    hours but on the achieved output.

4. Equal opportunity to access to jobs can only be achieved if the targeted population is well
    informed about the possibilities and conditions o f employment. This requires a properly
    designed and implementedinformation & communicationcampaign.

5. Recruitment procedures should be very transparent and should reflect the principle of equal
    opportunities inaccess. Ifthere are morejob seekers thanjobs, a monthlyjob rotation will be
    applied through a lottery system. To ensure equality of opportunity at the family level, only
    one able-bodied person per family will be eligible for employment at a time.

4.4.4    Timing, Scale andLocationof Activities

Proper timing and scaling o f activities are very important considerations inrelation to the social
targeting objective o f NEEP. The Program should not compete with other demands for casual
labor. Especially during the agricultural peak season implementation agencies and their partners
have to assess carefully the local situation o f labor supply vis-&vis requirements. If necessary,
operations should be scaled downs during this period or even be suspended (except maintenance
activities).

Works are to be located in the vicinity o f the areas where the targeted population lives. The
purpose o f the Program i s not to increase the suffering o f the already vulnerable population by
locating activities far away from their homes. Experiences indicate that works should be located
within a radius o f 5-8 kilometres from the targeted community. To avoid inequity in resource
allocation and possible undesirable effects o f differences in approaches, projects under NEEP's
National Development Budget will be initially targeted to those areas that are not served yet by
other major relevant programs like NSP and NABDP.

4.4.5    Wage Ratesand Payments

Wage rates and payment modalities constitute important social targeting instruments. Ifthe wage
rates are set to high, the social targeting objective will not be achieved. Ifthe rates are set too low,
productivities will decrease and the Program will be perceived as a welfare program rather than
an infrastructure program. The convention on the protection o f wages stipulates that wages should
be paid in cash money. Where wages are paid partially in the form o f allowances in kind, they
should be appropriate for the personal use and benefit o f the worker and his or her family, and




                                                   98

 fair value should be attributed to such allowance^'^. Wage rates will be set andpaidinaccordance
 with the following conditions:

 1. Men and women should receive equal pay for work of equal value.
 2. Currently available information suggests that the minimum daily wage for unsllled casual
     labor should not be below US2.0, or the equivalent inanother currency or inkind.
 3.  Wage rates will be set at Provincial level and will be based on prevailing wage rates for
     unskilledagricultural labor duringthe agriculturalslack season.
 4. The preferred payment modality of wages i s cash. Where food and cash resources are
     available, at least 50% of the daily wages shall be paid in cash. The food portion of a daily
     wage shall not exceed four kilogramof wheat per worker.
 5.  Wages shall be paid on time and infull. The preferred frequency o fpayments i s monthly.

Projects within the framework of NEEP should not be implemented or significantly be scaled
down in those areas and/or duringthose periods in the year where or when daily wage rates for
unskilledlabor are significantly higherthan the set daily wage.

Mixed FFWICFW schemes or FFW schemes will be limitedto areas with acute or very highfood
insecurity, to be agreed upon between the Government and WFP. The location and the timing of
constructionactivities under such schemes should reflect the seasonalvariation infood insecurity.
In the identification of these projects preference will be given to those that can absorb large
numbers of targeted people, without inducing undesired migration to the worksites. FFW
payment modalities will not be applied inmaintenance schemes. Maintenance works will be fully
carried out through CFW activities. FFW schemes will only be approved if all the funding
resourcesare securedto complete that scheme ina functional way.

4.4.6    Labor Productivity

To ensure that men and women receive equal pay for work of equal value, it i s very important
that payments are linked to established and appropriate labor-productivities. This will also
improve transparency and increase productivity. The advantage o f a remuneration system based
on productivity over daily wage payment i s that it ensures cost predictability, minimizes
supervision, maximizes productivity and maximizes income and flexibility for workers. Pending
the outcome of a planned labor productivity survey, the labor productivity norms as applied by
the GovernmentAJNOPS will be the reference standard. An exception will be the payment system
for the disabled workers where wages will be fixed on a daily basis. Generally, the work to be
done by these workers i s of a different nature than the work done by the able-bodied workers and
it will be often impossibleto set daily, productivity-related,tasks for these workers.




l7In 1963 a principle agreement was reached between the ILO andWFP that, inthe case o fWFP projects
involving the employment of wage labor, the workers should receive, in addition to the food supplied, a
cash payment of not less than 50% o f the wage prevailing in the locality for the kind o f work to be done.
This requirement was intended to ensure that workers would be able to meet essential non-food needs, and
would not be led to sell or barter the WFP food received.

5.       OUTPUTS,ACTIVITIESAND STAFFINGINPUTS

Table 1 presents the framework relationships between: a) NEEP's specific objectives as
mentioned in paragraph 1.2.1; b) the expected outputs at the end o f SY 1382; and c) the main
activities that are requiredto achieve these outputs.

Indicated outputs reflect the resourced budget under the NEEP National Development Budget o f
the National Investment Plan (see figure 1) and the food resources available through WFP's
Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation (approximate value o f these food resources: US$49
million).

The substantial additional outputs with regards to the creation o f employment opportunities and
the development o f infrastructure covered under other National Development Budgets and
fundingchannels are not incorporated inthe table 1.

For the development o f the methodologies, support systems and resources, available Government
inputs will need to be mobilized. Considerable external support will be required as well to
strengthen the Government's capacity in the management o f NEEP. Table 2 outlines the
envisaged minimumkey full-time personnel inputrequirements for the JPMU during SY 1382.

Apart from these minimum staffing input requirements, a representation o f the participating
Ministries in the JPMU will be needed to ensure adequate communication, coordination and
dissemination o f information. Support staff will be required for the day-to-day management o f the
office.

Additional short-term external support will be required for the development o f a number o f
methodologies and for strengthening the database by conducting a number o f base-line studies
and surveys.

To enable the implementation o f NEEP duringthe SY 1382 construction season it will be critical
that the following activities are completed by the end o fApril 2003:

    Establishthe Inter-Ministerial Board and the Joint ProgramManagementUnit.
    Secure the operational budget for the Joint Program Management Unit
    Recruitment and secondment o f staff to the Joint ProgramManagementUnit
    Procurement o f equipment and transport for the Joint Program Management
    Finalize the draft short-term strategy through a consultative process (including workshops)
    withthe Government stakeholders, implementingpartners, UNagencies and donors.
    Consolidate available data and information required for the programming o f resources.
    Develop operational guidelines and procedures.

        WAGE RATESAND PARTICIPATION OFWOMEN AND DISABLED


Wage Rates

      Wage rate i s critical decision variable in NEEP and it should serve as an instrument for
      self targeting. Besides providing livelihood security, it should help generate productive
      and durable infrastructure.

      L o w wage rates facilitate self selection and minimizes the need for rationing. But very
      low wage rates affect quality o f assets and NEEP works are primarily post-conflict
      reconstruction works.

      Highwage rates leadto excess demand andthis leads to rationing; which in-tumbecomes
      problematic as un-fair practices creep-in once rationingbecomes a norm.

      Highwage rates are likely to exclude the most needy and maximizes bothinclusion and
      exclusion errors. The vulnerable groups' share in wage bill will be lowered on account
      o f fall innumber o f days o f employment for a given budget. It may disrupt the existing
      labor market and may adversely effect the other economic activities. It may even result
      in a high cost economy and make the domestic products non-competitive. Highwage
      rates may induce adoptiono f capital intensive technologies displacing labor.

      The market wage for unskilled workers inlean season ina province be the upper limit for
      wage rates under NEEP inthat province.

      Piece work system and task work system be given preference since labor productivity per
     hour will be high. It also ensures equal pay for work o f equal value. The gender equality
      concems can be taken care of. It also makes monitoring task easy and ensures flexibility
      inwork timings.

      Cash payments o f wages i s desirable since it leaves greater flexibility for household level
      expenditure allocation decisions. It also avoids logistic problems o f distribution o f food
      (kind) and more so in an environment with weak institutional base.               Monthly or
      fortnightly payments depending on the local preferences be adopted. Only during crisis
      situations like drought, both cash and kindpayments be considered.

     NEEP works should be preferably taken up during agricultural lean seasons to avoid
     competition between NEEP and agriculture works. However, maintenance works can be
     taken up inall seasons.

     Village or settlements with very high market wage rates even for unskilled workers
     should not receivepriority under NEEP. Preference can be accorded to those areas where
     no other major workhnfrastructure development projects are in operation and the areas
     identified as the most inaccessible and vulnerable.

     Inthe case of secondary roads, iflabor have to move away from their village for longer
     period, wage rates be billed to compensate for the social costs.



                                               106

   0   Equally important i s creation o f an enabling environment through NEEP by display o f
       information on project costs, wage rates, material cost, etc. in local language and social
       audit will facilitate accountability o f the contractors to the communities..

Involvement of Women and Disabled


   0   Women participation in public works in Afghanistan is more a socio-cultural issue and
       with out the consent o fthe community women cannot take part inpublic and laborbased
       works. However, some o f the experiences o f NGOs like CARE in central Afghanistan
       reveal that the community support can be mobilized. Certain types o f works which
       women like to do exclusively as a group without the presence o f males have to be
       initiated inthe NEEP. Under irrigation sub-projects women and disabled can be involved
       inweaving o f gabion baskets. Disabled can also take up the collection and carrying of
       baskets through horse drawn carriages to the site, Stone dressing and nursery raising are
       some other activities where in women and disabled can be involved. Under tertiary
       roads, works closer to the settlement be contracted out to women. Disabledbe involved in
       activities such as clearing the road side bushes etc.


   0   Women Social Animators through PRA techniques can elicit the views on choice o f
       schemes/works, work sharing, institutional arrangements for workfare and time
       preferences Women can be even involved inmicro-project design as well. Dialogue and
                    .
       negotiations with community can help seek the approval for women's participation.
       Local NGOs be given training in use o f PRA methods by the International and National
       NGOs like CARE and DACAR . In areas where PRA exercises can not be carried out
       focus group discussions be attempted.


   0   To promote the participation of women and disabled in NEEP, certain proportion funds
       from the Bank be earmarked exclusively for these vulnerable groups.( 20 %). Ifincertain
       regions community acceptance i s not forth coming then that part o f the funds be
       transferred to the areas where women are allowed to take up works.           Such allocation
       norms may result in institutional innovations in identifying suitable schemes for women
       inthe specific socio-cultural context.


   0   Piece work system i s most desirable mode due to its flexibility intime allocation between
       household chores andjob.

                ENVIRONMENTAND SOCIALSAFEGUARDSFRAMEWORK

 I. Objectives

 This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework provides general policies, guidelines,
 codes of practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of the proposed World
 Bank supported National Emergency Employment Program - Rural Roads in Afghanistan.
 Consistent with existing national legislation, the objective o f this Framework i s to help ensure
 that activities underthe proposedreconstruction operation will:


 0        Protect humanhealth;
 0        Prevent or compensateany loss of livelihood;
 0        Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual subprojects or their
          cumulative effects;
 0        Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,
 0        Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguardpolicies.

 11.      GeneralPrinciples

 Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed project, and the related need for providing
 immediate employment, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing potential
 environmentaland social risks, this Framework i s basedon the followingprinciples:

     1. The proposed project will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs of which
         may not be known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application of the World Bank's
          safeguard policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during
          implementation for the selection and design of subprojects, and the planning o f
         mitigation measures;

     2. The proposed project will not support environmental Category A ~ubprojects'~,nor
          subprojects requiring land acquisition affecting 200 or more people. Consequently, no
         Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) or Resettlement Action Plans (RAPS)will be
         required. All proposed subprojects will be screenedto ensure that the environmental and
          social risks can be adequately addressed through the application o f standardized
         guidelinesand codes o fpractice;

     3. Activities requiring a more detailed level of assessment, such as new road construction
         (or, related, significantly expanded, infi-astructure), will be supported under subsequent
         operations;

     4. Project design and subproject selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity
         between ethnic and religious groups, considering variations in population density.
         Employment opportunities within the sub-projects will be available on an equal basis to
         all, irrespective of gender, or ethnic or religious group. Inall sub-projects which require
         consultations with local communities or beneficiaries, gender-separated consultations

         will be conducted to elicit the views o fthe female population, along with that of the male
         population; and,

     5.  Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplifiedto meet the special needs of
         this project. Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this Environmental and Social
         Safeguards Framework will be disclosed in Afghanistan in Dari and Pashto, and in the
         World Bank Infoshop.

111.     Management of Social and EnvironmentalIssues under the Project

N o significant environmental impacts are anticipated as the Public Works Programonly involves
repair and rehabilitation of existing rural roads and related access infrastructure. The project i s
not expected to have any land acquisition or other adverse social impacts, but on the contrary
significant positive social impacts regarding improved livelihoods. The project i s national in
scope with a focus on vulnerable districts, and this will enable different ethnic groups to benefit
from the project. Since the project involves repair and rehabilitation of existing roads, it will not
impact historical or cultural artifacts. The project implementation manual will include project
screening, planning and appraisal formats, which will record the environmental and social
impacts and related mitigation measures for specific sub-projects. Monitoring will include
reporting on chance archeological finds. The project implementationmanual will be based on the
Environmental and Social SafeguardsFramework agreedbetween the Government and the Bank.

The relevant safeguards for this project are Environmental Assessment (OP4.0l),         Involuntary
Resettlement (OP/BP4.12), Indigenous Peoples (OD4.20), and Cultural Property (OPN11.03).
For all four safeguard policies, the project design follows the criteria and norms laid down inthe
"Revised Guidance Note on Application of Safeguard Policies for the Afghanistan Program".
Because individual subproject investments are not known in advance, GOA will adopt a
programmatic approach, with the following characteristics:

Environmental impacts
Impacts are expected to be those associated with the rehabilitation o f rural roads and
reconstruction o f very small infrastructure (i.e. culverts, stream crossings, retaining structures
etc.).  Such impacts will be addressed by incorporating standard environmental operating
procedures into the project manual and technical training courses. To this end, Environmental
Codes of Practice (ECOPs) will be developed to address environmental issues at design,
implementation and maintenance stages. ECOPs will incorporate mitigation measures which are
essentially based on sound engineering, such as erosion protection, provision o f adequate
drainage, keeping earthwork to a minimum, prevention o f shallow slope failures, etc.
Implementation will be pursued through terms o f reference and checklists for the implementation
consultants, who are also responsible for carrying out preliminary environmental screening
through on-site training and dissemination. Potential induced impacts in environmentally
sensitive areas will be assessedand documented inthe sub-project planning/appraisal format and
mitigation measures designed and implemented, if applicable. Inparticular, the project should
minimize the risk o f further depletion of forest areas resulting from improved access inprovinces
such as Laghman, Kunar, Nuristan, Paktia, and Badarskhan.

LandAcquisition and Resettlement
The activities to be undertaken under the proposed project involve rehabilitation of existing
secondary and tertiary roads that are not likely to involve any land acquisition or have any other
adverse social impacts. No involuntary resettlement i s anticipated. However, the project's
Operational Manual will include a fi-ee-standing guideline on land acquisition, and will include a



                                                 109

process framework for managing land acquisition of any type, voluntary or involuntary. Ifminor
pieces of land are needed in connection with construction of road structures or changes in road
alignments? they can only be obtained if the land in question i s govemment land, or though
voluntary donation (local authorities do not have funds to purchase land). The sub-project
planning/appraisal format inthe Project Technical Manual will includea check-list recordingany
amount of land made available by the govemment or privately donated, that the land i s free of
squatters or other encumbrances, and written proof incase the land i s privately donated, that it is
provided as a voluntary donation (see Attachment 2(ii) in the project (NEEP-RR) Safeguards
Framework). Confirmation o f voluntary surrender will be a criterion on the proposal review list
and will be supervised by the oversight consultants and independent monitors. Bank supervision
missions will verify that these guidelinesare followed.

Minorities andvulnerable groups
The project will not cause any adverse impacts on minorities, and the overall project design with
its targeting o f vulnerable districts within each province will help ensure that different ethnic
groups participate in the project and receive benefits from it. Within districts, inclusion of
different ethnic groups as beneficiaries in terms of both income generation through labor
contracts and improved connectivity will be addressed through the selection of specific sub-
projects so that these include roads that serve villages inhabited by different ethnic groups. After
the first year o f implementation, an assessment will be made o f whether this approach has
succeeded in providing benefits to different groups in ethnically mixed districts. Results and
recommendations from these studies and project monitoring in minority areas will be an agenda
item in project annual reviews. Project monitoring will also assess whether within-village
minorities are beingincluded among project beneficiaries.

Cultural Property
Chance archeological finds will be recorded in project monitoring formats, the implementing
agency will secure the artifact, and the Archeological Committee will be informed of the find.
Should the continuation of work endanger an archeological site, project activities will be
suspendeduntila solution i s found.

Mine RiskManagement
Subprojects will not be implemented without appropriate mine-risk management.                     Current
practice (evolved during field implementation) for managing mine risk have been robust. A GOA
procedure for mine risk management (based on these practices) in World Bank funded projects
has been sent for approval o f the Bank Safeguards. Once approved by the Bank and signed by
GOA,this will become a part of the project safeguard framework. All risk assessment and
clearance tasks shall be implemented in coordination with the Mine Action Center for
Afghanistan (MACA). These procedures may need to be amended in the future, depending on
evolving circumstances.

IV. SafeguardScreeningand Mitigation

The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation o f subprojects will be consistent
with the following guidelines, codes ofpractice andrequirements:




2o  Changes inexisting road alignments may be required to eliminate hazards to traffic or to ensure that a
    particular stretch o f road is passable throughout the year.

IV.     Responsibilitiesfor SafeguardScreeningandMitigation

Two Ministries will act as the implementing agencies for the proposed project, the Ministry of
Reconstruction and Rural Development and the Ministry o f Public Works. Each Ministrywill be
responsible for applying the safeguard screening and mitigation requirements to its own
subprojects.

Within each Ministry, a Safeguards Focal Point will be identified with responsibility for
overseeing the implementationof the Environmental and Social SafeguardsFramework.

The National Emergency Employment Program Coordination Unit (NEEPCU) in the MRRD
(being supported under this project) will ensure third-party tracking of implementation o f the
Framework.

V.      CapacityBuildingAndMonitoringOf SafeguardFrameworkImplementation

As part ofthe capacity buildingthat will be provided for implementationof the proposed project,
the Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministries will also receive
training in the application o f the Safeguard Framework and specifically during the development
and implementation o fthe ECOP.

To assist in this capacity building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the
application o f the Framework, GOAwill contract specialist social and environmental services
within its NEEPCU, and as part of its overall project implementation consultant's team. During
supervision of these operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the
Framework, and ifrequiredwill recommend additional strengthening.

The experience of the Labor-based Public Works (LIPW) component under the ongoing
Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (ECEPWP) will be reviewed
with regardto environmentalissues, landacquisition and other social safeguards issues.

VI.     ConsultationandDisclosure

This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework reflects consultations with the principal
NGOs and development partners participating inreconstructionactivities inAfghanistan. It will
be disclosed by GOAin both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be made
available at the World Bank's Infoshop.




                                                111

Since no other separate environmental or social assessments will be prepared for activities under
the proposed project, no additional disclosure requirements will apply. Inthis regard, however, it
i s worth noting that GOAintends to make all project documentation publicly available through the
Afghan Information Management System (AIMS).

        Guidelinesfor LandandAsset Acquisition, EntitlementsandCompensation

I.Objectives

Land acquisition will be kept to a minimumand no person will be involuntarily displaced under
subprojects financed by the proposed project.          Subproject proposals that would require
demolishing houses or acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize or
avoid their impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor
expansion along rights o f way should be reviewed carefully. No land or asset acquisition may
take place outside o f these guidelines. A format for Land Acquisition Assessment i s attached as
Attachment 2(i).

These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons to ensure that
all such persons negatively affected, regardless o f their land tenure status, will be assisted to
improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or production capacity to
pre-project levels.

Categorization

Based on the number o f persons that may be affected by the project (Project Affected People,
PAPs) and the magnitude o f impacts, projects may be categorizedas S-1, S-2, or S-3 projects:

    a.       S-1 projects are those that will involve the resettlement o f more than 200 PAPs and
             where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. Such interventions
             will be ineligible for support under the proposed emergency reconstruction
             operations.

    b.       S-2 projects are those which will involve the resettlement o f less than 200 persons. In
             such cases, the following documentation i s required: (1) a land acquisition
             assessment, (2) the Minutes or record o f consultations which assess the compensation
             claimed and agreement reached, and (3) a record o f the receipt o f the compensation,
             or voluntary donation, by those affected (see below).

    C.       S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant
             adverse social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and
             improved livelihoods are expected from such interventions.

11.Eligibility

PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood is directly or indirectly affected by the project.
PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are:

    (1)      those who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structureshuildings,
             including recognizedcustomary and traditional rights;

    (2)      those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufruct right
            rooted incustomary law;




                                                114

    (3)     those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall
            within (1) and (2) above, are eligible to assistance to restore their livelihood.

AcquisitionofProductiveAssets and Compensation

PAPSare eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as describedbelow:

        a.       Voluntary contributions. In accordance with traditional practices, individuals
              may elect to voluntarily contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or
              permanently from their land without compensation.

        b.      Contributions against compensation.          A contributorJasset loser considered
              "affected" will be eligible for compensation from the local community or
              alternatively from the Government.          A PAP shall lodge hisher claim for
              compensation to the local community representatives/shura head and it shall be
              verified by the implementing agency. The claim shall be lodged within 2 weeks o f
              completion o f the consultations with the concerned community, and before project
              implementationbegins.

Voluntary contribution, or contribution against compensation, should be documented.             The
documentation should specify that the land i s free o f any squatters, encroachers or other claims.
A format is attached inAttachment 2(i), which includes a Schedule to be followed to assess any
compensation claimed and the agreement reached.

111.CompensationPrinciples

The project implementing agencies shall ensure that any o f the following means o f compensation
are provided ina timely manner to affected persons:

(1)    Project affected persons losing access to a portion o f their land or other productive assets
       with the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at
       replacement cost for that portion of land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost
        assets will be according to following principles:

       a.     replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent
              productive assets;
       b.     materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;
       c.     replacement o f damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;
       d.     other acceptable in-kindcompensation;
       e.     in case o f cash compensation, the delivery o f compensation should be made in
              public, i.e. at the Community Meeting.

(2)    Project affected persons losing access to a portion of their land or other economic assets
       rendering the remainder economically non-viable, will have the options of compensation
       for the entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset,
       according to theprinciples in (1) a-d above.

ConsultationProcess

The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants o f land and owners o f assets located in
a proposed subproject area are consulted. There will be gender-separate community meetings for


                                                115

each affected mantuqu/gozur (urban infrastructure) or village (other projects) to inform the local
population about their rights to compensation and options available in accordance with these
Guidelines.   The Minutes o f the community meetings shall reflect the discussions held,
agreements reached, and include details o f the agreement, based on the format provided in
Attachment 2(ii) .

The implementing agency shall provide a copy o f the Minutes to affected persons and confirm in
discussions with each o f them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements
reached, and any eventual complaint.          Copies will be recorded in the posted project
documentation and be available for inspection duringsupervision.

Subproject Approval

In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the implementing
agency shall:

        a. not approve the subproject unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed
           between the affected person and the local community;
        b. not allow works to start until the compensation has been delivered in a satisfactory
            manner to the affected persons;
        c.  ifmore than 200 persons are affected and require compensation, the subproject shall
           be deemed ineligible for support under the emergency reconstruction operations.

Complaints and Grievances

All complaints should first be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local community/village
level. If this falls, complaints and grievances about these Guidelines, implementation o f the
agreements recorded in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged irregularity in carrying
out the project can also be addressed by the affected persons or their representative at the
municipal or district level. If this also fails, the complaint may be submitted to the relevant
implementing agency for a decision.

Verification

The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements o f compensation and evidence o f
compensation having been made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising
engineers, who will maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when
they undertake reviews and post-project assessment. This process shall be specified in all
relevant project documents, including details o f the relevant authority for complaints at
municipal/district or implementing agency level.

                                   Protectionof CulturalProDertv

Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works o f art, or sites o f "outstanding universal
value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point o f view,
including unrecorded graveyards and burial sites.          Within this broader definition, cultural
property i s defined as sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical,
architectural, or religious significance, andnatural sites with cultural values.

The proposedproject i s unlikely to pose a risk o f damaging cultural property, as the sub-projects
will largely consist repair and reconstruction o f existing secondary and tertiary rural access
infrastructure. Further, the negative list o f attributes, which would make a subproject ineligible
for support (Attachment l),    includes any activity that would significantly damage non-replicable
cultural property. Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection from theft,
and treatment o f chance finds should be followed and included instandard bid documents.

ChanceFindProcedures

Chance find procedures are defined in the law on Maintenance o f Historical and Cultural
Monuments (Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and responsibilities
o f cultural heritage agencies if sites or materials are discovered in the course o f project
implementation. This law establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and cultural
artifacts are state property, and further:

     1. The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment o f historical and cultural
         monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministry o f Information
         and Culture, which has representation at provincial level.

     2. Whenever chance finds o f cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are
         made the Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation of
         work endanger the historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended
         untila solutionis foundfor the preservation o fthese artifacts.

     3. If a moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found in the countryside o f a
         province, the provincial governor (wali) or district in-charge (woluswal) should be
         informed within two weeks, and they should inform the Archaeological Committee. In
         case the immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found in a city, the provincial branch
         o f the Department o f Maintenance o f Historical Values o f the Ministry o f Information
         and Culture should be informed within two weeks (art. 18). Ifthe find is made within the
         center, the Archaeological Committee must be informed directly within one week (art.
        25).

     4. Failure to report a chance find within the stipulated time limit will be punished with a
         fine or imprisonment for a period o f one week or up to one month (art. 72).

     5. If someone intentionally damages a historical or cultural artifact, the culprit shall pay
        compensation in accordance with the value o f the artifact plus be imprisoned for a period
        o f one month to ten years depending on the gravity o f the crime (art. 71).




                                                  120

In case o f a chance find of moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact, the
implementing agency i s responsible for securing the artifact from theft, pilferage and damage
untilthe responsibilityhasbeentaken over bythe relevant authorities as specified above.

These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when
applicable.  During project supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor that the above
regulations relating to the treatment o f any chance find encounteredare observed.

Relevant findings will be recorded in World Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and

   Proceduresfor MineRiskManagementinWorldBankFundedProjectsinAfghanistan


Background:

The following procedures are designed to respond to the risks caused by the presence o f mines in
Afghanistan, inthe context of:
         Community rehabilitation / construction works to be identified and implemented by the
         communities themselves (for small projects o f up to $100,000 each);
         Small and medium-size works to be identified by local authorities and implemented by
         local contractors (for projects up to $5m each);
          Works to be implementeddirectly by Government departments/agencies,without use o f
         contractors;
         Large works to be implementedby contractors (for projects above $5m);

General comment applying to all following procedures: All risk assessment and clearance tasks
shall be implemented in coordination with the Mine Action Center for Afghanistan (MACA).
These procedures may need to be amended inthe future depending on evolving circumstances.

Procedurefor Community-ManagedWorks

Applicability: This procedure applies to community rehabilitation I construction works to be
identified and implementedby the communities themselves (for small projects o f up to $100,000
each).

Overall approach: The communities should be responsible for making sure that the projects they
propose are not in mine-contaminated areas, or have been cleared by M A C A (or a mine action
organization accredited by MACA).

Rationale: Communities are best placed to know about mined areas in their vicinity, and have a
strong incentiveto report them accurately as they will carry out the works themselves.

Procedure:

1. Communities are required to submit a reply to a questionnaire regarding the suspected
presence o f mines in the area where Bank-funded community-managed projects will be
implemented. This questionnaire should be formally endorsed by the Mine Action Program for
Afghanistan(MAPA).       It will be a mandatory attachment to the project submission by the
communities and should be signed by community representatives and the external project
facilitator. External project facilitators will receive training from MAPA. Financing agreements
with the communities should make clear that communities are solely liable in case of a mine-
relatedaccident.

2. If community certifies that there is no known mine contamination inthe area, the ministry
       the
responsible for the selection o f projects should check with MACA whether any different
observation i s reported on MACA's data base.




                                                  123

             o IfMACA's information is the same, the project can go ahead for selection. The
                 community takes the full responsibility for the assessment, and extemal
                 organizations cannot be made liable incase o f an accident.

             o IfMACA's information is different, the project should not go ahead for selection
                 as long as MACA's and community's statements have not beenreconciled.

3. Ifthe community suspects mine contamination inthe area,

             o If the community has included an assessment / clearance task in the project
                 agreed to be implemented by MACA (or by a mine action organization
                 accredited byMACA), the project can go ahead for selection.

             o Ifthe community has not included an assessment / clearance task in the project,
                 the project should not go ahead for selection as long as this has not been
                 corrected.

             o Mine clearance tasks must be implemented by MACA or by a mine action
                 organization accredited by MACA. Communities will be penalized (subsequent
                 funding by World-Bank funded projects shall be reduced or cancelled) if they
                 elect to clear mines on their own.

Procedurefor SmallandMedium-sizeWorks ContractedOut

Applicability: This procedure applies to small- and medium-size works to be identified by local
authorities and implementedby local contractors (for projects up to $5m each).

Overall approach: MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) should provide
detailed information on the mine-related risks (either based on previously done and updated
general survey or on a new general survey) before projects are considered for selection. Only
project sites assessed to have a nil-to-low risk would be eligible for selection, unless they have
been demined by MACA or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA.

Rationale: Neither local authorities nor local contractors have the capacity to assess the mine-
related risks ina systematic way, while they may have incentives to underestimate them.


Procedure:

1. Prior to puttingup a project for selection, a general survey should be carried out by MACA
    (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) to assess mine-related risks in the area
    o f the project (this should include checking information available in the MACA data base).

2. If A C A provides information suggesting a nil-to-low risk in the proposed project area, the
       M
    project can go ahead for selection.

The contract between the responsible ministry and the contractor will include a clause stating that
in case of an accident, legal liability would be fully and solely borne by the contractor.

3.   IfMACA assesses a potentially highrisk inthe area (whether due to the presence ofmines
    or uncertainty),



                                                124

              o Ifthe project includes an assessment/ clearance task agreed to be implemented
                  by MACA (or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA), it can go
                  ahead for selection based on agreed fundingmodalities (clearance may be funded
                  either under a contract with a Bank-funded project or under existing donor
                  agreements with the mine action organization);

              o If the project does not included an assessment / clearance task, it should not go
                  ahead for selection as long as this has not been corrected.


Procedure for Works to be implemented directly by Government DepartmentdAgencies,
without use of contractors

Applicability: This procedure applies to works to be implemented directly by Government
departmentdagencies, without use o f contractors.

Overall approach: MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) should provide
detailed information on the mine-related risks (either based on previously done and updated
general survey or on a new general survey) before works or installation o f goods/materials are
carried out inany given area. Work would only be allowed to proceed inareas assessedto have a
nil-to-low risk, unless they have been demined by a mine action organization accredited by
MACA .

Rationale: Government departments and agencies responsible for providing services currently do
not have the capacity to assess the mine-related risks in a systematic way, and currently follow a
process of consulting with MACA prior to carrying out activities.

Procedure:

1.       Prior to carrying out work, the Government departmedagency will consult with MACA
to assess mine-related risks inthe area (this should include checking information available in the
MACA data base). Ifnot already done, a general survey shouldbe carriedout byMACA (or by a
mine action organization accredited by MACA)to assess mine-related risks inthe area.

2.       If providesdetailedinformationonmine-relatedriskswhichsuggestanil-to-low
           MACA
risk in the proposed area, the work can proceed. The Government would be solely liable in case
o f a mine-related accident.

3.       Ifinformation providedbyMACA cannot support the assessment of a nil-to-low riskin
the proposed area (whether due to the presence o f mines or uncertainty), works should not go
ahead before MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) carries out the
necessary further assessment and/or clearance for risks to be downgraded to nil-to-low, based on
agreed funding modalities (clearance may be funded either under a contract with a Bank-funded
project or under existing donor agreements with the mine action organization).




                                                 125

Procedure for Large Works Using Contractors

Applicability: This procedure applies to large works to be implemented by large contractors
(projects above $5m).

Overallapproach: The main contractor should be responsible for dealing with mine-related risks,
incoordinationwiththe UNMineAction Center.


Procedure:

1. As part of the preparation of the biddingdocuments, a general survey should be carried out
    by MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) on all the areas where
    contractors may have to work (broadly defined).          This survey should provide detailed
    information on mine-related risks in the various areas allowing for an un-ambiguous
    identification of areas that have a nil-to-low risk of mine/UXO contamination and areas
    where the risk is either higher or unknown. The survey should be financed out of the
    preparation costs of the biddingdocuments.

All survey information should be communicated to the bidders (with sufficient legal caveats so
that it does not entail any liability), as information for the planning o f their activities (e.g.,
location o f campsites, access roads to quarries).

2. Dependingon the nature and location of the project and on the available riskassessment, two
    differentoptions canbeused.

Option 1-Mine-clearance activities are part o f the general contract

    a. Based on the general survey results, a specific budget provision for mine action during
    constructioni s set aside as a separate provisional sum inthe tender documents for the general
    contract.

    b. As a separately identified itemin their bid, the bidders include a provision for a further
    detailed mine assessment and clearance duringconstruction.

    c. On the instruction of the Supervision Engineer and drawing on the specific provisional
    sum for mine action in the contract, the contractor uses one of several nominated sub-
    contractors (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) to be rapidly available on
    call, to carry out assessment prior to initiation of physical works inpotentially contaminated
    areas, and to conduct clearance tasks as he finds may be needed. The Contractor may also
    hire an international specialist to assist him in preparing and supervising these tasks. The
    Contractor is free to chose which o f the accredited sub-contractors to use, and he i s fully
    responsible for the quality o f the works and i s solely liable in case of accident after an area
    hasbeendemined.

    d. To avoid an "over-use" of the budget provision, the Contractor is requiredto inform the
    Supervision Engineerin writing (with a clearjustification o f the works to be carried out) well
    inadvanceofmobilizing the mine-clearingteam. The Supervision Engineer hasthe capacity
    to object to such works.




                                                 126

Option 2 -Mine-clearance activities are carried out under a separate contract

    a. Specific, separately-awarded contracts are issued for further surveying and/or clearing o f
    areas with a not-nil-to-low risk (under the supervision o f the Engineer) by specialized
    contractors (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA). The definition o f the areas
    to be further surveyed I cleared should be limited to those areas where any contractor would
    have to work, and should not include areas such as camp sites and quarrieslmaterial sites
    which are to be identified by the Contractor during and after bidding o f the works. As a
    result o f these further surveys and possibly clearance works, mine-related risk in the entire
    contract area i s downgraded to nil-to-low.

    b. The contract with the general Contractor specifies the extent o f the portion o f the
    construction site o f which the Contractor i s to be given possession from time to time, clearly
    indicating restrictions o f access to areas where the mine risk i s not nil-to-low.     It also
    indicates the target dates at which these areas will be accessible. Following receipt o f the
    notice to commence works from the Engineer, the Contractor can start work inall other areas.

    c. The general Contractor i s invited to include in its bid an amount for mine-security, to
    cover any additional survey I clearance he may feel necessary to undertake the works.

4. Incase o f an accident, a Boardo f Inquiryis assembled by M A C A to investigate on the causes
of the accident and determine liabilities. Large penalties should be applied on the Contractor if
the Board determines that the accident resulted from a breach o f safety rules.

5. All parties involved in this process are required to closely coordinate with M A C A and to
provide the Government, local communities, MACA, as well as any interested party the full
available information on mine-related risks that may reasonably be required (e.g., maps o f
identifiedminefields, assessments for specific areas).

EXECUTIVESUMMARY

Purpose
The purpose o f this Manual' i s to assist the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) to develop an
implementation plan and detailed procedures for a Labor Intensive Works Program (LIWP) a
component o f the Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (ECEPWP).
The secondphase of the work plans for inclusion of the MIWREfor Irrigationworks as well as a
role of MRRD for coordinated targeting of rural infrastructure. The Ministry of Martyrs and
Disabled will be an associated ministry to address the targeting of vulnerable disabled wage
earners and families where feasible.
The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) is to be specifically for the LIWP and has followed
the earlier generic forms of (PIMs) as a tool for implementing small public works inAfghanistan
under various aid initiatives reflecting policies of the Islamic Transitional Government of
Afghanistan (ITGA).


Objective
The objective of the LIWP i s to support economic recovery, using labor intensive mechanisms to
improve selectedrural infrastructure.
This will be achieved by:
         o providingemployment opportunities through labor-basedreconstructionactivities.
         o carrying out urgent reconstruction andrehabilitationworks for roadworks to improve
             rural transport; and

The outcomes of the component are expected to be improvements inrural infrastructure, which
will reduce transport costs providing lower input costs and higher profits to for agricultural
products, which would improve the basis for sustainable livelihoods. A major ancillary objective
will be the transfer of project implementation skills to MoPW counterparts, developing Afghan
capacity to carry out similar works at International standards for execution and financial
accountability.


Implementation
The Project would be implementedover an 12monthperiod. The LIWPwill be implementedby
the UNOPS with MOPW(MIWRE) for urgent, labor-based, rehabilitation work such as road
rehabilitation and small structure repair.



Selected Provinces
The ITGA's intention is to ensure a wide distribution o f reconstruction support around the
country within the practical constraints o f the roadinfrastructure sectors and proposed
interventions, which will be supported by other donors. All Provinces of Afghanistan have been
targeted for these activities.


 The procedures documented inthis manual are based o n the 14-year UNOPS experience inRural
Rehabilitation inAfghanistan.


                                                129

Allocations
To ensure a needs-baseddistribution of Program funds, allocations to each o f the provinces has
been calculated on criteria related to the relative numbers of people residing in those provinces.
This Programo fUS$ 12,000,000 inthe first phase, will support labor intensivepublic works sub-
projects at three levels. Those community works less than $30,000; a majority of engineering
works up to $100,000; and a limitednumber of larger works.


Procurement,FinancialManagement,DisbursementandAudit Arrangements
Assistance with procurement, financial management and audit functions for the LIWP will be
provided by the UNOPS as the Implementing Agency (IA). Under LIWP a primary objective i s
to buildMinistry capacity for these functions. To ensure that functional capacity i s built up, the
Implementing Agency will provide training to key counterpart staff in the MOPW, as deemed
necessary to ensure they develop capacity to eventually carry out these core functions on their
own. This will be done though formal daily training sessions in addition to the hands-on project
work


Monitoringand Evaluation
The IA, will prepare and submit to the MOPW, quarterly progress reports showing progress
towards meeting implementation and development objectives for all the sub-projects they are
implementing. The external progressreporting of LIWPwill be the responsibility of the MOPW,
which will submit to the IDA.


EnvironmentalAnd SocialAspects
The principles governing social and environmental management will be applied through an
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (the Framework).
The sub-projects envisaged under the LIWP are not expected to generate significant negative
environmental effects. Rather, they should contribute to the improvement o f environmental
conditions. The Framework provides a list of items ineligible for support under the ECEPWP
and, by implication therefore, items which are not eligible investments for LIWP sub-projects to
financed under the ECEPWP. The Framework provides social and environmental mitigation
measuresto be incorporated inthe design, contracting and monitoring o f sub-projects.


ParticipatoryApproach
Participationand consultations with beneficiaries will take placethrough the traditional district
shuras/organizations inconjunction with the District administrations. Project design and sub-
project selection will aim at maintainingequity between various groups of the population.

INTRODUCTION

 1.1     Purpose
The purpose o f this Manual' is to assist the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) to develop an
implementation plan and detailed procedures for a Labor Intensive Works Program (LW) a
component o f the Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project (ECEPWP).
The secondphaseof the work plans for inclusionofthe MrWRE for Irrigation works as well as a
role of MRRD for coordinated targeting of rural infrastructure. The Ministry of Martyrs and
Disabled will be an associated ministry to address the targeting of vulnerable disabled wage
earners and families where feasible.
The Project ImplementationManual (PIM) has been drawn from a generic form of PIM designed
to be used for the World Bank financed works, as a tool for implementing small public works in
Afghanistan under various aid initiatives, reflecting policies of the Islamic Transitional
Government of Afghanistan (ITGA). The PIM would, off course, need to be reviewed and
possibly adapted to meet the requirements of additional donor agencies that may become
involved. This i s particularly true for the financial disbursementmechanism.


1.2      Objective
The objective of the LrWP is to support economic recovery, usinglabor intensive mechanisms to
improve selectedrural infrastructure.
This will be achievedby:
The outcomes of the component are expected to be improvements in road infrastructure, which
will reduce transport costs providing lower input costs and higher profits to for agricultural
products, which would improve the basis for sustainable livelihoods. A major ancillary objective
will be the transfer of project implementation skills to MoPW counterparts, developing Afghan
capacity to carry out similar works at International standards for execution and financial
accountability.

be loosely based on criteria related to the relative numbers o f people residing inthose provinces.
This Program of US$ 12,000,OO will support labor intensive public works sub-projects at three
levels.  Those community works less than $30,000; a majority o f engineering works up to
$100,000; and a limited number o f larger works.


 1.3.3. Procurement,FinancialManagement,DisbursementandAudit Arrangements
Procurement, financial management and audit functions for the LIWP will be provided by the
UNOPS as the ImplementingAgency (IA). Under LIWP a primary objective i s to buildMinistry
capacity for these functions. To ensure that functional capacity i s built up, the Implementing
Agency will provide training to key counterpart staff in the MOPW, as deemed necessary to
ensure they develop capacity to eventually carry out these core functions on their own. This will
be done though formal daily training sessions inaddition to the hands-on project work


1.3.4   Monitoring andEvaluation
The IA, will prepare and submit to the MOPW, quarterly progress reports showing progress
towards meeting implementation and development objectives for all the sub-projects they are
implementing. The external progress reporting o f LIWP will be the responsibility o f the MOPW,
which will submit to the IDA.


1.4     Environmental And Social Aspects
The principles governing social and environmental management will be applied through an
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (the Framework).
The sub-projects envisaged under the LIWP are not expected to generate significant negative
environmental effects. Rather, they should contribute to the improvement o f environmental
conditions. The Framework provides a list o f items ineligible for support under the ECEPWP
and, by implication therefore, items which are not eligible investments for LIWP sub-projects to
financed under the ECEPWP. The Framework provides social and environmental mitigation
measures to be incorporated inthe design, contracting and monitoring o f sub-projects.


1.5     Participatory Approach
Participation and consultations with beneficiaries will take place through the traditional district
shuras/organizations in conjunction with the District administrations. Project design and sub-
project selection will aim at maintainingequity between various groups o f the population.


2       OBJECTIVESAND OUTCOMES


2.1     General Objectives
The objective o f this Project i s to assist ATA inrehabilitating the rural infrastructure/ feeder road
network in all provinces in order to: (a) provide a rapid infusion o f cash to rural communities
through a Labor based methodology; (b) ensure preservation o f existing infrastructure/road
assets; (c) induce revival o f economic activities; and (d) concurrently building subsequent
capacity to allow the MOPW led team to manage similar interventions directly.




                                                  133

The immediate physical objective of the Project is: (a) to repadmaintain sections of rural
infrastructure and farm to market roads that have failed due to war related damage and many
years without maintenance; and (b) to rehabilitate the infrastructure to meet the original
functional requirements. The direct emergency objective i s to get cash into the hands of rural
families in order to assist them in coping with the onset of winter as well as preparation for the
next agricultural season.

Additionally, UNOPS partnership will provide training for counterpart staff in procurement,
project design and management. It will include detailed training on subproject contracting at
international standards for design, costing, tender, bid review and evaluation, engineering
supervision, monitoring and financial supervision.          The output o f this objective is a
MoPW(MIWm) better prepared to accept and deliver and account for international funds at
international standards, enhancing the likelihood of future direct funding.


The above objectives will be achieved through the provision of consultancy services, works,
equipment, and supplies for infrastructure/road building activities identified and prioritised by
ATAiMoPW(MIWRE).


2.2      Specific Objectives
The project hasthe following specific objectives. Corresponding planned activities are subject to
modifications that may be agreed between MoPW(MIWRE) and UNOPS as needed to achieve
the following objectives:

    0   Immediateand sustainedincometo Labor force

        This will be accomplished by the immediate certification of field staff and deployment
         for Level One Engineeringsubprojects. Sites in 8 regions located close to provincial and
        district centers will be prioritized with identified vulnerable areas receiving initial
        attention. Activities o f limited engineering, but necessary to protect and improve roads,
        such as drainage works, leveling, and culvert rehabilitatiordcleaning will be targeted.
        Limited surface rehabilitation for roads not requiring substantial survey/design will also
        begin. Community groups are organized through shuras to carry out necessaryworks.


    0   Rural Infrastructure rehabilitated to appropriate quality and implementation
        standards.
        Concurrent to the above activity, survey/design and costing for EngineeringLevel 2&3
        subprojects will be developed, necessary procurement and training completed and
        preparations made for construction in those areas where the winter conditions will allow
        activities. Inhigher elevations, preparations will continue through winter to allow for a
        fast spring start -up. Staff will be shifted to the warmer locations to complete some
        provincial work early allowing reallocation o f assets in early 2003 to higherhorthern
        locations as weather permits.

        UNOPS will apply the existing Subproject contract methodology, developed through
        more than 14 years o f Rural Engineering inAfghanistan, to insure all aspects o f project
        activities are transparent and accountable at international standards.        The general
        methodology will use information coordinated under the provincial Governors office to
        set priority targets in all Provinces for Labor Intensive works. It will then divide works
        into three Technical categories to allow immediate cash infusion on least demanding



                                                 134

         sections, but allowing time for proper Design, and engineering of more technical
         structures in Category 2 and 3.      It uses subproject procedures that divide work into
         ceilings that allow smaller projects to be regionally approved with larger projects having
         an expedited appraisal at Kabul level. Financial delegations are up to $30,000 with the
         UNOPS STA and $100,000 with UNOPS STA after LCC review inKabul.

UNOPS will apply the Roads RehabilitationTechnical manual developed more than 10 years ago
and already translated into local languages as the interim standard for these roads.
Implementation will use approved UNOPS subproject documentation and certification.


     0   Project Management Training - International managing, finance and accounting
         systems modifiedto fit Government mechanisms and staff trained to be able to use
         systems

         UNOPS subcontracting and admidfinance documentation modified and translated to
         support activities above. Government staff trained in use and compliance.          Slower
         construction seasons will allow or heavier training levels.      Topics cover subproject
         management of road works as well as all procurement, administrative and financial
         procedures. Trainings will be output oriented with staff certified and costs covered only
         for objectives achieved.


    0    Maintenancecapacity developed andtrained

         Also concurrently to construction above a manual focused on maintenance of these
         Public works will be designed and translated for use. This will complement equipment
         purchased as Area based assets and staff trained to allow a limited deployment of
         maintenance and construction equipment (this component would be expanded to all
         Provinces ifadditional fundwere allocated).


2.3      General Outcomes
The outcomes of the component are expected to be more income to rural populations, cheaper
transport facilities, which contribute to sustainable livelihoods, as well as improved government
systems for project delivery which i s fundamental to sector reform and institution building.


2.4      Specific Outcomes
Through an integrated approach to Labor-intensive works and Road rehabilitation to accepted
standards involving communities, local NGOs, line ministries and technical departments o f the
Government, a number of hard and soft outputs will be achieved under the contract. The
verifiable indicators o fthe hard outputs for Phase 1are:

      0   The potential rehabilitation o f between 2000-5000 Kilometers o f road dependent on
           starting road condition of targeted sections.
      0   With 15% o f funds allocated for expected structure repair such as culvert and retaining
          walls more than 50,000 Cubic meters of stone masonry protection canbe completed.
      0   Upto $6 millionplacedinhands of the rural labor force as cash for work.
      0   Technical Roads manualrevised with a maintenance section for follow-up care
      0   Regional maintenance capacities with limited equipment to continue works inplace.

3        ALLOCATION OFFUNDSTO TOWNS

3.1      SelectedProvinces
To ensure a needs-based distribution o f Program funds, allocations to each o f the provinces has
been calculated on criteria related to the relative numbers o f people residing in those provinces.
Additional funds will be adjusted for need and economic costhenefit.


4        THE IMPLEMENTATIONMODEL

4.1      The Project Process
The manual focuses on the subproject process o f the LIWP as shown on the following page and
details a typical cycle with five stages o f process (one being the subcontracted implementation).
This manual encompasses these stages o f the process and includes a separate set o f subproject
financial processes.     UNOPS guidelines for actual project implementation will be used for
procurement, staffing and regular financial operations. These are available through the UNOPS
handbook and the UNOPS Web site system.


4.2      The Role and responsibilities of the MOPW
MOPW at the National level is the coordinating Ministry within the ITGA, and the line ministry
responsible for all Area and Provincial activity. The duties o f the MOPW with respect to the
LIWPinclude the following:

       0   Through Provincial Technical Teams (PTT) and Area engineers, surveyhnitial design
           and costingo f subprojects

          Ministry to perform its duties, and certify/supervise the activities at the Area and
          Provincial levels
       0  the Provincial and Area level to assist survey and design and supervise the
          subcontracting, procurement and implementatiodcertification.
The policy o f the ITGA i s to use Project ImplementationTeams within government institutions.
These groups will, inter alia, effectively take part in the rehabilitation and reconstruction o f the
Country. The contract implementation function would be contracted out to the private sector.
In this regard, the role o f the implementing agency would be to implement the Program with
counterpart staff participationat all levels to insure skills transfer. SpecificallyUNOPS will have
legal responsibility for subcontracting, procurement and financial administration.

5       SUB-PROJECTIDENTIFICATION

5.1.    Sub-project identificationthroughstakeholder participation
The success o f LIWP depends on adequate stakeholder participation. While the time constraint
will not allow for in depth relationships to be built between planners, implementers and local
communities, processes can be tailored to the three levels o f projects expected that will allow
adequate dialogue before selection. Whenever resources are brought to the community level,
especially in a post conflict environment - care must be taken to insure that the allocation o f
resources i s made using decision making bodies that are credible in the eyes o f the people
affected.  In rural Afghanistan this means community leaders, District level shura bodies,
Woleswals, Provincial technical staff and members o f the Govemment ministries. This project
will rely on, and try to assist the capacity development of, provincial coordination mechanisms
under the office o f Govemor.
Inorder to ensure that the rural Afghan population benefits from the LIWP it is important to
ensure that the sub-project selection procedure i s o f a demand driven nature. This ranges fi-om
where the vulnerability needs are most acute for the initial quick cash Level One interventions, to
where the road rehabilitation needs will bring the most lasting benefiting o f Engineering based
subprojects.


5.2     Subproject ceilings
The LIPW project separates the interventions into two distinct categories.       First are simple
smaller projects that require minimal or n o engineering and simpler community based



                                               138

contracting/execution arrangements     -Level 1. Second are those of a more advanced technical
nature - still Labor based but requiring adequate levels of engineering intervention. This to
ensure the result i s improved infrastructure inthe med-longterm rather than the inappropriate use
o f Labor in interventions that lack any sustained impact.         These are considering in this
implementation plan as Level 2 & 3 interventions and for which the details subproject cycle will
be discussedmomentarily.

5.3      Level One
(Small-scale, always less than $30,000 for community-based labor intense works)
To be successful ina major objective of the Program- cashput inthe hands of rural Labor force
immediately - the project must be able to identifyinterventions that can be carried out quickly -
inmany casesbeforeheexpectedarrivalofthe winter seasoninseveralmonths. These will avoid
major construction works and focus on Labor intensive procedures that either address the
immediate rehabilitation needs of roads with limited damage or act to do simple preparation for
more damaged sectors that will be addressedunder Levels 2&3.

These activities include, brushremoval and Boulder removal. They cover Ditching, slopinghack
sloping, and the cutting of mitre drains - all of which will address the initial rehabilitation needs
of the roadway but also act to provide a substantial period of protection that avoids further
damage before more substantial road works are carried out. Near to future sites for retaining
walls and drainage structures, preparatory andprotective activities canbe done to allow the use of
labor alone to improve the situation through backfilling and compaction. In selected sites, with
the available inputs, limitedgabion protectioncouldbe added.

These activities will require an expedited mechanism for selection, approval and implementation
inorder to achieve the statedobjectives. Inorder to allow this streamlining a first step hasbeen
to determine a ceiling for individual project size that allows maximum community participation, a
limited need for technical oversight and less likelihood through lower financial ceilings of
financial impropriety. This ceiling is suggested initially at $30,000 per activity for community
managed works. Based on Labor costs of about $2 a day plus supervision costs of $4 for one
crew chief on every 25 workers and a $5 daily fee for the project foreman, 50-250 workers can
benefit from two months of seasonalwork before winter sets in,inhundreds of target locations.

Level One subprojects must match the technically appropriate sectors o f road rehabilitation with
those locations having populations perceived as most vulnerable. Appropriate administers for
activities must be identified, detailed summary sheets and Cost estimates supplied. Target
outputs through a simple design and bill o f quantity format agreed, advances provided and
monitoring and certification carried out. All in a fairly expedited but adequately documented
process. Administrators will be responsible to insure the specified workforce works the specified
hours/days as agreed in advance. Monitoring will adjust payments for a percent o f compliance.
Level One projects will be administered under this streamlined procedure.

A distinct component of the Level 1 works will be identified for vulnerable households and
families with Disability. Appropriate community works ranging from a physical nature where
appropriate, to activities within community institutions such as schools and mosques, as well as
available apprenticeship training will be on offer. Organized through community elders and
school/church leaders and coordinated through the provincial and regional Ministry of Martyrs
and Disabled offices, this component will be an add-on to works developed through the regular
mechanism. This use of existing operations allows the component to be added for little additional
cost other than the actual labor payments.

 See Level One Annex

5.4      Level Two & Three
(Labor-based Engineeringworks)

For Level 2 and 3 engineeringbased subprojects the process becomes more formalized where
both technical information from a variety of sources and local confirmation are used to narrow
down the potential sub projects. In order to achieve maximum stakeholder participation the
active support o f many agencies both vertically and horizontally integrated into the provinces i s
essential.


6        SUB-PROJECTPROCUREMENTPROCESS
The method of procurement is a function of the modality selected for project implementation.
Essentially there are two options; community contracting and commercial contracting (includes
NGOswilling to register as contractors).
For all levels, that prioritization and appraisal process is as follows:


6.1      Project Initiation
Technical information from Provincial, International, Government technical body sources i s
collected within the framework for the Provincial Technical Team (PTT)concept under the
coordination o f the Governor and benefiting from participation of counterpart ministry
participationas they become operational at Provincial level.

      0    Information on vulnerable areas i s           compared against potential appropriate
           infrastructure/road sectors.
      0    Province/District level surveys review sectors and availability o f local Labor pool.
      0    Short listed sectors submitted by Area Engineers and PTT usingthe following criteria:
             *:*  degree of Labor intensity;
             *:*  economic impact;
             *:*  consultation with and endorsement by local civil society/ community groups.
Each sub-project i s reviewedby the Provincial Team for the degree of impact it has on all three of
the above criteria.
Since providing employment is the main objective of the LIWP, it i s given the highest weighting.
The suggestedguidelines for weightings are as follows:
             *:* Employment: 40%
             *3 Economic impact: 40%
             *:* Consultationwith civil society: 20%
         The prioritization will be done by majority opinion of the complete Provincial team inan
         open fomm.
The Area teams,with the provincial Governors concurrence will recommend prioritizedproposals
and provide the relevant information to the Kabul LIPW team. The Kabul team will enter the
information into the National database and ifwithout objection instruct the Area provincial teams
to:

      0   Proceedwith recommendedCommunity basedlabor only works
      0   Conduct detailed technical assessment o fthe Level 2&3 works

6.5       Projectsfundedby directlyby donors
Insome cases where projects are funded directly by donors, the approval mechanism of these
sub-projects will be agreed between the implementingpartner and the donor concerned prior to
receipt o f funds.


7         PRE-QUALIFICATION OF CONTRACTORSAND NGOS

7.1       Database/ Register
Using the UNOPS Contractor database, the register will be updated at the Provincial level to
include all firms / contractors / NGOs wishingto bid for works under this Program.


7.2       QualificationCriteria
For Level 2&3, it i s anticipated that the civil works on most projects will be relatively
(technically) simple. The proposed criteria, is therefore that the contractors must have performed
at least three similar sized contracts previously. This criteria couldbe set for contracts above, say
$10,000 and below which, no previous jobs will be required (this could encourage local
entrepreneursto start new businesses for smalljobs).
Other appropriate qualificationcriteria are chosenfor larger works (see registrationform).


7.3      ApplicationForms
Each Provincial office should maintain freely available copies of application forms for
registration. Advertisements and Radio/TV notify potential contractors of the process in each
Area and Kabul

8        REQUESTSFOR QUOTATIONS
             Tendering will follow the UNOPS approved standards, (forms attached - Invitation
             to bid, information letter, endorsement sheet, tender document).
             Contracts will be awarded on the basis of the receipt, evaluation and comparison of
             all, but at least three (3) competitive quotes.
             Where considerable numbers of firms have registered, tenders should be allowed by
             only those firms registered and with capacity for the specific region and type of
             intervention.      Ifover subscription occurs UNOPS will propose a tender document
             charge to cover printing and review charges that should reduce the number of
             applications.
             Quotations will be requestedby a specific time on a specific date.
             A secure Tender box will be placed inan appropriate room ineachprovincial Office
             into which quotations can beplaceddirectly by the contractors.
             All contractors submitting quotations will be invited to attend the opening of
             quotations. This shall take place at the time and date specified for quotations (i.e. at
             6 above).
             The quotations shallbe openedand the followingdetails announced:
             Name of Contractor
             Quotation Price




                                                  142

             Each quotation will be evaluated to check that all of the technical and commercial
             requirements of the Invitation to Quote document have been fully met.
             Quotations with substantial non-compliance will be rejected and not considered
             further inthe selection process. However, the firms submittingsuch quotations will
             be given a chance to learn of the non-compliance inan interview conducted after the
             selection processhas beencompleted.
             Quotations that are substantially compliant will be compared.
             The lowestpricedquotation will berecommended for the contract.
             Due to the tendency for firms to underbid to get projects and potentially misuse
             mobilization advances, any lowest bid that i s more than 10% lower than market
             estimates, would be required to work without mobilization advance and be paid on
             the basis of 90% o f work performedwith fullpayment after completion.
             The review team will prepare abriefevaluation report.

8.1      Award of contracts
The Contract will be drafted with the firm submitting the lowest responsive evaluated quotation.
The Consultant's Senior International Engineer shall complete the Letter of Acceptance form
attached to the Invitation to Quote document. This shall be signed and approved by the following
parties:
         Review Team
         Contractor
Contracts under $30,000 will be signed by UNOPS STA, those between $30,000 and $100,000
will be signed by the UNOPS STA after LCC or NY review, and those over $100,000 must be
approved by UNOPS NY.
Tender, Bidevaluation, and contracting forms are annexed.


8.2      Contractperformance
Although day-to-day monitoring of sub-projects is carried out at the provincial level, the MOPW
i s responsible for overall project monitoring. The PC will, with the help o f the implementing
agency in each province, monitor the progress of each sub-project. The Implementingagency i s
responsible for the execution o f the works, but MOPW will make sure that the Program o f works
i s being adhered to. Likewise, MOPW will monitor timely disbursement o f the funds UNOPS
provides to the contactors. The role of the MOPW i s very much as a co-ordinator. It will make
decisions on policy matters and help to expedite and facilitate disbursements between IDA and
the Implementing agency.


            Contracts are monitored at three levels. Provincial Technical Teams, Area Teams
            and random checks by the International Advisor teams.
            This is in addition to regular informal checking and monitoring b interested
            community groups and local authorities.
            Regular monitoring results in Subprojects monitoring reports submitted by
            engineering staff and is terminated with the final "End of Subproject Report issued
            on completion.
            Engineeringworks will have a retentionperiod of 6 weeks to 3 months before a final
            release o fthe money that remains as security deposit and guarantee of good work.
            A handover with community and local authorities is thendocumented.
            Maintenance reportingbegins through MoPW field staff.



                                                143

            Additionally an internal audit department will review regional BOQ rates and spot
             check actual quantities against project site visits to confirm transparency and
             accountability.
             Contactors failing to follow all procedures and who perform poorly will face
             disciplinary action that may include suspension and expulsion from future
             contractingopportunities.

8.3     Procedures for Public Sector Contracting
The contracting bypublic sector for the LIWP funds is not allowed under the fundingrules ofthis
project but may bepermissible under rules of different donors.


8.4     Facilitationof disbursement
The UNOPS Finance officer using the UNOPS - US$ Imprest account will facilitate the
disbursement o f funds as per UNOPS procedures, through UNOPS staff. UNOPS will request
the opening o f a convertible account at the Da Afghanistan Bank to handle local transactions. In
the interim the existing Imprest will be used. Contract will be calculated in Dollars but paid at
the bank exchange rate at time of disbursement. Contractors will be encouraged to open local
accounts for payment.


8.5     Provisionof project co-ordination/support
The MOPW will be responsible for project co-ordination and support. The Project Co-ordinator
(PC) will be responsible for providing MoPW NOCs to batches of sub-projects over $30,000.
Projects less than $30,000 have the implicit approcal throughthe Ministrycounterpart on the Arae
Team. PTTs will monitor the progress of the sub-projects. Area Teams with MOPW monitors
will check results.

10        DEMINING,ENVIRONMENTAL,AND SOCIAL RISKS
The best information on the potential for mines in a given area lies with the local communities
them selves. All proposed LIWPprojects must be certifiedby the local communities as ina Low-
to-Nil risk environment. Level 2&3 Subprojects will be passed to the Regional RMAC for their
confirmation o fno information contrary to a Low-to-Nil Riskfactor.
The reconstruction and rehabilitation interventions envisaged under the proposed project are not
expected to generate significant negative environmental effects. Rather, they should contribute to
the improvement o f environmental conditions. Limited adverse impacts could result, however,
fiom inadequate design and construction practices.          T o limit the extent o f these risks, the
Environmental Framework -developed for other IDA funded interventions - provides a negative
list o f activities ineligible for support under the proposed project.
T o mitigate the remaining potential impacts, the guidelines and codes o f practice included in the
Framework provide social and environmental mitigation measures to be incorporated in the
design, contracting and monitoring o f sub-projects. These are made operational through the
specific site checklists for Level 2&3 works and addressed as necessary through the initial
prioritizationprocess and documentation for Level One works.

No activities will be supported that require involuntary land acquisition or the acquisition o f land
requiring the resettlement or compensation o f more than 200 people.              Consequently, no
Resettlement Action Plan will be required for these types o f projects.

12      AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING OF THE LIWP and SUB-
PROJECTS

12.1    Procurement,FinancialManagement, DisbursementandAudit Arrangements
Procurement, financial management and audit functions for the LIWPwill be undertaken through
UNOPS procedures by delegatedUNOPS staff.
For procurement, the MOPW, would provide technical input. To ensure that works procurement
capacity i s built up, UNOPS will provide training to key counterpart staff in the MOPW, as
deemed necessary to ensure they develop capacity to eventually carry out procurement on their
O w n .

To support the capacity building of financial management in MOPW, the accounting unit of
UNOPS will provide the basic inputs for project financial management and reporting. Quarterly
Financial Monitoring Reports will be prepared by the MOPW's accounting units and reviewed
and approved by the Implementingpartner.
The accounts of the Project will be audited by the Auditor General with the assistance of the
Audit Agent. The annual project financial statement to IDA would include a summary of funds
received (from all sources), and a summary of expenditures shown under the main Project
components / activities and by maincategories of expenditure


12.2    MonitoringandEvaluation
The Provincial Engineers, assistedby the implementing agency, will prepare and submit to the
MOPW(MIWRE), quarterly progress reports showing progress towards meeting implementation
and development objectives for all the sub-projects they are implementing.
The MOPW(MIWRE), assisted by the implementingagency, will collate the reports from the
regions and prepare and submit to the Bank and ATA quarterly progress reports showingprogress
towards meeting implementation and development objectives for each province/area and the
LIWP as a sub-component of the ECEPWP.
The external progressreportingof LIWP will bethe responsibility ofthe MOPW(MIWRE) which
will consolidate all components and submit to the IDA


13      INTERAGENCY CO-ORDINATION
Inseveral regionsmorethan one donor maybe financing ruralpublic works. Inorder to provide
coordination and avoid duplication of effort there i s need for an inter-agency working group to
meet on regular basis. The purpose o f the meetings will be to exchange information on each of
the Programs, and create consistency among terms and conditions for rural works and wage rates
for the beneficiaries o f employment generation and cash for work Programs. The working group
will meet once monthly, chaired by the Provincial Govemor, under the PCB, which will be
responsible for coordination. At the National level the emergingNEEP structure at MRRD will
provide these services.


13.1    The Roles andResponsibilitiesof UNOPSandMoPW
UNOPS i s entrusted with the following roles and responsibilities. Where appropriate,
MoPW(MIWRE) Engineers will be used to carry out technical and project management
functions:
