Emergency Employment\n            Program for Rural Access Project for Afghanistan, which\n            forms a part of the Government's National Emergency\n            Employment Program (NEEP), will assist the Government in\n            providing targeted social protection, and improving key\n            rural access infrastructure to improve the livelihoods of\n            the rural poor in the Government's territory by\n            providing: (i) emergency short term employment opportunities\n            for the poor on labor-based rural access infrastructure\n            improvement subprojects; and (ii) technical assistance for\n            the implementation of NEEP. The Credit portion will finance\n            the reconstruction of secondary rural access\n            infrastructure--primarily bridges. The Grant will finance\n            the rehabilitation of tertiary rural access infrastructure\n            and technical assistance to the Government for implementing\n            its NEEP. The project will comprise two components: A)\n            labor-based rural access rehabilitation reconstruction\n            subprojects; and, B) technical assistance to support the\n            Government's overall NEEP. The Project is expected to\n            create a minimum of 6,000,000 unskilled labor days of\n            employment, and to rehabilitate a minimum of 2000 km of\n            rural roads and 2300 m of bridges. The labor-based\n            sub-projects are expected to provide high social returns in\n            the short run and contribute to economic progress in the\n            long-term. The employment generated will reduce income\n            vulnerability levels and create infrastructure which will\n            improve access to markets and services. By removing access\n            bottlenecks, the project will help integrate the village\n            economy with the regional and national markets. The\n            technical assistance component will lead to better\n            allocation of resources, higher productivity and outputs,\n            and help mobilize further donor resources for productive\n            employment creation. The project builds upon working\n            implementation arrangements, but even so its implementation\n            is  expected to be difficult. The security situation could\n            deteriorate, derailing reconstruction efforts. This is\n            outside the scope of the project design. However, the\n            project's modular design will allow activities in one\n            or more unstable provinces to cease without stopping work in\n            provinces where there are no or few security risks. The\n            Credit and Grant are expected to be fully disbursed in a 39\n            month period."}, "docdt": "2003-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
