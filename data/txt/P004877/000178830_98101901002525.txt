SOCIETE NATIONALE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ
POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Power Project for the Societé Nationale de
l'Electricité et du Gaz (SONELGAZ), a Government-owned company responsible
for generating, transmitting and dis tributing eleetricity and gas throughout
Algeria.
ii.       The Project comprises 120 MW of gas turbine capacity at Algiers,
three 220-kV substations, six 60-kV substations and one 90-kV substation in
various locations, dispatch facilities, and various management and technical
studies. The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$64.3 million, in-
cluding a foreign exchange component of US$38.5 million equivalent. The pro-
posed Bank loan would finance this foreign exchange component, which excludes
interest during construction. The Project forms a small part (9.4%) of
SONELGAZ's forecast 1973-78 construction program costing US$681 million
(US$483 million for electricity, US$152 million for gas and US$46 million for
buildings and general equipment). Procurement would be on the basis of Inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines and 15%
local preference would be allowed for Algerian manufacturers in bid evalu-
ation.
iii.      In addition to items included in the Project, SONELGAZ's 1973-1978
power development program comprises completion of a 274-MW steam station at
Skikda; the installation of gas turbine stations at Hassi R'Mel and Arzew
(8() MW each), construction of a second 220-kV line between Algiers and Oran,
conversion of existing lines and substations to 220 kV, and large expansions
in distribution.
iv.       Because of the length of its interconnected network, SONELGAZ is
experiencing problems in maintaining stability, voltage, security and spin-
ning reserve, aggravated by an inadequate control system comprising only
limited communication facilities. The dispatch facilities included in the
Project would assist SONELGAZ in remedying these difficulties.
v.        Management and operations are satisfactory.  Training is excellent.
SONELGAZ's organization has not been changed materially since 1947 and in some
respects is inadequate. A consultant has already been appointed to carry out
a reorganization study which would be financed by the proposed loan.  Retro-
active financing totalling about US$300,000 is proposed for this contract
arid the engineering contract for the dispatch system, covering costs incurred
since appraisal.



- ii -
vi.       With respect to SONELGAZ's electricity activity, the present rate of
return of 5.1% on net fixed electricity assets would rise to 7% by 1978 on the
basis of present tariffs. Internal cash generation would cover 20% of the
cost of the 1973-1978 construction program for electricity. The Government
and consumers' contributions would finance 41% of the program, and long-term
borrowing, including the proposed loan, would finance 39% of it.
vii.      Although SONELGAZ's tariffs are adequate to provide a reasonable
rate of return for its elextricity activity, once the ambitious national
power expansion program has been completed, the entity had forecast that its
overall financial position would gradually deteriorate due to the size of the
expansion program (including that for gas) and the operating deficit of its
gas and other activities, unless appropriate measures were taken to improve
the trend. In order to reach this qbjective the Goverament and SONELGAZ
agreed on a combination of electricity targets and objectives for rate of
return, the ratio of surplus to investment program, the ratio of net revenue
to debt service requirements, to set prices and charges for operations other
than sale of electricity and gas not below cost, and to make the period of
future Government loans to SONELGAZ consistent with the economic life of the
relevant assets. SONELGAZ will furnish the Bank annually with information,
approved by the Government, indicating how it plans to meet the targets, and
how it expects to meet operating deficits and financing gaps (if any) in its
gas and other activities. A tariff study will be made for electricity and a
market/tariff study for gas.
viii.     In views of the agreements reached as set forth in Section 7, the
Project would be suitable for a Bank loan to SONELGAZ of US$38.5 million
equivalent, repayable over 20 years including a grace period of 3-1/2 years.

APPRAISAL OF A POWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.(1      The Government of Algeria, on behalf of the Societeé Nationale de
l'Électricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ), has requested the Bank to help finance
a Project estimated to cost US$64.3 million. For this Project, which forms
a small part (9.4%) of SONELGAZ's 1973-78 construction program, a loan of
US$38.5 million is proposed to finance the foreign exchange cost. The
Project would comprise two gas turbine stations in Algiers with a capacity of
120 MW, various substations, dispatch facilities, and several studies, includ-
ing a general organization and management study.
1.02      The Project is based on a study prepared by SONELGAZ for the Algiers
power stations and on a feasibility study prepared by Electricite de France
for the dispatch facilities. A consultant (PA International of U.K.) has
already been appointed for the organization and management study.
1.03      A previous Bank loan (131-FR) of US$10 million was made in 1955,
prior to independence, to Electricite et Gaz d'Algerie (EGA), SONELGAZ's
predecessor, under guarantee of the French Government, to finance part of
EGA's expansion 1955-1958 program in generation, transmission and distribu-
tion.
1.04      The Project was prepared following two Bank reconnaissance missions
in 1972 and 1973. This appraisal report was prepared by Messrs. W.F. KÜpper
(Engineer) and Y.P. Buphomène (Financial Analyst) and is based on information
provided to them by SONELGAZ during an appraisal mission in October/November
1973.
2. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
General
2.01      The Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, on th2 southwest
coast of the Mediterranean, has an area of about 2.3 million km (885,000
square miles). Most of its estimated 15 million inhabitants live in the
fertile coastal area, which'covers about 20% of the country. This area is
separated by the Atlas mountain ranges from the predominantly desert area
in the south.  Of the 44 million ha fertile area, about 34 million ha (15%
of the countrv's land area) is used for grazing, 8 million ha (3%) is actively
cultlvated and 2 million ha (1%) is covered by forests.



-2-
Energy Resources
2.02      Algerials major natual3resources are oil and gas.  Its proven oil
reserves are at least 1.9 x 10 m (12 billion barrels) and the 1973 output,
including gas condensate, was 51 million tons or about 1 million barrels per
day. The main oil fields are in the central desert area of Hassi Messaoud/
Haoud el Hamra. The natural gas field of Hassi R'Mel is one of the world's
larg~st, with proven recoverable reserves (under present techniques) of 3,000
x 10( m . Additionally, some 1,000 x 109 m of proven reserves are distributed
among 8 other fields.  Liquified natural gas (LNG) is now being exported from
Arzew and Skikda and similar large-scale projects are under way including
pipelines across Tunisia and under the Mediterranean, to Italy. The main
centers for processing oil are refineries at Arzew, Algiers, and Skikda.
Tule ports of Arzew, Bejaia and Skikda export oil. A project for the con-
struction of the new LNG port of Bethioua, near Arzew was appraised for Bank
financing concurrently with the present power Project, as was a railway re-
habilitation project.
2.03      The country's hydro resources are limited and most of the hydro
potential is already being exploited for power (284 MW installed capacity,
supplying an average of 400 GWh annually), but effective capacity is re-
stricted (184 MW) due to irrigation requirements.
2.04      Coal reserves are small, and mainly concentrated around Bechar
wliere, before independence, about 300,000 tons were mined annually. The
mines are being modernized and production is to be increased to 600,000 tons
annually to be used mainly in coke-making for the steel works at El Hadjar
near Annaba in the east. Little coal is currently used for other purposes.
Organization
2.05      An outline of the organization of the energy sector, established
in 1969 under the Ministry for Industry and Energy, is shown in Annex 1.
2.0(      SONELGAZ has the exclusive right to transmit and distribute power
throughout the country. Its right to generate power is not exclusive. Fac-
tories, requiring up to 1,000 kVA, may be auto-producers, and any factory
requiring process heat may generate its oxmn electricity for maximum economy.
However, any excess production of electricity by the auto-producers must be
sold to SONELGAZ. The company is also the sole distributor of gas in the
countrv, either produced in its own plant (which will be discontinued in
1974) or purchased in bulk from the Societe Nationale pour la Recherche,
la Production, le Transport, la Transformation et la Commercialization des
lHydrocarbures (SONATRACI).  In the last few years gas distribution has been
progressively converted to natural gas (and bottled gas) throughout the
country.
2.07      SONATRACH has the exclusive right of exploration, development,
processing, and trading of oil and gas, with the restriction that gas for
national requirements be sold in bulk to SONELGAZ for distribution.



- 3 -
2.08       The Societeé Nationale de Recherches et d'Exploitation Minière
(SONAREM) has the exclusive right of exploration, development, processing,
and trading of mining products.
2.09       In order to ensure optimum use of existing power facilities and to
reap the benefits of scale, it has been the Government's policy to substitute
individual or isolated power supplies with supplies from SONELGAZ. The various
refineries and liquefaction plants already have been connected to SONELGAZ's
network, and SONELGAZ is expected to meet most of the future power require-
ments in the rapidly expanding petroleum and gas sector. Similarly, in Hassi
R'Mel, generation for the gas field bases, their surroundings, and the gas
field itself (to the extent possible), would le concentrated in a single
plant, to be constructed and operated by SONEIGAZ.
2.10       Growth in the power sector was practically stagnant during 1963-
1966, but since then the sector has grown steadily.  Power sector data for
1973-1978 are shown in Annex 2.  The total 1972 capacity of 1,024 MW installed
in the country generated 2,323 GWh. Of this capacity 794 MW (78%) was owned
bv SONELGAZ, which generated 2,015 GWh (87%), and 230 MW (22%) captive plant,
generating 308 GWh (13%). Dividing losses proportionally, general consumers
(domestic, Government, irrigation, commercial) accounted for 1,162 GWh (50%)
of the total 1972 production; the petroleum and gas sector for 294 GWh (12%);
and other industry for 867 GWh (38%).
2.11       Of the 230 MW installed in captive plant, 140 MW pertains to larger
industries (petroleum, steel) and about 90 MW to smaller industries. Genera-
tion of the latter has declined steadily and now constitutes less than 1% of
the total country generation. Since 1965, generation of the larger industries
has been relatively level at 10-13% of total generation.
2.12       Overall length of SONELGAZ's 220-kV system (which, however, will be
operated at 150 kV until 1977/78 when full conversion to 220 kV should be com-
pleted) is about 1,700 km. Total length of the transmission system, including
60-kV and 90-kV lines, is 4,000 km. The middle voltage lines (5.5-30 kV) have
a length of about 16,000 km, and low tension distribution lines and cables
(127/220 V and 230/380 V) about 9,000 km.
2.13       At the end of 1973, total installed capacity in SONELGAZ's inter-
connected system, amounted to 861 MW, and location and capacities of the major
thermal plants were as follows:
Oran:      Steam 189 MW, gas turbine 44 MW
Algiers:  Steam 120 MW, gas turbine 40 MW
Annaba:   Steam 184 MW
Skikda:   A new steam station comprising 2 x 137 MW is under
construction for completion in 1974/75.
About 200 MW in major hydro plants is concentrated in the area midway between
the Tunisian border and Algiers; 84 MW in smaller hydro plant is spread
along the Atlas Tellie Mountains (lower Atlas), near the coast. In isolated
systems, gas turbine capacity was about 130 MW, mainly catering to oil and
gas fields, and diesel capacity was about 23 MW.



-4-
Future Developments
2.14      SONELGAZ's 1973-1978 construction program, which reflects the
National Development Program but which has not yet been approved by the
Government, has been assumed to be slightly reduced in practice (see 2.21).
It would amount to some DA 2,787 million (US$681 million equivalent). This
program (see Annex 3) includes a power component amounting to DA 1,976 million
(71' of the total); a gas component of DA 621 luillion (22%); and a general
component of DA 196 million (7%).
2.15      The program includes the completion in 1974/75 of the 274-MW steam
station at Skikda. With this station SONELGAZ would complete its major ex-
pansion program in generation for the interconnected system, initiated under
the last 4-year plan. Thermal plant capacity installed in this system would
increase from 312 MW in 1971 to 835 MW by 1975.  The additional capacity was
scheduled mainly with a view to expected developments in industry, partic-
ularly the oil and gas industry (Oran and Skikda/Annaba areas). Construc-
tion of industrial plants was delayed, however, and for the next 2-3 years
considerable (but rapidly diminishing) excess capacity will be available.
SONELGAZ is currently constructing a second 220-kV llne from Algiers to Oran
and is procuring equipment for conversion to 220 kV (mainly substation equip-
ment) to be completed in the next 3-4 years. To remove the capacity regional
imbalances in the system and to meet forecast demand at least cost, SONELGAZ
is planning to install 3 x 40 MW in gas turbine plant in Algiers by 1977/78,
to be financed by the proposed loan, and a further 2 units in the Oran area
by 1979. No steam-electric plant is scheduled for completion prior to 1980.
A continuing program of substation construction to be financed partly from
the proposed loan, and line conversion to higher voltages, in addition to
expansion in distribution, would enable the increasing demand to be met, par-
ticularly in industry. The Government would provide the funds required for
the execution of an exceptionally large village electrification plan, rising
from DA 61 million (about US$15 million) in 1973 to DA 120 million (US$29
million) by 1978.
2.16      The present control system in Algiers (mainly telephone connections
and some tele-indications) is completely inadequate for SONELGAZ's rapidly
growing generation and transmission system. A dispatch system, to be fi-
nanced from the proposed loan, is scheduled for completion by 1977.
2.17      Developments in the gas field of Hassi R'Mel (about 400 km south
of Algiers) would require the completion, by 1977/78, of a gas turbine station
with an installed capacity of about 80 MW. SONELGAZ, which was at first con-
sidering Bank financing for this station, has postponed construction of this
station and therefore has withdrawn this request.
2. 19     The Government is planning to construct, by 1980, an aluminum plant
near Bejata and a steel plant near Djidjelli (both north of SONELGAZ's main
hydro plants, on the coast), requiring a total of 240-300 MW. Plans for a
generating plant and substations catering for this particular load will be
made by SONELGAZ as soon as more details are available. The impact of these
plans on overall system planning cannot be assessed at this stage due to the
lack of detailed information.



2.19      Although the power program would considerably strengthen transmis-
sion, and reinstitute an appropriate balance between regional generation ca-
pacities, it is closely geared to the 1974-1977 National Development Plan.
Because SONELGAZ is considered the basic entity for industrial development,
it is obliged to frame and execute its own program substantially irrespective
of changes or delays in other parts of the national plan. This already has
caused overinvestments (see 2.15) in power under the 1970-1973 national plan.
2.20      Agreement has been reached with Government and SONELGAZ on various
financial measures which will improve SONELGAZ's financial position (see 6.02).
The application of these measures will necessitate, inter alia, a review of
the program and institution of measures needed to restore a balanced invest-
ment pattern.,
2.21      In view of (a) the fact that the 1973 construction expenditures
remained about 16% below the estimate, (b) the gas program appears over ambi-
tious and not based on a realistic view of the market development, and (c) the
agreements reached--which are expected to result in an investment pattern more
closely related to actual developments in power requirements--it was considered
appropriate to assume a somewhat reduced 1973-1978 program. For power, this
reduction (down to DA 1,975 million from DA 2,076) mainly reflects the delay--
which already became apparent in 1973--in some non-Project items (mainly trans-
mission) by about one year. For gas (down to DA 621 million from DA 848 million)
a reduction of 25% was assumed, which appears realistic consistent with the
historical trend. The general component was reduced by 10% (down to DA 196
million from DA 218 million) in line with the reduced overall investment.
International Interconnection
2.22      Algeria supplies, by means of a 90-kV line from its 150 kV substa-
tion El Aouinet, some power to the town of Tadjerouine in Tunisia. Similarly
it receives in the Annaba area some power from the Fernana hydro station in
Tunisia. In 1q69, the Governments of Algeria and Morocco reached an agree-
ment in principle on interconnection of their power systems. A study, fi-
nanced by the African Development Bank, was completed in 1972. In 1973,
SONELGAZ and Office Nationale de d'Electricité (ONE) of Morocco reached
agreement on 220-kV interconnection between Oran and Oujda in Morocco for
mutual support and reserve. The link is scheduled for completion by 1976/77.
3. THE BORROWER
Legal Background
3.01      SONELGAZ is the successor to l'Electricité et Gaz d'Algerie (EGA),
which was created in 1947 when all electricity and gas companies in Algeria
were nationalized by the French Covernment.  In 1969, the Algerian Government
dissolved EGA and created SONELGAZ, vesting all former rights and obligations
of EGA in thie new company. See Annex 4 for details on legal background.



- 6-
Management and Organization
3.02      Management.  The company's management is satisfactory.  Its Chief
Executive is the General Manager, who is appointed by Government decree upon
the recommendations of the Minister of Industry and Energy. The present Gen-
eral Manager was appointed in 1970. The ordinance of July 1969, which created
SONELGAZ, stipulated that the company was to be controlled by a Board (Comite
d'Orientation et de Controle) of 12 members comprising a President, the Gen-
eral Manager, representatives of various miùistries, the party, and employees.
This committee, however, was never instituted because of changed views with
respect to management of socialistic organizations; it is expected that
workers participation in management will be required by law in 1975. The
committee's prerogatives are now vested in a Management Committee (Comite
de Direction) comprising the General Mlanager and the 5 directors and 9 chiefs
of the various divisions, departments, and advisory services.
3.03      Organization.  SONELGAZ has 4 major divisions, each headed by a
Director: Electrical Planning and Construction, Planning for Gas Production
and Transport, Generation and Transmission, and Distribution. Contributory
services are provided by 8 departments: Financial, Economic, Legal, Person-
nel, Training, Procure,ment and Stores, Organization, and Information. All
executive officers are Algerian.
3.04      Staffing.  At the end of J972, SONELGAZ employed 6,277 regular
staff, which has increased since 1968 by a modest average of 2.5% annually
(see Annex 5). The number of staff is reasonable. Combined energy sales of
electricity and gas (both expressed in energy equivalent) per employee rose
from 0.55 x 106 therm in 1968 to 0.75 x 106 therm in 1972. Assuming that all
gas consumers are also electricity consumers (204,860 gas consumers and
807,420 electricity consumers in 1972), the ratio rose from 118:1 in 1968 to
129:1 in 1972, which îs reasonable.
3.05      The replacement of foreign employees (which numbered 464 in 1963)
by Algerian personnel has been more rapid than SONELGAZ considered desirable
due to the difficulty of retaining and recruiting such staff in view of the
currency restrictions which do not allow staff to repatriate surplus earningd.
This explains the fluctuations in foreign staff, which ntmbered 119 in 1970,
rose to 181 in 1971 and dropped again to 141 in 1972.
3.06      Training.  SONELGAZ has excellent training programs and facilities
in Blida and Ben Aknoun, where up to 250 students can be trained for periods
of several months up to 2 years in basic technical courses, or follow re-
fresher courses. It is difficult, however, to attract new trainees because
of the insufficiency of their basic training and the fact that interest in
technical work is low. As a consequence, the training capacities of the
centers are not fully utilized and the dropout rate is high (up to 50% for
young trainees). Algeria has many training centers for administration, and
full use is made of these centers to train clerical staff, and for higher
staff to study special subjects. Career development possibilities are good,
provided the employee shows initiative. In 1972, about 40 employees were
enrolled (up to 4 years) at universities and other training centers in Algeria
ancd 33 were attending courses at institutes and universities in France, Belgium
and Russia.

3.07      Organization Study  In early 1973, SONELGAZ informed the Bank of
its wish to engage consultants to study and make recommendations for its re-
organization and to modernize its administrative procedures in view of its
rapid growth. Subsequently, in accordance with the Bank guidelines for em-
ployment of consultants, SONELGAZ engaged the services of P.A. International
of the U.K., on conditions and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (see
Annex 6). The foreign exchange cost of the study, which is expected to be
completed in about 3 years, amounts to abou: US$750,000, which would be fi-
nanced from the proposed loan. SONELGAZ has agreed to review with the Bank,
prior to implementation, the actions it proposes to take as a result of these
studies. Retroactive financing of about US$50,O00 is proposed for financing
this contract.
3.08      Planning.  SONELGAZ's long-term planning, which is executed by its
own engineers, is in broad outlines only. Until recently, investment decisions
were based on financial and technical rather than economic considerations. The
company has now initiated the use of discounted cash flow methods for comparison
of alternative major components within its programn, particularly development
in generation. This approach, however, does not yet take into account that for
evaluation of alternatives the relevant cost is the cost to the economy (e.g.,
fuel costs like natural gas are taken at the low price paid by SONELGAZ to
SONATRACH, not the pre-liquefaction price reflecting the international market
price, or future replacement cost (see 5.09).
3.09      Operations.  SONELGAZ's facilities are well run and operation is
generally satisfactory.  Annex 5 provides some statistics and company indi-
cators for 1968-1972.
'ratiffs
3.10      Electricity.  SONELGAZ's electricity tariffs, which have not been
changed since their implementation in 1965, are stipulated in a "Cahier de
Charges" for high tension and one for low tension supply. Their structure
was designed by Electricité de France (EdF) for l'Electricité et Gaz d'Algerie,
and represents the French "tarif vert" concept, i.e. marginal costing. In
theory, tariffs should be adjusted on the basis of economic indicators for
high and low tension networks. Since the issue of the cahiers de charges,
however, no adjustment has been allowed by the Government because such ad-
justment would not be in accordance with present policy.
3.11      All tariffs have an annual demand charge per kW (high tension) or
kVA (low tension), metered or subscribed, and kWh charges depending on the
time of day, the season and location (except for domestic purposes for which
the fixed charge and kWh charge are equal throughout the country). Special
tariffs cater for complementary or standby supply to auto-producers and a
reactive charge can be applied for industry. Although the structure is
basically the same, the diversity of industrial tariffs is large due to
the division in zones. Typical for Algiers are the following high tension
tariffs:

Demand charge:  DA 45/kW year

Typical domestic tariffs are:
0.5 kVA                    1 or 2 kVA
Fixed charge DA/year              6                           35
Energy charge DAe/kWh            35                           28
Average revenue for 1972 was: high tension (i.e. most industrial connections)
9.5 DAé/kWh (USJ2.3/kWh); low tension (domestic and small industry) 32.6 DA,/
kWh (US,8.0/kWh); average: DAJ17.1/kWh (USe4.2/kWh).
3.12      A tariff study was made in 1965 by a French firm, indicating thh*t
the general tariff structure was still appropriate.  Some minor changes were
recommended in the low tension tariffs but a 20% increase in high tension
tariffs was recommended to reflect the relevant cost of supply.  No action
was taken because the Government declined to authorize any tariff increase.
3.13       In order to assess the impact on costs of its development program,
SONELGAZ has agreed to engage qualified consultants prior to March 31, 1975,
on terms of reference and conditions acceptable to the Bank, to,carry out an
electricity tariff study, and review with the Bank, prior to implementation,
the actions it proposes to take as a result of this study. Suggested terms
of reference for this study which is to be financed from the proposed loan,
are given in Annex 6.
3.14      Gas.  SONELGAZ's gas tariffs were revised in November 1968, when
the Government decreed a reduction of about 50% in view of the conversion
to indigenous natural gas, and for social reasons.  There are 3 tariffs:
-    Domestic:  ranging from DAi1.8-DAe5.2/therm (1 therm
1,000 kcal or about 4,000 BTU);
-    Small industry:  fixed charge DA 162/year, and energy charge
of DAé1.3/therm; and
-    Large industry:  individual contracts because the tariff for
bulk supply is still being studied.



-9-
Average revenue for 1972 was:  high pressure (i.e. most industrial connec-
tions) DAi0.9/therm (USe0.22/therm or US$0.56/106 BTU); low pressure (domes-
tic and small industry) DAt2.5/therm (USe0.S'1/therm or US$1.53/106 BTU); aver-
age DAe1.3/therm (USe0.32/therm or US$0.78/ 06 BTU). The number of consumers
was 204,860. In order to relate SONELGAZ's gas development program as closely
as possible to actual requirements (see 2.21) in view of the current and fore-
cast deficiency aspects of SONELGAZ's gas operations (see 6.22), the company
has agreed to combine a study of its gas tariffs and the market with
the tariff study for electricity (see 3.13 and Annex 6).
4. THE PROJECT
Project Description
4.01      The Project, which is described in detail in Annex 7, consists of:
(a)  gas turbine plants with a capacity of 120 MW to be installed
at Algiers, comprising a power station with two 40-MW units
at Boufarik substation, southwest of the city, and a power
station with one 40-MW unit at Bab-ez-Zonar substation, east
of the city;
(b) main dispatch center (including a district dispatch center
for routine operation of facilities in the central part of
the country) at SON?LGAZ's new head-office at Algiers;
district dispatch centers at Oran and Annaba; transmitting
facilities along transmission and telephone lines; sending
and receiving facilities at power stations, and at 220-kV
substations and other selected substations;
(c) construction of three 220-kV substations (El Asnam, Marsat
El Hadjadj and El Hadjar extension), six 60-kV substations
(Hassi Ameur, Ain Skhouna, Ben Aknoun, Bordj Bou Arreridj,
Constantine South, Laghouat, and one 90-kV substation
(Souk Ahras); and
(d) consulting services for improvement of SONELGAZ's organiza-
tion including administration and accounting, a tariff study
for electricity and a market/tariff study for gas.
Cost Estimates
4.02)     The estimated cost of the Project (Annex 8), excluding interest
during construction, is US$64.3 million, of which US$38.5 million would be
in foreign exchange. Cost estimates are summarized as follows:

4.03      The cost estimates have been based on SONELGAZ's estimates for the
gas turbine stations and substations, and consultant's estimates for the dis-
patch system.  These estimates are based on end-1973 price levels of similar
substation equipment and gas turbines. They include import duties, which
average 10-12% on the imported component. Physical contingencies of 15%
on local cost and 5% (gas turbines) and 7% (dispatch and substations) on
foreign exchange cost have been added. To allow for future price rises
both for local and foreign cost, compounded increases were assumed, allow-
ing for 14% in 1974, 11% in 1975, and 7.5% thereafter. On the basis of
these estimates, the gas turbine stations would cost about US$230/kW with
a foreign exchange component of US$145/kW. This is considered realistic
in view of the local cost incurred in the construction of power station
buildings and the fact that the foreign cost does not include the cost of
substation modifications which are to be carried out under SONELGAZ's gen-
eral program.
Status of Engineering and Construction
4.04      Dispatch System.  SONELGAZ has engaged EdF to study the dispatch system
anld prepare bid documents under a contract acceptable to the Bank. The contract
specifies that during all work stages EdF will provide the necessary staff to
adlvise and assist SONELGAZ in the execution of the scheme, and train personnel.
Ihis is in accordance with SONELGAZ's general policy of assuming formal respon-
sibi.lity for execution of a project. This is acceptable in view of the com-
petence of SONELGAZ's staff.  Retroactive financing, amounting to about
US$250,(000, is proposed for this engineering contract.



- 11 -
4.015     Gas Turbine Stations.  SONELGAZ (with limited assistance from con-
quitants) has procured and installed a number of package gas turbines similar
to the proposed Bank-financed gas turbine plant to be installed in Algiers.
It intends to engage the services of consulting engineers under arrangements
similar to those made for the dispatch system for carrying out the works.
4.06      Substations.  SONELGAZ prepares all designs for its substation pro-
gram.  It engages consultants (currently SocieteGenerale pour l'Industrie of
Switzerland and Electrobel of Belgium) to review the final design and super-
vise the required testing. Due to the lack of sufficient competent staff,
SONELGAZ hires specific staff from its consultants for expert assistance
in the execution and supervision of complicated projects.  This policy of
limited consultant services would also apply to the substations to be fi-
nanced under the proposed loan, and is acceptable.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.07      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would finance the c.i.f. cost
of imported materials and equipment and the foreign exchange cost of related
installation services and consulting services. All contracts to be financed
from the proposed loan (except for consulting services) would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding, consistent with Bank Group
Guidelines for Procurement. Although Algerian industry manufactures little
of the required equipment, a preference of 15% or applicable duties, which-
ever is the lesser, would be granted to Algerian manufacturers who do par-
Licipate. Retroactive financing totalling about US$300,000 (see 3.07 and
4.04) for consulting services is proposed. The expected disbursements from
the proposed loan are shown in Annex 9.
4.08      Should the Project foreign exchange cost be less than estimated,
any undisbursed amount would be allocated to consultant services for the
next stage of development or, if not required for this purpose, would be
cancelled. Procurement is expected to be completed by the end of 1975,
and the Project by June 30, 1978. The closing date should be December 31,
1979, to allow for some slippage and final guarantee payments.
Environment
4.09)     The environmental impact of the gas turbine plants is negligible
because they will be located outside population centers and operate on na-
tural gas which ensures a minimum of noxious and visible fumes. The sub-
stations will be located in sparsely populated areas where amenity consid-
erations are minimal.

5. JUSTIFICATION
Objectives
5.01       The main objective of the Project is to assist SONELGAZ in remedy-
ing difficulties encountered in its interconnected system, which stretches
for about 1,000 km along the coast. Problems are being experienced in main-
taining stability, voltage, security of supply and spinning reserve, which
are further aggravated by the inadequacy of the present control system com-
prising limited communication facilities only. The proposed dispatch facil-
ities included in the Project would help remedy these problems. By install-
ing additional gas turbine plant in the Algiers area, the present regional
capacity imbalance in the system would be reduced.  An important objective
of the proposed loan is also to assist SONELGAZ in improving its organiza-
tion and administration.
Forecast of Power Requirements
5.02       SONELGAZ's growth trend (least square method) ln sales since 1966,
wlhen sales started improving after a stagnant period of several years, has
been about 11%. An average annual growth of 14% is expected for 1973-1978.
For 1973 and 1974, sales are expected to increase by 17% and 15% respectively,
reducing to 12% by 1978. The forecast does not take into account the possible
effects of the recent substantial increases in international prices for oil
anci natural gas, because the effect on power demand may not become markedly
noticeable before 1976/77. For scheduling of additional capacity, however,
a higher growth rate has been assumed (see Annex 13) to reflect the possi-
bility of requirements exceeding the present forecast.
5.03       It is extremely difficult to forecast SONELGAZ's growth because:
(a)  the period of real growth covers only 6 years (1966-1972); and
(b)  the company has not yet been able to fully develop a method to
assess delays in new industrial plant completion and actual power
demand of such plant; this problem is further aggravated because
national companies do not provide full details on their future
development plans.
5.04       SONELGAZ has taken three approaches in forecasting power require-
nients (see Annex 13). First, an exponential curve was fitted by least squares
to past growth in generation, and extrapolated. Secondly, the 17 sectors of
the economy, as divided for statistical purposes, and domestic consumners,
were studied to assess background growth, to which were added new industrial
plant requirements in accordance with the national plan. Thirdly, a mathe-
matical model was prepared reflecting GNP and number of inhabitants for 16
developing countries, which was then applied to Algeria. The results vary
widely; during appraisal these forecasts were discussed with SONELGAZ in view
of the uncertainties in industrial plant development, and a combination of
inethods 1 and 3 was adopted for the average growth rate.

5.05      The increase in relative importance of sales to industry, partic-
ularly to the oil and gas industry, is shown in Annex 10; the increase in
sales is summarized as follows:

5.06      Existing plant, and plant to be installed during 1973-1978, as well
as fuel requirements and cost for each type of plant and type of fuel, are
shown in Annexes 11 and 12. Conversion from residual oil to natural gas for
fuel and a relatively small amount of flare gas from refineries will be sub-
stantially completed in 1974, except for some outlying systems not yet con-
nected to a natural gas pipeline. SONELGAZ currently pays only DA 0.007/m3
(or about USé4.4/106 BTU) for natural gas, and total fuel cost (including
flare gas and soate residual and diesel oil) per kWh generated would be re-
duced from DAi 0.490/kWh (IJS mil 1.20/kWh) in 1973 to DAJ 0.241/kWh (US mil
0.59/kWh) by 1978; gas turbines would then generate 890 GWh or 22% of thermal
generation (totalling 4,000 GWh, which itself is about 90% of total genera-
tion, including hydro, amounting to 4,420 GWh).
Generating Plant
5.07      With the completion of the 2 x 137 MW steam-electric plant at Skikda
in 1974/75, increasing amounts of power will have to be transferred to Algiers
(400 km) and to Oran (800 km), and new plant will be required in these areas
to meet requirements and to improve the balance of capacities and reserves.
Because it appears likely that the installation of gas turbine plant will be
the least cost development following Skikda, the only two reasonable alter-
natives to be studied are the following: Alternative 1, the next step in
generation would be the installation of gas turbines followed by steam plant,
and Alternative 2, steam plant only would be installed.
5.08      At the estimated opportunity cost of capital of about 9%, constant
prices as of the time of appraisal, and financial cost of fuel, Alternative
1 would have a present value of DA 28 million below the present value of
Alternative 2, mainly due to the lower capital cost of gas turbines and their
use primarily for peaking. The decision is not significantly sensitive to
variations in construction cost because in order to equalize the present value
of both alternatives at a discount rate of 9%, gas turbine plant cost should
have to be at least 14% higher, and steam plant cost 14% lower, than estimated,
whieh appears highlv unlikely.



- 14 -
5.09      The effect on Project justification  of varying assumptions for the
economic cost of fuel was tested. In view of the large gas reserves (some
4,000 x 109 m3) - the date at which foreign exchange cost vould be incurred
due to the use of gas for power, is not the date (or dates) on which the gas
would actually be used, but the date on which - as a result of this usage -
the gas would not be available for export. Conservatively assuming a run-out
date of 25 years for the field and, in view of the uncertainties, an economic
well head price ranging from US$1.20-1.70/106 BTU, and a shadow exchange rate
raniging from DA 4 - DA 6/US$, the above present value difference of DA 28 mil-
lion (in favor of Alternative 1) would reduce by a minimum of about DA 6.6
million and a maximum of DA 9.4 million; thus the conclusion is not sensitive
to teic economic. cost of fuel for the values assumed, which cover the likely
ransge of possibilities.
Dispatch System
5.10      Because SONELGAZ's system, in which increasing amounts of power
have to be transferred over distances up to 800 km, would become progres-
sively more unmanageable, the present telephonic dispatch should be replaced
by an automated system. Advanced installation of gas turbine plant in the
weakest (western) part of the system could conceivably allow postponing
construction of the dispatch system by several years, and for this purpose
two alternatives have been studied (see Annex 13). Alternative 1 assumes
that the dispatch systemi would be completed by 1976 and that gas turbine
plant (80 MW) for Oran would be installed by 1979 as currently envisaged.
Alternative 2 assumes the dispatch system to be delayed by 3 years, which
would require advancing installation of 60 MW in gas turbine plant by a
similar period.
5.11      At the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Algeria of 9%, the
present value of Alternative 1 would be about DA 3.5 million below the pres-
ent value of Alternative 2, indicating that the dispatch system should be
completed as soon as possible. This conclusion is rather insensitive to
construction cost; the cost of the dispatch system should have been under-
estimated by 18% and the cost of gas turbine plant overestimated by 18%, in
order to cause both alternatives to break even at 9%. The conclusion is not
sensitive to an increase in the price of fuel (i.e. using economic cost of
fuel ratlher than financial cost). Such increase would benefit Alternative 1,
because the extra fuel required in relation to increased revenues (due to
decrease in system outages) for this alternative is less than the net sav-
ings in fuel attributable to this alternative.
Substations
5.12      The substations near Oran/Arew (El Asnam, Marsat El Hadjadj, Hassi
Ar,eur), Algiers (Ben Aknoun) and in the east (Constantine South, El Hadjar
:xd Souk Ahras) all are required (see Annex 13) to meet rapidly increasing
demanld, mainly for industry and urban developments, which cannot be met by
tiue present subtransmission lines and substations and alternative extensions
tliereto. Three substations at Ain Skhouna, Bordj Bou Arreridj and Laghouat
are the only reasonable technical solutions for meeting increased demand re-
sulting from increased requirements of existing and new domestic consumers



- 15 -
ani fron the execution of small infrastructure projects in the interior; high
cost die-sel plant in Ain Skhouna and Laghout would be eliminated, and Bordj
ioi Arredi.dj would be connected to a 60-kV line to be constructed for a cement
f SIc torv.
Rate of Return of Project
5.13      The rate of return of a project is the discount rate which equalizes
the present values of the cost and benefit streams attributable over time to
the project. Because the proposed Project comprises a dispatch system, gas
turbine plant mainly used for peaking and reserve, and substations, for which
benefits are extremely difficult to quantify, it was deemed appropriate to
assess the rate of return on SONELGAZ's overall 1973-1978 expansion program
for electricity, of which the Project constitutes a small but representative
part (9.4%). Revenues from additional output have been used as an approxima-
tion of the benefits. These revenues understate the benefits consumers re-
ceive from the development program because it is considered that a tariff
increase of reasonable magnitude (say 10-20%) would not reduce demand sig-
nificantly.
5.14      At present tariffs the rate of return of the development program
and, consequently, of the Project, is about 15% (Annex 13). This rate of
return is coxisidered reasonable because, after a long period of slow expan-
sion, the current program includes a backlog of construction to restore an
adequate balance of capacities and service quality, and the requirements for
execution of a national plan, the additional benefits of which, if achieved,
cannot be quantified with any degree of certainty. The rate of return would
increase to about 21% in the event of a favorable combination of a 10% reduc-
tion in the investment program and in operational cost, and a 10% increase
in revenue. Because conservative estimates have been used in forecasting
SONELGAZ's revenues from the sale of electricity, the probability of results
in line with these more favorable assumptions appears high. If the above
three factors would combine unfavorably (10% increase in construction and
operating cost and a 10% reduction in revenue), the rate of return would
decrease to somewhat less than 8%. This combination appears unlikely.
The rate of return is expected to range from 15-17%.
6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
SONELGAZ's Financial Responsibility and Viability
6.01      Although SO)NELGAZ is an autonomous commercial entity, in practice it
has little financial independence. Management is hampered by numerous Gov-
ernrvent controls (e.g. according to SONELGAZ's 1971 Annual Report about 20 ap-
provals are required for awardlng a contract).  The Ministry of Industry and
Energy controls SONELGAZ's activities and approves all decisions on organiza-
tion and personnel. SONELGAZ's operation and construction budgets must be
approved by the Ministries of Planning and Finance, which arrange external
financing for projects once they are included in the National Development



- 16 -
Plan. Tariffs are subject to Government approval. InternaL resources gen-
erated in excess of the amount required for meeting the renewal program,
should under the law be invested in Treasury Bonds, but the Company is
currently exempted from this (see 6.10).
6.02      At the end of 1972 the overall financial situation of SONELGAZ was
sound, although during the preceding 3-year period the revenue growth rate
had been decreasing while the operating expenses had been increasing at a
growing rate. The situation for the electricity activity is expected to
remain satisfactory. lHowever, SONELGAZ's financial situation as a whole
would be weakened by the burden of an ambitious construction program and
because earnings from electricity are subsidizing the unprofitable gas and
miscellaneous activities. Consequently, the company would not remain viable
unless (i) non-essential components of the investment program are curtailêd
including a substantial revision of the gas program (see 2.21), and (ii) the
Governtent and the company implement appropriate financïal measures to alle-
viate the debt service requirements and, if needed, provide comnplementary
financial assistance in the form of grants. The Goverrment and SONELGAZ
agreed to take appropriate measures (see 6.27).
Accounts
6.03      The accounting methods still reflect those implemented in France
by the National Accounting Council. Although this system is largely satis-
factory, it still requiîrs some adjustment, now underway, to meet SONELGAZ's
specific requiretaents and to speed up the accounting procedures. At ptesent,
a rather old punch card system is being uged in Algiers and Oran for account-
ing, inventories, billing of domestic consumers and payroll; however, a new
Gk 115 Honeywell computer is being installed îti Algiers and several new ap-
plications for data prbcetsing are being developed.
6,04      SONELGAZ's âccouints are consolidated; however, a pattial breakdovn
of the balance sheet is available for electticity, gas and other activitieà,
and in 1972, for the first time, detailed aepatàte revenue accounts for eath
bf these activities were attached to the consolidated accounts with a break-
ddwn for generation, transmission and distribution. In September of each yeAâ,
SNELGAZ prepares an opetation and construction budget for the current year
and the following yeat, thich is sent to the Government for approval.  In
June, SONELGAZ prepares an annual repott on the previous yeat's accounts,
containing information (even criticism) which one usually expects to find
btly in an external auditot's report. This antual report i8 very detailed
and satisfactory.
Audit
6.05      According to the law creating SONELGAZ a Commissaire aux Comptes
exercises financial controls on behalf of the Government and prepares an
audit of the Company's accounts. This Commissaire aux Comptes is appointed
by the Minister of Finance from the staff of the Government's Financial
Control Departnent. He is entirely independent of SONELGAZ and reports



- 17 -
to the Government. His audit, in association with the Annual Financial Report
issued by the Company, would be satisfactory for the Bank. However, the
Commissaire aux Comptes has not yet issued his 1971 and 1972 reports. During
negotiations the Bank confirmed that the audit of the Commissaire aux Comptes
is acceptable, and the Government and the Bank will consult with each other
on the conditions under which such audit is performed. The Government has
indicated that it will cause the Commissaire aux Comptes to perform his audit
in such time that this audit will be received in the Bank not later than
Septenmber of each year.
Insurance
6.06      SONET,CAZ insures its major assets against the usual hazards (fire,
transport, third party, electrical or mechanical damage to machinery, etc.)
throuigh the Caisse Algerienne d'Assurances et du Reassurances (CAAR) and the
Societe Algerienne d'Assurances (SAA). Both are nationalized companies which
reinsure through the world insurance market.  In 1972, the insurance premium
amiounted to DA 6 million against a total net fixed asset value of DA 2,875
million (0.2%). Since 1967, however, it no longer covers electrical or
mechanical damage to transmission lines and substations, which are the
most frequent. Negotiations are in progress with CAAR to insure these assets.
Taxes, Duties, and Sbcial Security
6.07      SONELGAZ is liable for income tax (20% of net income after inter-
est on debt), sales tax (averaging 7.9% of which 7% is charged to consumers),
salarv tax (6% on all salaries) and custom duties (varying from 0 to 100%
and resulting in 7 to 8% of the total construction cost). SONELGAZ is also
liable for a construction tax of 10% of the bills paid to contractors, but
presently has an exemption until 1975 which probably will be extended.
6.(8      SONELGAZ's social security plan includes free medical treatment,
retirement provisions, dependents' benefits, holiday camps for staff children,
etc. In 1972, the cost amounted to DA 26 million or about 20% of gross wages
and salaries.
Contribution to Government's Development Program
6.0U'     Like all other national companies, SONELGAZ is required to con-
tribute about 50% of its net consolidated surplus (before allocation to reserves),
forecast one year in advance, to the cost of the Government's development
program. No reimbursement takes place if the actual surplus is less than
expected, or if a loss is incurred. The contribution amounted to DA 11 mil-
lion iri 1971, DA 8 million in 1972, DA 10 million in 1973, and will reach
rDA 15 million in 1974.
6.1)     SONELGAZ is also required to invest in Treasury Bonds, the amount
charged for depreciation.  However, an annually renewable exemption from this
obligation has been granted up to the hmount required for the renewal and
routine development programs.

Balance Sheet
,.11      Fixed Assets - SONELGAZ's actual 1970-1972 and forecast 1973-1978
consolidated balance sheets are in Annex 14. Major assumptions are stated
in Annex 18. At the end of 1972, gross fixed assets in operation (DA 2,949
viillion) and work in progress (DA 1,023 million) aggregated DA 3,972 million,
of which 77% was for electricity, 10% for gas and 13% for Head Office and
general. From 1972 through 1978, gross fixed assets in operation would in-
crease at an average annual rate of 11% for electricity and 23% for gas. The
1972 fixed assets anc 1973-1978 forecast fixed assets do not include any cap-
italized interest during construction, which is treated as an expense. In
1972, accumulated depreciation amounted to 39% of gross fixed assets in opera-
tionI. In 1961, the existing assets were revalued by DA 347 million. About
40% of the capital expenditures at the end of 1973 was made after 1967 and 27%
after 1970. Under these conditions the present assets valuation is reasonable
and is expected to remain so due to the effects of the large continuing develop-
ment vrogram.  At the end of 1972, the amount of work in progress was high -
about 35% of the 1972 gross value of assets in operation - because the volume
of work has sharply increased since 1968 and transfer from work in progress to
assets in operation is generally slow. However, this is expected to improve.
bv the end of 1978 work in progress would reduce to about 18% of the gross
value of the assets in operation.
6.1'')    Inventories - The average turnover of materials in stock is too low,
chliefly because of the slow and intricate administrative procedure for purchase
and import of materials, which causes SONELGAZ to overstock in order to avoid
possible interruption in operation and construction. SONELGAZ expects that
the Government will ease the procedure, permitting the company to gradually
reduce the turnover to about 8 months by 1978.
6.13      Receivables - At the end of 1972, receivables amounted to DA 285
million and represented about 76% of the total revenue for the year. The
bills in arrears for electricity and gas supplies amounted to DA 137 million
against a revenue of DA 353 million, or an average of 142 days of billing.
The following table summarizes the situation by consumer categories:
Outstanding        Revenue       Equivalent

- 19 -
For general consumers the situation is satisfactory. The proportion of bills
collected in the year of issuance was 93.9% in 1972. On the other hand, the
situation was bad and worsening from year to year with respect to Government
and Municipalities as well as National Companies. For the former, the propor-
tion of hills collected in the year of issue was only 53% in 1972 and 72%
for the latter. The company has informed the Government of this situation
repeate.dly, through its annual report. The Government has informed the Bank
that it expects to settle arrears within a reasonable time, in principle be-
fore December 31, 1976, and is expected to cause its offices and the National
Companies to pay promptly for future services.
6.14      At the end of 1972, accounts receivable for debtors other than con-
sumers amounted to DA 86.4 million. Of this amount, about DA 35 million was
for taxes incorrectly assessed on the Company, according to SONELGAZ. DA 17
million pertains to cash advances to two subsidiaries, TRAVELEC and SERIG,
responsible for civil works in electricity and gas. The latter amount will
be transferred to "loan" and "portfolio" in the 1973 and 1974 accounts.
6.15      Equity - There are no stocks or shares.  The Government is legally
entitled teo receive a dividend but has agreed to replace this by the contribu-
tion to Government's development program (see 6.09). As of December 31, 1972,
the ecuitv amounted to DA 1,832 million, including: (i) DA 1,145 million main-
ly for assets transferred from former French companies and taken over by the
Government after independence; (ii) DA 368 million in Government contributions
for rural development, and (iii) DA 272 million in consumers' contributions.
Accumulated profits were negligible. From 1973 through 1978 Government con-
tributions for rural electrification would grow by DA 553 million and consumers'
contributions by DA 335 million. It has also been assumed that during the
period the Government would transform DA 27 million of existing loans into
equity related to the electricity activity, and would grant DA 70 million in
subsidies for the gas activity (see 6.24).
6.16      Long-Term Debt - As of December 31, 1972, outstanding long-term
debt was DA 1,221 million, a breakdown of which is shown in Annex 19.  A
major feature of this debt is the very low average interest rate (2.9% in
1972).  Tlis is the result of numerous adjustments of accounts between the
Government and the company within the framework of the general settlement
of problems between France and Algeria.  With the exception of the first
IBRD power loan (DA 11 million outstanding) and suppliers' credits, the exist-
ing debt at the end of 1972 consisted of loans from Algerian banks or long-
terni credits from the Treasury. All banks in Algeria have been nationalized.
Besides the Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD), there are three other
banks, of which the Banque Nationale Algerienne (BNA) is allowed to make
loans to SONELGAZ. One savings institution, the Caisse Nationale d'Epargne
eL de Prévoyance (CNEP), is also allowed to make loans. On the basis of the
assuni%pt ons made in tLuis report, long-term debt would increase by DA 1471
million during 1973-1978 (see 6.24).  The debt/equity ratio would remain at
about 40/60.



- 20 -
Past and Forecast Operating Results
6.17      A major feature of the consolidated income statement for 1970-72
(actual) and 1973-1978 (forecast) (see Annex 15) is the steadily growing in-
terest on long-term debt which, despite the low rate, would have risen from
nearly 6% of the expenses (including depreciation), in 1970 to 18% in 1978.
SONELGAZ, which had an average net annual surplus of about DA 18 million for
each of the 3 years 1970-1972, would accumulate an average net annual surplus
of about DA 31 million for each of the following 6 years. Annex 16 gives a
breakdowm of SONELGAZ's 1972 revenue account for electricity, gas and other
activities. The following table summarizes a similar breakdown for 1973-1978:

Electricity sales are 80.0% of conso:.idated revenue and gas sales 12.9%; the
remaining 7.1% comprises revenue from works for consumers, revenue from sales
of appliances, sales of by-products or scrap, rental fee for staff housing,
etc. Operating expenses for electricity, gas and other activities account
for 71.6%, 15.0% and 13.4%, respectively, of total expenses before depreciation.
During 1973-1978 the average growth rate of revenue from sales would be 12.8%
as against 13% between 1969 and 1972. Operating expenses before depreciation
are assumed to increase at an average rate of 9.5% during the period as against
11% between 1969 and 1972 because of the conversion to natural gas as the prin-
cipal fuel for the power stations, the closing down by the end of 1974 of
tiie manufactured gas plants, and the increase in efficiency expected in
the power production.
6.18       Depreciation, for which the straight line method is used, is satis-
factory.  Depreciation rates are based on the expected life of assets:  30
years for most of the equipment in thermal power stations, 50 years for civil
works and buildings, 30 and 40 years for overhead lines and substations, 75
years for dams and reservoirs, and 10 and 5 years for office equipment and
vehicles.
Electricity Department Operating Results
6.19       The forecast income statement and operating results of the Elec-
tricity Department from 1972 (actual) through 1978, assumes an average an-
nual growth rate in sales of about 14% (see 5.35), as against 9% in 1972,
with no changes in SONELGAZ's tariffs.  During the period the annual revenue
generated by the assets in operation (gross value) would be a steady 14.0
Net operating income ranges from DA 67 million in 1972 (22% of sales) to DA
166 million (27% of sales) in 1978. Annual surplus would average DA 55 mil-
lion for the period. A comparison with EdF, which uses similar administra-
tive and operational methods, shows that in 1972 administration and over-
head costs for thermal generation (about DA 30 per kW) were satisfactory. The
cost of operation and maintenance, excluding fuel, was 30% above the French
cost. This is partially due to the smaller size of the plants and the dif-
ference in workers' skills. However, SONELGAZ could improve its productivi-
ty, which is one of the purposes of the reorganization study (see 3.07) and
the objective of various technical improvements now under way. The operat-
ing ratio (before depreciation) was 57% in 1972. Forecast revenue accounts
assume that by 1978 the operating ratio will decrease to about 50%.
6.20       Based on the revised construction program (see 2.21 and Annex 3),
the rate of return of electricity assets (including an adequate proportion of
headquarters and consumer assets) would range from 5.0% in 1972 to 7.0% in
1978. This realistic objective, combined with other proposed financial
covenants (see 6.27), would provide SONELGAZ's electricity sector with a
reasonable financial position.
6.21       During negotiations, the Government and SONELGAZ agreed that in the
year 1974 and thereafter, they would take all measures to provide, by the end
of 1978, a rate of return of not less than 7% on the average net electrical



- 22 -
fixed assets in operation.  The calculation of this rate of return would be
made by considering only revenues and expenses related to the electricity
activity, including a reasonable allocation for head office or general over-
heads. Electrical fixed assets would exclude assets financed by consumers
but include a reasonable proportion of Headquarter's and other assets common
to both electricity and gas activities.
Cas Department Operating Results
6.22      In 1972 the gas activity was in deficit by about DA 9 million.
Sales increased by 8%. The average revenue per therm sold vas DAJ1.3.
The forecast assumes an average increase of sales of about 22% for 1973
through 1978, much less than initially expected by SONELGAZ. However, the
net operating income for the gas operation would be almost nil during 1973-
1978 and, after payment of interest on debt, a deficit of about DA 125 million
would accumulate. SONELGAZ's gas activity, under present conditions, is not
viable. The deficit heretofore has been financed by electricity surplus.
Forecast financial statements attached to this report assume that the Govern-
ment will grant subsidies in sufficient amount to meet the difference between
the internal cash generation and the debt service related to the gas activity.
Other Activities Operating Results
6.23      In 1972, these activities were in deficit by about DA 4 million be-
cause charges made to consumers do not adequately cover overhead expenses.
The forecast shows deficits accumulating to about DA 20 million in respect
cf '973/74.  For future years the Government and SONELGAZ agreed to set prices
and charges to consumers at such levels so as to assure revenue from these
activities and services would at least cover costs including reasonably allo-
cated overhead and general charges.
Financing Plan
6.24      SONELGAZ's 1974-1978 construction program and Financing Plan have
not yet been approved by the Governnent. SONELGAZ 's consolidated Sources and
Application of Funds for 1972 (actuai) and the proposed 1973-1978 financing
pJin, based on the assumed construction program (see 2.21), are shown in
Annex 17.  The following table summarizes the situation with an approximate
breakcdown between electricity (including general construction program) and gas.

6.25      As a matter of Government policy, and as is the case for other na-
tional companies, SONELGAZ's internal cash generation is intended to be suf-
ficient onlv to finance replacement and routine development. Revenues from
electricity, gas and other activities are not considered separately, and are
used for the financing of the activities as a whole. All major works in-
cluded in the national development plan are financed by loans made avail-
able to the company through Algerian banks, according to the Government's
instructions or from the Treasury, and exceptionally through international
lending agencies. Rural developmment is financed by Government contribu-
tioris.



- 24 -
6.26      SONELGAZ's overall financing plan does not consider separate finan-
cing for electricity and gas. For the year 1975 and thereafter, the Government
and SONELGAZ agreed to prepare separate two-year financing plans to be epproved
by the Government for each of the activities in accordance with the requirement
stated in 6.27.
6.27      Electricity Financing Plan.  The electricity financing plan con-
sidered separately is a suitable basis for a loan. During negotiations:
(a) SONELGAZ and the Government agreed that until the 7% rate of
return has been reached (see 6.21), the surplus from the
electricity activity (before charging depreciation, but
after deducting all operating expenses related to this
activity including a reasonable allocation of general
expenses, and debt service on loans allocated to electri-
city) would not be less than 15% of the average construction
program for electricity, including a reasonable proportiont of
general construction for the current and the previous year;
(b) the Government agreed to take appropriate measures to al-
leviate the burden of SONELGAZ's debt service in such a
wav that the ratio of the net revenue of SONELGAZ's elec-
tricity activity to the debt service related to this activity
for the previous and current year is not less than 1.5 for
1975 and thereafter;
(c) the Government agreed to cause the lending institutions to
set the duration of future loans to SONELGAZ commensurate
with the nature of the assets they are to finance; and
(d) SONELGAZ agreed that any funds remaining after the contribution
to the Government shall be initially applied to meet require-
ments for electricity operations.
b. LS8    Financial statements attached to this report assume that DA 27 million
of loans borrowed in 1971/72 will be transferred to equity and that the period
of future loans will be extended to 20 years including 3-1/2 year periods of
grace.
6.29      SONELGAZ's proposed financing plan assumes two foreign loans.  The
first one would be the proposed Bank loan for US$38.5 equivalent for 20 years
including a grace period of 3-1/2 years. The second loan of about US$27
million equivalent, for which similar conditions have been assumed, would
finance the foreign cost of the Arzew and Hassi R'Mel gas-turbine stations
and the installation of two more 220-kV substations.  The Government and
SONELGAZ have discussed the matter with the Bank, but have not yet formally
decide whether or not to request further assistance.



- 25 -
6. 3ù     Suppliers' credits included in the financing plan are similar to
those existing in 1972/73. The average proportion of suppliers' credits in
the long-terîn borrowing, which was about 25% in 1972 for SONELGAZ as a whole,
would remain about the same throughout 1973-1978.
6.31      Gas Financing Plan.  Without the electricity activity subsidizing
gas, or without Government grants, the gas financing plan is not viable.
Because of delays in industrial plant completion, the initial program was
oversized and requires some curtailment.  A thorough study of the gas market
is needed to ascertain the exact demand and assess which part of the program
should be reduced or postponed (see 3.14). SONELGAZ agreed to engage consult-
ant to carry out sucli a study. Financial statements attached to this report
are based on a construction program in line with the trend of the assumed
gas consumption.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.(il     S9ONELGAZ has agreed:
(a)  to furnish to the Bank for review, promptly upon completion,
the reports for the organization study, the electricity tariff
study, and the gas market/tariff study, and inform the Bank
of the actions it proposes to take as a result of the said
studies in accordance with the instructions of the Government
and in application of the Government's national development plan
(see 3.07, 3.13 and 3.14);
(b)  to take all steps necessary to employ consultants for the
electricity tariff study and gas market/tariff study, not
later than March 31, 1975 (see 3.13);
(c)  to employ qualified consultants as and when needed and on
specific assignments, upon terms and conditions satisfactory
to it and the Bank, to assist it in carrying out the work
for the Algiers gas turbine facilities and the dispatch
facilities (see 4.04, 4.05);
(d) to take all steps as shall be necessary to (i) provide by
1978 a rate of return of not less than 7% on the average net
fixed electricity assets in operation; the rate of return
shall be calculated by taking into account net income and
operating expenses for electricity, including a reasonable
proportion of other charges for overhead and general purposes;
electricity assets would exclude assets financed by consumers,
but would include a reasonable portion of headquarter facilities
and other assets common to all SONELGAZ's activities (see 6.21);
and (il) until the 7% rate of return has been reached, achieve
a surplus for the electricity activity (before charging depre-
ciation but after deducting all operating expenses related to
this activitv, including a reasonable allocation of general



- 26 -
expenses) not less than 15% of the average cost of construction
program for electricity (including a reasonable portion of
general construction) for the current and preceding year; and
that, except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, any funds
remaining after the contribution to the Government shall be
initially applied to meet requirement for electricity operations
for its operations (see 6.27);
(e)  to set prices and charges for its operations other than the
sale of electricity and gas at levels sufficient to ensure
that revenue from such other activities are not less than
their costs, including reasonably allocated overhead and
general charges (see 6.23); and
(f),  that, beginning with 1975, it will provide to the Bank,
prior to November 30 of each year, separate financing plans,
approved by the Government, covering the current and the
following year, showing the proposals for (i) meeting for
t-,e electricity activity the targets for rate of return,
tIte coverage of the construction program, and ratio of net
revenue to debt service, and (ii) meeting the operating
deficit, if any, for the gas activity, and the financing
gap, if any, for the construction program for gas (see-6.26).
7.i' '    The Covernment has agreed:
(a)  that it will take, not later than December 31 of each year,
starting with 1975, all steps necessary to ensure that the
ratio of SONELGAZ's net revenues for electricity operations
for the current year to the average debt service requirements
on loans allocated to electricity operations for the previous
and current year is not less than 1.5 (see 6.27); and
(b)  to cause the lending institutions to set the duration of future
loans to SONELGAZ coennensurate with the nature of the assets
they are to finance (see 6.27).
During negotiations the Bank has confirmed that it considers the
"(:omn.issaire aux Comptes" appointed by the Government to be independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. The Government and the Bank will consult
with eachi other, àt the request of either of them, on the conditions under
whicl such audit is performed.  The Government has indicate that it will
c.use the Commissaire aux Comptes to perform his audit in such time that
this audit will be received in the Bank not later than September of each year
(see 6.05).
7.04      During negotiations the Government and SONELGAZ have informed the
Bank that the Government is considering a settlement of debts owed to and by
Government agencies and public enterprises and that it expects that a full
settlement of such debts will have been accomplished by December 31, 1976
(s.e e ei)



- 27 -
7.0.5     In view of the agreements  and assurances on the matters listed
above, the Project provides a suitab"e basis for a Bank loan of US$38.5
million. The proposed loan would be made to SONELGAZ for a term of 20 years,
including a grace period of 3-1/2 years. A Guarantee Agreement would be
concluded between the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria and the Bank.

ANNEX 4
ALGERIA
SOCIETE NATIONALE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ
Power Project
Legal Background Information
1.        Before nationalization, supply of electricity in Algeria was
provided by more than 20 private companies under their respective conces-
sions. Folloving the nationalization in France (by Decree 46-628 of
April 18, 1946b, as modified by Decree 46-2298 of October 21, 19h6), Decree
47-1002 of June 5, 1947 (as modified by Decree (without number) of
September 17, 1947) applied nationalization for Algeria creatirg at the
same time l'Electricité et Gaz d'Algerie (EGA) as the sole public entity
to serve the sectors.
2.        Subsequent to Algerian independence, EGA was dissolved and Societe
National de l'Electriciteé et du Gaz (SONEI.GAZ) was created by Ordinance 59-
59 of July 28, 1969, which transferred all assets, rights and obligations to
the new company. SONELGAZ's statutes are annexed to this ordinance.
3.        Regulations for the employment of person'nel (Statut National du
Personnel des Industries Electriques et Gazieres), which date from 1946
(French Decree 46-1541 of June 22, 1946, declared applicable to Algeria
on June 5, 1947, and promulgated on July 10, 1947), are still applicable,
except that basic rezuneration schedules were revised on June 6, 1963, and
that many special aUowances have been added of general (13th month, emplcy-
ment allowance) and particular (productivity, travel distance, location of
employment, training, settlement, etc.) nature.
4.        SCNEIGAZ's regulations for its concession and operations, defining
its rights and duties and those of its customers, as well as its tariffs,
are laid down in two "Cahier des Charges", one covering the 60-kV supply,
and one covering 30 kV and lower tensions, in the form of an agreement
between the Minister of Industry and Energy and EGA, dating from March 3,
1965.
5.        In accordance with Decree 63.201 of June 1963 and the Ordinance
of May 27, 1966, SONEIGAZ insures its assets and other risks with the Caisse
Algerienne d'Assurances et de Reassurances and the Societ4 Algerienne
d'Assurances.

Outline of Reorganization Study
1.  In accordance with the terms of reference of a contract signed November it  ,
1973, P.A. International is carrying out the study which is expec-ted t>^
require up to three years on the following basis.
2.  In the first phase (Diagnostic Phase), the study should include the analysis
of:
- objectives of the undertaking
- its organizational structure
-  the role of each division, department and service section
-  requirements for the management information system
-  administrative systems and methods
- the role of computer facilities in administration
- use, training and upgrading of staff
- planning and preparation of projects and their control during
execution
- market strategy
- the scheduling of development stages
-  the objectives SCNELGAZ desires with respect to financial ef'iciency,
rate of return, and level of service to consumers
3. In the second phase the consultants should make detailed proposals for
review and discussions, and prepare all documents required for impiemen ta-
tion of the final recommendations, for which a period of about 20 months
is envisioned. The consultants should assist, to the extent required,
in the implementation of the recommenda+,ions.  This part of the work
would overlap the 20 month work period for the preparation of the re-
commendations, but extend about 8 months beyond this period. All aspects
should be covered as outlined for the first phase.

Provosed Terms of Reference for Tariff Studies
Electricity
1.        Exadne the marginal capacity and running costs of generation,
transmLssion and distribution of the energy for the significant times of
the-day and periods of the year, at the different voltage levels, in the
different regions of the country. This will require due attention to the
daily and seasonal variations in system demand and, to the extent possible,
to the daily and seasonal variation in demands of various consumer classes.
The period to be studied shall cover the years 1975-1978. The basis for
the estimates of marginal coats shall be the development program for the same
period, its proposed operating regime and proposals for subsequent expansion.
To the extent possible, marginal capacity and rmnming costs -hould be adjusted
for losaes, either by taiing a figure for average losses over all periods,
or by determining losses in different periods (and for different voltage
levels of service). Incremental cost of power factors shal be studied.
2.        The test discount rate to be used for the study shall-be 9%.
3.       Compare the existing tariff structure and rates with the results
of the marginal cost structure assessed on thebasis of the above. Descrip-
tion of the exiBting system should pay particular attention-to the incentive
aefects of alternative metering and tariff types. Simplification may be
qought for smaU consumers where the costs of metering are high in relation
to bills.
4.        Make recommendations for a revised tariff structure in the light
of ihe findings. To the extent possible the present structure shall be
rretained unless significant ,gaps exist between the marginal cost structure
aesesed and the existing tariff structure, and unless present tariff and
m:otring policies do notVprovide correct inventives for consumers to economnize
when marginal costs are high, and to conserve more when marginal costs are low.
5.        Assess the financial consequences of the implementation of the
recommended tarif£ structure, assuming that ths rate of return on average net
assets in operation would not be less than 6% in 1975/76, 6.5% in 1977 and
7% ini 1978, suitably revising the recommendations for tariff levels to
reflect this requirement. Any revisions of tariff levels, however, to meet
the aime of finance or simplication should be made so as to least distort
any incentive effects of the tariffs and any aims of equity.
6.        Study the impact on tariffs of progressive conversion of steam-plant
firing from natural gas to residual oil, in steps of 25% of total generation.
Make recomendations for the introduction of an adequate provision in the rate
regulations for the adjustment of rates for the sale of electricity in order



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3
to cover additional operating expenses resulting from variations in the
price paid by for fuel (other than diesel oil or other oil used in limited
quantities) for steam-electric plant and define the average price of fuel
above which the regulation should automatically apply.
7.        Prepare recommendations for the implementation of the recomnended
tariff structure in close cooperation with management, including publicity,
meter acquisition and installation, reading and billing, and necessary staff
training, to enæure and facilitate the adoption of the new tariff.
Gas
8.        A market study shall be made covering the period 1974-1978, assessing
the requirements for gas. Particular attention shall be paid to the assessment
of rsalistic completion dates of new developments in housing and factories and
their demand for gas.
9.        SCNELGAZ's construction program for gas shall be studied and revised
in accordance with the above findings, in order to relate the revised program
as close as possible to actual development.
10.       A tariff study for the gas activities shall be carried out generally
in accordance with the above terms of reference for the electricity tariff study,
but suitably adopted to the more simple nature of the gas activities. The
revised gas development program shall be taken into account.

ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 10
A. FCCAST CF SALES AND DEMAND
1.        S<NEIAZ's growth trend (by least squares method) for sales has
been about 12% since 1966 when, after a stagnant period of several years,
sales started improving. An average annual growth rate of 1I% is expected
for 1973-1978. For 1973, sales were expected to increase by about 17%.
2.        It is extremely difficult to forecast S(KEIfWAZ's growth because
(a) the period of real grouth covers only 6 years (1966-1972); and (b) the
company has not yet been able to fully develop a method to assess delays in
nov industrial plant completion and actual power requirements of such plant;
this problen is further aggrevated because national companies do not provide
full details on their future development plans.
3.        The company has taken three approaches in forecasting power require-
ments. First, an exponential curve vas fitted by least squares to growth in
generation for 1966-1973 (the latter year being included because 10 month
figures vere already available), both for the interconnected and the sum of
the isolated systems, excluding SLWATRACH. This resulted in two sets of three
curves (low, average, high forecast). These were added, together with power
generation in the outlying systens as forecast by SoeATRACH. The company did
not provide information on high and low forecasts and their probabilities.
This firet approach resulted in a minimum 1978 generation of about 4,100 GWih
(12.5% average growth over 1972) and a maximum of 4,800 GWh (15.5% average
growth).
4.        Secondly, the 17 sectors of the econony (as divided for statistical
purposes) and domestic consumers were studied to assess the background growth
of sales (aostly varying between 3% and 10% annually), to which vere added the
requirements of new industrial plant in accordance with the national plan, and
estimated losses. Possible delays in plant completion were not considered in
detail; high and low estimates were made for domestic supplies, but not for
industry. By 1978, generation required would amount to 5,500-5,700 GWh,
representing an annual increase of about 18%. A very low probability was
assumed for this estimate by S1IIELGAZ and the mission.
5.        Thirdly, a mathematical nodel was prepared reflecting GNP, number of
inhabitants, and power generation, for 16 developed and developing countries,
which was then applied to Algeria under three assumptions of growth of GNP.
This resulted in forecast generation for 1978 of 4,100 GWh (12.6% average
growth) and a maximum of about 5,300 GWh (17.4% average growth).
6.        During appraisal, the above forecasts vere discussed with SONEIGAZ
in view of the many uncertainties in industrial plant development, and the
mission agreed with SONEILiAZ on a conservative approach in forecasting sales,
in order not to overstate SCI4EL&AZ's financial results and to reflect physical
constraints in constructing new plant. For this reason, the average forecast
for mwthods 1 and 3 was adopted for the years through 1975, and the average
minimum forecast was adopted for 1976 through 1978. This results in a grorth
rate of 15% for 1974 (slightly below the expected 1973 increase), decreasing
to 12% by 1978.



ANNEX 13
Page 3 of 10
7.        Maxuni demand, on the basis of the forecast load factor (expected
to rise to 60% by 1978), would increase an average of 10.8% during 1972-1978,
to 710 Md in the latter year. In view of the uncertainties in the data, and
the conservative forecast power requiremaents, engineering considerations
dictate for planting-up purposes a slightly higher growth rate for demnand;
12% was assumed, resulting in 760 Md by 1978, or about 7% above the basic
estinate.
8.        The increase in relative iznportance of sales to industry, particularly
to the oil and gas industry, is shown by Annex 10; the increase in sales is
suimnarized as follows:
--Average Growth-
-1966--    -1972--    -1978--    1966-72        1972-78

9.        Existing plant, and plant to be installed during 1973-1978, as well
as fuel requirements and cost for each type of plant and type of fuel, are
shown in Annex 11 and 12. Conversion to natural gas for fuel and a relatively
small amount of flare gas from refineries, will be substantially completed in
1974, exept for some outlying systems not yet connected to a natural gas pipe-
lipe. SCQEDLAZ currently pays only DA 0.007/m3 (or about DAO.18/lfI3BTU-US04 .L1C/
10°BTU) for natural gas, and overall cost per kWh generated would reduce from DAe
0.490/kWh (US mil 1.20;kWh) in 1973 to DAOO.241/kWh (US mil 0.59/kl.) by 1978; gas
turbines would then generate 890 GWh or 22% of thermal generation (4,coo GWh-i,
which itself i:s about 90% of total generation amounting to 4,1430 GWh).
B . CCK4PARISCN OF ALLTETNATIVES
a. Generating Plant
Basic Considerations and Asswumtions
1.        With the coupletion of the 2x137 Mg pl.ant at Slikda in the east of
the country, increasing amoumts of poier have tVo be transferred to Algiers
(400 km) and to Oran (800 km) and new plants would be required in both locations



ANNEX 13
Page 4 of 10
in due time to meet requirements and restore an adequate balance of
capacities and reserves.
2.        For planting up purposes a 12% growth rate in maximum demand is
assuxed, slightly above the appraisal estimates. It is al8o assumed that
the requirements for the plant margin (about 45% by 1975) would be reduced
sharply prior to installing new plant, and be maintained at about 30% until
the end of the decade.
3.        In view of the Skikda unit size of 137 MW (effective 130-132 MW),
is assumed that until the end of the decade, when maximum demand would be
in the order of 900-1,000 MW, this unit size should be maintained for stea.r
plant, followed by 200 MW unit size. For gas turbine plant, for which cost
per kW is little sensitive to unit size, blocks of capacity equal to 130 MW
are being assumed.
Alternatives to be Studied
4.        Because:  (a) it is obvious that SONELGAZ primarily needs additional
capacity to firm up the system, and not energy; (b) it is an almost foregone
conclusion that at the extremely low financial cost of fuel (which may not be
necessarily true for economic cost) and lower capital cost of gas turbine plant
would favor the installation of gas turbines even when operating at a relative]y
high plant factor; and (c) the decision is required whether the next plant to be
installed should be gas turbine plant or steam plant, the following two reasoriibl le'
esti-mates were studied.
Alternative 1
Installation of gas turbine plant (260 MW) followed by steam plant.
Alternative 2
All steam development.
Discounted Cash Flow Comparison
5.        The schedules for required capacities and generation for both
alternatives are sho'wn in Attachment 1 to this Annex, as well as the various
cost streama for both alternatives. toRether with the basis of the cost assuwmed;
at constant prices as of the time of appraisal.
conclusions
6.        The equalizing discount rate up to which Alternative 1 would con-
stitute the least cost development plan, is in excess of 20%. More particular,
at the opportunity cost of capital in Algeria (estimated to be about 9%), the
development with gas turbine plant followed by steam plant would have a present
value of about DA 28 million below the present value of the all steam develop-
ment. This is mainly due to the lower capital cost of gas turbine plant and
its use primarily for peaking (hours of operation would be a maximim of about
1,400 homrs in 1979). The next step in generation development should therefore
be gas turbine plant.



ANNEX 13-
Page 5 of LC
Sensitivity of Cost Variations
7.        Sensitivity to variations in operational cost (including fuel at
financial cost) is negligibly small.
8.        In order to cause the alternatives to break even in the discountod
cash flow comparison at the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 9%, the
cost of gas turbine plant would have to be about 14% higher and the cost of
steam plant 14% lower than estimated; this appears highly unlikely.
9.        The conclusion is not sensitive to the ec5n3mic cost of fuel.  In
view of Algeria's large gas reserves (some 4,000xlO m3), the date at which
foreign exchange cost would be incurred due to the use of gas for power, is
not the date (or dates) at which the gas would actually be used, but the
date at which as a result of this usage, the gas would not be available for
export. Conservatively assuming that the run-out date would be 25 years froin
the beginning of the discount period (1975), the present value factor at 9%
(the estimated opportunity cost) would be 0.1160. The additional gas used
by Alternative 1 through the discount period 1975-1984, is about 335xlOxm3
whiche at a financial cost of DA 1.8/10P BTU (at 9,800kcal/m3) represent a
cost of about DA 2.3 million in the year 2000, when the gas would not be
available for export. Assuming - in view of the uncertainties - an economic
well-head price ranging from US$1..20-1.70/10  TU and a shadow exchange rate
ranging from DA 4-DA 6 per US$, the economic cost of the gas by the year
2000 would range from about DA 57 million to DA 81 million, representing
a present value of DA 6.6 million and DA 9.4 million respectively. The
present value in favor of Alternative 1 of DA 28 million shown above, woulcd
thus reduce to DA 18-21 million, which ie` still substantial and confirms
Alternative 1 to be the most economie development program in generation.
b. Dispatch System
Basic Considerations and Assunptions
1.        Because SNEILGAZ' system, in which increasing amounts of power have
to be transferred over distances up to 800 km, would become progressively more
unmanageable as to voltage, frequency, and security of supply, sound utility
practices require the installation of a dispatch system with automated adjust-
ment of the main parameters.  In view of the increasing number and duration
of system outages, it appears that the existing dispatch system, comprising
telephone commNnications and some voltage displays only, is inadequate, and
the installation of a more sophisticated system is overdue. Such a system
would decrease the number and duration of system outages (i.e. increase
revenue) and improve the technical and economic use of facilities. Completion
by 1976/77 is currently envisionei, but conceivably the system could be postponed
by several years, thus foregoing aome financial and economic benefits, provided
adequate measures would be taken to firm up the systems.
2.        For purpose of comparison of alternatives it is being assumed that
installation of a dispatch system cannot be postponed by more than 3 years,
but that some additional generating facilities would be i±istalled at the
extreme - and weakest - end of the interconnected system (Oran), where by
1976 high security of supply is required for the oil and natural gas pro-
cessing plants.



ANNEX 13
Page ô of 10
3.        Currently about 35-40 MW can be transmitted from Algiers to Oran
by means of the existing 150-kV line and the present dispatch system (voice
command). Once conversion to 220 kV is completed and the second 220-kV
line has been commissioned, and Morocco has been connected - which is all
expected for 1976/77-the transmission capacity Algiers-Oran by voice command
and with one line out of service, in expected to be about 60 MiW (i.e. about
half the normal transmission capacity of 120 MW and the automatic control).
For approximate equal security in supply about 60 MW is gas turbine plant
should be installed in Oran in 1976 in case the dispatch system were to be
postponed.
Alternatives to be Studied
4.        In view of the above, two alternatives are defined as follows:
Alternative 1
- Dispatch system to be completed by 1976/77
- Oran gas turbines 2x40 MW to be commissioned in 1979,
in accordance with SONELGAZ' present forecast
Alternative 2
- Dispatch system to be completed by 1979/80
- Oran gas turbines: 2x30 MW to be operational by 1976
20 Md to be operational by 1979
Discounted Cash Flow Comparison
5.        The various cost streams (at constant prices as of the time of the
appraisal) for the above are shown in Attachment 2 to this annex, together with;
the basis of the costs assumed.
Conclusion
6.        At the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 9% the present value
of Alternative 1 would be about DA 3.5 million below the present value of
Alternative 2, indicating that the dispatch system should be completed as soon
as possible.
Sensitivity to Cost Variations
7.        Increase in fuel prices causes ths present value difference to
increase, thus benefiting Alternative 1, because the present value of the
financial cost of extra fuel required for Alternative 1 (in order to generate
the onergy related to the increase in revenue) is smaller than the savings in
fuel due to the improved efficiencies provided by the operation of the dispatch
system.
8.        Ln order to cause Alternatives 1 arnd 2 to break even in present value
at the aassied opportunity cost of capital, the construction cost of the dispatch



ANNEX 13
Page 7 of 10
system should be about 18% higher and the construction cost of gas turbine
plant about 18% lower than estimated. The probability of these combined
errors is considered to be negligibly small.
c. Substations
El Asnam (220 60 kV); Oran/Arzew Area
1.        Supply by means of the existing 60-kV lines from existing and new
220-kV substations is limited to about 20 MVA. Forecast requirements are the
following;
M>adaum Demand (MVA)                1974      1977     1980
ELsting                              5.0       6.5     10.0
Cement Factory (lx1O6 T/yr)                   10.0     20.0
SCKATRACH Plastic Factories          1.0      15.0     35.0
Irrigation                                              5.0
Other New Industry                             3.0      6.0
Tenes (transfer from 30 kV)            -        -       4.0
Coincident Demand (xO.7)             4 .2    24.5      55.0
Even if construction of several of the new factories will be delayed
by 1 or 2 years, maxiimu  denand will exceed the limit of 60-kV capacities in
the El Asnam areae and a new 220/60-kV substation should be constructed as
soon as possible because alternative addition in transformer capacities in
existing substations and construction of parallel 60-kV lines would only alleviate
the situation for about 3 years. This transformer capacity and the lines would
be substantially redundant after completion of the new 220-kV substation.
2. Marsat El Hadjadj (220/60 kv)
3. Hassi Ameur (60/30 kV)
(Nidway between Oran and Algiers)
The zone between Oran, Arzew a,d Mostaganem is expected to develop
very rapidly with the construction of SCHATRACH's liquefaction and chemical
plants, and expansion of the refinery. Forecast requirements are the follo-wing:

By 1977, the carrying capacity of 60-kV lines (50-60 MVA) will be
exceeded, requiring a direct 220-kV connection (Marsat el Hadjadj) for the
area in addition to the supply from the existing 220-kV substation Zahana (pre-
sently operating at 150 kV).  The main function of substation of Hassi Ameur
would be 60-kV switching (between Ravin Blanc, Zahana, Marsat el Hadjadj,
Ain El Bya, and the industrial ring around the Arzew area). Some loads froxm
existing 60 kV substations would be transferred to the new substation Hassi
Ameur.
Ain Skhouna (60/30 kV; Area South of Oran)
4.        A 60-kV line, 80 km long, is scheduled for completion by 1976 to
connect the isolated system of Ain Skhouna to the main system at Saida. AI;
irrigation project is presently in execution in the area, where demand is
expected to be about 3 Md in 1976, mainly for pumping.  Demand for irrigation
would progressively increase to about 10 MW by the end of the decade. The
construction of the line and substation is the only reasonable technica],
solution, and would replace high cost diesel. plant.
Ben Aknoun (El Biar) (60/30/10 kV; Algiers Area)
5.        The rapid expansion of Algiers in the hills above the city, requires
the construction of a 60-kV line which ultimately will close a ring around the
new developments. The substation would supply the new urban developments,
including the stadium and university extensions.
Bordj Bou Arreridj (60/30 kV; Inland, Midway between Algiers and Skikda)
6.        The area is presently supplied by means of a 75 km long 30-kV line,
which does not allow the connection of several infrastructure projects, like
the textile plant (3 MW) under construction in M'Sila and some small factories
in Bordj Bou Arreridj. With the construction of a cement factory in Ras el Oued,
somewhat to the east, a new 60-kV line will be completed by 1976 for connection
to Setif (where SONEI1GAZ's development program envisages the construction of a
220-kV substation). This line will be extended to Bordj Bou Arreridj and the
proposed substation would be required to supply the various infrastructure
projects.
Constantine South (60/30 kV; Eastern Area)
7.        This third largest city in Algeria is supplied from two aides (Skikda
from the north and Khroubs from the south) by a single 60-kV line and present
demand (about 20 MVA) is rapidly approaching the capacity of the 60 kV line froin
Skikda (60 km). The Constantine South substation would be the first step in
completing a 60-kV ring around the city, for which forecast demand is expected
to be the following:

E2l Hadjar (220 kV, extension, Annaba Area)
8.        The Societeé Nationale Sidertirgique (SUS) in constructing two
electric mielters, 20 NVA each, vith a third probably to follow, roquiring
direct connection to 220 kV. In view of its expansion plans the Societo'
Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF) vill conatzuot a subatation which, for
reasons of supply, will be connected both to the primazy 220-kV aide and
the secondazy 90-kV side of El Hadjar. The substation would be extesded to
allow for the necessary lino sections 220 kV (two, for vhich ono reserve
bay is available) and 90 kV (one).
Laghouat (60/30 kV; North of Hassi R'Hel in Cectral Desert Area)
9.        The town is presently connected to Hassi R'Mel by means of a 30-kV
lino, more than 120 km long and in view of woltage drop, current demand (1.8 MW)
is being met during poak bours by paralleling the 1.5 Nd diesel station at
Laghouat. With the constiuction of a noe gas turbine station at Hassi R'Xel
as included in SONELWAZ's devolopment progra., conversion to 60 kV of the
existing 30-kV line vould eliuinate the high cont diesel plant. The isolated
systems of Dhelf a and Aflou vill be connected to Laghouat and total aximum
demand is expected to increase to about 5 )IT by 1976.
Souk Ahras
10.       The present substation, which colprises sectionalisers only will
be equipped fully to provide the necossary reliability for the railvays in
view of the rehabilitation and forecast increased demand. A sugar factory
-ould be connected, and the etation would serve as back-up for th» 30 kV
systen in the area.
C. RATE OF RETURN 0F PROJECT
1.        The rate of return of a project is the discount rate which eqaalizes
the present values of the costs and benefits streams attribItable over time to
the project. Because the proposed Project comprises a dispatch system, gas
turbine plant operating mainly used for peaking and standbyy, and aubstations,
for which benefits are extremely difficult to quantify, it was deemed appropriate
to assesa the rate of retum of SONELQAZ'S overall 1973-1978 expansion program,
of which the Project fonns a saall part (about 94). The detailed benefits and
cost streams are shown in Attachment 3 to this annex. Thq are based on the
following:
CGots
2.        The cost of SONELGAZ's development program and the Project included in
it are shown in Annex 3. Subtracted frou  these costo vere the coat of facilities
to be completed after 1978 and the cost of the expansion pzvgram for gas. Also
excluded were import duties and taxes assumed to average 8% of total construction
cost because this constitutes only an intennal transfer to the economy.



ANNEX 13
Page 10 of 10
3.        Personnel cost for the electricity activity were reduced by 6%
for the tax on salaries for which SCNELGAZ is liable.  Ninety percent of the
increment of other electricity operating expenses  (other than materials re-
quired for power operations) were attributed to power, assuming that 10% is
attributable to SONEFGAZ long range planning beyond the period 1973-1978
(training, promotion, etc.).
4.        Fuel costs were assumed in accordance with Annex 12, remaining constant
from 1979 onward over the assumed economic life of the development program.
Benefits
5.        The increment in power sales (rising from a base of 1,800 GWh in 10W2
to 3,940 GWh by 1978) and assumd to remain constant from 1979 onward at -he
average prices assumed during appraisal (see Annex 15) provide the incremiental
revenue derived from the execution of the expansion program to meet the increnmental
growth of sales.  Sales taxes of 7% charged to consumers were added, as they are
demonstration of the willingness of consumers to pay for electricity.
Rate of Return
6.        As shown in Attachment 3 to this anhex, the above results in a rate of
return of the development program - and of the Project - of about 15%.  This is
considered reasonable in view of the fact that the current program includes a back-
log of construction to restore adequate service quality, and the requirements for
the execution of an ambitious national plan, the benefits of which, however, if
achieved cannot be quantified with any degree of certainty.
Sensitivity
7.        The rate of return, on less or more favorable assumptions would vary
as follows:
Rate of Return
On Main Assumptions                                       15
On Less Favorable Assumptions
a.  10% reduction in attribution of revenue               12.9
b.  10% higher capital cost                               13.2
c.  10% higher O&M cost                                   13.3
d.  Combination of a,b and c                              Below 8%
On More Favorable TAssumtions
e.  10   increase in attribution.of revenue              17.o
f.  10% lower capital cost                                17.0
g.  10% lower O&M cost                                    17.9
h.  Combination of e,f and g                              21.0
Conclusion
8.        Because conservative estimates have been used in .forecasting SONELAz
revenues from electricity sales, the probability of results in line with the miore
favorable assumptions appears high, and for this reason the rate of return is
expected to range from 15-17%.

c. Economic life of the dispatch system assumad to be 25 years, and of the
gas turbines 20 years.
Operational Co0t
a. Dispatch: 45 staff at DA 30,000/man-year increasing about 4% annually
(merit increases)
b. Gas Turbines:  6 operators at DA 25,000/man-year; DA 50,000 annually for
expatriate special maintenance personnel maintenance and
fuels ausumed negligibly small for Alternative 2 for the
period up to 1979 (when, for Alternative 1, the turbines
would becomu operational) because the plant is expected to
operate only under emergency conditions; from 1979 onvard
operational cost for both alternatives would be equal and
for this reason can be neglected in the discounted cash
flou comparïson.
Savings
a*        The dispatch systei would yield savings due to more econowic use of
facilities and increase revenues due to the umaller nu*ber sod shorter duration



ANNEX 13

o! outages. Because savings in operation and maintenance cost can not be
quantified with any reasonable degree of accuracy, it is assumed that
savings in fuel and increase in revenue can be used as an approximation
of the attributable benefits. This understates the total attributable
benefits.
b.        Total financial cost of fuel is stated in Annex 12.  Because
savings under both Alternatives would be equal from 1980 onward, three years
only should be taken into account in the discounted cash flow calculations.
Assuming a 12% increase for 1979, and a 1% saving, the savings would be
the following:
1977     1978      1979
Total fuel cost DA 103       5,410    6,210    6,950
Savings:  1%; DA:           54,100   62,100   69,500
c.        SC&EIAZ presently pays only DA 0.71,loe>kcal (usL4-4h/lO  BTU), which
obviously is far below the economie (pre-liquefaction) cost of this type of
fuel.  Financial coats, however, are being used for the relevant cost stream
to allow a sensitivity analysis in view of the uncertainties with respect to
the economic cost of natural gas (see text paragraph B9).
d.        The increase in revenue has been assumed to be small (0.5%); because
the increase for both Alternatives would be equal from 1980 onwarû, three years
only should be taken into account.  The increase in (financial) cost of fuel
is very asual, and the increase in revenue would be the following:
1977     1978      1979
Revenue increase DA 103      2,700    3,000    3,200

Major Assumptions Used as Basis for Financial Forecast
1  BALANCE SHEET
?ixed Assets:   Forecasts result from the existing assets and from the
assumed developrent program. For the calculation of the
rate of return and of the construction program ratio in
the electricity sector, it has been assumed that 79%
of the common assets and related depreciation would be
allocated to power, 15% to gas and 6% to the other
activities.
3epreciation:   On forecast assets: average rate 3.33% for transmission
and thermal power stations; 2% for building, 2.5% for
distribution.
Intangible      Cost of studies have been entered in the balance sheet
Assets:         and written off the same year.  Actual balance at end
of 1972 is being progressively written off.
Wbrks in        All works included in the Project, and buildings, are
Progress:       expected to remain in progress an average of 3 years.
Distribution works and all other routine works would
remain one year in progress.
Debts:          Forecasts assume that future loans from the Algerian
Banks and from the Treasury would be on conditions and
for terms similar to those from the Wbrld Bank.  It has
been assumed that the average proportion of suppliers
credit in the long term borrowing which was 25% in 1972
would remain the same.
II. REVENUE ACCOUNTS
Sales of        Based on existing tariffs and an average rate of increase
nerg~y:         of sales of electricity and gas in high and low tension
for electricity and high and lowpressure for gas.
Assumed average rate of' increase of sales of units from
1972 through 1978

for therms     HP 24%    LP 15%

Perscnnel   Based on forecast of number of employees for each sector of
Costs:      activity (thermal, transmission, gas and electricity distri-
bution).  Assumed average rate of increase (salary per man):
7%. Includes merit increases, cost of living increase, and
promotion. Assumed rate of staff development: 2.7% per year.
Fuel Cost: Based on cost per category of fuel at existing price. Takes
into account the shifting of generation of electricity to
gas-burning stations and the transfer of gas distribution to
natural gas.
Cost of     Based on an average rate of increase of 12% from 1972
Material    to 1978.
for Opera-
tion:

Ihan Income to 1978.
Tax:
Other Ex-   Forecasts assume an average rate of increase of 11% from
penses:     1972 to 1978.
NOIES: 1/ SONELGAZ's actual revenue accounts as shown in this report are
the resuIt of the transposition of the company's formal Income Statements
into the Bank's usual presentation. Hence, there are differences betueen
figures in official statements and the statements attached to this report.
2/ The breakdown of 1972 operating expenses for electricity, gas
and other activities as shown in Annex 16 is based on figures provided by
the Borrower for this year, and takes into account several adjustments where
needed. The table (page 20) summarizing a similar breakdown for 1973-78
is derived from the 1972 situation and assumes that revenue and expenses
in each sector will vary as described above.
