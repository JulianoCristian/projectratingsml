REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TiE r. auUTIIvTL DIRECTOnS ON A   PROPOSED LIOUN
To SOCIETE NATIONALE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ
_ FOR A PUWJ.R PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Societe Nationale de l'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ) with the Guar-
antee of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for the equivalent
of US$38.5 million to help finance a power project. The loan would have a
term of 20 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace with interest at 7-1/4 per-
cent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Economic Development and Prospects of
Algeria" (155-AL) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 4, 19J73.
An economic mission visited Algeria in April/May 1974 and is preparing its
report. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Following a period of adjustment after independence in 1962, the
Government has succeeded in creating political stability while pursuing a
strategy of pragmatic and vigorous economic and social development based on
centralized control cf the economy, economic independence, rapid growth through
industrialization, rapid expansion of education and training, and a narrowing
of income disparities. Substantial progress has been made in alleviating the
two principal constraints to development - the institutional vacuum and the
lack of technical and professional staff.  The exploitation of oil reserves
and industrialization have played the primary role in development, while the
agricultural sector has lagged. Unemployment remains high, although there is
an acute shortage of skilled manpower. Policies of financial austerity and
equalizing d:Lstribution of income have been pursued, and emigration of workers
from the poorer areas to the cities and abroad have helped to narrow dispari-
ties of incorne between regions. However, discrepancies still exist, mainly
reflecting differences in resources and the level of economic development.
4.        With the nationalizations in the oil and gas sector in 1971 nearly
all foreign-owned enterprises have been brought under Algerian control. For-
eign capital is welcomed in the form of medium and long term loans, though
joint ventures are accepted in specific cases, e.g. as part of economic
cooneration with other Maghreb countries or when they offer technological
know-how or outlets to foreign markets. A major share of Algeria's invest-
ment effort has gone into basic industry - notably hydrocarbons, cast iron,
steel and chemicals - and into education. To narrow income disparities, the

agrarian reform began in 1971 whose ultimate aims are to redress asset dis-
tribution and unlock productive potentials in the agricultural sector.
5.        The Government exercises economic and i.n-vestment controls either
directly or through large state enterprises and "self-managed" modern farms.
which dominate the various economic sectors.   To relieve thie shortages of
technical and managerial stafE in most sectors, public spending on education
and training was raised to 10 percent of GDP, and innovative solutions were
found to the difficult problem of adapting the education and training system
to the needs of the economy.   Extensive recourse was also made to exterral
technical assistance, and pretraining on the job was made a feature of proj-
ect contracts implemented by foreign firms. Tne Government and the state
enterprises greatly increased their capacity to implement development proj-
ects, particularly in the hydrocarbon and industrial sectors, although ac-
celerating investment implied cost overruns and initial operational ineffi-
ciencies.  The Government now seems to realize the need for more efficient
use of investments, and is trying to introduce improvements in project eval-
uation, and some decentralization of decision making.
6.        During the First Four-Year Plan period (1970-73), preliminary data
indicate that GDP growth averaged 10.8 percent a year from 1969 to 1973 in
current prices. Domestic prices were strictly controlled, probably rising
by an average of about 3.5 percent per year. (There is no general price
index; industrial prices rose by 3.1 percent a year, and the cost ot living
index in Algiers by an average of 4.7 percent per year.) Sharply rising in-
vestment and petroleum export earnings were the main sources of this growth.
Gross fixed investment rose from 28 percent of GDP in 1969 to 37 percent in
1973. Public investment, which accounted for about 85 percent of the total,
amounted to roughly $8 billion in the four-year period, and reached a level
of about $2.8 billion in 1973. Petroleum export earnings rose to an esti-
mated $1.5 billion in 1973 from $0.6 billion in 1969.
7.        The main emphasis of the 1970-73 Plan, besides education, was on
the hydrocarbon and industry sectors, which received the largest shares of
public investment (30 percent and 23 percent respectively). In the hydro-
carbon sector, public investment ($2.3 billion in 1970-73) enabled Algeria
to maintain an exploration program, to raise crude oil production from 48.2
million tons in 1970 to 50.8 million tons in 1973, increase petroleum refin-
ing canacity to more than 5 million tons at the end of 1973, expand trans-
port capacity and build up gas export capacity. Algeria also entered into
severnl long term contracts for gas deliveries to Europe and the USA which
are being negotiated and wiich could result in export of about 80 billion
cubhI meterF in 1980.  The hydrocarbon sector contributed 19 percent of GDP
and 83 percent of merchandise exports in 1973.
8.        In manufacturing, Algeria has followed a strategy of developing
heavy industries first; that is, netrochemicals, iron and steel and heavy
mechanical and electrical industries. Less investment has gone into other
manufacturing, such as food processing, consumer goods and construction ma-
terials. Manufacturing contributed 12 percent of GDP in 1973. Agriculture



-3-
nas been stagnant and suffers 'LroLi se-veraL structuraL problems.  Its slare
in GDP was about 8 percent in 1972 and its share of public investment Was
only 6 percent.  Output nas haraly risen above the level at independence,
and agricultural exports declined as demand for wine weakened. Algeria's
large food deficil: consequently increased; Dy Lte end of thle rla1 periLIud,
it had to import 30 percent of its cereals requirements and nearly all its
neecis, in sugar, dairy products and edible oil.  Concerned over the struc-
tural problems and the unfavorable trends, the Government gave increased
attention to the agricultural sector towards the end of tne Pian, deciding
on a large prograrn of conversion of vineyards, and introducing a program of
agrarian reform as well as increasing the supply of needed inputs.    Invest-
ments in transport: infrastructure, housing and health also seem to have
lagged behin(d the growing needs.
9.        Due to high capital intersity, investment and output growth did not
generate enough new employment opportunities to reduce significantly the high
rate of unemployment. Despite the relief provided by substantial emigration
to France (which has been stopped by Algeria recently), unemployment outside
agriculture was estimated at 25 percent of the related labor force in 1972
and agricultural underemployment at 40 to 50 percent according to official
statistics. However, these figures probably were overestimates, since they
included a number of people who either were not actively seeking employment.
The Government is giving increasing attention to the problems of rural areas
through regional development programs and through agrarian reform.
10.       The financing of sharply rising investments required a large in-
crease in nationaL savings, which Algeria a,hieved through austere fiscal
and incomes polic:Les. National savings attAined nearly 30. percent of GNP
in 1973. This high percentage derived primarily from petroleum and related
revenues and also from the restraints put on public salaries and private pro-
fits. During the 1970-73 period, about 90 percent of investment was financed
by nationial savings. National savings were supplemented by rising external
borrowing mainly Erom commercial sources. Algeria's external debt was esti-
mated at $2.4 bil:Lion, including $1 billion undisbursed, at the end of 1972.
Borrowings from the Eurodollar market, which exceeded $1.3 billion in 1973,
and other borrowings may have raised the external debt to about $4 billion
(including undisbursed) at the end of 1973. External debt service had risen
to nearly $200 million, or 12 percent of exports and workers' remittances,
in 1972. It is expected to continue rising to over $500 million a year by
the mid seventies,, but to represent less than 10 percent of export earnings,
due to the petroleum price rise. Gross foreign exchange reserves exceeded
$1.1! billLon at the end of 1973, equal to about five months' imports of goods.
With the substant:Lal oil price increases Algeria's capacity to service addi-
tional debt has been greatly enhanced.
11.       The economic growth prospects of Algeria in the medium term are
bright, given the large additions made to industrial capacity in recent years
and the considerably higher earnings expected from exports of oil, oil prod-
ucts and liquefied natural gas that can support further rises in the invest-
ment: level.  A considerably higher rate of GDP growth than in the past can



- 4 -
be expected. The constraints on managerial and technical skills will con-
tinue to be strong despite rapid training. A second Four-Year Plan 1974-77
(involving S25 billion investment) is in final stages of consideration by
the Government. It will outline the Government's strategy for taking ad-
vantage of the additional development possibilities resulting from the rise
in petroleum prices, and is expected to continue to give particular attention
to industrialization and education, while putting increased emphasis on sec-
tors that had lagged heretofore such as agriculture, transportation, tele-
communication, health and housing.
12.       The export price of Algerian crude oil has risen from an estimated
$3.80 per barrel in 1973 to about $12 per barrel in early 1974. At this price,
petroleum exports could amount to about $5 billion in 1974, while Government
revenues could exceed $3.5 billion. (In 1973, petroleum exports amounted to
$1.5 billion with Government revenue of $1.1 billion.) Petroleum production
is not expected to increase rapidly, but gas exports will increase substan-
t}ially in the later years of the plan period, with a possible increase in
thic nrice of gas.  In these circumstances, and assuming that oil prices re-
main stable in real terms, it seems that Algeria will not face financial con-
straints in raising its already considerable rate of investment.     However, it
is not clear at present whether it will accumulate any significant financial
surplus or may still need further capital inflow in the medium term, since
the result will depend, among other things, on the level of investment (in-
rluciding reinvesrment in the oil and gas sector): on policies regardinz con-
sumption standards and on policies concerning accelerated repayment of short-
tprm deht- The nossible accumulation of reserves will also depend partly on
the relative movement of prices between exported oil and imported equipment
and raw mnterials= The Serond Plan should throw additional light on these
points and thus provide the basis for a firmer assessment of the balance be-
tween Al1cr'4'-q finAnci1i requirements and resourees Yner the medium term
An economic mission to review the Plan is scheduled for later this year.
In the longer term, particularly as   as exnorts heronme sionificnnt in 1C77/78
as the savings capacity outside the oil sector expands, and if new oil re-
source-s are exploited, Algernla'  need for fvtvrn.ul cai tarl s.hniold derpre
rapidly.

Mission visited Algeria in April-May, in conjunction with the Economic Mission
to Ihelp Uidentify and prepare projects suitable for future BankL il.ancinF;, wl-.h
in the framework of the 1974-77 Plan which is being finalized.
15.       The recent rise in the prices of oil will enable Algeria to ftrther
raise its already high level of in-Vesitmten  and to relax its austerity programn
without running into balance of payments difficulties. Thus, in the medium
term, the focus of Bank lending to Algeria will be on projects which h.elp
substantially to enhance Algeria's capacity to maximize the returns from its
investments and spread the benefits of gro-wth.    LTLis would be done by dem-on-
strating the value of thorough project preparation and by supporting, through
individual loans, the Government's efforts to increase t'he efficLenicy of' eco-
nomic institutions. In this context substantial technical assistance may be
needed and requested by the Government; a joint Bank-Inr technical assistance
mission recently visited Algeria at the request of the Government to study
the financial planning system and to prepare a.training program dealing witt
various aspects of financial planning at the central, banking and project
levels.   A further major aim of Bank lending would be to support the Govern-
ment's efforts in creating jobs to alleviate the need for emigration, and in
spreading the benefits of growtn and development to the less developed rural
areas and outlying regions. This may be done by focussing on lending and
technical assistance in two specitic areas: regional development and agrarian
reform. In my recent visit to Algeria, interest in the Bank's contribution to
these socially oriented programs was expressed by the Government. The future
lending program which is to be formulated for Algeria will be based upon a
Bank appraisal of t'he country's needs for financial and tech1nical assistance,
taking into account the special advantages that cooperation with the Barnk
can offer. Appraisals are currently scheduled for projects in education,
and industry:   these two sectors, together with agriculture and general in-
frastructure, are likely to be the main areas of Bank involvement in Algeria.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Energ_ Resources
16.        Algeria's major natural resources are oil and gas.     Its proven re-
coverable oil reserves are just over 1.9 billion m3 (12 billion barrels) and
present annual output, including gas condensate, is some 50 million tons or
about 1 million barrels per day. The main oil fields are in the Hassi
Messaoud/Haoud el Hamra area.    The natural gas field of Hassi R'Mel is one
of the world's largest, with proven recoverable reserves (under present tech-
niqueS) of 3,000 billion m3.    Additionally, some 1,000 billion m3 of proven
reserves are distributed among eight other fields. Liquefied natural gas



- 6 -
(LNG) is now being exported and large scale projects are under way. The
main centers for processing oil are refineries at Arzew, Algiers and Skikda.
Oil is exported from these centers and from the port of Bejaia. LNG is ex-
ported from the ports of Arzew and Skikda.
17.       The hydroelectric resources of Algeria are rather limited and most
of the hydroelectric potential is already being exploited for power (284 MW
installed capacity, supplying an average of 400 GWh annually), but effective
capacity is restricted (184 MW) due to irrigation requirements.
18.       Coal reserves are small and mainly concentrated around Bechar where,
before independence, about 300,000 tons were mined annually. The mines are
being modernized and production would be increased to 600,000 tons annually,
to be used mainly in coke-making for the steel works at El Hadiar, near
Annaba, in the east. Little coal is used for other purposes.
Organization
19.       The generation, distribution, and transmission of electricity and
gas throughout Algeria is under the responsibility of the Societe National1
de 1'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ). SONELGAZ is the successor to
l'Electricite et Gaz d'Algerie (EGA), which was created in 1947 when all
electricity and gas companies in Algeria were nationalized by the French
Government. In 1969. the AlRerian Goverrnment dissolved EGA and created
SONELGAZ, vesting all former rights and obligations of EGA in the new company.
20.       SONELGAZ' network extends for almost 1,000 km mainly along the coast.
This causes problems in maintainina stability. voltages9 security nf supply,
and spinning reserve.   Overall length of the 220-kV system (which, however, is
tn be onerated at 150 kV until 1977/78 when ful1 rnnwPrzino to 220 kv would
be completed) is about 1,700 km. Total length of the transmission system,

_ectoral Dievelopment
Growth in 1-he power sector was practically stagnant during 1963-1966
but since then, the sector has grow. steA41-     TI- 101)72, S    AZ    r
about 73 percent (794 4W) of Algeria's 1,024 M'I in power plant capacity, and
accounted 'e.r anbout '37 pe;rcent of thLue 23nL tW generated.  Captive pLaUc
capacity is about 230 MIA, of which 140 MW pertains to larger industries
(petroleui, steel) anU about 90 .. to sma[ller inLdustries. Generation of the
latter has declined steadily and now constitutes less than 1 percent of total
generat:ion.  Since 1965, generation in the Larger industries has been rela-
tively stable at 10-13 percent of total generation.
23.       In order to ensure optimum use of existing power facilities and to
reap tne benefits or scale, it nas been tne Government's policy to substitute
individual or isolated power production with supplies from SONELGAZ. The
various rerineries and liqueraction plants nave already been connected to
SONELGAZt network, and most of the future power requirements in the rapidly
expandi.ng pe:roleum and gas sector are expected to be met by SONELGAZ. Sim-
ilarly, in Hassi R'Mel, generation for the gas field base, its surroundings,
and the gas fields itself (to the extent possible), would be concentrated in
a singl.e plant, to be constructed and operated by SONELGAZ.
24.       Because SONELCAZ is considered a basic entity for industrial devel-
opment it tends to frame and execute its own program substantially without
regard to changes or delays in other parts of the national plan.    This caused
over-investments in power under the 1970-73 national plan. The proposed 1973-
78 construction program of SONELGAZ amounts to some $681 million. The program
appears to be generally well conceived and to represent the most economic ap-
proach to meeting Algeria's medium term power needs. The additional facilities
are scheduled to meet: expected developments in industry, particularly the oil
and gas sectors, and the power program would considerably strengthen tran:smis-
sion and reinstate arn appropriate balance between regional generation capac-
ities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the report
"Appraisal of a Power Project: Societe Nationale de l'Electricite et du Gaz
(SONELGAZY', Report No. 415a-AL, dated May 20, 1974, which is being circulated
separately. A Loan aind Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
General
26.       The proposed project is the second Bank power project in Algeria.
For the first power project, a loan of $10 million was made, in 1955, prior
to independence, to l'Electricite et du Gaz d'Algerie (EGA), the predecessor
of SONELGAZ. and it wras completed successfully. The proposed project was
identified in 1973.   The feasibility studies for the power stations were
carried out by SONELGAZ, and the study for the dispatch facilities by

Electricite d- France.   Appraisl  to    laei    Otbr-o2be          93
liegotiations were held in May 1974.  The Algerian delegation was led by
Mr. .Aahfoud Aoufi, Secretary GIeneral of tbe Ministry of Fina  e, a. it-
included Mr. Karamane, Managing Director, and Mr. Bayou, Financial Di-
rector, of SOUNELGAZ.
The Project
27.       The main purpose of the proposeu project is Lo assist, CO1XTA7 i.
remedying difficulties encountered in its interconnected system.    P-:oblems
are being experienced in maintaining stability, voltage, Security o- supply
and spinning reserve, which are further aggravated by the inadequacy of the
present control system comprising only limited communication facilities;
construction of modern dispatch facilities would reduce these problems. By
installing additional gas turbine plant in the Algiers area, the present
regional capacity imbalance in the system would be reduced. Another important
objective of the proposed loan is to assist SONELGAZ in improving its organiza-
tion and administration.
_3.       Tte project includes:   (a) the installation of three 40-MW automated
gas turbine units for operation on natural gas; (b) a modern dispatch system
withi a main dispatch center and three district dispatch centers together with
appropriate telemetering and control equipment; (c) the construction or three
220-kV, six 60-kV substations and one 90-kV substation; and (d) consulting
services for organization and administration, project engineering and tariff
studies.
29.       The environmental impact of the gas turbine units is negligible
because they will be located outside population centers and operate on natural
gas which ensures a minimum of noxious and l?isible fumes.   The substations
will be located in sparsely populated areas where amenity considerations are
minimal.
Project Implementation and Consultants
30.       SONELGAZ has engaged PA International of the UK for the organization
study under a contract acceptable to the Bank. Retroactive financing of about
US$5U.000 is proposed for this contract. SONELGAZ has engaged Electricite
de France (EdF) to study the dispatch system and prepare bid documents under
a contract acceptable to the Bank.   The contract specifies that during all
work stages EdF will provide the necessary staff to advise and assist SONELGAZ
*iu thie execution of the scheme, and train personnel. This is in accordance
ith, SONELGAV' general policy of assuming formal responsibility for execution
of zI project.  This is acceptable in view of the competence of SONELGAZ' staff.
Retroactive financing amounting to about US$250,000 is proposed for this engine-
ering" olntract=~
31.       SONELCAZ (with limited assistance from consultants) has procured and
installed a number of package gas turbines. It intends to engage the services
Of consulting engineers under arrangements similar to those made for the dis-
patch system, for carrying out the works. SONELGAZ prepares all designs for

its substation program currently in execution. It also engages consultants
(currently Societe Generale pour l'Industrie of Switzerland and Electrobel
of Belgium) to review the final design and supervise the required testin.g.
Due to th1e lack of sufficient competent staff, SONELGAZ hires specific staff
from its consultants for expert assistance in the execution and supervision
of comn.plicated projects.  This Dolicy of limited consultant services would
also apply to the substations to be firnanced under the proposed loan, ar,d
is acceptable.
Project Cost and Fiilancing
32.       'Le estimated cost of the nronnsed nroiect, excluding interest
during construction, is US$64.3 million, of which US$38.5 million would be
in foreign exchange.   The proosed Bnk loan would finance the foreign ex-
change costs; the financing required for local expenditures would be pro-
vided by the "overnm?ent ard from internal cash aeneration-   Cost estimates
are summarized as follows:

Procurement and Disbursement
33.       All contracts to be financed from the proposed loan (except for con-
sulting services) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding. Al1though Algerian industry manufactures little of the required
equipment, a preference of 15 percent or applicable duties, whichever is the
lesser, would be granted to participating Algerian manufacturers.    Disburse-
ments would be made against the c.i.f. cost of imported materials and equip-
ment and the foreign exchange cost of related installation services and
consulting services. Disbursements are expected to begin in October 1974;
the loan would be fully disbursed by the end of December t978.    The Govern-
ment has asked that the proposed Loan include US$300,000 of retroactive fi-
nancing for consulting services and this amount has been included in the
cost of the project. Any funds remaining in the Loan Account upon completion
of the project would be used in agreement with the Bank to finance consultant
services for the next stage of development or would be available for cancella-
tion.



t conomic Jusi-ification
34.       Because the proposed project comprises a dispatch system, gas tur-
bine plant miainly used for peaking and reserve, and substations, for which
benefits are extremely difficult to quantify, it was deemed appropriate to
assess the rate of return on SONELGAZ' overall 1973-1978 expansion program
for electricity, of which the project constitutes a small but representative
part (9.4 percent). At present tariffs, the rate of return of the program
is about 15 percent. This rate of return is considered reasonable in view
of tihe fact that the current program includes a backlog of construction to
restore an adequate balance of capacities and service quality.    The rate of
return would increase to about 21 percent in the event of a favorable com-
bination of a 10 percent reduction in the investment program and in opera-
tional cost, and a 10 percent increase in revenue. Because conservative
estimates have been used in forecasting SON TLGAZ' revenues from electricity
sales, the probability of results in line with these more favorable assump-
tions appears high. If the above three factors would combine unfavorably
(10 percent increase in construction and operating costs and a 10 percent
reduction in revenue), the rate of return would decrease to somewhat less
tnan 8 percent. This combination appears unlikely. The rate of return is
expected to range from 15-17 percent.
Financial Aspects
35.       SONELGAZ' operation and construction budgets must be approved by
the Ministries of Planning and Finance, which arrange external financing for
projects once they are included in the National Development Plan. Tariffs
are subject to Government approval. Revenues from electricity, gas and other
activities are not considered separately, and are used for the financing of
the company's activities as a whole.   As with all other national companies,
SONELGAZ is required to contribute about 50 percent of its net consolidated
suirplus (before allocation to reserves), forecast one year in advance, to
the cost of the Government's development program. No reimbursement takes
place if the actual sulrplus is less than expected, or if a loss is incurred.
The contribution amounted to DA 11 million in 1971, DA 8 million in 1972,
DA 10 million in 1973, and will reach DA 15 million in 1974. As a matter
of Government policy, and as is the case for other national companies,
SONELGAZ' internal cash generation is intended to be sufficient only to
finance replacement and routine development. All major works included in
thp nntional develonment nlan are financed bv loans made availablo tn
SONELGAZ thirough Algerian banks, according to the Government's instructions
or from thle Treasury, and exrcptiona11v through internationa1 lendincg agen-
cies. Rural development is financed by Government contributions.
36.       At the end of 1972, the overall financial situation of SONELGAZ was
satisfacto. r, althoubh during the preceding 3-year period the revenue growth
rate had been decreasing while the operating expenses had been increasing at
a- -grown   r-,at  The Si4tuation for the electricity operati-ns 4 - ----- t- o I4

from electricity are subsidizing the unprofitable gas and miscellaneous activ-
ities. Consequently, the company would not remain in financial equilibrium
unless (i) non-essential components of the investment program are curtailed
including a substantial revision of the initially considered gas program;
and (ii) the Governnent and the company implement appropriate financial meas-
ures to alleviate the debt service burden and, if needed to, provide comple-
mentary financial assistance.
37.       In order to provide SONELGAZ's electricity operations with a reason-
able financial posiiLion, the Bank, the Gove:^nment, and SONELGAZ have agreed
on a combination of targets including a rate of return, a ratio of surplus
to investment program, and a ratio of net revenue to debt service requirements,
as fo]llows:
(a)  SONELGAZ shall take all steps necessary to earn sufficient
revenues to yield an annual return of no less than 7 percent
on net fixed electricity assets in operation starting in FY78
(Section 5.04 of the draft Loan Agreement). Until the rate of
return of 7 percent is reached, SONELGAZ will ensure that its
revenues from electricity operations produce a surplus after
payment ofi debt service equal to no less than 15 percent of
the average cost of its construction program for electricity
for the current year and the preceding year, and a reasonable
proportion of the construction program common to electricity
and gas operations. (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agree-
ment)-
(h)  Gnvernment will ensure that by December 31, 1974 and by the end
of each year thereafter, the ratio of SONELGAZ' net revenues
from 1lporrioifv onprationn  fnr the cutrrent year tn the aver-

operatinns fnr thp ciirrent year 2nd nrpvious year i.s not less

of the draft Loan Agreement).
38.       Agreement has also been reached fnr    lNFLT.G-A7 to set prices and
charges for its operations other than the sale of electricity and gas whiLch
is subsidized at levels sufficient tn ensure that revenues frnm siich nthr
