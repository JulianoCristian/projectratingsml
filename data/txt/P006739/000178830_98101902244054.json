The\n            project would eliminate seasonal flooding and would reclaim\n            6,000 ha which are permanently flooded. The latter, together\n            with 7,800 ha of land held in excess of 50 ha per existing\n            farm to be expropriated under existing land reform laws,\n            would be used to settle about 1,000 landless farmers on\n            empresas comunitarias; in addition, another 2,800 small\n            farms of less than 12 ha would benefit from the land\n            improvement program. The project would also provide\n            extension services and improvement of social infrastructure\n            for education, health, village water supply, rural\n            electrification and telephone service. INCORA would manage\n            an agricultural credit fund, utilizing the Caja Agraria as\n            banking agent, to provide medium- and long-term credit to\n            small farmers. Subloans would be for on-farm development,\n            purchase of farm machinery, construction of infrastructure\n            on livestock farms and purchase of breeding stock."}, "docdt": "1975-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
