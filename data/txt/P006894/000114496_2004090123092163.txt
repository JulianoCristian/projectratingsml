Colombia: Loans 3952-CO and 3955-CO
This is in connection with the Guarantee Agreements between the Republic of 
Colombia (the Guarantor) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(the Bank) dated December 20, 1995 (Santa Fe I Water Supply and Sewerage 
Rehabilitation Project - Loan 3952 CO) and  March 26, 1996 (Power Market Development 
Project - Loan 3955 CO) hereinafter collectively referred to as the Guarantee 
Agreements.
We have detected in both cases clerical mistakes in the text of Sections 1.01 of 
each of the Guarantee Agreements inasmuch as the standard references to the Applicable 
General Conditions used in such Sections mistakenly mention the "General Conditions 
Applicable to Single Currency Loan and Guarantee Agreements for Single Currency Loans 
dated January 1, 1985 with the modifications set forth in Section 1.01 of the Loan 
Agreement", rather than the "General Conditions Applicable to Single Currency Loan and 
Guarantee Agreements for Single Currency Loans dated May 30, 1995", as it is correctly 
mentioned in Section 1.01 of each  respective Loan Agreement for said Projects and 
Loans, dated December 20, 1995 and March 26, 1996, respectively.
Thus, we hereby propose to correct the respective texts of Sections 1.01 in each 
of the Guarantee Agreements to read as follows:
"Section 1.01. The 'General Conditions Applicable to Single Currency Loan 
and 
Guarantee Agreements for Single Currency Loans' of the Bank dated May 30, 
1995, (the General 
Conditions) constitute an integral part of this Agreement."
 
Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience that we might have caused you 
and, if you are in agreement with the corrections, countersign and date the attached 
form as representative of the Guarantor pursuant to the respective Section 3.01 of 
each of the Guarantee Agreements.
Sincerely,
