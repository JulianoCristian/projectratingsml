Amendment to the Project Agreement                        
Dear Secretary General: 
 
 
We refer to the Project Agreement between the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) 
and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated 
March 18, 1999 (Project Agreement). 
 
We also refer to the understanding between the representatives of the Ministry of 
Water and Irrigation and the Bank reached during the Project’s mid-term review in 
May 2002, and to your letter (Ref. WA-7-2-14121) dated August 15, 2002 to increase the 
threshold for national competitive bidding in order to accommodate future procurement 
for the proposed extension of the Management Contract. 
 
The Bank, after due consideration, accedes to the request. Accordingly,
 
Paragraph 1, Part C, Schedule 2 to the Project Agreement is amended to read as follows: 
 
“1. National Competitive Bidding 
 
Works estimated to cost less than $2,500,000 equivalent per contract, up 
to an aggregate amount not to exceed $15,000,000, and goods estimated to cost 
less than $500,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to 
exceed $5,000,000, may be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of the Guidelines.” 
 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
the form of confirmation set forth below. Please return to us one fully executed original
