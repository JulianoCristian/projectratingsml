The project consists\n            of four components. First, Management Contract\n            Operator's base fee will pay for salaries and expenses\n            of the operator's core group of staff managing the\n            operations of the Service Area's water and wastewater\n            infrastructure. Second, Operating Investment Fund (OIF) will\n            finance the Operator and the Water Authority to support\n            essential short-term and operating investments to improve\n            operation and maintenance and support in the rehabilitation\n            of the water and sewerage system. Third, Capital investment\n            will support design, implementation, and supervision of the\n            restructuring and rehabilitation of the water supply system\n            as well as upgrading and extending service coverage. Fourth,\n            technical assistance will strengthen the planning and\n            management unit, provide independent auditors to monitor the\n            Operator's technical and financial performance, and\n            support consultants' services."}, "docdt": "1999-02-17T00:00:00Z"}
