Lessons learned from the project: The\n            availability of accurate baseline data is crucial for\n            assessing the performance of the operator and the importance\n            of such a baseline cannot be emphasized enough. Excluding\n            the operator from managing the capital investment component\n            had a negative impact (through delays) on achieving certain\n            performance targets. When the existing utility operations\n            are relatively weak performance targets should be\n            conservative and should be limited to a handful of the truly\n            central ones. When the private operator is entering a\n            relatively weak environment, the duration of the management\n            contact should be six years and upwards since this is the\n            minimum time to achieve significant improvements in such a\n            weak environment. The effort and time required to reduce\n            unaccounted-for-water/non-revenue water was underestimated.\n            Allowing the prospective bidders to bid on the percentage of\n            the incentive fee was suboptimal and created more risks to\n            the bidders. The credibility of the water supply operations\n            depends on the success in achieving continuous water service\n            in Amman. It is now clear that this will require more time\n            than forecast."}, "docdt": "2007-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
