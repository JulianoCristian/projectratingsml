1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Jordan is one of the most water-short countries in the world. Only about 6 percent of the land is
arable, and although the contribution from agriculture to GDP had declined to 3.3 percent in
2000, the agriculture sector still used two thirds of Jordan's water. About two thirds of the
population is urban and both coverage and continuity of water supplies have been deficient. The
water supply scarcity in the capital city of Amman is particularly acute, since the population
mainly relies on water that has to be pumped from near the Dead Sea up to Amman, a vertical
pumping of 1200 m, which makes for an energy-intensive and costly supply. Marginal volumes
of water are supplied either from desalted water or from over-exploitation of groundwater,
attesting to the water cost in environmental and financial terms. The next major supply source for
Amman is the proposed Disi-Amman conveyor scheme that will mine fossil groundwater in the
south of the country, and then pump it a distance of about 300 km to Amman, at yet higher costs.
The implementation of the Disi-Amman conveyor scheme has been much delayed.

In 1999, the cost of supplying water to Amman was escalating rapidly, and the Amman Water
and Sanitation Management Project (AWSMP) was designed to assist the Government of Jordan
in using water more efficiently by reducing the excessive share of unaccounted-for-water and
improving the overall operation and maintenance of the system. AWSMP responds to three of
the five priorities of the World Bank's 2002 Country Assistance Strategy, as follows:
(a) enhancing conditions for growth led by the private sector; (b) addressing resource
conservation, exploitation, and management with a focus on water scarcity; and (c) improving
governance through public sector reform.

In addressing these issues, the AWSMP was designed to:

(a)     Pioneer private sector participation in the Jordanian water sector through a performance-
        based management contract aimed at improving the overall efficiency of water supply
        and sanitation system in Amman. This would be measured against achievement of over
        40 key performance indicators. Moreover, the management contract designed by this
        project was also amongst the first supported by the World Bank and hence did not have
        much case history to learn from.

(b)     Take steps to address the urgent need to manage the scarce water resources available to
        meet the needs of the population, as well as public and industrial establishments in
        Amman. It is important to note that addressing resource augmentation, conservation and
        allocation issues were outside the scope of the project.

(c)     Initiate reform in the sector by letting out Amman's water supply and sanitation system
        under a competitively-procured management contract, which would be independently
        monitored. This was a clear departure from the previous World Bank strategy under
        which eight World Bank loans had been made to the water supply and sanitation sector
        with public sector operators, but which did not result in significant improvements to
        water supply and sanitation (WSS) services. On the contrary, service levels had continued
        to decline in the 10 years preceding the AWSMP project.


                                                 1

The World Bank was in a position to play a central role in assembling the co-financiers for
AWSMP, namely the European Investment Bank, Italian bilateral assistance, KfW, and USAID.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PDO was to: (i) improve efficiency, management, operation and delivery of water and
wastewater services for the Amman Service Area; and (ii) lay the groundwork for sustainable
involvement of the private sector in the country's overall management of water and wastewater
services.

Key performance indicators to monitor project implementation were extracted from the
management contract performance indicators and included the successful prioritization of sector
investments, improved efficiency of water distribution, improved continuity of supply, improved
management, rehabilitation, and efficiency of water management, as well as strengthened
capacity and financial viability of the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

Project development objectives were not revised.

A number of the management contract performance indicators were adjusted during
implementation through a series of memorandum of understanding between WAJ and the private
management contract operator ­ a joint venture between Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux-Montgomery
Watson Arabtech Jardaneh (LEMA). The adjustments were necessary to accommodate
exogenous factors that affected contract performance with LEMA, and to make the indicators
more realistic. For instance, the original expectation of reducing unaccounted-for-water of 54%
to 29% by the fourth project year was changed in 2002 to a final target of 45%. However, the
key performance indicators listed in the PAD were never formally revised to reflect the
adjustment to the contracted performance indicators in the management contract.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Amman's total population, estimated at 2.0 million, was expected to benefit from the improved
distribution system which would (i) increase the reliability of water supply, (ii) improve the
quality of the distributed water (through more reliable disinfection), and (iii) enable more
equitable access through the use of more rational criteria for allocating scarce water.

Between 2003 and 2007, the influx of over 500,000 Iraqi refugees swelled the Amman
population by an estimated 25% and commensurately increased the number of beneficiaries from
the project. Providing service to this unanticipated population increase added to LEMA's
challenge particularly when bulk supplies to Amman remained largely unchanged.

Component 1 financed the competitively bid fixed fee charged by the private operator mainly
covering the personnel and overhead, while Component 2 supported short-term expenditures to
improve operations and maintenance in the Service Area that were not covered by the company's
working capital. Component 3 supported design, implementation, and supervision of a slice of
the restructuring and rehabilitation of the water supply system, as well as upgrading and
extending service coverage. Component 4 supported consultant services for supervision and for
project management under the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Component 4 was also
intended to finance other studies in the water sector throughout Jordan.

1.6 Revised Components

There were no revisions of the approved components. However, there were some changes in
the final allocation of the loan between the project components (see Table 2 below) for two main
reasons:

(i) The private operator contract was extended for 41 months to cover the period of the closing
date extension, hence expenditures under Component 1 was increased by 66%. The rationale for
the extension is explained below, and

(ii) Other financing was made available for the Operating Investment Fund from improved
internal cash generation from operations, and to a lesser extent through a debt swap arrangement
with the French government, hence expenditures under Component 4 were decreased by 65%.

1.7 Other significant changes

There were no significant changes in project scope and implementation arrangements except that
the loan closed 41 months after the original closing date on account of two extensions: the first
extension of 17 months was justified by the slower-than-expected implementation of the Capital
Improvement Program (CIP), particularly those sections financed with Italian funding. The
second extension was justified by the need to prepare for the next investment phase and to define
and prepare for the institutional setup that would be in place after LEMA completed its contract
by the end of the project period. The increase in CIP was approved on an emergency project
called the Khaw-Batrawi pipeline to increase the supply to Amman to alleviate the increasing
shortage

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

A major factor that influenced project design was the lesson learnt from eight previous Bank-
funded water supply projects to Jordan that public sector management of the Amman water
supply system had failed to produce improvements in service levels. To overcome the weak
governance structure associated with public sector management the AWSMP chose to apply the
discipline of contractual obligations to improve service levels by employing a private operator,
chosen competitively from among pre-qualified internationally-experienced operators.

A second key factor was the lesson learnt that while tariffs had to reflect water scarcity and
operational costs, any tariff adjustment should be made prior to the private operator taking over
so as to avoid a political backlash against the private operator which would make it difficult for
him to bill and collect for services, albeit on behalf of his employer, the Water Authority of
Jordan (WAJ). A tariff increase was accordingly approved in 1997, well in advance of inviting
the private operators to pre-qualify and bid.

The third key factor affecting design was the need for the private operator to retain a sizeable
number of WAJ staff, both to retain the continuity of experienced staff, as well as to mitigate the
alternative employment issues at the WAJ, since the staff released by the private operator were
sent back to WAJ to find alternative tasks there. The private operator was committed to
retaining at least half of the WAJ employees in the Amman Service Area.

The successful incorporation of these factors in the project design helped to ensure good quality
at entry for this project.

2.2 Implementation

The project was implemented under a management contract with the private operator, LEMA.
The initial four year management contract from August 1, 1999 to July 31, 2003 was extended
twice, (by 17 and 24 months respectively) to correspond with the extensions of the project
Closing dates and ended on December 31, 2006.


                                                 4

There were no significant factors affecting implementation and outcomes. At no time was the
project at risk; neither were there any major restructuring of the project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The monitoring of the implementation of the Capital Investment Program (CIP) and of the
performance of the private operator was undertaken by the Planning and Management Unit
(PMU), which started as part of WAJ and subsequently moved to the Ministry of Water and
Irrigation (MWI) and served as a de jure regulator. The PMU was funded by a grant from the EU.
The PMU's function was to track progress towards meeting the Project objective of improving
efficiency, management, operation and delivery of water and wastewater services. Specific target
values were adopted for 15 key indicators, and these were tracked on a quarterly and annual
basis. The key indicators were drawn from the more comprehensive performance indicator
agreement for the management contract. In addition, an annual monitoring report was prepared
by outside technical and financial auditors, funded by the USAID.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The PMU was responsible for ensuring safeguard and fiduciary compliance. No Bank safeguards
were triggered.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

For the post-completion phase, USAID funded a study to determine management options. The
study was done in three stages as follows:

(i) In the first stage, alternative organizational models for the Amman water supply and
wastewater system were evaluated in a study concluded in January 2006. On the basis of the
study, the MWI and WAJ decided to establish a new company, along the lines of the successful
Aqaba Water Company, to provide water supply and wastewater services in the LEMA service
area, as well as in the Amman Governorate. This new company would be established under
company law as a company owned 100% by the government. This would allow the new
company certain flexibility with respect to hiring and firing of staff, determining its own pay-
scale and stepping out from the rigidities of the civil service rules and regulations. The new
company would not be subjected to public procurement rules and regulations.

(ii) On the second stage a feasibility study was carried out to establish and make this new
company operational. This study was concluded in July 2006.

(iii) The third ongoing stage is detailing the implementation arrangements and transfer of over
seven years of management experience from LEMA to this new company, which is now called
Jordan Water Company (Miyahuna in Arabic). Four of LEMA's key staff have been employed
for a period of six months to oversee the transition arrangements.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

USAID will also finance four advisors for up to one year each to support the Miyahuna
management. Miyahuna's General Manager had, until his appointment, headed up the Aqaba
Water Company (AWC), the corporate structure of which Miyahuna resembles. With this
experience, it is anticipated that the transition to the post-project period will be a smooth one.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The ICR rates the relevance of the project as high as the project objectives respond to three of
the five priorities of the Country Assistance Strategy (see Section 1.1 above). The design and
implementation of the project is closely aligned to these objectives in terms of the close and
continuous involvement of the private sector, both for operating and maintaining the water
supply and wastewater system and for monitoring project results.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the PDO can be measured in two related ways: (i) by comparing the actual
values of the key performance indicators to the target values at appraisal; and (ii) by assessing
the efficacy of the four components in terms of their respective output. The first comparison of
performance indicators, grouped around three major outputs is shown in Table 3 below:

Based on (i) the high degree of compliance with targets and on the satisfactory implementation
of the four main components (as detailed in Annex 2) related to improvements in the operations
and delivery of services; and (ii) on the fact that project pioneered successfully private operations
of water supply and wastewater systems in Jordan. However the government decision to revert
back to the private sector may compromise the long term sustainability of project achievements
the ICR rates the achievement of project development objectives of the project as "moderately
satisfactory".

      to 20% of annual billings, equivalent to 73   daily billing) decreased by 20% from 269 days in

                                                    case of Amman, old account receivable inherited
                                                    from 1985 account for about 70 days of average

                                                    system, X7, required more time than originally
                                                    expected, and further explains the slow reduction
                                                    in accounts receivable. Subsequently LEMA was
                                                    able to comply with the modified, rolling targets of
                                                    collection of accounts receivable from 2003

In summary, the management contractor LEMA was able to comply substantially with 12 of 15
performance targets listed in Table 3 above and did reduce both the percentage unaccounted-for-
water and the accounts receivable as measured by the days of average billings. Furthermore
LEMA was able to achieve a performance incentive payment, which is tied to the achievement of
its contracted obligation, for every year of its operations. It can be argued that it was unlikely in
the first place to expect a reduction of the level of unaccounted-for-water by 25 percentage
points particularly where water supply is intermittent and in the level of accounts receivable from
269 days to 73 days within the relatively short time period of four years. This is why the targeted
reduction of unaccounted-for-water was modified and refined in 2002 to acknowledge the fact
that the baseline indicators had been set on the basis of unreliable estimates.

The achievement in terms of the remaining performance indicators of reducing the number of
water and sewerage network repairs is partial. It is likely that repairs in the short-and medium-
term will increase with improving operations (i) through improved constancy of water service
(when significant additional bulk water supply from the Zara- Ma'in and Disi are available); and
(ii) in a situation where improved customer service and public information campaigns encourage
customers to report leaks and malfunctions. Much of the network repairs are due to the old
deteriorated secondary and tertiary networks within the remaining 160 un-rehabilitated
distribution districts. Rehabilitation and replacement of the network within those two outside the
scope of the project and would require further investment of about US30-40 million.

3.3 Efficiency

The efficiency in terms of economic rate of return on project investments cannot be fully
calculated as implementation delays have resulted in 13 of the 15 CIP contracts having been
finalized and 150 out of the 310 distribution districts having been hydraulically isolated as of the
project completion date. The full benefits of the higher efficiency expected from the project will
not be realized until the CIP is completed and at such time that all the 310 District Zones will
have been hydraulically contained and bulk-water supplies will have increased sufficiently to
make continuous service possible. However, Annex 3 shows the partial cost-benefit analysis of
the expected improvements in the continued reduction of the non-revenue water (analogous to
the unaccounted-for-water) which estimates the economic internal rate of return as 33%,
attesting to the high economic returns on reducing losses in an arid area where there is a high
value on saving scarce and costly water. Based on the rate of return the ICR rates the efficiency
of the project as high.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

In view of the high relevance of the project, the partial achievement of project development
objectives and the successful piloting of new Public-Private Partnership arrangements during 7.5
years despite severe limitations in bulk water supply, the ICR rates the overall outcome as
moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Not applicable.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The lower-income strata in Amman have benefited from the project in three ways:

First, the poor are the last among the population to be connected to the water supply and
sewerage networks. Water connections under the AWSMP rose from about 90% in the year
2000 to practically 100% in 2005. This implies that the poor are now in a position of parity with
their richer neighbors in terms of equality of access to this basic resource.

Second, the poor have similarly benefited from the rise in the sewer share of the population from
69% in 2000 to 80% in 2005.

Third, where service is deficient, either through intermittent supplies or through unsafe water
quality, the poor suffer disproportionately because they have less economic means to pay for
alternative supplies. By the same token, where constancy of supply and the quality of water
improve the poor benefit.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project did achieve the first PDO ("improved efficiency, management, operation and
delivery of water and wastewater services for the Amman Service Area"). It did this through
improving the capacity and financial viability of the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) since


                                                 9

LEMA managed to substantially improve collections and working capital during the contract
period.

The project also aimed to "lay the groundwork for sustainable involvement of the private sector
in the country's overall management of water and wastewater services". It succeeded in working
with a private operator (LEMA), which gained experience in the seven and a half years of the
project period to successfully operate and maintain improvements in the Amman water supply
and wastewater systems.       In this period, the practice of modern utility management was
introduced, and the accountability of the operator was established.

Beyond laying this `groundwork', the project helped manage the transition from LEMA to a new
company, the Jordan Water Company, Miyahuna which operates on commercial basis with more
transparent governance structure, thus ensuring that management of the Greater Amman water
and wastewater systems did not revert back to WAJ. The reversal from a path towards greater
private sector participation is explained by the inability of the government to guarantee bulk
water supply because of the continued scarcity of water resources in Jordan.

After some six years of a private management contract the Government faced the choice of either
extending the LEMA management contract, or replacing it by something else. The first option
would have been pointless unless the Government had been able to shift more risk to LEMA by
requiring it to reduce non-revenue water and by demanding that the constancy of water service
be increased to 24-hours. Both obligations would have required WAJ to guarantee annual and
growing supplies of raw water to LEMA for distribution. However, without any guarantee that
more bulk water would be available, WAJ was unable to contractually commit to LEMA
increasing water quantities. Under the circumstances the Government opted not to try to shift
more risk to LEMA, since LEMA would simply have refused to commit to greater constancy of
water supplied and lower non-revenue water. The government concluded that the LEMA
management contract offered no potential for further improvements.

Instead, the Government had the example of the Aqaba Water Company, an independent public
company, which was operating efficiently. The government then chose to adapt the Aqaba model
to Amman since it offered the possibility (albeit a risky one) of greater efficiency with a more
flexible path towards continuous service. Miyahuna was set up as an independent public
company, operating under the commercial company law. Its start-up has been facilitated by the
deployment of key senior staff from LEMA to assist the Miyahuna management for a six-month
period (see also section 2.5 above).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project successfully promoted the use of a Geographical Information System (GIS) to record
and manage water supply and wastewater assets; and this system has now been adopted by other
public agencies to help their work.        Another positive impact arose from the successful
establishment of two meter repairs shops which have proved successful, and is planned to be
developed into an independent profit center to serve regional demand outside the Amman service
area. The government is also developing a water resource strategy to develop more sustainable
policies to better manage the supply risks.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

LEMA initiated annual surveys of stakeholder satisfaction and a more meaningful engagement
with its customers. The survey was carried out by private company throughout the service area,
with an emphasis on the areas that has benefited from the CIP. The results of the survey indicate
that the costumer satisfaction improved over the project period, specifically with regards to water
quality, quantity of water supplied, and customer service. These achievements are expected to
be maintained and further improved upon by Miyahuna.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The "Risk to Development Outcome" is rated as Moderate, based on the following
considerations:

    · Technical risks are moderate in the medium term because the AWSMP has implemented
         ten contracts to improve technical capacity for operating and maintaining the existing
         larger water supply facilities; another five contracts are under implementation.
    · Bulk water supply to Amman has recently been augmented with 40 million m3 annually
         from the Zara Ma'een reverse osmosis plant, implying a net increase in supplies of about
         25 percent.

    · The efforts to reduce leakage in the water distribution network (though not as successful
         as expected, see Table 3) has improved the chances of further increasing the hours of
         supply in the Miyahuna service area; the production capacity is equivalent to about 160
         l/c/d (assuming a total population in Amman of 2.3 million in 2006). Assuming a 35%
         leakage, this supply corresponds to an average consumption level of about 110 l/c/d,
         which could be sufficient for continuous supplies.

    · In the medium term, work is needed to continue to confine Distribution Districts
         hydraulically and restore continuous service to already confined Zones where the
         network has been upgraded and where metering is universal. This upgrading of the
         distribution system will likely continue in order to reduce leakage in preparation of the
         expensive water from the Disi Conveyor system that is expected to be operational from
         2012 onwards.

    · The financial risks are moderate. Through the 1997 tariff increase as well as the
         improvements made possible under the management contract, the working ratio1 dropped
         from about 110% in 2000 to below 80% in 2005. This constitutes a margin to ensure
         orderly operations and provide financing for further operational improvements. The
         graph below shows the inverse of the working ratio (cash operating income/cash
         operating costs) since the year 2000.

    · The next investment phase, the Start-up Project, with about US$75 million of investment
         to further improve the operational efficiency in the 2007-2012 period has already

       received financing of about US$17 million from KfW and another US$4 million from
       USAID. Additional financing is expected, given the amount of good-will that Jordan
       commands with potential external financiers.

    · The economic risks are rated as moderate as well. Jordan's economy has been skillfully
       diversified and concessionary funding has been secured due to Jordan's geopolitically
       sensitive location;

    · The institutional risks are rated as substantial. However, the Government of Jordan has
       put in place a few measures to mitigate such risks. The new operating company,
       Miyahuna, has a charter that is similar to that of the Aqaba Water Company (AWC),
       which has been operating successfully for a few years. The general manager of AWC has
       now been appointed to head up Miyahuna. The new Miyahuna management will also be
       supported by a consulting firm financed by USAID. Furthermore Miyahuna agreed with
       LEMA that key senior staff of LEMA would continue to provide support to the new
       company management for 6 months;

    · The socio-political risks are similarly rated as moderate, based on the successful risk
       mitigation that the Kingdom of Jordan has managed in the past.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The project was prepared using a PHRD grant during 1997-1999 and utilized lessons from the
preparation of the Gaza management contract (1995-96), but improved on the structure of the
operating contract. Sufficient time for project preparation ensured client ownership and capacity
building in favor of piloting private sector participation in the sector. During preparation, a
competitive and transparent bidding process for the management contract was followed; it


                                                  12

attracted wide interest and enabled the pre-qualification of five internationally-experienced
operators.

The processing of the loan was also carefully matched by measurable milestones, such as an
increase in the water and wastewater tariff to make operations financially sustainable. Similarly,
a substantial effort was made to line up and coordinate with other external financiers, agencies
such as EIB, Government of Italy, KfW, and USAID, to ensure adequate financing of the Capital
Investment Program.

Rating: The ICR rates the Bank performance during preparation as "Satisfactory".

There was no assessment by the Quality Assessment Group of Quality at Entry.

(b) Quality of Supervision

The project was supervised by a Washington-based task team with excellent knowledge of the
sector and the project and had a task team leader who was involved with the project from
preparation through completion. The project supervision budget averaged US$75,000 annually,
which was adequate for a project that was never in problem status or at risk.

Rating: The ICR rates the Bank performance during supervision as "Satisfactory".

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Based on the section 5.1 (a) and (b) the overall Bank performance as "Satisfactory".


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

The Government supported the process of employing a private operator and took the necessary
steps to make the contract sustainable throughout project implementation in several ways:

First, it decided in May 1997 to restructure and raise tariffs in Amman prior to the arrival of the
private management operator, LEMA. The early action on tariffs that became effective in
October 1997 was helpful in minimizing the public's perception that tariff increases were linked
to the private operator.

Second, the procurement of the management operator was handled by a special Tendering
Committee with representation from the Ministries of Public Works and Housing; Planning; and
the Water Authority of Jordan. The Tendering Committee adopted the Bank procurement
procedures, which helped the perception of a fair and transparent procurement which no doubt
contributed to the relatively high number of expressions of interest for pre-qualification and bids.

Third, the Government adopted a Water Utility Policy in advance of the tendering which was a
way to mitigate political risk for the bidders.



                                                13

Fourth, the Government appointed a special Project Development Team to guide the transition
from the LEMA contract to its successor, the Miyahuna. There is a clear need for assistance
during the transition since LEMA could rely on the technical know-how of its parents, Lyonnaise
des Eaux and Montgomery Watson whereas Miyahuna does not have a corresponding resource to
draw on.

Rating: The ICR rates the performance of the Government as "Moderately Satisfactory".

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: The implementing agency of the Project is the PMU. WAJ exercised its overview of
project implementation through the PMU. The PMU managed the Capital Investment Program
and supervised LEMA's management contract. The ICR rates the performance of PMU during
supervision as "Satisfactory".

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: The ICR rates the performance of the Government as moderately satisfactory and of
the implementing agency as "satisfactory".



6. Lessons Learned

The project-specific lesson learned was the lack of interest of the contractor to take advantage of
the performance based management fee. The award criterion for the bids for the management
contract comprised two parts: one annual fixed management fee and one performance-based fee
called, the Performance Incentive Compensation (PIC). Bidders were asked to indicate the
amount of fixed management fee and the PIC, which in turn was expressed as a percentage of the
incremental improvement of the cash flow of the Amman operation.

LEMA presented the winning bid with the lowest required combined remuneration. However,
interestingly, LEMA bid the minimum percentage (5%) that served to calculate the annual PIC.
As a result, the PIC has represented only about 5% of the total compensation paid to LEMA. For
instance, over the four year period 2001-04 LEMA was paid an average PIC of US$ 0.2 million
or between 5% and 10% of what it received as the fixed annual management fee. The structure of
the bids demonstrated that bidders were risk-averse and preferred to rely on the fixed fee. This is
an important lesson for the design of management contracts.

Generally applicable lessons learned were as follows:

At the design stage

    · Risk allocation between the contract parties has to be laid out with as much detail as
        possible. This would help the private sector price their risk and the MC would have
        benefited. In the Amman MC the concept of a simple management contract attempted to
        approach a lease contract or affermage too much which in turn increased the risks, the
        uncertainty for the bidders and the price of the bids.


                                                 14

    · The availability of accurate baseline data is crucial for assessing the performance of the
       operator and the importance of such a baseline cannot be emphasized enough.

    · Excluding the operator from managing the capital investment component had a negative
       impact (through delays) on achieving certain performance targets. The operator should
       have had more of a say as where new major investment were going.

    · When the existing utility operations are relatively weak performance targets should be
       conservative and should be limited to a handful of the truly central ones. The Operator
       should be given more hand in proposing innovative ways to manage and operate the
       system instead of focusing their energy on monitoring a large number of performance
       indicators.

    · When the private operator is entering a relatively weak environment, the duration of the
       MC should be six years and upwards since this is the minimum time to achieve
       significant improvements in such a weak environment.

During the implementation stage

    · The effort and time required to reduce unaccounted-for-water/non-revenue water was
       underestimated. Compared to the forecast reduction of unaccounted-for-water of 25
       percentage points for a four-year management contract the reduction has been about 9
       percentage points for a management contract that lasted 7.5 years. The experience
       highlights the importance of not over-promising improvements, particularly for complex
       issues such as UFW under intermittent supply because such promises weaken the
       political support in favor of credibly performing private contractors.

    · Allowing the prospective bidders to bid on the percentage of the incentive fee was sub-
       optimal and created more risks to the bidders.

    · The credibility of the water supply operations depends on the success in achieving
       continuous water service in Amman. It is now clear that this will require more time than
       forecast. The question remains at what per capita supply it would be possible to provide
       continuous service. At the present time, the available per capita supply of 160 l/c/d could
       be sufficient. However, it should be of general interest to document how continuous
       service is achieved in Amman. The Jordan Water Company, Miyahuna, and WAJ might
       consider preparing to document the measures taken to this effect and their success for the
       benefit of other Jordanian cities and other countries.



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

In addition to its "Implementation Completion Report" for which summary is presented in
Annex 7, the Borrower commented on the Bank's draft ICR. The Borrower considered the
Amman Water management contract satisfactory and that it achieved its development objectives.
In addition they noted that searching for a private sector partner was the duty of the successor of
the management contract. The government believes that the current setup of Miyahuna is not
final until their efforts to find a private sector partner is finalized.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

One of the main objectives of the Amman Water and Sanitation Management Project is to reduce
the excessive levels of unaccounted-for-water (UFW), related but not identical to non-revenue
water (NRW). The two are not fully congruent as is shown in Graph 1 below. The Non-Revenue
Water is simply the water that does not produce revenue for the utility. In contrast, the
Unaccounted-for-Water is the share of water system input that is unknown in quantity and in use,
such as water leaked in the distribution system (technical losses), water stolen (as in illegal
connections), imperfectly recorded (as in under-registering meters or through collusion between
meter readers and consumers), poorly estimated in the commercial system (administrative losses)
and so on. The key characteristic of unaccounted-for-water is whether it is accurately metered
which allows it to be accounted-for. The analogous key characteristic for non-revenue water is
whether it produces revenue, and not whether it is metered and properly accounted for. In
practice, NRW and UFW may be similar as a percentage. For instance, the accounted water
excludes the billed unmetered consumption but does include the unbilled metered consumption.
The revenue water handles these two items in the water balance in exactly the opposite way.

In the case of Amman system the AWSMP concentrated on converting the distribution mode
from having water directly pumped to consumers to one where water was pumped to service
reservoirs from which water was fed by gravity to Distribution District (DD). The gravity supply
offered a number of advantages such as easier operations and more even pressures. Once all the
15 contracts in the Capital Investment Program are completed water will then be distributed
through the secondary distribution network to 310 DD. In order to properly monitor consumption
in each DD it is necessary to confine each DD hydraulically in such a way that all inflows to a
DD are metered. The confinement allows a comparison between the water supplied to each DD
and the sum of all individual meter readings which will in turn enable the utility to accurately
estimate the non-revenue water (NRW) or the unaccounted-for-water (UFW). Accurate estimates
will allow appropriate measures to be taken to reduce NRW and UFW.



                                               19

The hydraulic confinement has only been completed for about 150 of the 310 Distribution
District in Amman. The work to confine a DD is painstaking since all unknown connecting pipes
to adjacent DD have to be closed off through valves or through removal. Over many decades ad
hoc pipe sections have been constructed, by the utility or by consumers, in order to improve
water service. Many of these are unregistered by the utility (which is why the complete mapping
of the network was included under the AWSMP). Some of the new distribution networks that
were installed under the AWSMP merely duplicated existing network sections that continued to
draw and distribute water that was not always registered. The above factors help explain why the
NRW and UFW have not declined more sharply as a result of the AWSMP. As a corollary the
full economic benefits from the AWSMP will not be perceived until all the DD have been
confined hydraulically. As a consequence it is not meaningful to undertake an economic cost-
benefit of the necessary but not sufficient investments in the conversion of the previous, directly
pumped distribution system to the emerging system where water is distributed by gravity to
hydraulically confined DD. However, a cost-benefit analysis has been made showing the
economic rate-of-return from the further work to reduce the NRW over the coming years and is
shown on the adjacent page. The rate of return is estimated at roughly 33%.
