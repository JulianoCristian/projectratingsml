There has been virtually no exploration for petroleum\n            in Nepal except for limited surface geology surveys\n            undertaken during the 1960's. An IDA-financed\n            aeromagnetic survey in 1980 demonstrated the existence of\n            thick sedimentary zones and basement anomalies in the Terai\n            Basin which could be indicative of geologic strutures\n            capable of trapping hydrocarbons. However, while these\n            indications are encouraging, they are as yet too preliminary\n            to attract foreign oil companies to undertake exploration\n            work without the acquisition of substantial additional\n            geological and geophysical data. The project would consist\n            of: (i) a seismic survey of about 800 line-km in the Terai\n            Basin; (ii) preparation of draft petroleum legislation;\n            (iii) geochemical analysis and other studies; (iv)\n            exploration promotion; and (v) training of staff in geology,\n            geophysics and legal aspects of the petroleum industry. The\n            major benefit of the project would be to enhance the\n            attractiveness of Nepal as a petroleum prospect, thereby\n            encouraging foreign oil companies to undertake the most\n            costly phases of exploration. The project would also provide\n            temporary employment for some 400-500 laborers."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
