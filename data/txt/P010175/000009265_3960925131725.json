The project\n            achieved its main objectives, institutional capacity was\n            strengthened, sustainability is likely with adequate\n            funding, and both the Bank and Borrower acted\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the need for indigenous hydrocarbons in\n            Nepal is great and efforts should continue to be made to\n            attract IOCs (International Oil Companies). The terms of\n            PSAs (Production Sharing Agreements) offered to oil\n            companies should be made as attractive as possible. Second,\n            it would be helpful if the regulations requiring a limited\n            period during which bids can be accepted is removed. Third,\n            the DMG (Department of Mines and Geology) should continue to\n            play a central role in coordinating donor financed efforts\n            and in finding means of continuing the promotion effort.\n            There are sufficient technical personnel in DMG to carry out\n            the routine work and their role in assembling and\n            reinterpreting data as it is acquired is critical. Lastly,\n            funding for technical assistance would be beneficial to\n            continue the supervision of ongoing exploration and efforts\n            to strengthen the DMG."}, "docdt": "1992-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
