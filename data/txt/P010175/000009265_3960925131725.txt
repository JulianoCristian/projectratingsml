PETROLEUi4 EXPLORATION PROMOTTON PROJECT
(CREDIT 1260-NEP)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Petroleum
Exploration Promotion Project (PEPP) in Nepal, for which Credit 1260-NEP in
the amount of SDR 8.3 Million (US$ 9.2 million equivalent) was approved on
June 10, 1982. During the project three cancellations totalling SDR 1.7
million were made, reducing the total credit amount to SDR 6.6 million. The
Credit was finally closed on December 31, 1990, five years behind schedule.
The last disbursement was made on April 23, 1991, leaving an undisbursed
balance of SDR 724,362.96 which was cancelled on April 23, 1991.
The PCR was prepared jointly by the Energy and Infrastructure Division
of Country Department 1, South Asia Region (Preface, Evaluation Summatv, Parts
I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the final supervisior. mission
of the project in July 1990. It is based inter alia, on the President's
Report, Credit and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence
between the International Development Association (IDA) and the Borrower; and
internal memoranda.

PETROLEUM EXPLORATION P,.OMOTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1260-NEP)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Oblectives
(i)         The project's main objectives were to promote petroleum
exploration in the Borrower's territory by international oil companies (IOCs),
including the completion of the preparatory work required for such promotion
efforts; and to strengthen the Borrower's department responsible for
administering and supervising the exploration and development of petroleum
resources. The project comprised: (a) legal advice to redraft Nepal's
petroleum legislation and prepare a model petroleum production sharing
agreement (PSA); (b) a reconnaissance seismic survey covering about 800 line
km in the Terai Basin, including the Churia Hills; (c) geochemical and
geological studies; (d) an exploration promotion campaign to stimulate
interest in petroleum exploration in Nepal among IOCs; and (e) a training
program for Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) staff. (Para. 1.03, 2.01).
Implementation Experience
(ii)        The legal consultants revised the petroleum legislation and
prepared a model production sharing agreement (PSA). The new legislation was
promulgated in time for the first round of promotion meetings. (Para. 1.05,
2.02).
(iii)       The reconnaissance seismic survey of the Terai was completed in
two field seasons in the dry seasons (October to April) of 1982/83 and 1983/84
by an expatriate seismic contract crew. A total of 1,260 line km of
reflection seismic were recorded with fair to good results in the Terai where
the terrain is reasonably flat and the subsurface undisturbed, however no
usable results could be obtained in the more rugged terrain of the foothills
where the main overthrusting begins. The seismic survey's primary objectives,
which were to demonstrate that usable seismic results could be obtained and
that there were prospective geological structures under the Terai plain, were
achieved. The seismic survey's total cost was US$ 3.5 million, considerably
less than the estimated US$ 7.2 million, due to lower than expected contract
prices and a reduced program. This resulted in large savings at the end of the
first part of the project. The geological studies and geochemical sampling and
analyses were completed on schedule. New geological maps were made and the
geochemical surveys indicated the existence of source rocks for petroleum in
the basin. (Para. 1.05).

iii
(iv)        A reduced training program comprising on-the-job training,
overisas courses and seminars for DMG staff, was implemented.
(v)         The first round of promotional meeti.ngs was held ir. London,
HWvston and Kathmandu in March 1983. The attencar.ce at the meetings was good,
and se-reral interested IOCs purchased some of the data packages offered. The
Project's primary objective was achieved wlsn, in response to the offer mude
at these meetings, a partnership of two IOCs, Shell and Triton, took up Block
10 in i986. The Shell/Triton PSA included an exploration program comprising
gravity and detailed seismic surveys and an obligation to drill one
exploration well during the first four year exploration period. This was the
only agreement concluded in respcnse to the first promotico- campaign. (Para.
1.06).
(vi)        At this point some US$ 3.5 million was left in the Credit, and
HMG/N, encouraged by the int rest shown by the IOCs, felt tha: with the help
of further donor financed exploration work, other IOCs might be attracted by a
second round of promotion. It asked, and IDA agreed, that the Credit be
extended for four years on a year by year basis to support further promotion
efforts.(Para. 1.06).
(vii)       In 1987 Petro-Canada International Assistance Corporation (PCIAC)
offered HMG/N grant funding to carry out two seasons of seismic work on the
Terai, extending and in-filling the IDA supported seismic survey. The new
seismic survey comprising a further 1,630 line km was completed in two field
seasons in 1987/88 and 1988/89. The results were reinterprGted and integrated
with the previous results to provide a new interpretation of the structure
below the Terai. (Para. 1.06).
(viii)      Shell, the operator for the Shell/Triton partnership working in
Block 10, carried out seismic and gravity surveys and subsequently drilled an
exploration well to a depth of 3,520 meters in 1989 to test a structure
defined by the surveys. The well was drilled to the prospaotive section but
found no indications of hydrocarbons and was eventually abandoned as a dry
hole. Block 10 was relinquished at the end of the first exploration period of
four years with the agreed exploration program completed in March 1990, and
Shell/Triton withdrew from the area. Although the exploration only tested a
limited area in the extreme eastern end of the prospective area the results
were a severe setback to the general view of the prospects in the area, and
this was probably the main reason for the lack of interest shown by the IOCs
in later promotions. (Para. 1.06).
(ix)        The blocks were opened again for bidding in 1989, however there
was no response to this offer. A second round of promotion meetings was held
in London, Houston and Kathmandu in March 1990, using a format simila.; to that
used in 1985. The London and Houston meetings were held as planned, and were
well attended, but the meeting planned for Kathmandu was cancelled when most
of the oil companies showed little interest in travelling to Kathmandu to
attend the meeting. The ten blocks were again offered for bids in 1990 after
the London and Houston meetings but there was no response to the offer. (Para
1, 1.06).
(x)         The total expenditure on the project was US$ 7.8 million; 72% of
the US$ 10.9 million originally estimated. The total disbursed from the Credit



iv
was US$ 6.4 million - SDR 5.9 million -. (Paras. 3.03 and 3.05).
Findings and Lessons Learned
(xi)        The negative results of the She?l/Triton exploration well in Block
10, coupled with the lack of exploration success so far in the Ganges plain in
northern India, have been strong setbacks to continued interest in the search
for hydrocarbons in Nepal. Hcwever the first exploration well in Nepal tested
only the extreme eastern end of the Terai Basin and it should not be regarded
as condemning the whole basin. Nepal's need for indigenous hydrocar',orns is as
great as ever and efforts should continue to attract the IOGs. It is clear
that the terms of the PSAs offered to the oil companies in what is now
regarded as a low prospecrivity and high risk area, where the field conditions
are severe and field operations relatively expensive, should be made as
attractive as p_sible. Several IOCs have shown interest in carrying out
surveys in blocks but are reluctant to undertake obligations to drill, which
involves considerable expense in mobilizing a drilling rig into Nepal in
addition to the high cost of drilling the well. These offers of seismic or
geological surveys should be accepted as they increase the knowledge of the
area, and when the results have been acquired IOCs are usually reluctant to
give up acreage which shows promise without drilling. It would also help if
the regulations requiring a limited period during which bids can be accepted
could be removed. This arrangement is suitable for bidding in a highly
prospective area where there is strong competition and many bidders, but in
Nepal it would be better to leave the blocks on offer as open acreage so that
interested parties could make offers at any time.
(xii)       The DMG should continue to play a central role in coordinating
donor financed efforts and in finding means of continuing the promotion
effort. There are sufficient technical personnel in DMG to carry out the
routine work, and their role in assembling and re-interpreting the data as it
is acquired is critical. Less reliance should be placed on consultant's part-
time efforts, and more use made of donor technical assistance to introduce new
technology, and provide training for DMG staff. DMG should also, if necessary
with donor help, seek new ways to form groups of IOCs to take up blocks under
novel conditions.
(xii:')     Although a further Credit to support a further promotion campaign,
as requested by DMG, is not considered justified, funding for technical
assistance would be benificial. Wurrently DMG is seeking IDA support under an
ongoing technical assistance Credit to continue the supervision of the ongoing
exploration and the efforts to strengthen DMG.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM IDA'S PERSPECTIVE
Proiect Identity
1.01  Name            : Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project
Credit Number  :  1260-NEP
RVP Unit        : South Asia Region
Country         : Nepal
Sector          : Energy
Sub-sector      : Oil and Gas
Background
1.02        In FY79 Nepal's total energy consumption was only 2.8 million tons
of oil equivalent. The average per capita energy consumption (200 kg of oil
equivalent) was one of the lowest in the world. Some 90% of this consumption
was supplied from non-commercial sources, mainly wood, which was in
increasingly short supply. Nepal has no indigenous oil or gas production and
the consumption of petroleum products, which are all imported, accounted for
only 4Z of energy consumption in 1981. The imported petroleum products were
used mainly in transport. In FY80 petroleum product imports cost US$30
million, which was 32Z of the export earnings for that year, and in ieY81 these
costs had risen to US$37 million. Very little was known of Nepal's petroleum
potential as exploration up to that time had been confined to surface
geological surveys. An important advance in evaluating the petroleum
prospects was made when an IDA financed aeromagnetic survey in 1979/80
indicated the presence of a thick sedimentary section under the Terai which
might contain hydrocarbons. The aeronaonetic survey results were considered
sufficiently encouraging to warrant further investment in evaluating Nepal's
petroleum potential. As there was no local funding or expertise available for
exploration, the Government's exploration strategy was aimed at encouraging
IOCs to undertake the high risk and costly exploration work in those areas
where prospects were most favorable. It was proposed to launch a exploration
promotion campaign based on new data, including seismic reflection surveys,
acquired under the Project. The petroleum legislation was to be revised and a
model PSA drafted. A series of promotion meetings were to be held during which
the prospective areas would be opened for bidding. It was against this
background that the Development Credit Agreement was signed in July 9, 1982.

Proiect Obiectives and Description
1.03        The project aimed at fostering interest among IOCs to explore for
petroleum in Nepal. An IDA financed aeromagnetic survey in 1980 had
demonstrated the likely existence of thick sedimentary sections and basement
anomalies in the Terai Basin which could be indicative of geological
structures capable of trapping hydrocarbons. Mowever, while these indications
were encouraging, thev were considered insufficient to attract IOCs to
undertake exploration work without the acquisition of additional geological
and geophysical data. The project consisted of: (i) a seismic survey of about
800 line km in the Terai Basin; (ii) preparatior of draft petroleum
legislation and a new model contract; (iii) geochemical analysas and
geological studies; (iv) exploration promotion; and (v) training of Department
of Mines and Geology 'DMG) staff in geology, geophysics and the legal aspects
of the petroleum industry.
Prolect Design and Organization
1.04        The project was prepared in nine months by the DMG and discussed
with IDA in October 1980. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$ 300,000
was approved by IDA in September 1981 to assist in the preparation of the
project. DMG was made responsible for project implementation and a special
implementation unit (SIU) staffed by ten professionals and support staff from
DMG wais set up for the purpose. A specialized contractor was to carry out the
seismic surveys. Contractors were also to be hired to process and interpret
the seismic results and to help prepare and execute the promotion campaign.
Geochemical. sampling and analyses were to be carried out by specialized
consultants. A photogeological survey was planned to update the geological
maps of the area. SIU was to prepare reports to IDA covering exploration,
promotion and financial matters related to the Credit.
Proiect Implementation
1.05        The legal consultants drafted a revised version of the then
existing petroleum legislation and a model production sharing agreement (PSA)
based on the PSA used in Indonesia. Under the terms of the PSA the oil company
funds all of the costs, and if there is a discovery it recovers agreed
exploration, appraisal, and development costs from a percentage of the
hydrocarbons produced (usually around 30% of production). The remainder of the
production is shared in a ratio agreed during negotiations, usually around
75/25 for the first 50,000 barrels per day, 80/20 between 50,000 and 100,000
barrels per day, and 85/15 for more than 100,000 barrels per day. Later in the
Project at DMG's request financial corr.ltants 3arried out a study of the
accounting procedures needed to control the activities of DMG and the IOCs
expected to enter PSAs with HMG/N.
1.06         The seismic reconnaissance survey of the Terai comprising 1260
line kilometers of reflection seismic was completed in two field seasons in
1982/83 and 1983/84. The various field problems associated with data
acquiaition on the Terai were solved and good results were obtained there, but
it proved impossible to obtain useable seismic results in the more mountainous
areas to the north in the foothills of the Himalaya. Nevertheless, the seismic
survey achieved its primary objective of demonstrating that usable seismic
results could be obtained at reasonable cost in what were considered to be the



3
most prospective areas. A geochemical survey was carried out by international
consultants which indicated that there were source rocks capable of producing
hydrocarbons in the sediments. The photogaological survey was completee
successfully. The training program was completed by the end of 1985, but was
extended to include financial and accounting methods when the Project was
extended.
1.07          Using the available seismic, geochemical and geological data
data packages suitable for sale during the promotion campaign were prepared. A
presentation brochure outlining the petroleum potential of Nepal was produced
for distribution during the promotion. Promotional meetings were held in
Houston, London and Kathmandu in March 1985 and ten acreage blocks covering
the Terai plain were offered for bid , In 1986 Shell and Triton in partnership
took Block 10 at the eastern end of the Terai under a PSA bared on the model
drafted by the legal consultants. (Annex 1, Location Map). TL'. wa? the end of
the project as originally planned, but given the pos'tive response to the
promotion and other donors willingness to fund further exploration work, HMG/N
requested that the funds remaining in the Cred.i- shou>2 be used foz a second
promotion campaign which would offer the results of the new donor funded work
as additional data. IDA agreed to this proposal.
1.08         Petro Canada International Assistance Corporation (PCIAC) funded
a further two years of seismic, gravity and geological work in 1987/88 and
1988/89, in-filling and extending the IDA supported seismic survey on the
Terai. An additional of 1630 km of seismic line were covered during these
surveys with good results. A reinterpretation of the results by Caadifian
consultants was also fundee by PCIAC, and they arranged for one of the
consultants to present the reinterpretation at the second round of promotional
meetings in March 1990. Between 1986 and 1988 Shell as operator for the
Shell/Triton partnership carried out seismic and gravity surveys in Block 10,
and in 1989 drilled an exploration well on a structure defined by the surveys.
The well, Biratnagar 1, was drilled to a depth of 3520 meters to test the
prospective section. Well cuttings indicated that the prospective section was
over-mature, with poor porosity and no hydrocarbon indications. The well was
abandoned as a dry hole without testing. Shell and Triton withdrew from Block
10 with their work obligation fulfilled in 1990.
1.09         Local regulations in Nepal require that areas can only be opened
for bidding for a limited period. The area was again opened for bids in 1989,
and after promotional meetings in London and Houston 1990 the same ten blocks
were offered for the third time. Although the meetings in Houston and London
were well attended, the oil companies showed little interest in travelling to
Nepal for the final meeting in Kathmandu, and it was cancelled. There were no
responses to the bidding offerr in 1989 and 1990. When the Credit closed in
December 1990, the DMG requested a further Credit to continue promotion
activities but this was not considered justified at that time. However, in
order to assist DMG to provide coordination for further donor financed
exploration work, efforts are being made by IDA to provide technical
assistan-e under the ongoing Third Technical Assistance Project - TA-3
Pancheswi.r - (Cr 1902-NEP).

Proiect Results
1.10        The first promotion campaign in 1985 was successful to the extent
that Shell and Triton in partnership signed a production sharing agreement
with HMG/N to explore Block 10 at the eastern end of the Terai Basin. Shell as
tha orprator for the partnership carried out four years of exploration work
including geological, geochemical, seismic and gravity surveys, and drilled an
exploration well Biratnagar-l to a depth of 3,520 meters. However, the well
was dry, and the partnership withdrew from the agreement with their
obligations satisfied at the end of the four year exploration period in April
1990. The negative result of the Shell/Triton well, even though it only vested
a small area at the extreme eastern end of the Terai was probably the main
reason for the lack of enthusiasm shown by the oil companies in the later
bidding rounds. It should be remembered that this is not a typical oil and gas
province, and the possibilities of hydrocarbons being generated and trapped
must be regarded as remote. It has been shown that a structure in the eastern
area is dry and it will be difficult in the current tight financial situation
to persuade the IOCs to spend limited exploration money in this area. On the
positive side the understanding of the structure of the Terai Basin has been
increased and possible petroleum prospects identified. The seismic results on
the Terai plain south of the mountain front using current techniques were good
and showed that the structures could be defined by seismic surveys at
reasonable cost. Several structural indications have been identified which
should be further investigated as possible hydrocarbon plays.
1.11        At the institution level the DMG has been strengthened, a r.umber
of their personnel have been given training. Modern petroleum legislation has
been enacted. Donors have expressed interest in funding further exploration
and new prospective plays may be identified during these surveys. DMG should
continue to seek donor funding and IDA funding could be provided to allow DMG
to coordinate future donor funded activities. In casR none of the IOCs enter
into production sharing agreements to drill exploratiozn wells, and if DMG can
identify suitable structures using data from the donor financed exploration
activities they may able to find donor support to drill exploration wells.
Project Sustainability
1.12        Nepal's need for hydrocarbons is as strong as ever. Although DMG's
technical capability has been strengthened they have virtually no funding to
support a continued promotion effort. They have been successful in obtaining
further donor help to continue their exploration efforts, and this should
provide new data and prospects to attract the IOCs. However DMG will need
funding to provide the continuity in the coordination and interpretation of
the results from the new surveys. Arrangements are being discussed to provide
such funding from the Third Technical Assistance Project (Cr.1902-NEP). The
petroleum legislation should also be modified to allow the blocks to be left
open for bids, so that interested parties could make offers at 8ny time,
rather than closing the bidding round after a certain period.

IDA's Performance
1.13        To provide HMG/N with sufficient time to promote the area, the
Credit'd closing date was extended by one year five times from 1985 to 1990,
and funding of the promotional efforts were continued until 1990, through two
promotion campaigns and three bidding rounds. IDA staff supervised the first
promotion and assisted in the discussions with PCIAC and gave advice as
requested by DMG.  The laison with the DMG/SIU was close and extremely
cordial throughout the Project's implementation. During the early stages of
implementation, when the field work was in progress and the promotion campaign
was being trepared, supervision missions were made two or three times a year
by geophysical specialists and geologists, with occasional visits by financial
analysts and economists. In the later stages after the first promotion
supervision missions were reduced to one a year.
Borrower's Performance
1.1;.       The special implementation unit for the Petroleum Exploration
Project worKed well. With the exception of the audited statements of accounts
which were usually delayed while awaiting government clearance, their reports
were good and supplied as requested. The quarterly reporting and the SIU
prepared reports for each supervision and review mission to Kathmandu were
good and greatly facilitated the supervision.

1.15        The relationship between IDA staff and the DMG/SIU staff seconded
into the project was good tbroughout the project. Local staff took part in the
field work and were given on the job training. They showed themselves to be
capable of learning and applying exploration techniques. To further develop
the DMG staff it would be advisable in future to give them more responsible
roles in the project implementation and to reduce the reliance placed on
expatriate consultants.
Consulting Services
1.16        Consultants played a key part in the project and their performance
was rated good to excellent by DMG. Consultant and contractor services were
used for:-
Seismic data acquisition and supervision;
Seismic data processing;
Seismic interpretation;
Geochemical sampling and analyses;
Photogeological survey and interpretation;
Legal advice on petroleum legislation and drafting the new model
petroleum agreement;
Promotion campaign preparation and in the promotional meetings;
In the final promotion campaign PCIAC funded consultants carried out the
field work and presented their new interpretation in the promotion
meetings.

Prolect Documentation and Data
1.17        The President's Report and the Development Credit Agreement were
approriate for the project's objectives and were followed throughout the
project. During the first part of the project when IDA funded seismic work was
in progress, seven quarterly reports were submitted by SIU. In 1986 at the
end of this first phase of the activities, SIU prepared an interim review
report giving a summary of the results to that date. During the extension of
the project, while the PCIAC funded seismic surveys were being planned and
implemented, IDA staff were invited by DMG and PCIAC to attend the program
meetings and full minutes were provided to IDA by PCIAC. Data was prepared as
required by SIU for the supervision mission. These various reports and the
supervision reports together provided an adequate documentation of the
project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NEPAL
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1260-NEP)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Proiect Oblective. Design and Scope
2.01        The project was designed to:  (a) promote petroleum exploration in
Nepal by IOCs, including completion of preparatory work required for such
promotional efforts; and (b) strengthen the Department of Mines and Geology/
HMG in administering and supervising the exploration and development of
petroleum resources. Pursuant to the Article 3.02 of the Development Credit
Agreement (IDA Credit 1260 NEP) signed in July 9, 1982 between His Majesty's
Government of Nepal and the International Development Association/World Bank,
the Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) established PEPP to carry out
necessary operations to achieve the objective as set forth in the Credit
Agreement. PEPP/DMG has carried out various geological/geophysical exploration
activities through foreign contractors/consultants. The main achievements of
the project are:
(i)   a new Petroleum Act was brought into force under which
Petroleum Regulations and Model Petroleum Agreement was
also enacted on March 10, 1985 with some necessary amend-
ments in 1989;
(ii)  a seismic survey of 1250 line km was conducted (1982-84)
through Compagnie Generale de Geophysique (CGG) France and
a consulting firm (Tetra Tech, Inc.) was engaged to
disseminate and synthesize all available seismic,
geochemical, and geological data; and
(iii) preparation of a Petroleum Accounting Manual applicable to all
multinational oil companies working in Nepal under Petroleum
Agreements.
The outcome of these activities were presented to oil companies during
promotional meetings held in London, Houston and Kathmandu (March/April 1985)
when the first round of bidding for 10 different exploration acreage blocks
was opened. This first round of bidding resulted in the signing of an
exploration agreement with Shell Exploration B.V., The Netherlands and Triton
Energy Corporation, USA on May 4, 1986 for the Exploration Block #10
(Biratnagar Area). Shell, as the operator, carried out detailed geological
and seismic surveys covering 1938 line km, and also drilled one stratigraphic
exploratory well to a total depth of 3520 m. Unfortunately, the well did not
prove to be a commercial one; the operator relinquish the area after the first
four year Exploration Period.
2.02        Since it was the first well ever drilled in Nepal that tested only
a limited area in the extreme eastern part of the country, DMG felt that
sufficient reliable independent structures still exist for further
investigation in other part of the country. With a view to acquire additional
data to promote for exploration, the PEPP/DMG acquired an additional 1640 line
km of seismic data in 1987-89 under bilateral assistance from Petro-Canada
International Assistance Corporation (PCIAC). After acquiring new PCIAC
seismic data and in anticipation of the expiry of the Credit at the end of



8
1990, PEPP/DMG decided to hold another series of promotional meetings in March
1990, followed by a second round of bidding which did not attract any oil
companies. The third round of bidding was announced on March 1990, and
included Block #10 relinquished by Shell/Triton. However the political
instability (democratic movement) was a set back in attracting oil companies.
With the advent of democracy in the country and newly elected democratic
government, PEPP/DMG is optimistic and expects greater interest to be shown by
the international oil companies for the exploration activities in future.
Implementation Arrangements
2.03        In order to enable the Executing Agency (DMG) to meet the
objectives and other covenants stipulated in the Agreement, PEPP was
controlled independently by the Special Implementation Unit (SIU) throughout
the project period. Some professional staff were seconded to this project by
DMG and a number of temporary staff were recruited to carry out various
activities. PEPP/DMG conducted several activities for the enhancement of the
proprietary data base relating to petroleum exploration promotion, training of
its personnel in technical, legal, financial and administrative skills
relative to petroleum operations and the institutional strengthening of the
PEPP/DMG in anticipation of working with multinational oil companies and
monitoring their activities.
(A) Consultants Services
A few consultants/firm were hired in specialist area where PEPP/DMG
had no specific knowledge and facilities. The specialist area
included legal, petroleum, geology, seismic surveys, photogeological
mapping, data processing/interpretation, petroleum negotiations,
petroleum accounting, etc. The hiring of consultants/
contractors was carried out as per IDA Guidelineo of Hiring
Consultants from short listed firms/companies. Most of the consul-
tants were contracted on as and when needed basis during the project.
The performance of the consultants engaged in this project were good
to excellent. However, in some cases, the type of service provided
was more of an "obligatory/contractual nature," than of an "advisory
nature" which would be of an important opportunity for transfer of
technology/on-the-job training to PEPP/DMG staff.
(B) Procurement of Goods and Services
The equipment and materials financed under Credit Agreement were
procured on the basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB),
International Shopping (ILS) in accordance with the Bank'a Guidelines
for Procurement. The performance of various suppliers of equipments/
materials were generally satisfactory. Deliveries of certain items
(seismic explosives), however, were delayed by the suppliers with
respect to the terms of contract/purchase orders. During the project
period a total of about SDR 857,000 was spent on the importation of
equipments and materials.



9
Organizational Relationships
2.04        A good working relationship was maintained with the concerned line
agencies of HMG and the IDA. However, in some cases, especially to customs
exemptions on imported equipment/materials, issuance of non-tourist visa to
expatriates were delayed and problem were faced with the r!oncerned HMG
departments since no clear provisions were made for the exemptions in the text
of Development Credit Agreement. It is, therefore, advisable for IDA to
ensure that provisions designed to overcome such problems should clearly be
mentioned in the Credit Agreement.
(A) PEPP/DMG Performance
Despite their unfamiliarity with the Bank's procedures in the early
stages, PEPP/DMG was able to successfully implement and execute all
the activities set forth in the Agreement. A best exeraple would be
that the every review mission during the project were fully satisfied
with the performance of PEPP/DMG and five times yearly extensions of
the Agreement were approved by the IDA.  The only weakness of PEPP/DMG
was in not being able to provide the Final Audit Certificate immediately
after an audit had been carried out. This involves a lengthy
bureaucratic process, and applies to all projects in Nepal.
(B) IDA Performance
An excellent working relationship between PEPP/DMG and the IDA/World
Bank was maintained throughout the project and no significant
difficulties were encountered during project implementation/execution.
The IDA had clo;ely monitored the activities of the project and had
responded expeditiously to requests made by PEPP/DMG dur4ng the life
of the project. Moreover, the opening of Book of Accounts for 4
months after the expiration of the credit further enhanced the project
implementaticn in terms of delayed and left over importations. (e.g.
Computer Systems/Network).
Proiect Costs
2.05        At an early stage (1982) the total project cost was estimated and
allocated at SDR 8.3 million for an initial period of 3 years. However, to
further enhance the quality of achievement of some objectives, annual
extensions of the Agreement were approved 5 times by the IDA till end of
December 1990. During the period of the project unused portion of SDR 1.7
million was surrendered and cancelled from the original allocation, thus
remaining amount of SDR 6.6 million was reallocated and endorsed by the IDA.
During the entire project period SDR 5,875,637.04 was spent on various
activities with remaining undisbursed balance of SDR 724,362.96.
Proiect Documentation and Data
2.06        Pursuant to the Article III and IV, PEPP/DMG established an
independent Special Project Unit to carry out necessary operations and during
the life of the project, a separate project accounts/data base was
established.  The IDA review wmsion were provided with sufficient information
required during their assessment of project operations and were fully



10
satisfied with the performance of PEPP/DMG, thus providing full compliance
with the provisions set forth in the Credit Agreement.
Future Perspective/Recommendations
2.07        Successful completion of various geological and geophysical works
in the southern plains of Nepal have for the first time given factual data for
the evaluation of geological formations of the subsurface sedimentary basins.
These works have indicated the possibility of various "plays" that could be
considered for exploration of petroleum in Nepal. PEPP/DMG has gained
substantial experience from implementation/execution of the project in order
to promote petroleum exploration in the country. However, PEPP/DMG is still
partially dependent on expatriate consultants in some specialist areas. As
the activities of PEPP/DMG continue to grow, it will require outside funding
to support its operational and promotional campaign. Therefore, IDA
assistance for some more years will remain a preferred source of financing to
further strengthen its capabilities.

Comments
Seismic contract fees were less than expected because of lower world prices.
Extra consultant work for seismic should have been allocated to seismic
survey, not to geophysical and geological consultants. The resultant increase
in consultants funding also gives a false impression of those expenditures.
Extension of project increased materials costs. At the later stages of the
project personal computers and other office equipment were purchased to
upgrade DMG's data handling capacity, and thus allow them to continue to
supervise and interpret donor financed promotion activity.
