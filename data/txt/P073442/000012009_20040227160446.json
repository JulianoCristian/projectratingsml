The EA first addresses the need to improve the\n            institutional, legal, and regulatory framework concerning\n            medical, and wastes disposal management, in an ecological,\n            and sanitary manner. To this end, a regulatory management\n            should be in place at health facilities, accompanied by the\n            necessary budgetary resources to finance waste management,\n            and support, and promote the use of recycled materials.\n            Medical and hospital personnel, as well as private health\n            operators, should be trained in waste management, while\n            extensive sensitization, promotion, and public campaigns\n            should inform populations on the risks associated with the\n            non-compliance with waste management practices. Training\n            programs, and strategies for sanitary collection operations\n            should be made available, which should include the necessary\n            transportation modes, and appropriate residues treatment\n            systems, and processes for final disposal. It may include\n            microwave, incineration, chemical disinfection, and disposal\n            at landfills (following appropriate site selection), as each\n            case may require."}, "docdt": "2003-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
