1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.       Guinea-Bissau became independent in 1974. The eruption of armed conflict in 1998-99 brought
to an end the progress that had been made in economic development in the early 1990s. The conflict
reduced real GDP by 28% and agricultural production by 17%. Part of the physical infrastructure,
including the health sector, was severely damaged. As a result, health services, which are crucial for
HIV/AIDS mitigation, were in disarray and will take a long time to recover given the poor state of the
physical infrastructure and the precarious state of public finances. As to common knowledge, the
displacement of people fuels HIV/AIDS transmission rates, which increased following the civil war also
in Guinea-Bissau, especially among the under-30 age group.

2.       The importance of the HIV/AIDS epidemic was clear to the Government, which developed a
Strategic National Plan for the health sector (SNP) and a National Program to implement the SNP, with
support from various technical and financial partners. In the SNP, the Government confirmed its
commitment to a decentralized participatory approach, a multi-sectoral strategy, and a reliable and fully
transparent financing system. The SNP formed the basis of the request for financial support to both the
World Bank and the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). The
HIV/AIDS Global Mitigation Support Project was designed to support Government implementation of its
SNP.

3.       In 2003, the Government requested access to IDA resources within the framework of the first
phase of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for the Africa Region. Guinea-Bissau was
eligible for MAP funding and satisfied the four eligibility criteria as follows: (i) it had a coherent national
strategy and had developed a comprehensive medium-term, multi-sectoral plan in a participatory manner
with all concerned stakeholders; (ii) a National HIV/AIDS Council (NAC) was created on March 14,
2004 (a condition of effectiveness), chaired by the Prime Minister, and with equal representation from
Government, civil society, and the private sector; (iii) Government agreed to implementation procedures
that would help expedite and outsource project implementation; and (iv) Government agreed to use and
fund multiple implementation agencies as reflected in its plans to channel funds directly to both public
and private implementing agencies, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs), associations of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and to communities.

4.       This Specific Investment Loan was consistent with the objectives of the Bank's regional
HIV/AIDS strategy and consistent with the objectives of the 2004 Guinea-Bissau Interim Support
Strategy (ISS).

5.       At the time of Project preparation, some limited actions to prevent HIV/AIDS and mitigate its
impact were being carried out by a few NGOs in Guinea-Bissau, but they were not coordinated and had
limited financial support. There were also no comprehensive and reliable HIV statistics. Available data
from the Ministry of Health show that from 1994 to 1996, there were between 600 to 900 new cases per
year and 1,101 in 1999. The disease was continuing to spread mostly along the main transportation axes
from Bissau to Bafatá, Gabú, and Cacheu. According to the 2001 WHO estimates, health centers were
only capturing around 16% of estimated cases. It was projected that without intervention, 24 to 40 persons
would be infected daily with HIV-1.1

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
6.       The Project's initial PDO was to support the medium-term strategy of the Government to expand
and accelerate the national response to HIV/AIDS by: (i) reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS infection; (ii)
increasing access to treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS; (iii) decreasing
the socio-economic impacts of HIV/AIDS at the individual, household, and community levels; and (iv)
strengthening national capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

7.       The SNP had identified a large number of output, process, and outcome indicators. The project
results framework selected some of these indicators as shown in Table 1.


 Table 1: Key Outcome Indicators

 Element of PDO                                    Associated Outcome Indicator

 Reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS infection.        By the end of Y3, the rate of increase of sero-prevalence of
                                                   HIV among antenatal women aged 15-24 has declined in
                                                   the population (compared to Y1).

                                                   symptoms in the last 12 months, who sought care at a

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
8.       A restructuring package was approved by the Board on July 3, 2007 and countersigned on
December 7, 2008 with revised PDO and associated key performance indicators (KPIs). The restructuring
was part of the umbrella restructuring and amendment of the financial agreements for all MAP projects in
the Africa Region. The restructuring of this Project aimed to align it with MAP implementation
experience. The original PDO as formulated could not be measured as no baseline data existed, but more
importantly, MAP implementation experience had shown that it was unrealistic to expect, and thus target,
a reduction in prevalence over the short span of the project. A more realistic and attainable objective for
MAP projects would be to target prevention, care and mitigation. The PDO was modified along these
lines, but components were not changed as a result of the restructuring.

9.       The new PDO, with more reasonable goals, focusing more on prevention, was reformulated as
follows: "The objective of the Project is to assist the recipient in increasing access to HIV prevention,
care and treatment, and mitigation services." The following KPIs were added to the financing agreement
(Schedule 6) and replaced the indicators in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD):

PDO Indicators:
     The percentage of young women and men aged 15-24 reporting the use of a condom the last time
         they had sex with a non-marital, non-cohabiting sexual partner has increased to 65%.
     The %age of identified commercial sex workers who report using a condom with their most
         recent client has increased to 25%.
     5,000 persons aged 15 and older have received counseling and testing for HIV and received their
         test results during the last 12 months.
     5,000 pregnant women living with HIV have received anti-retrovirals to reduce the risk of Mother
         to Child Transmission (MTCT) during the last 12 months.



                                                     2

     The percentage of youth (15-24) who can correctly identify at least two methods of HIV/AIDS
         transmission has increased to 60%.


Intermediate indicator:
     1 million male and female condoms have been distributed during the last 12 months.
     10% of identified orphans and vulnerable children whose households received free basic external
         support in caring for the child during the last 12 months in the five pilot regions.
     US$1million provided to CSOs for subprojects.
     US$500,000 provided through Public Sector Organizations (PSO).

10.      Some of these new indicators carried on some of the activities from the pre-restructuring phase,
mainly: condom use and distribution, support for civil society initiatives, support to orphans and
vulnerable children, and counseling and testing. A number of KPIs were dropped, including: support to
find alternative income sources for PLWHA and affected families, STI/HIV/AIDS treatment capacity in
all health facilities, training of traditional healers and sage femmes in each region, condom use, number of
operational VCT centers, and HIV seroprevalence by source.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.      The Project was intended to benefit the following groups: (i) women, by giving full prophylactic
treatment to pregnant women, and by providing counseling and testing on MTCT; (ii) young people and
PLWHA, by raising awareness on unprotected sex, on transmission and viable treatment of the disease,
on the risks of multiple partners and offering counseling; (iii) hospital workers, by raising awareness of
the risk posed by insufficient or no sterilization of medical equipment; (iv) orphans and other vulnerable
children, through engagement of civil society, NGOs and orphans associations; and (v) groups which
engage in high-risk HIV related behaviors, such as sex workers, truck drivers and migrant workers.
Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and civil society associations--namely, religious organizations,
PLWHA associations, and orphans associations--would also benefit.

1.5 Original Components
12.      The Project would be implemented through three components, described below.

13.      Component 1: Community and Civil Society Initiatives, and Capacity Building (US$2.5
million), focused on social mobilization and community-level responses to HIV/AIDS. Funds were to be
set up to expand and strengthen HIV/AIDS activities of CBOs and civil society associations themselves,
or to contract NGOs or private sector entities. Groups that received funding were to be encouraged to
focus, but not necessarily limit, their activities on the most vulnerable groups, including: PLWHA,
hospital workers, orphans, youth, commercial sex workers, and truck drivers. Among these, priority was
given to orphans and PLWHA.

14.      Component 2: Government Multi-Sector Response (US$2.2 million), comprised a fund to
scale up and strengthen prevention, care, support and mitigation of the social and economic impact of
HIV/AIDS through programs/activities of the public sector. Component 2 had the following
subcomponents:

15.      Subcomponent 1: Support to Ministry of Health (US$1.3 million), supported the Ministry of
Health in combating the epidemic by partially financing the Ministry's HIV/AIDS work plan, including
prevention activities, medical treatments, counseling, supply of drugs, and monitoring the progress of the
epidemic. Funding sources from other partners would complement Project activities to ensure national
coverage.




                                                         3

16.     Subcomponent 2: Support to other Ministries and Government Agencies (US$0.9 million),
focused on mainstreaming HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention in the regular activities and work plans
of key ministries (Education, Finance, Defense, Justice, Agriculture, and Transportation).

17.     Component 3: Institutional Development for Program Management (US$2.3 million),
supported the National AIDS Council (NAC), whose broad responsibilities focused mainly on advocacy
and exerting leadership on the multi-sectoral response to HIV/AIDS. The Project also supported the
National AIDS Secretariat (NAS), including its regional components and focal points, to fulfill its
national HIV/AIDS coordination mandate, as well as technical support, financial management, and
monitoring and evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components
18.     Project components were not changed.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
19.     Changes in implementation arrangements were formalized through amendments to the
Development Grant Agreement. A first amendment was approved in August 2006. A new disbursement
category for sub-projects was introduced to provide support to CSOs, with a reallocation of SDR 700,000
into this new category. This category was to have been included in the original Project design, but was
omitted.

20.     In addition, the Project originally envisaged that there would be five operational surveillance
centers, one in each of the five regions covered by the project (Bissau, Bafatá, Oio, Cacheu and Gabú),
but at the time of the mid-term review (MTR) the Bank realized that: (i) funding was insufficient to have
the desired impact in all five regions; and (ii) there was significant overlap with the activities of GFATM
in two regions (Oio and Gabú). It was therefore agreed to focus interventions on Bissau, Bafatá and
Cacheu. In Oio and Gabú, the Project would focus only on supporting activities related to the first
component.

21.     A restructuring package was approved by the Board in July 2007, and took effect when it was
counter signed in December 2007. The restructuring included a revision of the PDO and KPIs (formalized
as Schedule 6 to the Agreement), extended the closing date from December 31, 2007 to 31 December
2008, and reallocated funds.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
22.     The quality at entry is rated unsatisfactory. Although Project design drew on other country
experiences (Uganda, Brazil, Senegal), and took into account lessons from other Bank HIV/AIDS projects
in Africa, and recommendations of studies in key areas (use of rural radios, support to orphans), it failed
to adequately address a number of key issues which seriously affected Project outcome and impact:

     The Project's objectives were too ambitious given the extremely weak implementation capacity in
        the country and the lack of available information to measure Project impact. This was one of the
        key comments received at the decision meeting from the Operations Advisor for HIV/AIDS, but
        there is no evidence that this concern was addressed in Project design.

     Discussions of the SNP at the Government level were limited to the Ministry of Health, and did
        not involve other Government stakeholders. As a result, the SNP lacked Government ownership
        and remained a document written specifically for the donor community by consultants.

     The decree establishing the SNP implementation structure was not discussed in the Council of
        Ministers and adopted by the Prime Minister, but instead based on a decree signed by the then


                                                       4

        Minister of Health, greatly diminishing the buy-in of the Prime Minister's Office and other
        Ministers.

     GFATM funding was not adequately taken into account in Project design and the coordinating
        mechanism between the two projects (Bank and GFATM) was not addressed. The PAD did not
        make clear which activities were to be funded by GFATM and which by the Bank. This lack of
        coordination became a major contributing factor to implementation problems.

     The PAD did not make it clear that a number of activities were assumed to be carried out by other
        Projects. In particular, the safeguard measures were inadequately evaluated and depended on the
        multi-donor supported National Health Development Project (PNDS) for the required investments
        in health infrastructure and incinerators. The delayed implementation of these investments greatly
        impacted the project.

     Despite the long list of indicators in the PAD, there was no monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
        system included in Project design, making it impossible to measure KPIs.

     During preparation, there was a suggestion to use Dakar-based firms to handle financial
        management and procurement, as there were no firms in Guinea-Bissau that would meet Bank
        standards. This option was rejected by the task team as too costly and these functions were thus
        assigned to NAS, despite the fact that staff with these skills were very scarce in the country.

     Similarly, the Bank agreed with Government that all NAS staff should be Guinea-Bissau
        nationals, even though there was a severe shortage of experienced people in-country and the
        salaries offered were too low to attract nationals living overseas (the Coordinator earned about
        US$30,000 per year).

     Project implementation arrangements were very top heavy, in particular for the first component,
        which required the establishment of regional teams with high operating costs.

     No detailed and reliable cost estimates were prepared for the Project in the form of cost tables or
        other tools. The Project Costs Annex in the PAD only shows total amounts by the three Project
        components with no details or disaggregation.

23.     Overall Project risk was rated as substantial. The PAD identified two risks as high: (i) NAS
management and implementation capacity would be inadequate for the task; and (ii) insufficient data
would be available to measure project impact (some key data may not be easily collectable or collected
too late to be of use in project evaluation). Although these were indeed critical risks that affected Project
implementation, the proposed mitigation measures were weak or not followed through. In the case of
NAS capacity, the risk mitigation measures refer to a transparent recruitment process without
acknowledging the possibility that not enough qualified staff would apply, and refers to an institutional
assessment to be carried out in 12 months after effectiveness, but there is no evidence that such an
assessment took place. In the case of data availability, the risk mitigation measure proposed a data
assessment as part of establishing the M&E system, and notes the need to put in place appropriate data
collection systems. There is no evidence that a systematic data assessment was carried out, but in addition
the proposed mitigation measure did not adequately address the risk that the data would be difficult to
collect or not available in a timely manner. The lack of a baseline and an inadequate and delayed M&E
system impacted Project performance.

24.     Four risks were rated as substantial: (i) quality and commitment of political leadership, including
NAC, would be weaker than required; (ii) a weak health sector would hamper strategic HIV/AIDS-related
care issues; (iii) donor interest and financing would not increase; and (iv) there could be insufficient
CBOs and NGOs available in the regions to fully carry out the program. Mitigation measures were weak
and proved inadequate. Advocacy campaigns are not an appropriate substitute or palliative for lack of
political commitment, or leadership capacity in the national coordinating body (NAC). Weaknesses in the



                                                     5

health sector could not be addressed through the Project's HIV/AIDS interventions alone. Donor support
generally requires Government leadership and commitment, which in this case was weak, and the lack of
a well-functioning M&E system likely reduced donor confidence that donor funds would be well used
and targeted.

25.      All identified risks affected Project implementation to varying degrees--with the exception of the
availability of CBOs and NGOs--and the mitigation measures proved inadequate and not well thought
out or fully evaluated. In addition, an unforeseen critical risk was the unstable political environment, with
frequent Government changes that greatly undermined the ability of the Project to achieve its results.
Overall, the risk assessment should have been more detailed, considered alternatives, and made specific
reference to the fact that a new multi-sectoral project operating in a weak post-conflict environment
would force formidable challenges.

26.      The Project was not subject to a review by the Quality Assurance Group for either quality at entry
or quality of supervision.

2.2 Implementation

27.      Effectiveness was delayed by 6 months after Board due to several factors. The first was delays in
contracting NAS staff, which were in the end not contracted until close to effectiveness. Thus, there was a
lack of continuity of NAS staff between preparation and implementation, adding to misunderstandings
and implementation delays. In addition, the then Minister of Health did not want to release one of her key
directors to work at the NAS, because it would severely affect the capacity of the Ministry. The officer
selected for M&E received a competing offer from another project and withdrew his candidacy. As a
result, the staffing of NAS, which functioned as the Project Management Unit (PMU), was inadequate.

28.      The second reason was the delay in preparing the first year work program, which was in part
linked to the delay in hiring NAS staff and weak Government capacity. Following approval of the PPF,
the PNDS PMU agreed to handle procurement and financial management, until NAS staff was on-board.

29.      The main issues affecting the Project during implementation were:
  Insufficient capacity to plan and implement. None of the NAS staff had ever managed a program
     before and most were mid-level former civil servants from the Ministry of Health. In addition, none
     had been involved in project preparation and there was inadequate briefing at Project start-up.
  Project staff and the Bank team did not communicate well, not only because of the general
     communication difficulties in Guinea-Bissau, but also because the first and second TTL did not
     speak Portuguese and not all NAS staff and Government officials understood French or English well.
  Inadequate collaboration between UN agencies (with the exception of WHO) and NAS, despite the
     agreement by UNDP to provide technical support and build capacity in NAS. UNDP, as
     implementing agency for the GFATM Grant, appeared to have limited interest in supporting capacity
     building in NAS as UNDP itself was itself seeking to implement GFATM programs in Guinea-
     Bissau. It was only toward the end of the project, when it became clear that NAS would be the new
     implementing agency for the second phase of the GFATM HIV/AIDS Grant that the UN agencies
     started to support NAS.
  Limited initial support across the Government for the program which was seen as a Ministry of
     Health project.
  Although there was an experienced Procurement Officer in the PMU, procurement remained the
     weakest link, primarily due to the passive procurement execution (the procurement officer was also
     working for PNDS and gave priority to this work) and weak capacity in the PMU to write terms of
     reference. In addition, there was insufficient support from the Bank in procurement supervision and



                                                      6

     in particular for the review of procurement plans and performance. Also, the composition of the
     Bank's team during supervision missions was weak: according to information in the ISRs, the Social
     Development Specialist only participated in one mission, the Public Health Specialist participated
     only in three missions, and no Safeguard Specialist was part of the team.
  Serious delays in implementing the waste management plan.

30.     Strong points during project implementation were:
  Ability to reach all intended beneficiary groups such as women, orphans, vulnerable children,
     PLWHA, young people, truck drivers and sex workers.
  Voluntary counseling and testing, and the community component, which were both spearheaded by
     highly motivated NAS staff.
  Strong collaboration between the TTL for the GFATM Grant from Geneva and the Bank team with
     yearly joint supervision missions.

31.     A Mid Term Review (MTR) took place in October 2006. During the MTR it was agreed that the
Project needed to be restructured as the achievement of the PDO could not be measured and several KPIs
therefore needed to be reformulated. It was also agreed to extend the closing date from December 31,
2007 until December 31, 2008, and to reallocate grant proceeds. An action plan was drawn up to improve
Project implementation performance.

32.     The restructuring package was approved by the Board July 3, 2007. It was part of the umbrella
restructuring and amendment of the financial agreements for MAP projects. As Government had not
formally adopted the second SNP nor its revised institutional structure, the Bank team asked Government
to formally adopt the Plan and to formalize this in a Prime Ministerial decree, as a condition for signing
the amendments to the Financing Agreement. These conditions were met by November 2007, and as a
result of the Cabinet-level discussions there was much greater involvement of the Prime Minister in
HIV/AIDS awareness activities and greater overall Government buy-in.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
33.     Design. The Project did not include an M&E system in its design and there was therefore no
M&E system at the start of the Project. The M&E system was expected to be developed during
implementation. A consultant was hired to design an integrated M&E system that would apply to all
HIV/AIDS activities in the country. Unfortunately, the consultant could not complete her work due to
health problems. UNICEF and UNAIDS offered to provide support to complete the establishment of the
M&E system, but this support did not materialize in a timely manner.

34.     Implementation. Despite the fact that the consultant mentioned above could not complete the
manual, she was instrumental in training the M&E officer in data collection and reporting.
Implementation was difficult and NAS was not able to effectively produce reports. In March 2007, there
were still delays in finalizing the M&E system, which was negatively impacting Project performance.
Overall M&E, especially data collection and reporting remained inadequate and a major constraint.

35.     Utilization. Limited M&E capacity in NAS, and the unavailability of a management information
system for more than two years, made monitoring difficult, compounded by the fact that many indicators
had no baseline.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
36.     The Project was an environmental category B. The most important environmental issue identified
was medical waste disposal. An incinerator was supposed to be built in the National Hospital through
PNDS with AfDB financing, but by the end of 2007 construction had not yet started. In lieu of this, and



                                                    7

only in the last year of the Project, three mini-incinerators using WHO-approved guidelines were built at
the National Laboratory and at two health centers (Bandim and Belém), funded by the Project. Prior to the
construction of these incinerators, each testing and Counseling Center disposed of hazardous waste by
digging a hole in the ground where the hazardous waste was dumped and incinerated with fuel, a common
practice in Guinea-Bissau.

37.      Financial Management suffered in the beginning, owing to the lack of trained staff, while passive
procurement execution and weak capacity slowed implementation. More reliable financial information
became available following the transfer of financial management responsibilities from PNDS to the
Project, the associated adoption of the new financial management system, and the timely submission of
quarterly reports. The internal control system put in place was adequate, and audit reports were submitted
on time. There were no qualified audits.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
38.      Due to the limited IDA country envelope and the availability of GFATM resources, the Bank did
not prepare a follow-on project. The GFATM Grant (US$13.1 million) was signed on November 12, 2008,
with NAS as principal recipient. The Grant aims to: (i) decrease trends of HIV infection in the general
population; (ii) improve living conditions of PLWHA; (iii) provide complete and reliable strategic
information on the trends of the epidemic for decision making and resource allocation; and (iv) involve all
HIV/AIDS partners in the country in the fight against the epidemic. The new Grant will support some
activities initiated under the Bank's Project, such as the associations of PLWHA, but not others, such as
Regional AIDS Centers.

39.      The effectiveness and impact of the follow-on GFATM Grant will depend on whether it builds on
the lessons learned from the Bank's Project and avoids its mistakes. With the restructuring of NAS, the
country is better placed to implement the Government's HIV/AIDS strategy, but institutional gains in
fragile states such as Guinea-Bissau tend to be fragile, and must be supported with effective, well-targeted
and sustained financial and technical resources. Arrangements were made to ensure an adequate and
smooth transition with GFATM, but due to the lengthy recruitment procedures to hire new NAS staff
(over a year), the handover could not be properly effected. The new Grant will also have to contend with
a very weak health sector, and widespread needs across the sector, especially in terms of capacity at the
regional level, lack of reagents, little testing of pregnant women, and vertical control of MTCT.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
40.      The relevance of the Project's objectives, design and implementation is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. The Project was consistent with both the objectives of the Bank's regional HIV/AIDS
strategy and with those of the 2004 Guinea-Bissau ISS. Additionally, the project supported the
Government's medium-term strategy to expand and accelerate the national response to HIV/AIDS.
Addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to be a priority in the country (estimated current
prevalence rate of 3-7%), and is in line with global priorities to fight the disease. Although the Project
was highly relevant at the time it was designed, design and implementation could have been improved in
many important respects, but particularly in taking account of the fact that this was a complex operation
in a very fragile state with extremely weak capacity.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
41.      Achievement of the PDO is rated unsatisfactory. Key indicators, both before and after the
December 2007 restructuring, are presented in the datasheet. At the time of the restructuring, SDR 3.87
million had been disbursed, representing 82% of total disbursements. Since available data for many of the
pre-restructuring indicators is weak or absent, progress under the Project prior to restructuring is



                                                        8

presented below by component and activities, rather than by KPI (the achievements by KPI for the post-
restructuring phase are presented later).

42.      Component 1, Community and Civil Society Initiatives and Capacity Building
         (i) Work with orphans and vulnerable children (partially achieved): The work with priority
groups such as orphans and other vulnerable children, was successful due to partnerships created with
NGOs (Casa Emmanuel, Aldeia SOS, CARITAS, AMIC, and Associação Nova Vida), which helped in
the social integration of orphans and other vulnerable children. These NGOs worked directly with
orphans, children that suffered sexual abuse, children of HIV-positive mothers and PLWHA, by providing
emotional, nutritional and medical support. The Project succeeded in providing these children access to
education and food aid, giving them a sense of belonging and normalcy, and helped reduce social stigma.
There is, however, no data to assess or measure impact, without which it is not possible to rate this
activity as achieved.

         (ii) Community activities (inconclusive): Despite starting with delays a total of 148 associations
and NGOs submitted their legal documents, of which 99 were selected to receive training on how to
prepare sub-project proposals, and 71 proposals of up to US$20,000 were approved by the Regional
HIV/AIDS Councils (e.g., Youth Council, INDE--HIV-positive, and Casa Emmanuel--orphans).
Although the Project succeeded in channeling increased support through civil society, their impact and
effectiveness, especially in terms of behaviors of the general public, is unknown since at the end the
Project did not have sufficient funds to measure behavioral impact, despite the fact that this had been
planned as a priority activity. An important achievement was the emergence of a number of PLWHA
associations and creation of a network of these associations. Three national groups emerged as a result of
the Project.

         (iii) Behavior change of sex workers (partially achieved): Following a baseline survey, efforts to
change behavior among sex workers started, with delays, in 2007. Subsequent to the Project's activities,
the percentage of commercial sex workers who reported using a condom with their most recent clients
was 32%, up from under 20% reported in the baseline and above the 25% target.

         (iv) Training (partially achieved): Toward the end of the project, PLWHA and sex workers
received training from the NGO ADIM enabling them to successfully apply for micro-credits. ADIM also
provided training to develop skills for various income-generation activities such as sewing, gathering fire
wood, and selling chickens, thus opening up opportunities for beneficiaries to switch to alternative
livelihood sources.

43.      Overall the objectives of this component were only partially achieved and performance is rated
moderately satisfactory. Although data is incomplete, through its work with orphans and vulnerable
children as well as community activities, the component helped reduce the socio-economic impact of
HIV/AIDS at individual, household and community levels. The Project also laid the foundation to further
continue HIV/AIDS prevention activities and fostered national awareness on the importance of the
response to HIV/AIDS through the mobilization of community and religious leaders, particularly at the
regional levels. A major achievement was the support provided to the network of three associations of
PLWHA, and the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation.

44.      Component 2, Government Multi-Sector Response: this component was divided into two sub-
components, one targeting the health sector and one targeting key ministries.

45.      Sub- Component 1: The health sector sub-component aimed to strengthen the Integrated Health
Network for the provision of voluntary counseling and testing and HIV/AIDS related services along the
major transportation axes where prevalence rates are highest; increase the supply of drugs and materials;
strengthen clinical laboratory capacity to enable diagnosis and monitoring of HIV therapy, including


                                                     9

those for CD4; monitoring and diagnosis of opportunistic infections; support epidemiological surveillance
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of STIs; prevent MTCT; manage opportunistic infections (OIs),
focusing on prevention and treatment; and, lastly, support for management, monitoring and evaluation of
component activities as well as the overall progress of the epidemic. Seven major activities were
undertaken:

        (i) Voluntary counseling and testing (achieved): Voluntary counseling and testing and HIV/AIDS
related services were extended. Major activities were: training in counseling and voluntary testing for
health sector professionals, community associations and NGOs; and psycho-social support to PLWHA
and their families. Support was also provided along the major transportation axes. During 2005-08, over
59,000 persons 15 years or older went through counseling and testing. Psychological care was provided
also in one center, which was a substantial achievement in a country such as Guinea-Bissau that lacks
psychological professional capacity.

        (ii) Supply of drugs (not achieved): The supply of drugs did not materially increase as a result of
the Project and there continue to be insufficient materials and equipment (e.g., CD4 to determine at which
moment the infected person should take retrovirals). A 2006 study on the changes in prevalence and
incidence of HIV-1, HIV-2 and dual infections in urban areas of Bissau showed that anti-retroviral
treatment (ARVT) was not available in the country, although ART drugs were funded by GFATM. Weak
management of drugs and rupture of stocks of reagents and laboratory products, remained a concern
throughout the project; this rupture was caused by slow procurement (through the national drugs store
CECOME), but also due to shipment problems and low interest by suppliers. The drug supply chain was
very weak, lacking good software to manage stock distribution.

        (iii) Epidemiological surveillance (partially achieved): Support to epidemiological surveillance
was provided through training aimed at strengthening clinical laboratory capacity in areas such as: rapid
tests (110 out of 100 planned); bacteriology and blood safety (50 out of 100 planned); biochemical exams
(14 out of 20 planned); and treatment of STIs in PLWHA (140 out of 125 planned). Also, a baseline was
carried out.

        (iv) Treatment (inconclusive): Access to STI treatment and ART was held-up at the start of the
Project due to lack of test materials. The demand for STI/HIV/AIDS treatment increased, but due to poor
basic data it is not possible to assess if it met the Project target, from 0 to 20%. It is also not possible to
determine if the rate of increase of seroprevalence of HIV among antenatal women aged 15-24 declined.
However, the percentage of pregnant women that were receiving full prophylactic treatment increased
from 4.6% in 2004 to 11% in 2007.

        (v) Progress of the epidemic (inconclusive): Due to lack of data, it is impossible to measure the
spread of HIV/AIDS infection in Guinea-Bissau. What is clear is that it remains much higher than in
neighboring countries.

        (vi) Biosafety and waste disposal management (not achieved): Due to delays in implementing
the PNDS waste management plan, the three incinerators, at the National Laboratory and at two health
centers, were only constructed just before project close. Medical waste disposal therefore did not meet
safeguard standards during most of the life of the Project.

46.     Overall objectives of this sub-component were not fully achieved or inconclusive, and it is
therefore rated as unsatisfactory. While data is scarce on which to judge the success of activities
supported under this component, the data that is available combined with the low disbursement levels
(approximately 26% of those originally planned) support the rating. Further, as stated above, many
important outcomes that are key to the future sustainability of project efforts and the ongoing fight against
the epidemic, such as supply of drugs, biosafety and measurement of the epidemic, were not successful.


                                                       10

47.      Subcomponent 2: Aimed, inter alia, to provide capacity building to mainstream HIV/AIDS-
related activities (IEC campaigns, including promotion of condom use for staff and client awareness, to
ensure sustainable behavior changes among staff and clients) into the regular work plans of four key
ministries; facilitate the provision of HIV/AIDS social support networks for all staff; and carry out impact
studies to investigate the qualitative and quantitative consequences of the epidemic on specified sectors
and analysis of possible and appropriate responses. Two major activities were undertaken.

         (i) IEC (partially achieved): Awareness campaigns were developed with delays due to the late
preparation of the procurement plan. Billboards were installed in a few key locations but were unclear and
too complicated to effectively reach the population. More successful was the use of radios, where 774
programs were transmitted in local languages through contractual arrangements with radios, but they were
not diversified enough to ensure a greater knowledge of methods of HIV infection beyond intercourse.

         (ii) Condom distribution (partially achieved): This activity was carried out together with other
partners. Many NGOs targeted young people as this was the group with the highest likelihood for
behavioral change. As the final survey was not carried out, it is unclear whether the target of increasing
condom use from 35 to 65% was met. It is unlikely, however, that this target was met due to the
difficulties in obtaining condoms evidenced in most areas. An expatriate team was providing support
through PNDS for the development of social marketing capacity, but this contract was cancelled when the
Project became effective. The NGO AGMS (Social Marketing Agency of Guinea-Bissau), which was
created as a social marketing organization, carried out some activities under the Project but because of
uncertainty about its status, which was also flagged by the Bank's procurement specialist, these could not
be renewed. Despite this, AGMS successfully distributed over a million condoms to youths with Bank
support. The Transport Ministry developed effective interventions such as gas stations providing free
condoms for truck drivers and migrant workers. The Sailor's Union also distributed condoms for free.

48.      Overall the objectives of this sub-component were only partially achieved and there is no
evidence on impact. In addition, only 27% was disbursed of the amount envisaged at appraisal. The sub-
component is therefore rated moderately unsatisfactory. Awareness campaigns should have been a
priority from start and the availability of condoms was an issue.

49.      Component 3, Institutional Development for Program Management, aimed to strengthen the
capacity of NAS through the: (i) establishment of an effective and operational secretariat and networks at
national, regional, and district levels to enable the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of
strategic HIV/AIDS control interventions; (ii) establishment, operation and maintenance of performing
financial management and procurement systems; and (iii) establishment, operation and maintenance of a
performing M&E system.

         (i) Effective Secretariat (not achieved): NAC had the mandate for project oversight, while NAS
was responsible for project implementation at the national level and for the regional structures to facilitate
regional implementation. NAS, however, was not effective--its management and implementation
capacities were inadequate, it did not provide the expected leadership for the multi-sectoral response to
HIV/AIDS, and overall coordination was weak. The lack of pro-activity of NAS was a major factor in
implementation delays. As a result of these deficiencies, it was agreed to restructure NAS and to bring in
new staff for the final year of the project, both to improve performance and to ease the transition into a
new project. However, this did not happen due to delays in recruitment of new staff.

(ii) Financial management and procurement systems (not achieved): Although a financial management
system was installed and functioning, and was rated S or MS throughout the life of the Project, the last
ISR rates it as unsatisfactory, noting weak financial management that made it impossible to carry out the
final impact evaluation study (which was a priority activity) and prevent a funding gap related to drug


                                                      11

purchases through CECOME. Although not always reflected in the ISR ratings, procurement was
problematic throughout the Project, often being delayed mainly due to the fact that the procurement
specialist prioritized PNDS.

         (iii) M&E system (partially achieved): M&E implementation was a challenge. Extensive delays
in establishing a performing M&E system and continued poor procurement performance affected
implementation. This delay in establishing a functional M&E system impeded the provision of accessible
and timely information on progress of inputs, process, outputs and outcomes mainly in the beginning of
the Project. Capacity was built with technical assistance support and data was available before the MTR.

50.      Overall the objectives of this sub-component were not achieved, especially the critical component
of ensuring an effective secretariat, and the sub-component is therefore rated unsatisfactory. NAS was
not fully effective, M&E was delayed and not fully satisfactory, and financial management and
procurement were weak.

51.      Achievements by KPI for the post-restructuring phase are assessed below:

Outcome indicators:
         (i) Condom utilization among the general population (not achieved): The percentage of young
women and men aged 15-24 reporting the use of a condom the last time they had sex with a non-marital,
non-cohabiting sexual partner was 31%, less than half of the targeted 65%.

         (ii) Condom utilization among sex workers (achieved): The percentage of identified commercial
sex workers who report using a condom with their most recent client increased to 32%, 7 percentage
points above the target of 25%.

         (iii) Counseling (achieved): 13,996 persons aged 15 and older have received counseling and
testing for HIV, and received their test results during the last 12 months, compared to a target of 5,000
persons.

         (iv) MTCT treatment (not achieved): Only 258 pregnant women living with HIV have received
anti-retrovirals to reduce the risk of MTCT during the last 12 month, compared to a target of 5,000.

         (v) Identification of HIV/AIDS transmission (not achieved): The percentage of youth (15-24) who
can correctly identify at least two methods of HIV/AIDS transmission was only 7%, well short of the
60% targeted.

Intermediate outcome Indicators:

         (vi) Condom distribution (achieved): 2,028,160 male and female condoms were distributed
during the last 12 months of the Project.

         (viii) Support to orphans and vulnerable children (inconclusive): Although 4,544 orphans and
vulnerable children were identified, due to the absence of a baseline, it is not possible to determine if
10 % of those households actually received free basic external support for child care during the last 12
months in the five pilot regions.

         (ix) Funding grant allocation to Civil Societies (inconclusive): US$1.3 million was provided to
CSOs for subprojects compared to a target of US$1.0 million. However, as indicated earlier, the Project
did not carry out an assessment of the impact of these activities. Thus, while it is clear that additional
resources were channeled through CSOs, there is no information to evaluate the effectiveness of the CSO
programs or to draw lessons for future interventions.


                                                     12

         (x) Public sector contribution (achieved): US$1.3 million provided through Public Sector
Organizations compared to a target of US$0.5 million, but there is no information to assess impact or
effectiveness.

52.      Post-restructuring results are considered unsatisfactory. Although substantial achievements were
recorded in terms of condom utilization among sex workers, condom distribution, counseling, and
funding through CSOs and public sector agencies, there were major failings in terms of condom
utilization by the general population, MTCT treatment, and identification of HIV/AIDS transmission.
Moreover, there is no information to assess impact on support to orphans and vulnerable children, or the
funds distributed through CSOs and public agencies. These last two components, which fell substantially
below their targets (para. 54) were considered key for the sustainability of the program. Moreover, there
is no information to assess impact on support to orphans and vulnerable children, or the funds distributed
through CSOs and public agencies.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Unsatisfactory

53.      Project efficiency is rated as unsatisfactory. Weak governance and lack of accountability for
results led to inefficiencies in the use of resources. The Project's resources were not managed efficiently
and in line with Project objectives, and as a result the delivery of services was not efficient. Control over
resources and budget follow-up on the part of Project management were lax and the monitoring of
activities was weak. Symptomatic of these weaknesses is the fact that Components 1 and 2 were
significantly underfunded (only 64% and 54% respectively of appraisal cost estimates), while
disbursements under Component 3, which covered institutional develop for Project management, was
almost double the appraisal estimate. This de facto reallocation did not appear to respond to a strategic
realignment but rather to weak management and oversight.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory

54.      Although the Project was clearly relevant, this ICR concurs with the last ISR which rated the
PDO and overall implementation progress as unsatisfactory. Although some indicators were exceeded, as
noted in the last ISR two key indicators that were considered key for the sustainability of the program fell
substantially short of Project targets--the number of pregnant women living with HIV who received
treatment to reduce the risk of MTCT was only 5% of the post-restructuring target; and the percentage of
youth who can correctly identify at least two methods of HIV/AIDS transmission was only one tenth of
the target. In addition to falling well short of these two key targets, the Project was unsatisfactory in terms
of efficiency, had serious weaknesses in financial management and safeguards, did not manage a smooth
transition with the follow-on GFATM Grant, generated little data to evaluate performance, and failed to
carry out the assessment of behavioral change which was planned for the end of the Project and was
appropriately considered a priority.

Overarching Themes, other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
55.      HIV/AIDS increases the cycle of poverty, as less family members are generating income and are
socially productive. The prevention and treatment of the disease and STIs, is expected to have helped to
prevent or reduce HIV-related poverty, by enabling community members to continue to contribute to
society. The Project empowered local communities to help in the AIDS response, and awareness activities
carried out increased likely acceptance of PLWHA, by reducing the cultural taboo and stigma, and thus



                                                        13

may have contributed somewhat to social cohesion in the country. Through partnerships created with
NGOs, the Project assisted in the social reintegration of orphans and other vulnerable children, and
provided them with emotional, nutritional and medical support.

56.      An important achievement of the Project was to help raise social AIDS awareness, especially at
the regional level. For instance, remote villages revealed a surprising knowledge of HIV/AIDS which
were discussed in a variety local languages, laying the grounds for community behavioral change (e.g.,
voluntary testing). Although many key aspects of the Project were not successful or there is no data with
which to evaluate impact, the Project has, in effect, laid a foundation for HIV/AIDS work in Guinea-
Bissau which, if appropriately followed up, can begin to make a difference in mitigating the impact of the
epidemic.

57.      The Project made a special effort to focus on women. Targeting and involving women through
the provision of drugs and materials such as condoms, and treatment for OIs as well as anti-retroviral
drugs for the prevention of MTCT, was critical. Although difficult to assess, it appears that these efforts
to target women have helped in social mobilization and sensitization efforts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
58.      The community response component has given voice and visibility to a large number of CSOs. It
has built the capacity for advocacy and activism among PLWHA, as they were able to expand their
national network and reach out to larger numbers of people. In addition, the Project contributed to
strengthening a number of local communities through training and awareness campaigns. Local
institutions supported under the Project were mobilized to promote activities for the benefit of their
members. The voluntary testing program and the capacity building provided to NGOs carrying these out
have led to the establishment of national standards, including acceptance of the need to ensure client
confidentiality. As extensive training has been provided and detailed manuals exist, which have been
validated by all technical partners, it is highly likely that the voluntary testing program and capacity built
will be sustained after Project closing.

59.      The main risk would be the discontinuation of external support for HIV/AIDS as the country has
insufficient resources and capacity to address the epidemic. Resources available through the GFATM
will mitigate this risk in the short to medium term, but their impact will depend critically on drawing the
right lessons and avoiding some of the critical mistakes which appear to have hampered the Project. As a
result of the recent restructuring, NAS is better equipped to perform its coordination functions, but in
countries such as Guinea-Bissau these institutional gains can be very fragile and temporary, unless
continuously supported with external resources and technical capacity. A critical risk, which will continue
to affect follow-on activities and which lies beyond the scope of HIV/AIDS interventions, is the general
weakness of the country's health sector. Without parallel and effective efforts to strengthen health
policies, institutional capacity, skills and motivations of health staff, it will be difficult to sustain progress
in the battle against HIV/AIDS.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory

60.      Structured along the lines of the standard HIV/AIDS project, the design used lessons learned
from previous Bank operations. Inadequate attention, however, was paid to the specific capacity issues
prevailing in Guinea-Bissau. Although there may have been some pressure at the time to launch MAP
projects in the Region and perhaps over-optimism as to what could be achieved through a standard MAP
approach, there is no evidence that the country's extremely low capacity, the precarious state of its health
sector, and the country's serious lack of skills in all areas, were factored into Project design, even when
this was explicitly raised at the Decision Meeting. In addition, dialogue with the Government remained at
the level of the Ministry of Health and NGOs active in the health sector. Project design could have been
strengthened by: (i) more modest objectives and components, better tailored to the country's extremely
weak capacity; (ii) a better understanding of the local HIV/AIDS situation; (iii) a more realistic risk
assessment and mitigation strategy; (iv) establishment up-front of an M&E system; (v) greater
involvement of other stakeholders, especially throughout the Government; and (vi) an evaluation of the
costs of the proposed implementation structure relative to available funds and Project objectives.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Unsatisfactory.

61.      The task team made considerable efforts to compensate for the country's extremely weak
capacity, initial lack of ownership and Government commitment, and a flawed Project design. It also
made commendable efforts to coordinate with external partners, especially UN agencies and GFATM,
even though these partners were not always receptive or fully collaborative. Supervision frequency was
appropriate, with an average of two supervision missions per year (nine over the life of the Project), but
task team composition was frequently not adequate--according to the ISRs, the Social Development
Specialist only participated in one mission, the Public Health Specialist participated only in three
missions, and no Safeguards Specialist was part of the team. The task team does not appear to have
succeeded in building a solid partnership with the Borrower. The Borrower's ICR refers to lack of follow-
up on the part of the task team as one of the weakest points of Project implementation, as well as the fact
that the task team composition was incomplete during some supervision missions.

62.      In addition, the internal management set-up of the Project can be questioned. The second TTL
was not a health or HIV/AIDS expert and the Project was thus mapped to an environment unit (AFTEN).
Although this represented an Africa Region strategy at the time, designed to emphasize that HIV/AIDS is
multisectoral and that interventions should be mainstreamed across Bank operations rather than `belong'



                                                      15

to one sector (such as health), it would not appear to be an effective way to implement a complex
multisectoral operation in a fragile country with extremely weak capacity. As discussed in this report, the
Project faced many problems that were the result of a very weak health sector and thus greater
coordination with and support from health sector colleagues would have been desirable. In addition,
during the last year or so of Project implementation, the TTL remained the same but the Project was
mapped to the fragile states and social development unit (AFTCS). Having two completely unrelated
units being involved in the supervision of this project (AFTCS and AFTEN), was not conducive to strong
managerial and technical supervision oversight of a project operating in a very weak environment.

63.      The team and management missed an important opportunity during the MTR and subsequent
restructuring, especially on two counts. First, it should have been clear at the time of the restructuring that
something more than just changing the PDO was needed, especially given the limited time and resources
remaining after restructuring. This could have been the time to substantially restructure the whole Project,
most likely by refocusing it on a narrower set of objectives that could be reasonably accomplished in the
remaining time. Instead, only the PDO was changed. Second, at this stage the team could have also
sought urgent and dedicated technical support and assistance, especially from AFTHV, on the
restructuring itself but also on M&E, general supervision, and impact assessments.

64.      Financial management supervision was adequate, and in general the recommendations made by
the Financial Management Specialist were followed, with timely submission of quarterly reports.
However, financial management by the implementing agency was very weak, and as noted in para. 49 (ii),
the Project was unable to carry out the final impact evaluation and ended with a cost over-run on
procurement of drugs. There was insufficient support from the Bank in procurement supervision and
review, particularly of procurement plans and procurement performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory.

65.      The Bank's overall performance is rated as unsatisfactory, based on the assessment presented in
section 5.1 above.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory.

66.      Quality and commitment of the country's political leadership, including the National Aids
Council, was initially weak, including the lack of coordination between the Prime Minister's Office and
the Health Ministry. Also there was little progress in developing the enabling environment (politico-
institutional, technical, financial, administrative) and productive relationships with donors and partners. In
addition, the weak capacity of the PMU, and the limited cooperation between collaborating institutions,
caused delays in implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory.

67.      NAS faced a number of issues and challenges. The problem with staffing issues hampered
implementation and affected the quality of interventions. In addition, the lack of pro-activity on the part
of the National Secretariat continued to cause serious delays in implementation, reflecting the lack of
strategic direction and of strong leadership. Mechanisms to ensure accountability and sustainability
remained particularly weak throughout project implementation, particularly the limited efforts invested in
improving effectiveness and sustainability by NAS.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

68.      Overall, Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory based on the discussion in section 5.2.

6. Lessons Learned


69.      In fragile and post-conflict countries, as was the case in Guinea-Bissau, project objectives and
design need to be as simple and modest as possible. Project design must take full account of extremely
weak institutional capacity, the strong likelihood of political instability and staff/ministerial turnover, the
difficulties of ensuring full government ownership in the face of many competing demands and priorities,
and the need for a strong supervision effort, especially during the first 1-2 years of the project, to support
weak government structures and counterparts. Clear prioritization of activities, detailed implementation
plans, sequencing of activities and decisions, and a limited set of objectives and activities should be
essential requirements for projects to be implemented in fragile settings. These details should be fully
discussed and reviewed before submission to the Board, and task teams should be encouraged to prepare
detailed supervision plans for the first 12 months of project implementation.

70.      Creating a new institution is a complex and time-consuming undertaking, but especially in a
fragile state. As was the case of NAC and NAS in Guinea-Bissau, the difficulties are compounded when
the new institutions are required to work cross-sectorally, ensure buy-in from government structures and
the population at large, and include diverse representation (i.e., government, private sector, civil society).
Although establishment of NAC was a condition of effectiveness, project implementation was affected by
significant delays in contracting NAS staff, which should not have been surprising given the country's
low capacity and human capital. The fact that recruiting staff with appropriate skills for a new public
sector agency is a fragile state is likely to be difficult and lengthy; it should be factored into project
design, and steps taken to front-load capacity building and technical support during the project's early
phase. Sequencing and prioritization of project activities that can start early and that require relatively less
capacity also need to be part of project design.

71.      A multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS project, especially in an environment of weak capacity, should
target sectors and population segments with the largest potential impact. Although awareness raising
and sensitization of the population are welcome, given limited resources and institutional capacity, a
better strategy would be to focus mitigation and communication efforts on population groups that are
most vulnerable and that play a greater role in spreading HIV/AIDS.

72.      An adequate baseline and functioning M&E system are essential in projects that are piloting
new approaches, such as the first round of MAP interventions. Although development of the M&E
system was planned during implementation, it suffered delays, remains weak and is still lacking an
appropriate baseline. While some of the problems were unforeseen (health of the consultant, weak and
delayed support from UN partners), corrective actions and alternatives need to be considered and
prioritized. In the case of Guinea-Bissau, the lack of an adequate management information system
hindered the strategic response to the even limited monitoring data that could be generated. Projects that
are designed to learn-by-doing must have sufficient information to gather emerging lessons and adjust as
the project proceeds. Without reasonable certainty that a good M&E system and baseline will be in place
early during project implementation, it is questionable whether a learn-by-doing project should be
approved in the first place, even if there is a need to respond quickly to a serious emergency, such as
HIV/AIDS in Africa at the the time that MAP projects were approved.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The ICR Mission was unable to obtain detailed data and information on project outcomes, and very little by
way of analysis or studies. The only data set that was provided to the Mission did not include actual data, but
estimates derived from a Spectrum model. Even this data was incomplete, very difficult to read and analyze.
No Government or Project officials were available to assist the mission interpret the data or seek additional
information. The only data the Mission was able to collect on output by components is provided in the ICR
data sheet and is therefore not repeated in this Annex. The absence of data has greatly complicated the
preparation of this ICR.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Borrower pointed out in their ICR some strong and weak projects points, lessons
learned, recommendations and conclusions as follows:

Strong points of the Project: (i) existence of a National Strategic Plan in the fight
against HIV/AIDS; and (ii) creation of the CNLS and the STNL.

Difficulties: (i) institutional instability; (ii) lack of counterpart funding; and (iii) lack
of motivation among the health sector workers.

Weak points in the implementation and execution of the project: (i) frequent changes
in Government; (ii) lack of availability of TTL for supervision missions and lack of
follow-up on part of the TTL; (iii) change of TTL had a negative impact on the
Project; and (iv) lack of authorization from TTL to proceed with training for
different sectors of the SNLS.

Lessons learned:
     Objectives, strategies and activities have to be more realistic and concentrate
       on priorities;
     There was no ownership on part of the Government of the project document
       and leading to not respecting the commitments engaged with the financier;
       and
     There is no guarantee that there will be sustainability of the achieved results.

Relationship:
     Improvement of relationship with the World Bank team;
     Need of continuity of the interventions in the fight against HIV/AIDS to
       guarantee sustainability of the achieved results and have a better geographic
       coverage; and
     Improvement in ownership and integration on part of the Government in the
       management of funds.

Recommendations:
     It would be desirable that a new elected Government could complete its
       mandate, which would allow to improve the involvement of the CNLS;
     Better ownership of documents that will bring better results; and
     Better coordination among partners and stakeholders and the CNLS.

Conclusions:
     The results achieved were in general satisfactory, although some indicators
       were not achieved; and
     Development of the management capacity related to Project activities and
       experiences made it possible to lay the basic foundations for a better
       management of global resources.
