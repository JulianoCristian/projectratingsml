I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The project will support the medium-term strategy of the Government to expand and accelerate
the national response to HIV/AIDS by (i) reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS infection; (ii)
increasing access to treatment for STD and HIV/AIDS; and iii) decreasing the socio-economic
impacts of HIV/AIDS at the individual, household, and community levels.
Specifically, the project will:

l fund projects led by civil society, including the private sector, and carried out in urban and
    rural communities, which cover HIV/AIDS related prevention, advocacy, public awareness
    creation and care for orphans and PLWHA, focusing on the most vulnerable groups;
l strengthen delivery of health services providing prevention, care and treatment services, giving
    priority to the five regions with highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. Such services would
    include voluntary testing and counseling services and treatment of STDs and opportunistic
    infections related to HIV/AIDS;
l enable Government at the national and regional levels to carry out programs advocating
    prevention and facilitating access to care for its own staff and communities;
l strengthen institutional capacity for planning, delivering and monitoring of HIV/AIDS
    response interventions through all levels of Government and its line ministries, civil society
    and the private sector, with a focus on vulnerable groups.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project is designed within a multi-sector framework, under the Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP)
for Africa, which addresses HIV/AIDS in a broad context. It will support the Government in applying an
expanded response to HIV/AIDS through:

l funding projects led by civil society, including the private sector, and carried out in urban and
    rural communities, which cover HIV/AIDS related prevention, advocacy, public awareness
    creation and care for orphans and PLWHA, focusing on the most vulnerable groups;
l strengthening delivery of health services providing prevention, care and treatment services,
    giving priority to the five regions with highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. Such services

                                                                                                          ISDS


     would include voluntary testing and counseling services and treatment of STDs and
     opportunistic infections related to HIV/AIDS;
l enabling Government at the national and regional levels to carry out programs advocating
     prevention and facilitating access to care for its own staff and communities;
l strengthening institutional capacity for planning, delivering and monitoring of HIV/AIDS
     response interventions through all levels of Government and its line ministries, civil society
     and the private sector, with a focus on vulnerable groups.

The project will be implemented through three components as follows:

Part A. Community and Civil Society Initiatives, and Capacity Building
l social mobilization and community level responses to HIV/AIDS
l expanding and strengthening HIV/AIDS activities of communities NGOs, CBOs, private sector,
     religious sector, and PLWHA

Funds will be specifically set aside for two groups:
Orphans, whose numbers are increasing as the epidemic progresses. The program would target all
orphans, as differentiating orphans by causes would be difficult and inhumane.
PLWHAs, who have decreased productive capacity, which further reduces their resources. It is essential to
help families avoid the poverty trap and adjust available technologies in the agricultural and private sectors
to address this limitation and to create adapted sources of revenue.

Part B. Government Multi-sector Response
l strengthen prevention, care, support, and mitigation of the HIV/AIDS impact through public sector
     programs and activities
l support public sector institutions to protect their own personnel from the impact of HIV/AIDS and
     integrate HIV/AIDS activities into their core business.

This component will support:
The Ministry of Health ­ which will receive the largest share of funds under this component. The
ministry has a unique role in combating the epidemic, as it is often the only source of health care in rural
areas. This support will partially finance the Ministry's HIV/AIDS work plan.
All other Ministries and Government Agencies ­ ministries with advanced work plans and responsibility
for the highest priority areas (education, health, agriculture, interior and army forces, youth and sport) will
receive comprehensive support during the first year. Others will receive limited support focusing mainly on
protecting their own personnel.

Part C. Institutional Development for Program Management
The project will support the National AIDS Council (NAC) and its Executive Secretariat (NAS), including
its regional components and focal points, to fulfill its national HIV/AIDS coordination mandate. The broad
responsibilities assigned to the NAC evolve around advocacy, providing leadership for the multi-sector
response, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will cover the entire country, with a focus on geographical areas of greatest HIV prevalence, and
highly vulnerable groups to HIV/AIDS.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: The project has been classified as a B because of the potential environmental and social impacts
related to medical waste management under the project. In addition to financing the development and
implementation of health care management plan for activities related to HIV prevention and TB control, the
project will support the formulation of the national policy and guidelines of health care waste management and
assist in the preparation of legislation and to the enforcement of the legislation. In February 2002,
regulatory agencies, health care facilities, litter gatherers, and community organizations were
consulted and identified issues include: lack of appropriate selection of health care waste,
carelessness and lack of qualification of the medical staff, mingling of health care waste with normal
household litter, insufficient quantities of collection baskets and provisional litter containers, lack of
security equipment for cleaning staff, and no efficient waste treatment system. The project is
allocating US$370,000.00 for the Medical Waste Management Program (MWMP) implementation
in the five pilot regions.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The key safeguard issues relate to the management of health care waste (laboratory, chimicals supplies and

                                                        4
                                                                                                           ISDS


   obsolete medication) and its safe disposal. Issues Procedures are almost inexistent. The presence of waste
   which is potentially infected with the VIH virus increases the health risks of mismanagement, and prompts
   a renewed concern with safe management and disposal procedures. Issues have been addressed in the
   MWMP.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
None

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Currently, the environment as well as local communities are exposed to environmental and public health
risks due to haphazard disposal of health care center wastes as no appropriate procedures exits. The
implementation of training in safe disposal of hazardous waste and the strengthening of the physical
capacity of the health system to appropriately dispose of such waste in accordance with international
guidelines is expected to have a positive impact.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
The proposed MWMP is technically sound and no other financially viable alternatives exist.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
A medical waste management plan has been prepared and has been disclosed. A workshop to inform
stakeholders is planned as part of project launch activities.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Government has engaged in a wide-ranging set of consultations in preparing the National Strategy,
including with PLWHAs. This has been financially supported through the PHRD grant. In addition, UN
Agencies have supported a part of the cost of this participatory approach by financing some regional
workshops. The first year's draft work program has been elaborated at the regional levels with extensive
involvement of community representatives. Communities are already aware that they have an important
role to play in the regional planning, implementation and monitoring of activities. They also know that they
are eligible to receive grants for subprojects of their own design.

All line Ministries may access support from the project for their own HIV/AIDS programs according to
eligibility criteria.  For each ministry, a focal point has been designated who has been part of the
Government's preparation team of the project. Each focal point is responsible for developing action plans
for their respective ministry in consultation with their colleagues and is responsible for its implementation
and monitoring.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.
