    Mitigation Support Project for Guinea Bissau were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in fragile\n            and post-conflict countries, as was the case in\n            Guinea-Bissau, project objectives and design need to be as\n            simple and modest as possible. A multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS\n            project, especially in an environment of weak capacity,\n            should target sectors and population segments with the\n            largest potential impact. Although awareness raising and\n            sensitization of the population are welcome, given limited\n            resources and institutional capacity, a better strategy will\n            be to focus mitigation and communication efforts on\n            population groups that are most vulnerable and that play a\n            greater role in spreading HIV/AIDS. An adequate baseline and\n            functioning monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system are\n            essential in projects that are piloting new approaches, such\n            as the first round of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program\n            (MAP) interventions. Although development of the M&E\n            system was planned during implementation, it suffered\n            delays, remains weak and is still lacking an appropriate\n            baseline. While some of the problems were unforeseen (health\n            of the consultant, weak and delayed support from United\n            Nation (UN) partners), corrective actions and alternatives\n            need to be considered and prioritized."}, "docdt": "2009-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
