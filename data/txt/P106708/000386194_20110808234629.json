Project for Colombia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; the Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: an effective\n            operation is supported by strong analytics. A long tradition\n            of technical assistance, analysis and impact evaluations in\n            the context of ongoing Knowledge Services, policy or\n            investment operations was critical in the identification of\n            key reforms and in the design of specific elements of such\n            reforms. A long-term engagement facilitates the\n            implementation. This DPL built on a long series of financial\n            and technical services provided to Colombia in the area of\n            social protection over the past decade. A focused approach\n            serves to minimize Government transition risks. A single\n            tranche DPL in the midst of a Government transition always\n            pose challenges in the operational design. Reform is a\n            continuous process. Both the Government and the Bank team\n            were quite conscious that reform is a slow process and that\n            long term engagement yields more profound results than any\n            single operation could. A multi-sectoral operation is\n            manageable if the teams are selective in choosing a few key\n            strategies. While the operation covered many policy areas,\n            it only supported a few key actions within each of them.\n            Still, the fact that these policy areas were at different\n            stages of advance posed challenges of selecting appropriate\n            indicators to monitor. Strong coordination on the\n            Government's side is necessary when many ministries are involved."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
