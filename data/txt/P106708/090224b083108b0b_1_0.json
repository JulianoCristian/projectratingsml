There were several challenges\n            that remained in Colombia, especially in terms of the\n            limited coverage of the pension and health systems, and\n            unemployment insurance, which were available mostly to\n            formal workers. Similarly, programs aimed at fostering\n            employability, such as training, labor intermediation, and\n            other employment services, were not reaching the lower\n            segments of the population. A critical challenge was to\n            enhance the coordination between these programs.\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            supported Colombia in the implementation of the reforms. In\n            parallel to this operation, the Bank also provided\n            complementary technical assistance in the form of seminars,\n            policy notes, short technical briefs, as well as direct\n            comments and suggestions for the technical aspects of some\n            of the regulation and policy design in social protection\n            areas. Improvements in social sector management benefited\n            all citizens through more efficient and transparent central\n            administration, through better access to public service\n            delivery, and through better quality and access to public information."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T05:59:05Z"}
