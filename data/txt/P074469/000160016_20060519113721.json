Some of the measures and\n            mitigations of negative impacts are described as follows:\n            Follow best management practices to prevent accidental or\n            intended release of toxic waters, general prevention of\n            water leaks, and control of excavation levels. Employ dust\n            suppression measures, use traffic routing measures, and\n            periodically test for air pollution. Minimize waste\n            generation during construction, reuse construction waste\n            where practical, use appropriate methods for storing waste\n            materials, and dispose of waste on proper site. Limit\n            construction work to normal daylight working hours, and\n            employ noise buns or other noise suppression devices.\n            Minimize time for replacement operations, and conduct actual\n            replacement works during the night time to reduce temporary\n            problems related to water quality and interruptions. Provide\n            alternative safe access and request detours for pedestrians\n            in order to avoid accidents. Dispose of water treatment\n            sludge by proper handling, collection, and storage. Prevent\n            air pollution from chlorination facilities by implementing\n            standards for handling and periodic testing. Identify\n            cultural heritage sites and acquire permits."}, "docdt": "2005-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
