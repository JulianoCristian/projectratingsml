     Project components stipulate: 1) investments for improved\n            urban water efficiency will be economically justified at the\n            least-cost priority investment, based on an investment\n            strategy for a system improvement that lowers energy, and\n            other operating costs. Technical assistance and advisory\n            services will support, and conduct analyses for further\n            least-cost priority investments; 2) village water supply and\n            sanitation improvements, will be implemented through\n            cost-recovery procedures to cover the system's\n            operation and maintenance. It shall include training for the\n            newly formed waterworks, and for the protection of shallow\n            wells, in addition to a promotion of the national hygiene\n            and sanitation campaign, and, development of user\n            associations in rural areas; 3) institutional strengthening\n            and capacity building programs will be supported, through\n            technical assistance, and training of personnel based on a\n            needs assessment, envisaging the involvement of local\n            operators in the sector; 4) engineering and technical\n            expertise will support the planning, design, and\n            implementation of investment programs, final designs,\n            procurement, and supervision of construction investments;\n            and, 5) project management should support operating and\n            project related expenditures, such as auditing and\n            procurement procedures."}, "docdt": "2003-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
