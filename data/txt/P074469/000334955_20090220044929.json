the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) Creating client ownership at all levels of\n            Government by preparing the project in close collaboration\n            and implementation with the local stakeholders is critical.\n            2) The choice of performance indicators and the level of\n            technical, economic and financial analysis should be guided\n            by the quality of baseline data. In the particular case of\n            water supply and wastewater projects the quality of\n            production and consumption data is suspect in the absence of\n            widespread and careful metering. In the case of the\n            technical analysis such uncertainties in data argue in favor\n            of flexible and robust project designs as in rehabilitation\n            projects. 3) In order to promote sustainability and build\n            institutional capacity, the World Bank policy is that\n            project implementation units should be avoided or quickly\n            merged into the organization of the Borrower or Implementing\n            Agency in order foster sustainability and to build capacity.\n            4) The municipal water supply and sanitation utilities, the\n            apa canals, are the ultimate beneficiaries and are\n            responsible for operating the facilities financed under the\n            project. It is key for sustainability to create strong\n            client ownership in the apa canals and in the municipalities\n            of the project design and orderly project implementation.\n            Client ownership requires frequent contacts and site visits\n            from the PIU and Bank missions."}, "docdt": "2008-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
