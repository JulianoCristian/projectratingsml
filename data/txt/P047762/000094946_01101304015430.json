While the project will improve health conditions\n            due to accessible clean water decreasing the incidence of\n            waterborne diseases, will improve income due to temporary\n            employment opportunities, and will improve operational, and\n            managerial skills resulting from training provision to the\n            community, potential environmental concerns are associated\n            with construction, community activities, and water resource\n            uses. Environmental impacts, and the respective mitigating\n            measures follow. Construction, and transportation of\n            equipment will cause vegetation destruction, and soil\n            erosion, thus, the use of labor-intensive technology, and,\n            activities confined - as possible - to on-site locations\n            should reduce adversity, while vegetative propagation, and\n            tree replanting will restore land degradation. Construction\n            spoils, and waste residues will be removed, and properly\n            disposed of at selected sites. Loss of agricultural land,\n            and/or crops will be minimized as possible, through adequate\n            engineering design, and location of pipeline and\n            well/borehole sites, in addition, compensation will be\n            provided as necessary.
