The project has three main\n            components. The first is initiated in three districts and\n            gradually expands to about 12 out of Tanzania's 113\n            districts. Activities include: support for establishing and\n            strengthening the operational capacity (equipment support\n            and training) of district water and sanitation teams (DWSTs)\n            to prepare district rural water supply and sanitation\n            plkans/plans and appraise RWSS sub-projects proposed by\n            communities; support for establishing district RWSS funds to\n            finance the construction of new RWSS schemes;the\n            rehabilitation and expansion of existing systems and\n            possibly other water-related small-scale infrastructure\n            investments; and assistance to communities in properly\n            managing and operating these systems through apprpriate\n            hygiene education as well as promoting HIV/AIDS mitigation\n            and prevention activities. The second compoent provides\n            sectoral conditional grants to about 250 communities to\n            improve the water supply and sanitation services. This\n            includes the construction or rehabilitation of existing dug\n            or drilled wells, boreholes equipped with handpumps or\n            powered pumps, spring tapping, piped systems, household\n            latrines, and community sanitation facilities. The third\n            component supports the institutional strengthening and\n            development of a national RWSS program."}, "docdt": "2002-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
