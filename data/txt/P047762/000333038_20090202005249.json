AFRICA,TF027019-PHRD-RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION,TF036160-TANZANIA - WATER SUPPLY AND\n            SANITATION PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Rural Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project for Tanzania were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: community involvement in the design,\n            implementation, operation and maintenance is a key factor to\n            sustainability. Community ownership that results from\n            involvement has stopped vandalizing water schemes. It has\n            contributed to the innovation of the 'water rate'\n            that works. Before the introduction of the participatory\n            approach, where the Central government was the only agent\n            involved in the provision of water, vandalizing of water\n            schemes was common. Now with the change in the incentive\n            system, communities are stakeholders and thus contribute to\n            maintaining the assets for the benefit of the community.\n            This project underscores that sustainability is a function\n            of incentives. Efforts to raise community contributions as\n            means of ensuring 'ownership' and commitment to\n            pay for water must be strengthened in districts where\n            contribution rates are low. The challenges posed by\n            collecting contributions from very poor communities were\n            widely recognized. Such communities might need longer\n            collection periods, and allowance for partial in-kind\n            contributions. Persistence and strong information campaigns\n            are needed where the perception of water as a 'free\n            good' remains strong. Developing the local market for\n            the construction industry and spare parts is key to\n            decentralized implementation. Development of the local\n            market is key to the efficient functioning of the private\n            sector and for project sustainability of district level\n            social service delivery activities. In the construction\n            sector, proper packaging of construction activities could\n            help to capture economies of scale and progressive\n            development of the local construction industry, create the\n            pool of skills and good practices. Availability of spare\n            parts in the local market could help compress the time\n            needed for repairs, lead to operational efficiency and is a\n            key element of sustainability of the schemes that involve\n            water pumps."}, "docdt": "2008-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
