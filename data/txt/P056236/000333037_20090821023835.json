were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: by several measures, HEEP has\n            achieved, and in some instances surpassed, its expected\n            outputs. It is unclear, however, to what extent the higher\n            education system in Egypt is prepared for quality and\n            efficiency improvement. The participative and\n            'pedagogical' approach based on institutional self\n            assessment, peer reviews and the development of strategic\n            plan has ensured ownership and strong commitment from\n            academic staff. To be sustained this commitment needs to be\n            supported by appropriate funding. Whenever the nature of the\n            activities planned in the project require the recruitment of\n            large numbers of academic staff, the procedures and\n            conditions for hiring such staff should be agreed upon\n            during the project preparation and disclosed in the project\n            documents. The financial management manual and the project\n            accounting and financial reporting system need to be ready\n            at the early stages of the project. This will ensure\n            fiduciary compliance of project payments and avoid mistakes\n            that may jeopardize project achievements."}, "docdt": "2009-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
