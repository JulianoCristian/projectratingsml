                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This comparative review consolidates findings and lessons from a recent set of project
performance assessment reports (PPARs) on higher education reform in the Middle East and
North Africa (MNA). The PPARs covered Bank-supported projects in three MNA countries,
Egypt, Jordan and Yemen, which ran almost simultaneously during the first decade of the
21st Century. At that time, the three countries were facing similar problems of explosive
growth in university student numbers accompanied by declines in program quality and high
levels of graduate unemployment, attributed to the mismatch between the programs offered
and attended and the needs of the labor market.

While confronting the same challenges that all nations with rapidly growing higher
education populations must face, MNA nations operate within particular social and historical
contexts that shape the extent to (and ways in) which they can apply widely accepted higher
education reform models. A comparative analysis of the respective problems and attempted
solutions was expected to generate more meaningful conclusions and lessons than simply
compiling those from individual projects. These, in turn, will feed a significant set of new
insights into a planned IEG review of post-basic education.

The three projects that are the focus of this comparative PPAR are: Jordan – Higher
Education Development Project (Total Cost US$65.8 million, approved February 2000 and
closed June 2007); Egypt – Higher Education Enhancement Project (Total Cost US$60
million, approved April 2002 and closed December 2008); and Yemen – Higher Education
Learning and Innovation Project (Total Cost US$5.3 million, approved June 2002 and
closed June 2008).

The stand-alone country PPARs were conducted in late 2010 and early 2011. That for
Jordan is presented in full in a separate PPAR document reviewing both the Higher
Education Development Project and an Education Reform for Knowledge Economy Project.
Its section on higher education is summarized here in Annex C. The country PPARs for the
Egyptian and Yemeni projects are presented in full in this document as Annexes A and B.

Each PPAR was prepared by IEG based on the Implementation Completion Reports,
Staff Appraisal Reports, Loan/Credit Agreements, a review of Bank files, and relevant
research and government documents. Also an IEG mission headed by Maurice Boissiere
visited Jordan in October 2010, and another led by H. Dean Nielsen went to Egypt/Yemen
in November – December 2010, during which interviews were held with government and
implementing agency stakeholders, local staff, direct beneficiaries, and other donors, and
visits made to ministry offices plus universities and middle-level technical education
institutions (public and private). The cooperation and assistance of all the stakeholders is
gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, a draft of the main report and the respective PPARs
were sent to each Borrower for comments before being finalized. No comments were
received.

Summary
Main Issues in Higher Education in the three Countries

Higher education reform efforts at the turn of the century in Egypt, Jordan and Yemen were
spurred by similar urgent issues, as follows:

Rapid growth and strained budgets. Over the 1990s university enrollments expanded very
rapidly in the three countries (17 percent per year in Egypt, 19 percent in Jordan and an
explosive 43 percent in Yemen) far above the average 3 percent population growth rate in
the region. In all three expansion outstripped funding capacity of the state.

Lack of diversity in funding and inefficient use of funds. Through the 1990s the state was
just about the only source of funding of higher education in the region, except in the case of
Jordan which had embraced cost recovery. Figures on cost per student showed a holding
pattern in Jordan and some increase in Egypt and Yemen, but only in Egypt was this
considered to be a sign of inefficiency. In both Egypt and Jordan overstaffing in public
universities with non-teaching functionaries was a chronic problem.

Low quality. There had been no formal, institutional assessments of higher education student
achievement at the turn of the century, but high student-staff ratios revealed poor conditions
for quality teaching/learning: Jordan 27:1 Egypt 29:1 and Yemen, 41:1 (23:1 was the MNA
norm). Qualitative indicators also showed weakness in instruction and poor use of IT.
Employers and students alike were displeased with the quality and outcomes of education
provided, but there was little hard evidence: neither the institutions themselves nor any
oversight body had systematically evaluated student learning outcomes nor, as of the
launching of these projects, had any plans to do so in the future.

Weak middle-level technical education (TE). Community College enrollments in Jordan
declined by around 40 percent in the 90s and in Egyptian Technical College enrollment
growth was flat in the early 2000s; in Yemen, enrollments were growing but still accounted
for only about 5 percent of the higher education population. Post-secondary TE was seen as
out of touch with local economies, overly theoretical and outdated. TE Graduates suffered
higher unemployment rates than any other category.

Low relevance to country needs and conditions. University education was also out of touch
with the needs of increasingly globalized economies: above 75 percent of students in Egypt
and Yemen; 60 percent in Jordan were enrolled in the social sciences and humanities.
Graduate unemployment was high and growing: 17 percent in Jordan, and around 10
percent in Egypt and Yemen.

Out-dated systems of institutional development and governance. Jordan’s governance
system lacked system-wide coordinating and planning mechanisms, Egypt’s was overly
centralized, and Yemen’s was so recently established that it had not yet developed basic
capacities for system/financial management and planning.

Bank Support for Higher Education Reform and the MNA Projects

Since early 1990s the World Bank had been assembling analyses and case studies on higher
education reform in the developing world. In 1994 it produced a “Lessons of Experience”
Paper on the subject and in 2002 “Constructing Knowledge Societies: New Challenges for
Tertiary Education.” MNA countries became interested in these reform processes, with
Jordan, Egypt and Yemen building them into new projects in various ways. The Bank
supported higher education reform model covered such features as: university autonomy
with accountability; quality assurance (QA) and accreditation; transparent financing and use
of funding formulas; increased use of information communication technology (ICT);
competitively allocated grants; diversified financing and cost recovery; and overall system
coordination and oversight.

The three higher education reform projects that appeared in 2000 or just after had the
following objectives:
      Jordan: Initiate improvements in the quality, relevance and efficiency of higher
         education in the country and support the Government’s program to reform sector
         governance;
      Egypt: Create conditions fundamental to improving the quality and efficiency of
         the higher education system through legislative reform, institutional restructuring,
         and establishment of independent quality assurance mechanisms and monitoring
         systems;
      Yemen. Assist the Borrower in preparing and carrying out a higher education
         reform strategy, and developing the capacity of the Ministry of Higher Education
         and Scientific Research to carry out major reforms aimed at the strengthening of
         post-secondary education. 1

In all three countries, system reform thus aimed to improve higher education quality,
efficiency and relevance, and the Bank-endorsed higher education reform model stood in the
background of these reform efforts. In fact, components in the three projects included
almost all of the reform model features.

Comparative Analysis: Main Findings

This comparative analysis addresses questions concerning: the implementation of the reform
model; effectiveness in improving quality, relevance (including labor market relevance), and
efficiency; and effectiveness in supporting improved higher education governance.


Implementing the Bank-Promoted Higher Education Reform Model
There were no features from the reform model which were both incorporated into the higher
education reform projects and fully implemented in all three countries. However five
features were adopted and relatively well implemented in Egypt and Jordan: quality
assurance; competition for research/development funds; increased use of ICT; differentiated

missions (less well implemented in Jordan); and overall system coordination (less well
implemented in Jordan). None of the features incorporated in Yemen’s Higher Education
Project (HEP) were well or fully implemented, but, ironically, there were some parts of the
model not included in HEP that were successfully instituted in the country during the project
period (competition for funds; differentiated missions; cost recovery). The weakest buy-in
and implementation record were in features related to higher education finance (diversity,
cost recovery, and formula funding), the latter bought into by all three countries but not
implemented. Also, university autonomy did not get off the ground in the two buy-in
countries, Egypt and Yemen.

Project Effects on Higher Education Quality and Relevance
The three projects were most focused and successful at creating inputs or immediate
conditions (drawing from the higher education reform model) for improved quality:
improved IT infrastructure and its use in teaching, learning and research; staff upgrading
and in-service training; competitive grants to stimulate program innovation and renewal
efforts, and quality assurance and accreditation systems. In Egypt these systems were
operating quite effectively; in Jordan somewhat less so; and in Yemen with first steps.
However, in none of the three was there any evidence that these inputs have made a
difference in terms of student outcomes (improved learning and/or better preparation for the
labor market), given that such outcomes were neither measured in any of the projects nor
even by the countries’ higher education systems.

With regards to student-staff ratio (in which increases show worse conditions), all countries
showed poor or deteriorating conditions for effective learning. On the specified
intermediate outcomes in Jordan and Egypt, improved instruction and increased student
satisfaction, the results were negative on the first and inconclusive on the second for Jordan,
and inconclusive on both for Egypt.

Relevance was generally conceptualized as bringing higher education into better alignment
with economic and social needs of the country. The project’s emphasis for improving
relevance was on upgrading inputs or conditions. Strategies for this were updating curricula
and teaching styles (in line with international norms), getting both instructors and students
connected to the vast resources of the worldwide web, creating programs with direct
connection to labor force needs, and involving private sector managers in decision making,
and these were generally delivered as planned, particularly in Egypt and Jordan

There were few measures of higher education relevance as an outcome. It was possible,
with data external to the projects, to assess an outcome that background documents showed
widespread concern about: improved balance between theoretical (social sciences and
humanities) and applied fields (medicine, engineering and agriculture). Findings showed a
reduction in social sciences/humanities enrollments over project years from 60 to 56 percent
in Jordan and 76 to 66 in Yemen, but essentially no change in Egypt (79 to 78), levels still
well above those in other regions. With regards to employers’ satisfaction with technical
college graduates in Jordan, the results were not encouraging: trainees were found to lack
technical skills and their training was deemed overly theoretical.

Connection to the Labor Market
There were some positive project outputs in this area. Jordan and Egypt used competitive
grants and Technical College/Community College (TC/CC) reform programs to create or
restructure programs to be more relevant -- in their curricula and processes -- to labor force
needs. Although only indirectly supported by the project, Yemen built three world-class
graduate studies programs that were well connected to high level employment.

Data external to the projects painted a grim picture of the recent labor market success of
university graduates during project years. In Jordan the rate stayed at a high 17 percent and
in Egypt and Yemen in increased 3 and 5 fold, respectively. The huge spikes in
unemployment in both Egypt and Yemen came at the time that when the enormous late-
1990s surge of enrollees were coming into the labor market, and at the same time civil
service jobs were being eliminated and private sector job creation was stagnating.

Contribution to Higher Education Efficiency
Governments did plan to establish conditions for improved efficiency (many consistent with
the Bank-supported reform model), such as more decentralized decision making; improved
use of ICT for management and decision making; more cost recovery; self-generation of
revenue; and use of distance education (e-learning). Success in implanting these was
uneven: on the effective side were e-learning in Egypt and cost recovery in Yemen; on the
less effective: decentralized decision making in Egypt and use of MIS for management in
Jordan.

However, there were almost no outcome indicators to show whether these were leading to
more efficiency; not even any helpful operational definitions. One Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG)-constructed variable was cost per student, on which results were equivocal:
increasing steeply in Egypt and Yemen (but only in Egypt considered a sign of worsening
efficiency) and diminishing modestly in Jordan. Two other outcome indicators, one tracked
and the other not, did send a clear message of poor system efficiency: continued
overstaffing with non-teaching employees in Jordan and Egypt, and high student dropout
and repetition rates in Egypt and Yemen.

Effectiveness in Supporting Improved Governance
In the end, project supported changes in governance in the three projects did not bear much
fruit: Jordan’s higher education system never came around to acting like a coherent system;
Egypt’s main governance reform instrument became stalled in Parliament, and Yemen’s
piloting of management reforms never took place. What did occur was the building of some
systems that can contribute to better governance: improved ICT in all countries, some
improvement in the creation and use of Management Information System (MIS), the
acceptance of and some experience with competitive funding and quality assurance. The
main message is that it takes a long time, often longer than a single project (based on the
experience of these loans/credits) and some deep understanding (for example, through
thorough sector analytical work) by all parties for such inputs to be transformed into real
and significant governance reforms.

Bank Performance
Higher education reform was a relatively new undertaking, both in the World Bank and the
three countries. The Bank brought its best expertise at the time. The project preparation
activities in the three countries were constrained by three main shortcomings: a) failure to
assure country/institutional buy-in to the reform agenda and to identify reform champions
in charge of the project (Jordan), b) weakness in analytical depth related to the most
complicated reform components, such as formula funding and increased university
autonomy and less than a clear understanding of the problems and complexities residing
there (Egypt and Yemen), and c) shortcomings the results framework and laying out a solid
monitoring and evaluation agenda.

The quality of supervision varied widely. In Jordan it was quite conscientious and attentive,
in Egypt less so, and in Yemen, considerably less so. In all locations episodic project
supervision missions tended to rate fulfillment of all objectives as satisfactory, thus failing
to alert management that parts of the reform agenda were not progressing well (hence some
surprises when Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) were completed).
Supervision in Jordan was attentive to smooth procurement, disbursement processes and
technical assistance to project managers. In Egypt complications arose because the Bank did
not fully reconcile the government’s implementation structure with that in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD). In Yemen Bank task management changed four times, and
early on supported the merging of HEP with other projects without restructuring, which led
to a deviation from its original goals and strategies.

Conclusions
The three MNA higher education projects were launched under similar circumstances that
called for increased attention to higher education relevance, quality, and efficiency.
Each of these goals was conceptualized somewhat differently across projects, but all had
one feature in common: in none was there a clear elaboration of expected results or
outcomes. With few exceptions project indicators were conceived of inputs, processes or
outputs. Thus, it is not possible to clearly answer whether the three projects made any
substantial difference in higher education relevance, quality or efficiency. This is not to say
that they accomplished nothing: many new services and systems were delivered and
substantial changes were made in all three countries.

Certain parts of the Bank-supported higher education reform model flourished in the three
countries. Competitively awarded grants motivated departments and staff members to come
up with innovative programs, many connected to the labor market or addressing a national
development issue. The seeds of quality assurance and accreditation have also been sown
and are growing. ICT availability and usefulness have been accelerated, not yet for fully
operational and digitized management information systems, but at least for improved
internet connectivity, changes in instructional methods, and e-learning experiments.

Some problems remain. There are still vastly more students in the arts, humanities and
social sciences than in scientific and applied fields. Despite efforts to attract secondary
school graduates into middle-level technical education (by renewing courses and forging
ties with industry), students still tend to shy away from it. Moreover, even with significant
attempts to improve course structure and provide in-service staff training, there appears (at
                                               xiv

least in the one study of improved pedagogy - in Jordan) that not much has changed.
Finally, it is not clear whether graduates are prepared for the work place: a study in Jordan
shows employers have not changed in their dissatisfaction with technical college graduates.
Some of these weaknesses might be explained by the widespread low attention to incentive
and accountability structures (see World Bank MNA study “The Road not Travelled”). That
is, academic or technical programs can be modernized but students must be motivated to
enter them; graduates may not be able to find employment, but they won’t have lost
anything since tuition is free and, as in Egypt, so is room and board; and instructors can
create attractive new syllabi but there will be no consequence if they don’t show up to teach
them. It seems that all projects, designed to provide the conditions for higher education
reform, still have missed some crucial ones.

The efforts to reform (or pilot new forms of) university governance were stillborn in all
three countries. Funding formulas were drafted but were not used; decentralization and
university self-management of budgets failed to get off the ground in Egypt and Yemen. In
Jordan, the efforts expected to improve the coherence of the system did not bear fruit. It
seems that university governance is the most complex and change-resistant part of the
accepted reform model. Some evidence from the PPAR mission suggests that this might be
mostly a matter of unanticipated complexity or an underestimate of the implications of
intended changes. Dealing with such complexity can be a matter of better research and
analysis, or simply a matter of more time to work through it all. Or, it could be that this part
the model is too biased towards Western industrialized cultures and economies (the Bank’s
“Lessons from Experience” was originally drawn up in the Anglo-American context). This
part of the world may call for governance models more consistent with the culture and/or
more centralized governance traditions. This is an area for continued analysis and dialogue.

Lessons Learned

      The introduction of a widely adopted change model needs to be preceded by
       sufficient sector analytic work to create an appreciation of the complexities
       (implications) of the proposed changes and of the likely sources of resistance. Such
       analysis could help determine the parts of the model that are appropriate to the
       context, and the pace of adoption;

      Efforts to improve the quality of higher education need to improve student learning
       outcomes. Standard assessment of student achievement in higher education is
       challenging, both in a technical and a political sense. Moves in that direction have
       already begun in Egypt and Jordan;

      Restructuring higher education courses and programs and ensuring appropriate
       private sector participation in decision-making are not in themselves sufficient to
       ensure that reforms will result in more employable graduates. Higher education
       systems need to systematically monitor the labor market relevance of their offerings
       and the success of their graduates;

      Free university education in Yemen and Egypt (including generous room and board
       subsidies) creates the wrong market signals, encouraging enrollment in overloaded
                                          xv

    fields since failure to obtain employment represents little financial loss to students
    and their families;

   Desired change in higher education outcomes may not happen unless these are
    accompanied by appropriate incentives and accountability structures;

   Competitive systems for awarding grants can lead to some creative new and revised
    programs, but this needs to be done in conjunction with other university change
    efforts and on a large enough scale to have a significant effect on the quality and
    relevance of the university’s offerings;

   Graduate unemployment, which did not decline under the projects as hoped, will not
    change appreciably with the introduction of a few innovative programs (the main
    approach used in the project), but requires serious gate keeping by the governments
    (Numerus Clausus), shifting enrollments away from humanities (as in Yemen) and
    more serious incentive structures to study needed fields.

   The lack of programs for tracking and awareness-raising about graduate
    unemployment rates makes this problem less visible than it should be.

1. Introduction
1.1     The opportunity to conduct a comparative review of higher education reform
presented itself with the near simultaneous completion of similar higher education reform
projects in three MNA countries, Jordan, Egypt and Yemen. Promoting these reform efforts
in the region at the turn of the century was an extension of other programs supported by the
Bank in various parts of the world, prompted by its 1994 report on higher education (“The
Lessons of Experience”). The 1994 report was followed by a string of higher education
analyses and papers—for example, a higher education study with UNESCO (1999), and the
Bank’s own Tertiary Education Policy Paper (2002) – and reform projects in Latin America,
Asia, and Eastern Europe. The three projects in MNA were the first ones supported by the
Bank in the region.

Internal Issues in Higher Education
1.2     The following is a summary of issues that have prompted higher education managers
in the MNA region to seek World Bank funds for higher education reform.

1.3     Rapid growth and strained budgets. Over the 1990s university enrollments
expanded rapidly in all three countries: by about 17 percent per year in Egypt, 19 percent in
Jordan, and an explosive 43 percent in Yemen (see government figures reported in the
respective Project Appraisal Documents), far above the roughly 3 percent average
population growth rate in the region. The higher education gross enrollment rate, which
controls for population growth by comparing enrollments to age-group numbers, also
increased rapidly in the countries over 1991 to 2003 (see Figure 1-1) – in Egypt and Yemen
by more than double, and in Jordan by more than 40 percent. In all three countries the
expansion outstripped the funding capacity of the state: in Egypt higher education
expenditures as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP) declined during the early project
period; in Yemen annual government expenditure increases (13 percent, on average) were
modest compared to enrollment growth; and in Jordan, by 2000 the government had begun a
process to reduce the government’s subsidy of public higher education – ultimately from 50
to 20 percent, with the difference being taken up, but not fully, by university revenues from
student fees and other sources.2

1.4      Lack of diversity in funding sources and inefficient use of funds. Since the three
countries have been unable to expand central government funding for higher education as
fast as its student growth rate, and since government budgets, at least in Egypt and Yemen,
were almost the only source of funds, there was much discussion during the years preceding
the projects of “funding diversification” and more efficient use of resources, consistent with
practices in other countries.3 Cost recovery in public universities was a legal option only in

 Egypt’s higher education Expenditure as a percent of GDP went from 1.43 percent in 2002 to 1.26 percent in
2005 (Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education (2007), Master Plan for Higher Education in Egypt (2007-
2022); in Yemen, recurrent government expenditure on higher education increased from YR9.1 to 15.1 million
over 1997 to 2001 (Government of Yemen/World Bank (2010), Education Status Report: Challenges and
Opportunities); the data from Jordan were government sources, reported in the World Bank (2007),

Jordan (where it now accounts for over half of university budgets), but in the other two
countries it was banned by law. Nevertheless, in Egypt and Yemen, private higher
education, which was fee charging, was beginning its rapid growth, 4 and alternative
(“parallel”) programs were under consideration.5 Other diversity options being implemented
or consideration were channeling a higher proportion of secondary school graduates to
short cycle (2-3 year) middle level technical or community college courses (see Middle
Level Technical Education below), allowing departments and programs to earn money from
services, and promoting forms of distance education or e-learning (seriously pursued only
in Egypt).

1.5      Costs per student, at least in Egypt and Yemen, were showing an upward trend in the
early years of the 21st Century (Figure 1-2), viewed by the Egyptian Ministry of Higher
Education as indicating falling efficiency (GOE, 2007). This was less clear in Yemen, since
its per capacity costs had been far below regional norms.6 The internal efficiency indicators
of student dropout and repetition also revealed low efficiency. For Egypt (OECD/World
Bank, 2010) repetition7 during the 2000s was reported to be around 10 percent per year (18
in the social sciences) and dropout around 9. Graduation rates were estimated to average

 The share of Egyptian university students enrolled in private universities and institutes in 2002/03was about
28 percent of the total; whereas in Yemen that year it was just 5 percent. In Jordan private universities
enrolled one third of higher education students in 1999.

 The World Bank showed that in four of the five MNA countries for which data were available for the year
2000 governments spent 5 to 10 times as much for university students than for primary students, whereas in
Yemen the ratio in 2002 was only 2 to 1 (World Bank (2008), The Road not Traveled: Education Reform in
MENA).

    Neither Egypt nor Yemen had credit hour systems so failing student were required to repeat an entire year.

around 75 percent in 2005/06, but the largest public universities were far below that (Cairo,
50 percent and Alexandria 69). In Yemen, student repetition at mid-decade were around 26
percent in the social sciences/humanities and around 16 percent in the applied sciences
(World Bank (2010), Yemen: Education Status Report). Finally, managerial efficiency was
an issue across the region. In both Egypt and Jordan, according to project PADs,
overstaffing in public universities with non-teaching functionaries was problematic: Egypt’s
ratio of non-teaching to teaching staff was in 2002 1.25 to 1; whereas in Jordan around the
same time it was an astonishing 2.7 to 1 (see Project PADs).

1.6     Low Quality. Increasing student to staff ratios at the turn of the century were a
significant threat to educational quality. In the early years of the new decade Jordan’s
growing student numbers and shrinking national government subsidies (see above) started a
trend of increasing student to staff ratios, moving from the MNA norm of 23 in 2000 to 27
by 2002/038. In Egypt, this ratio averaged around 29 in 2002/03, a figure that obscures wide
variations across fields of study (medicine: below 10 and the fields having the highest
enrollments (law and commerce): above 100).9 In Yemen the figure peaked at around 41,
far above regional norms, in the early 2000s.10

 Regional and international norms (averages) were revealed in UNESCO Institute of Statistics’ (UIS) Global
Education Digest, 2007. The figures for Jordan were drawn from the HEDP Project Appraisal Document
(2000) and the Global Education Digest (2005) for 2002/03.

1.7     More qualitative indicators in the early 2000s in all countries pointed to the
dominance of the traditional lecture approach to pedagogy (accompanied by lecture notes --
a study in Egypt showed that a typical undergraduate checks out one library book per
year);11 little use of information and communication technology; frequent absence of the
senior instructor (in Egypt reportedly 75 percent in Medicine and Engineering); an emphasis
on rote memorization (as opposed to higher order thinking); and little access to up-to-date
laboratory/ICT equipment. Employers and students alike were displeased with the quality
and outcomes of education provided. However, little hard evidence was available for
assessing overall quality: neither the institutions themselves nor any oversight body had
systematically evaluated student learning outcomes nor, as of the launching of these, had
any plans to do so in the future12.

1.8     Weak Middle-level technical education. In a region where the need for middle level
technical skills was growing and where 4-year university education was increasing difficult
to finance, middle-level technical education had become a favored growth sector for MNA
governments. Still community college enrollments in Jordan declined by around 40 percent
in the 90s and in Egyptian Technical College enrollment growth was flat in the early 2000s.
In Yemen, community college enrollments increased early in the 21st century, since such
colleges were only established in the late 90s, but by 2007/08 they accounted for only about
5 percent of the higher education population. Across the three countries post-secondary
technical education suffered from a reputation for being out of touch with the local
economy, overly theoretical and outdated, under-resourced with labs and equipment, taught
by those having little practical work experience, and poorly linked to industry and
commerce. Graduates from post-secondary TE institutions have generally suffered higher
rates of unemployment than other tertiary education graduates.13

1.9      Low relevance to country needs and conditions. In the three countries higher
education reformers took issue with higher education relevance along three lines: a) its
relationship to the conditions and needs of the country; b) its connection to advances and
developments in the various fields of study; and c) its relevance to labor market demands.
In all three countries reviews have generally characterized undergraduate education
offerings as narrow, rigid, and outdated, emphasizing theory over practical and “soft” skills,
such as critical thinking and problem solving, even in “applied” fields such as teaching and
engineering.14 This was also the case with university-based research, which again
emphasized theory and was poorly connected to the practical needs of the country, the
governments having little institutional capacity to reward useful research or guide
researchers towards needed inquiry.

countries.

   As of 2002 in Egypt some 60 percent of recent mid-level technical institute graduates were unemployed
even 2 years after completing their programs (World Bank, 2002, PAD: Egypt Higher Education Enhancement
Project).
14
   For example, in the PAD for Jordan’s HEDP (World Bank 2000) it states: “Undergraduate teaching over-
emphasizes theory, and curricula and programs of study are irrelevant to broader economic needs” (p. 3).

1.10 Relevance to the needs of the country can be seen by fields of study chosen by
students. Whereas in the late nineties/early 2000s increased globalization was creating a
growing demand for competitive knowledge and skills in the scientific and technological
fields, students in the region were still overwhelmingly choosing to study social science and
humanities; see Figure 1-3 which shows more than 75 percent of students in Egypt and
Yemen enrolled in those fields and 60 percent in Jordan. In contrast, most Latin American
countries are below these levels, and in China and Korea the proportions were 32 and 44
percent, respectively (2008, The Road Not Traveled).).

1.11 Outdated systems of institutional development and governance. Rapid growth and
an expectation for system-wide change presuppose a capacity for strategic planning and
institutional restructuring, but in all countries this capacity has been inadequate. In Jordan,
at the turn of the century, the collective of semi-autonomous universities had not yet become
a coordinated system of higher education, having no effective policy making bodies, and
little capacity or authority to undertake strategic planning, quality assurance, substantive
guidance, and institutional oversight (until recently there wasn’t even a central repository of
management information). The opposite was the case in Egypt, where a controlling,
centralized higher education system allowed universities very few decision-making options
on student intake, personnel and financial management, and rewarding good performance.
In Yemen, given the relatively recent establishment of public higher education, the system
had not yet had sufficient time to develop capacities for institutional and financial
management. System oversight was recently (2001) shifted from a weak Universities
Council to a Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research but that body had
relatively little experience with strategic planning and institutional governance prior to the
BEP. Public institutions still were receiving their funding from the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) without any obligation to respect agreed program objectives, instructional standards,
or the need for audits. In all three countries, finances were allocated to universities through
closed negotiations instead of through objective and transparent processes.

External Issues in Higher Education: Graduate Employment, Knowledge
Economy, Community Service, and Research
1.12 The Road not Traveled (2008) presented a careful regional analysis of the
relationship between education, the labor market, and economic growth during the late 20th
and early 21st Centuries. Economic growth in MNA countries during that time was fairly
anemic, well below that in East Asia Pacific, South Asia, and even parts of sub-Saharan
Africa. Given MNA’s demographics, characterized by a young and rapidly growing labor
force, this relatively slow growth has translated into labor market imbalances and high
unemployment. This imbalance was especially striking in post-basic education, where
secondary and higher education graduates had difficulties in the labor market. For example,
in Jordan unemployment of university graduates reached 17 percent in 1994/94, and in
Egypt and Yemen it hovered around 10 percent at the turn of the century, before the big
bulge of graduates entered the labor market.15 Despite the progress made over the previous
decade in providing more education access at all levels and towards Education for All goals,
the new skills demanded in the labor market as a result of the global knowledge economy
have not been provided sufficiently by the MNA education systems, and the higher
education subsector in particular, adding a structural dimension to unemployment in
addition to that of slow economic growth. Recent higher education subsector projects in
MNA have all attempted to address various dimensions of this challenge.

1.13 Each element of this triad of factors (higher education, the labor market and
economic growth) needs to be examined in light of the MNA regional context. Table 1-1
below gives a rough indication of the relationship between economic expansion and labor
market growth in MNA compared to East Asia. Comparing East Asia and MNA annual
growth rates in GDP over 1980-2002, it can be seen that East Asia has not only grown much
faster than MNA in GDP terms (7.4 percent annually versus 2.4 percent annually for MNA
in the same period), but that difference between GDP and labor market growth rates is much
larger in East Asia than in MNA, suggestion a stronger absorptive capacity for labor in the
former region. As seen in Table 1-1, the three PPAR countries are above the MNA average
in both GDP growth and Labor Force Growth, but the difference between GDP and labor
market growth for them is still smaller than in East Asia, especially in Jordan, where it is
negative. Although much more detailed labor market analysis would be needed, this crude
indicator gives a rough approximation as to why MNA has such a serious unemployment
problem compared to East Asia.

1.14 While this may be considered external to the higher education subsector, both
education and economic policy makers at the highest level need to collaborate in addressing
the economic growth-labor market-higher education interfaces. The report of the Bank’s
Growth Commission (2008) gives some generic guidance for policies to promote growth
and employment based upon those countries that have done best over the past 50 years.16
Jordan has come closest to such an economy wide approach in its National Agenda exercise
led by HM King Abdallah, while Egypt has recently initiated efforts to better link higher
education and TVET to the labor market.17 Yemen underwent some strong growth in the
1990s but in more recent years has stagnated and its production of new jobs, especially
those requiring high skill levels, has been sluggish.

1.15 An important feature of the MNA labor market has been migration across countries,
especially from the non-oil countries to the oil-producing ones. This has had a special
impact upon higher education in countries such as Egypt, Jordan and Yemen, which have
been sending graduates to work in the oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries
for many years. In addition to taking some of the pressure off the domestic labor markets,
job opportunities in the GCC countries have also provided critical remittances to the
families of workers back home. Now many of those countries have established their own
competitive higher education systems, so there is less need for Arabic speaking graduates
from non-oil countries, except in certain employment niches. Nonetheless, regional aspects
of the MNA labor marker remain important.

1.16 The higher education-Labor Market interface needs to be addressed across different
disciplines and sectors, cognizant of the growing world-wide attention to growth of the
Knowledge Economy, or more precisely a “knowledge-driven economy.” As in other
regions, the number of projects in MNA with Knowledge Economy components has
increased dramatically over the past decade. This has required reforms in the organization

Bank Support for Higher Education Reform and the MNA Projects
1.17 Recognizing the need for higher education reform in the MNA region and around the
world, the Bank, in the mid-1990a, initiated a series of steps that would culminate in a
program of Bank support to higher education reform in various parts of the developing
world. The first of the steps was the release, in 1994, of a policy paper on higher education
that identified a package of reform elements that came to be regarded as the Bank-advocated
higher education reform model. The elements of this model, initially identified in Europe
and the US and then spread to reform movements in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin
America, include a) university autonomy with accountability; b) quality assurance and
accreditation; c) transparent financing (formula funding based on student numbers and
characteristics) usually under a finance council; d) competition for research and investment
funding usually under a research council; e) increased use of ICT for teaching/learning and
management; f) differentiated missions among colleges (short-cycle labor market) and
universities (long cycle and research programs); g) diversified finance including some
public subsidy, h) cost recovery via tuition with equity safeguards through student loans and
scholarships; and i) overall system coordination and oversight via some sort of higher
education council cum ministry. This “reform package” was refined further in the Bank’s
“Constructing Knowledge Societies: New Challenges for Tertiary Education (2002).”

1.18 Adapting this model to the Jordanian situation began with a Bank executed “Higher
Education Development Study” (1996), which was followed in 1997 by a Project Concept
Document for a higher education reform project. This was in turn followed by an
impressive series 15 project preparation studies conducted by international and local
consultants funded by a PRHD grant, which became the basis for the Higher Education
Development Project, which was launched in the year 2000.

1.19 In Egypt, Bank dialogue with and support to the government in the late 1990s
focused on the government’s 20 year (1999-2019) education sector strategic framework,
covering reforms to basic, secondary and tertiary education, leading to joint preparation of
sector loans for “education enhancement” projects at all three levels. Consistent with its
recently articulated model, the Bank supported higher education reforms in governance,
financing, efficiency, quality, and quality assurance, that were initially articulated at a
National Conference on Higher Education (2000) and in its consequent 25-point Declaration
for Action. The Higher Education Enhancement Project of 2002 covered 11 of these
original 25 points of action.

affects a country’s entire education system.” (World Bank Web Page).

1.20 In Yemen, the country’s higher education reform agenda was not as clearly
articulated as in the other countries; indeed, the main objective of Bank support in that
country was the preparation of a new higher education reform strategy. Preparation for that
(as noted in the eventual Project Appraisal Document) included reference to Bank-supported
higher education reform programs in Asian, Latin American, and African countries,
indicating possible reform directions. In these, a common thread was shifting university
management away from the central government and empowering universities to manage
their own programs and budgets under the direction of -- and with accountability to -- the
government ministry. As the Yemeni reform agenda took shape during its Higher Education
Learning and Innovation Project, a substantial buy-in to the Bank advocated reform model
became clear.

1.21 As is clear from the above, the Bank supported higher education reform projects in
Jordan, Egypt and Yemen incorporated many elements of the Bank-advocated reform
model. Table 1-2 lists the reform model elements and then lists if and how those appear in
the three reform projects.

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES (PDO) AND DESIGN FEATURES

1.22 Box 1 shows the reform projects and their development objectives. All three projects
aspired to strengthen/improve higher (post-secondary) education. Both the Egyptian and
Jordanian projects were more specific than that, setting out objectives of improving or
“creating conditions for improving” (Egypt) higher education quality, efficiency and
relevance (Egypt clearly aimed to cover the latter even though it was not in the project
objective statement).19 In Yemen, the areas of higher education strengthening were not
specified, but in strategic documents prepared during the project, it became clear that
quality, efficiency and relevance were also important to the Yemeni higher education
community (see Republic of Yemen (2006): National Strategy for the Development of
Higher Education). The objective statements also provided an indication of the reform
strategies to be used for high education strengthening in each country, which include in


19
     In HEEP, improving “quality and relevance” was in two of three project component statements.
                                                     11

Egypt legislative reform, institutional restructuring and improved accountability systems
(QA and monitoring); in Jordan the “reform of sector governance;” and in Yemen, a
national higher education reform strategy. System reform was thus the way to improve
higher education quality, efficiency and relevance, and the Bank-endorsed higher education
reform strategy stood in the background of these reform efforts.

Box 1. Higher Education Reform Projects and their Objectives
Egypt: Higher Education Enhancement Project (2002-2008). Total cost USS60 million.
Objective: Create conditions fundamental to improving the quality and efficiency of the higher
education system through legislative reform, institutional restructuring, and establishment of
independent quality assurance mechanisms and monitoring systems.
Jordan: Higher Education Development Project (2000-2007). Total cost US$65.8 million.
Objective: Initiate improvements in the quality, relevance and efficiency of higher education in
Jordan and support the Government’s program to reform sector governance.
Yemen: Higher Ed Learning & Innovation Project (2002-2008). Total cost US$5.3 million.
Objective: Assist the Borrower in preparing and carrying out a higher education reform strategy,
and developing the capacity of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research to carry out
major reforms aimed at the strengthening of post-secondary education. 20

2. Was the Bank’s Support for Higher Education Reform
Relevant?
2.1     In this review project relevance will be examined from two points of view: 1) Were
the projects and their objectives relevant to country needs? 2) Was the higher education
reform model adopted (and adapted) relevant to country conditions and context in the three
countries?

Relevance to Country Needs
2.2     The relevance of the projects and their objectives was substantial in Jordan and
Egypt and modest in Yemen. In the former two high priority was given to promoting
knowledge-based private investment and to matching that priority with a higher quality
higher education system, capable of equipping graduates with the knowledge and skills that
will make them employable and improve the competitiveness of local industry, but, given
constraints to higher education financing, undertaken in a way that was more cost-effective
than before. Thus, the objectives of improving quality, relevance and efficiency (Jordan) or
for establishing fundamental conditions for the same (Egypt) were highly appropriate at that
time. In Yemen, the higher education system has a similar mandate to supply the higher
knowledge and skills needed for national development and national competitiveness, but the


20
  “Carrying out” is interpreted in this review as implementing reforms in pilot locations for the sake of
learning, consistent with the LIC instrument and the vision in the PAD.
                                              12

higher education system (with its Ministry created only a year prior to project approval) was
not yet mature enough to take on the strategic planning and modernization functions that
were envisioned in project objectives.

Relevance of Project Designs
2.3     All three projects adopted designs that were heavily input oriented, leaving open
questions as to whether their reform efforts had led to desired outcomes. For example, none
of them were designed to show the effects of their substantial investments in IT, staff
training, curricular change/innovation, and management reforms on the prized higher
education outcomes, such as improved student learning, better employment outcomes or
increased efficiency. Thus, none of the projects was designed with student learning or
graduate employment indicators; nor did they establish more than a couple of measurable
indicators of improved efficiency. Furthermore, only in one of the countries was there a
plan to measure even intermediate outcomes of improved classroom instruction and in only
one was there an indicator of the skills and capacities of higher education graduates. This
could also be a reflection on the World Bank higher education change model at the time,
from which the countries drew, which itself did not feature assessment of student learning
outcomes nor any explicit features for improved connections to the labor market, except for
“differentiated missions” (increasing middle-level technical education), which in MNA has
so far not proved to be effective.

3. Comparative Analysis: Main Findings
3.1    Given the commonality in approaches and objectives of the projects, results are
reviewed around five main questions as follows:

Evaluation Questions
      How well could the Bank-promoted higher education reform agenda be implemented
       in the MNA region?
      What were the effects of the three projects on higher education quality and
       relevance?
      How did the three projects improve higher education connection to the labor market?
      To what extent did the projects contribute to the efficiency of higher education in the
       various national contexts?
      How effective were the higher education projects in supporting capacity
       development in those areas of governance most critical for quality, relevance and
       efficiency?

Implementing the Bank-Promoted Higher Education Reform Model in the
MNA Contexts
3.2    Table 1-2 listed of the nine main features the Bank-endorsed higher education
reform model and showed how the different countries bought into them through their higher
education reform projects. That table is reproduced here (see Table 3-1), but with an
additional column showing whether and how the features were implemented (even when
they were not included in a Bank-supported higher education project). Revisiting the
                                                   13

material in column 3 (reform features in higher education Projects) it is clear that all three
countries bought into most of the reform model features: four features were adopted by all
three countries; three by 2 of the 3, and two by only 1 country (diversified finance and cost
recovery).

3.3     Summarizing the information in Table 3-1, there were no features in the model
which were both incorporated into the higher education reform projects and fully
implemented in all three countries. However five features were adopted and relatively well
implemented in Egypt and Jordan: quality assurance, competition for
research/development funds; increased use of ICT, differentiated missions (less well
implemented in Jordan); and overall system coordination (less well implemented in Jordan).
None of the features incorporated in Yemen’s HEP were well or fully implemented, but,
ironically, there were some parts of the model not in HEP that were successfully instituted
in the country during the project period (competition for funds; differentiated missions;
cost recovery). The weakest buy-in and implementation record were in features related to
higher education finance (diversity, cost recovery, and formula funding), the latter bought
into by all three countries but not implemented. Also, university autonomy did not get off
the ground in the two buy-in countries (Egypt and Yemen).

3.4      Overall, in the three countries, parts of the reform model have taken root or at least
sprouted and other parts have not. Those that have met resistance –formula financing and
university autonomy -- have done so largely because of the complex (and sometimes
political) nature of the changes they advance which require time to understand and change,
i.e., through gradual consensus building. In the meantime, savvy managers are working to
design hybrid reform strategies.21 As suggested in the “Road Not Traveled,” the reform
agenda in each country will differ and move at its own pace.

  For example, Egyptian and Yemeni systems creating unofficial cost recovery systems. Also, in a PPAR
mission interview in Egypt a senior HEEP manager and former university president described the complex
nature of university decentralization in Egypt and how some decentralization can advance under current laws,
and much of the rest (e.g., personnel policies) can move ahead through a temporary melding of new processes
with older ones.

Project Effects on Higher Education Quality and Relevance
QUALITY

3.5     To depict quality change in education, educators often use student to teacher (“staff”
in higher education) as a proxy. Student to staff ratios (SSR) in the three countries’ public
universities, high and increasing at project start-up, were still high around project
completion: 29 to 1 in Egypt and Yemen and a staggering 38 to 1 in Jordan (the norm in
MNA was around 23 and among all lower-middle income countries 17). 22 However, during
the project period SSRs moved in different directions in the three counties: staying about the
same in Egypt, falling in Yemen, and rocketing in Jordan (Figure 3-1). In Egypt during the
period, enrollments increased unabated based on government policies to increase higher
education enrollments and to make it fee free (including providing support for room and
board), combined with continuing constraints on hiring new faculty. In Jordan the
government culminated its policy of shifting higher education financing to the universities
(by 2005 the national government subsidy had fallen from an earlier 50 percent to 20
percent), but the universities – still growing -- were not able to fill the void, resulting in
overcrowding. Finally, in Yemen, the government stopped enrollment expansion during
2003 to 2006 and at the same time expanded university staffing by 36 percent over 2002/03
to 2007/08, bringing its SSR way down. Bringing these ratios down to international or even
regional norms was not the stated goal of any of the three countries’ higher education
projects, but by not doing so, the countries failed to establish one of the important enabling
conditions for quality improvement.

3.6     There was some attempt to influence/measure intermediate outcomes, such as
improved instruction and increased satisfaction among students, but these were found to be
ineffective or inconclusive. For example, Jordan assessed changes in university instruction
(pedagogy), but found no significant improvements, and in student satisfaction: more than
12 thousand student evaluations of courses were collected, but, in a missed opportunity,
trends were not presented (Jordan higher education PPAR). Egypt’s MOHE mounted an
“impact analysis” at the end of HEEP, which showed some positive changes in higher
education pedagogy, but the sample for this was too small to be conclusive.23

3.7     In the end, the projects were most successful at creating inputs or immediate
conditions (drawing from the higher education reform model) for improved quality. For
example, all three higher education communities improved their information technology
(IT) infrastructure and its use in teaching, learning and research; all three provided staff
upgrading and in-service training; all used competitive grants to stimulate program
innovation and renewal efforts, and all at least initiated quality assurance and accreditation
systems. In Egypt these systems operated effectively, in Jordan somewhat less so, and in
Yemen with first steps (see country higher education PPARs). However, in none of the
three was there any evidence that these inputs have made a difference in terms of student
outcomes (improved learning and/or better preparation for the labor market), given such
outcomes were not measured in any of the projects or even by the countries’ higher
education systems.24

3.8    Using the vocabulary of the “Road not Traveled,” it appears that the higher
education systems completed some serious quality “engineering tasks,” but the enabling
conditions (e.g., Student of Staff Ratio (SSRs)), incentives and accountability (Monitoring
and Evaluation (M&E)) structures put in place were not strong enough to produce any
recorded improvements in desired higher education outcomes - or any that may have been
produced were not well documented.

RELEVANCE

3.9    Relevance was a serious issue in higher education for three project countries, with
Jordan putting it up front as a project development objective; Egypt, as a part of two project
components; and Yemen, among the main features of its main HEP deliverables, the
National Strategy for Higher Education. In all countries, relevance was conceptualized as
bringing higher education into better alignment with economic and social needs of the
country. Market place relevance was a special concern in Jordan for both higher education

  Reported in MOHE (Egypt) (2007), HEEP Impact Assessment Report. The question: “Staff using small
group teaching” 28 percent of respondents indicated this was true before HEEP and 48 percent said so
during/after; for “Staff using technological aids in teaching” the before and during/after numbers were 15
percent and 44 percent. However, the impact assessment drew respondents from four faculties in only 3 of 17
universities and there was a high refusal rate among target subjects; also, there was no baseline data.
24
  This was not just a problem in MNA countries. Assessing learning achievement in higher education has
progressed at a much slower pace across the world than assessing that in primary or secondary education.
Nothing like the internationally standardized math and science tests for primary and secondary students
(TIMSS) coordinated by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, or
OECD’s PISA exists for higher education, although OECD is now working to create new instruments and the
Collegiate Learning Assessment program in the United States is in progress.

and middle level technical education, but in Egypt and Yemen such relevance was a focus
more for mid-level technical education. In the latter two countries, university relevance
more often meant updating curricula and teaching styles (in line with international norms),
getting both instructors and students connected to the vast resources of the worldwide web,
and shifting course offering to more applied fields. Except for the indicator of improved
employer satisfaction with technical education graduates in Jordan, there were no formal
outcome indicators for the improved relevance goal in any of the projects.

3.10 It was, however, possible to assess one outcome that background documents showed
widespread concern about, namely an improved balance between theoretical (social sciences
and humanities) and applied fields (medicine, engineering and agriculture), and for that
there were mixed results (see Table 3-2 with results taken from external sources25). As seen
in the table, Jordan and Yemen both showed a reduction in the share of students enrolled in
the social sciences/humanities; while Egypt showed almost no change over 4-5 years. In
Yemen the 10 percentage point decline was influence by the higher education Ministry’s
policy of limiting admissions to such programs more than to the applied programs. 26 In
Egypt the lack of change reflects the fact that 70 percent of secondary school graduates are
in the social science fields,27 and that many students enter higher education with less
concern for employment than for the social status that comes with a university degree. 28
Finally, on the one specified outcome indicator for relevance, Jordan’s evaluators found
employers did not increase their regard for technical college graduates; they still found their
training overly theoretical and that trainees lack practical skills.

Connection to the Labor Market
3.11 Reformers in all three countries had serious programmatic concern about the weak
connection between their higher education systems and outputs to their countries’ labor
market needs, but this was not matched in their reform programs with design features to
track progress in overcoming the mismatch. Most project performance indicators were
instead about project outputs (for example, the number of programs with more work-
oriented curricula and the number of students enrolled in them).

3.12 Data external to the projects painted a grim picture of the recent labor market
success of university graduates (Figure 3-2). In all three countries unemployment among
university graduates remained high (over 17 percent in Jordan) or (in Egypt and Yemen)
climbed at a brisk pace by the new decade’s midpoint - in Egypt it tripled from around 9
percent in 2001 to almost 27 percent in 2005, and in Yemen (assuming the figures are
correct) it increased 5 fold from 11 percent in 1999 to 54 percent in 200530 31.

Yemen, Labor Force Survey 1999, and Household Budget Survey 2005. In Yemen, survey figures are not
always reliable. The huge spikes in unemployment in both Egypt and Yemen came at the time that when the
enormous surge of late 1990s enrollees were coming into the labor force, while at the same time civil service
jobs were being eliminated and private sector job creation was stagnating.

  Such high rates of graduate employment represent not only a waste of human resources but a contributor to
social unrest and political change. Unemployed university graduates have been at the forefront of social and
political change movements in the region in early 2011, which begin in Tunisia in January with the self-
immolation of an underemployed university graduate.

curricula and processes -- to labor force needs, but, again, there is no evidence anywhere to
show that graduates of such programs are finding jobs in larger numbers.32 Also, Egypt has
developed promising accreditation schemes and competitive grant-giving mechanisms (to
the point of being called new “cultural norms”) to leverage more innovative and relevant
programs, but again there is no sense so far that these leads to better market place results.
The strategy used in Yemen, to build world class graduate studies programs through
competitive selection and twinning with excellent mentoring institutions was successful in
producing some very employable and influential graduates (although many were already
senior government or business managers before entering the programs).33 However, given
the relatively small number of graduates from these programs they will not be very
influential, unless they fulfill their expected mandate to raise general quality and relevance
through example, a proposition that must be carefully fostered and assessed in the near
future. While state M&E frameworks in the countries do not appear to be covering labor
market relevance in a routine way, there are some raw data (e.g., in MISs) that could be used
to show more labor market-relevant university and TC outputs. In the meantime, the
injunction in the “Road not Travelled” that MNA countries shift emphasis from inputs to
results is resoundingly relevant to issues of labor market relevance.

Contribution to Higher Education Efficiency
3.14 The almost total absence of outcome indicators for efficiency once again prompted
the search for external data to show results for this objective. In this case the indicator was
change in cost per student, on which results were equivocal (Table 3-3). A 45 percent rise
over the project period was taken by Egyptian policy commentators as a sign of decreased
efficiency (MOHE, 2007), given the fact that student-staff ratios remained high over the
same period (see the results section on Quality above). The modest fall in Jordan
(presumably underestimated since there was no inflation adjustment) was accompanied by a
serious fall in service delivery (evidenced by drastically rising student-staff ratios) and thus
cannot be interpreted as sign of improved efficiency. Finally, while the large increase in per
student cost in Yemen could be sign of diminished efficiency, it probably was not so, since
Yemen had been underspending in higher education (see background section). In sum, while
cost per student was not used as an indicator of efficiency in any of the three projects,
external data was available to show changes during the project period and the results failed
to confirm any improvements in efficiency.

3.15 Two other outcome indicators, one tracked and the other not, did send a clear
message of poor system efficiency. In HEDP Jordan evaluators did not find the expected
decline in the ratio between non-teaching and teaching staff in public universities during the
project: instead the ratio increased slightly from 2.7:1 to 2.8:1 (see country PPAR). In
Egypt a snapshot on the use of university resources revealed that only 35 percent of
resources were going to direct support of student learning while 65 percent went for


32
  This was both because governments did not track such results and the fact that in many programs graduates
had not emerged from the programs by project closing.
33
  Such programs were indirectly supported by HEP through its connection to a large Dutch government grant
which provided most of their funding. They have now become the centerpiece of the follow-on Bank-
supported Higher Education Quality Improvement Project (see its Project Appraisal Document, 2010).

university overhead, revealing an intractable support staff overload problem, recognized
well before HEEP.

3.16 Conventional measures of internal efficiency, student dropout, repetition and
graduation rates, were surprisingly not systematically tracked in the projects, although
ingredients for these can be found in the new MISs (at least in Egypt and Jordan). What is
available now reveals relatively low internal efficiency, for example, in Yemen repetition
were between 12 percent (females in applied fields) and 30 percent (males in the
humanities) at the second half of the decade (Government of Yemen, 2007) and in Egypt,
graduation rates varied from 50 to over 100 percent, with the lowest rates found in the best
quality universities (e.g., Cairo and Alexandria) and vice-versa (OECD/World Bank, 2010).

3.17 Finally, through the higher education projects the governments did work to establish
some conditions for improved efficiency (many consistent with the Bank-supported reform
model), such as, more decentralized decision making; improved management information
systems and their use; improved use of ICT for management and decision making; more
cost recovery; self-generation of revenue; and use of distance education (e-learning).
Success in implanting these was uneven: on the effective side were e-learning in Egypt and
cost recovery in Yemen; on the less effective: decentralized decision making in Egypt and
use of MIS for management in Jordan. Ultimately, higher education projects did establish
some conditions for improved efficiency (many consistent with Bank-supported higher
education reform model), but there is no evidence that any of this led to real change in
efficiency outcomes.

Effectiveness in Supporting Improved Governance
3.18 Reforming higher education governance is a complex undertaking, requiring deep
understanding of existing power structures and decision-making processes, many of which
are not open to scrutiny. This review begins with the premise that understanding the socio-
culture context of participating countries is one of the keys to successful governance reform.
Large differences appear across projects in the extent to which such understanding was
reached. In Jordan, the Bank’s project preparation activities included the production of 15
studies, two explicitly on higher education planning, management and governance;
however, there were shortcomings in the extent to which higher education stakeholders

     Currencies: Egypt: 2007 Egyptian Pound; Jordan: Jordanian Dinar (nominal); Yemen: 2007 Yemeni Riyal.
                                            23

reached consensus on and “bought into” HEAP’s governance reform agenda. In Egypt, a
long process of consultation and consensus building preceded HEEP, but there were
complexities in university governance (e.g., covered by the decentralization package) that
were not sufficiently understood at the outset (i.e., no specific analytical work on them) and
that led to a lack of clarity and consistency in the project governance components. In
Yemen, there was no analytical work on financial and institutional management capacity
and on the culture of decision making and little stakeholder consultation on these, leading to
some unrealistic expectations in HEP’s piloting of governance reforms. During HEP
implementation processes for creating the National higher education Strategy were extra-
ordinarily participatory and did lead to a wide-spread buy in to many of the reform
strategies in that document.

3.19 In the end, project supported changes in governance were not that significant in the
three projects: Jordan’s higher education system never came around to acting like a coherent
system; Egypt’s main governance reform instrument became stalled in Parliament, and
Yemen’s piloting of management reforms never took place. What did occur was the
building of some systems that can contribute to better governance: improved ICT in all
countries, some improvement in the creation and use of MIS, the acceptance of and some
experience with competitive funding and quality assurance. The main message is that it
takes a long time, often longer than a single project (based on the experience of these
loans/credits) and some deep understanding (for example, through thorough sector
analytical work) by all parties for such inputs to be transformed into real and significant
governance reforms. It also seems plausible that some governance features of the reform
model draw too heavily on the Anglo-American experience (recalling that the Bank’s
“Lessons from Experience Paper” emerged from that context) and for at least these Arab
countries they need to be better aligned with Middle East/Northern Africa context, perhaps
drawing examples from more centralized countries around the world.

4. World Bank Performance
Quality at Entry
4.1     The reform of higher education was a relatively new undertaking, both in the World
Bank and it the three cooperating countries. To this the Bank brought its best expertise at
the time and the benefits of recent investigations and strategizing in the field. The project
preparation activities in the three countries, however, were constrained by three kinds of
shortcomings: a) failure to assure country/institutional buy-in to the reform agenda and to
make sure well know reform champions were in charge of the project (Jordan), b) weakness
in analytical depth related to the most complicated reform components, such as formula
funding and increased university autonomy and less than a clear understanding of the
problems and complexities residing there (Egypt and Yemen), and c) shortcomings in
specifying appropriate outcome indicators for its objectives and laying out a solid
monitoring and evaluation framework (all countries, but especially Yemen, where its
Learning and Innovation Loan instrument was particularly demanding of such). More
particularly, in Jordan it was unfortunate that the Bank team did not respond more
proactively to the Government of Jordan cancellation of Technical Assistance funding
during negotiations and a reduction in the government’s financial contribution. Also, due to
lack of consensus and implementation readiness it was necessary to use cumbersome dated
                                               24

covenants in the legal agreement to avoid overlooking important design features. Moreover,
the decision to entrust an autonomous agency to manage the project implementation unit
resulted in its having little clout in the higher education community. In Egypt, it was
unfortunate that implementation arrangements were insufficiently developed prior to project
start-up, especially in the complicated areas. And in Yemen, it was regrettable that
measures for procurement support and technical/financial supervision – procurement and
contract management were not even identified as risks – were not solidly supported from the
outset, despite clear government shortcomings

Quality of Supervision
4.2     The quality of Bank supervision varied widely across projects, with that in Jordan
being quite conscientious and attentive, that in Egypt less so, and that in Yemen,
considerably less so. However, supervision in all locations had one common weakness: in
all locations episodic project supervision missions tended to rate fulfillment of all objectives
as satisfactory, thus failing to alert management that parts of the reform agenda were not
progressing well (hence some surprises when ICRs were completed). It is not clear why this
occurred, but perhaps it relates to frequent reports of disconnects between what was being
implemented and project indicators of success. Also in common was closer supervision
attention to the delivery of commodities and services (inputs) than to outputs and outcomes
(the few that were identified), mirroring weaknesses noted in project implementation and
effectiveness.

4.3     On the strong side, supervision in Jordan was very attentive to smooth procurement
and disbursement processes and able to provide technical assistance to project managers that
in large measure made up for technical assistance not being financed by the project. In
contrast, in Egypt the Bank team never was able to adequately reconcile the government’s
implementation structure (five sub-projects) with the PAD’s structure (project components)
which complicated the use of progress indicators (a situation that probably should have led
to restructuring). There were also some lapses in financial management supervision
wherein university staff members were allowed to be paid as consultants. Finally, in
Yemen, Bank task management changed four times, and during the course of this
(especially before the midterm review) the Task team Leader consistently supported the
move towards merging HEP with other projects in implementing a sector wide-support
program (even giving no objections to contracts that ignored original Project features),
giving little official attention to the mismatch this created between the revised project
directions and the original performance indicators. The obvious need for restructuring was
never taken up, although the Bank had reminded project managers that they were
accountable to the original project agreements.



5. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
Conclusions
5.1     The three MNA higher education projects were launched during the first 3 years of
this century under similar circumstances: a rapidly expanding higher education population
                                             25

outstripping government capacity to maintain funding levels, consequent reductions in
educational quality; and a mismatch between the output of the universities and technical
colleges and the needs of the countries and their labor forces. These circumstances called
for increased attention to higher education relevance, quality, and efficiency, goals which all
three projects attended to, either through formal objectives (Jordan), project activities
(components) (Egypt), or policy strategies developed during the project (Yemen).

5.2      Each of these goals was conceptualized somewhat differently across countries, but
in one way the projects all had something in common. In none of the countries and for none
of the goals was there a strong elaboration of expected results or outcomes. With few
exceptions project indicators were conceived of in terms of inputs, processes or outputs. For
this reason it is not possible in any of them to clearly answer whether they made any
substantial difference in higher education relevance, quality or efficiency. This is not to say
that they accomplished nothing: many new services and systems were delivered and changes
were made in all three countries.

5.3     In fact, some parts of the Bank-supported higher education reform model flourished
in the three countries. In all three competitively awarded grants motivated departments and
staff members to come up with innovative programs, many connected to the labor market or
addressing a national development issue. The seeds of quality assurance and accreditation
have also been sown and are growing, albeit at different speeds. And ICT availability and
usefulness have been accelerated, not yet for fully operational and digitized management
information systems, but at least for improved internet connectivity, changes in instructional
methods, and e-learning experiments.

5.4      However, some problems remain intractable: there are still vastly more students in
the arts, humanities and social sciences than in scientific and applied fields. Also, despite
efforts to attract secondary school graduates into middle-level technical education (by
renewing courses and forging ties with industry) students still tend to shy away from it.
Moreover, even with significant attempts to improve course structure and provide in-service
staff training, there appears (at least in the one study of improved pedagogy - in Jordan) that
not much has changed. Finally, it is not clear whether graduates are prepared for the work
place: again, a study in Jordan shows employers have not changed in their dissatisfaction
with technical college graduates. Some of this might be explained by the weakness of
incentive and accountability structures that was lamented in the World Bank MNA study
“The Road not Travelled”. That is, academic or technical programs can be modernized but
students must be motivated to enter them; graduates may not be able to find employment,
but they won’t have lost anything since tuition is free and, as in Egypt, so is room and
board; and instructors can create attractive new syllabi but there will be no consequence if
they don’t show up to teach them. It seems that all projects, designed to provide the
conditions for higher education reform, may still have missed some crucial ones.

5.5     Concerning the project goals to reform (or pilot new forms of) university
governance, the efforts in all three countries were stillborn. Funding formulas were drafted
but were not used; decentralization and university self-management of budgets failed to get
off the ground in Egypt and Yemen. In Jordan, the efforts expected to improve the
coherence of the system did not bear fruit. It seems that university governance is the most
complex and change-resistant part of the accepted reform model. Some evidence from the
PPAR mission suggests that this might be mostly a matter of unanticipated complexity or an
                                                 26

underestimate of the implications of intended changes. Dealing with such complexity can
be a matter of better research and analysis, or simply a matter of more time to work through
it all. OR, it could be that this part the model is too biased towards Western industrialized
cultures and economies (the Bank’s “Lessons from Experience” was originally drawn up in
the Anglo-American context). For this part of the world it may need governance models
more consistent with Arab culture and/or more centralized governance traditions. This
indeed is an area for continued analysis and dialogue.

Lessons Learned
5.6       The following are some of the lessons learned from the comparative PPAR:

         When a widely adopted change model is being introduced to an area for the first
          time, it needs to be preceded by sufficient sector analytic work to create an
          appreciation of the complexities (implications) of the proposed changes and of the
          likely sources of resistance; such analysis could help determine the parts of the
          model that are appropriate to the context, and the pace of adoption.

         Efforts to improve the quality of higher education need to be submitted to the same
          general test that is widely accepted for pre-university education: Does it improve
          student learning outcomes? Standard assessment of student achievement in higher
          education is challenging, both in a technical and a political sense, but moves in that
          direction have already begun in Egypt and Jordan.

         Restructuring higher education courses and programs and even ensuring appropriate
          private sector participation in decision-making are not in themselves sufficient to
          ensure that reforms will result in more employable graduates. Higher education
          systems need to systematically monitor the labor market relevance of their offerings
          and the success of their graduates.

         Free university education in Yemen and Egypt (including generous room and board
          subsidies) creates the wrong market signals, encouraging enrollment in overloaded
          fields since failure to obtain employment represents little financial loss to students
          and their families.

         Competitive systems for awarding grants can lead to some creative new and revised
          programs, but this needs to be done in conjunction with other university change
          efforts and on a large enough scale to have a significant effect on the quality and
          relevance of the university’s offerings.

5.7     Graduate unemployment, which did not decline under the projects, will not change
appreciably with the introduction of a few innovative program (the main approach used in
the project), but requires serious gate keeping by the governments, shifting enrollments
away from humanities (as in Yemen) and more serious incentive structures to steer students
towards needed fields. The lack of programs for tracking and awareness-raising about
graduate unemployment makes this issue less visible than it should be.

Summary
1.      The Higher Education Enhancement Project (HEEP) was created at a critical time in
Egypt's economic development. The country had been restructuring its economy to better
compete in the global marketplace and had recently signed a partnership agreement with the
European Union. In order to successfully compete in this international arena Egypt needed to
quickly build capacity to fully participate in new knowledge-based enterprises. The speed with
which Egypt could make this economic transition would be either facilitated or hindered by the
relevance and quality of its higher education system-its universities and middle technical
institutes (MTIs)-and its capacity to bridge the growing digital divide. Even focusing purely on
the domestic economy, Egypt recognized the need to produce higher level higher education
graduates with skills needed for an increasingly privatized labor market, which in some cases
had begun to use foreign workers instead of local ones due to the poor or irrelevant preparation
of the latter.

2.      The issues that the HEEP designers faced were difficult and various: a) university
enrollments had doubled during the last 25 years of the 20th Century, accelerating in the 1990s
(during which decade gross enrollment rates went from 13 to 27 percent), with expansion
outpacing growth in public higher education funding, leading to high student-staff ratios (at the
turn of the Century 29:1 compared to a regional average of 23:1) and decaying infrastructure
and instruction supports (library, ICT, etc.); b) enrollment was skewed in the direction of social
sciences and humanities (around 80 percent), fields where there are no employment
opportunities, despite attempts to change the attractiveness of technical education, c)
governance of higher education was judged by reformers to be overly centralized with
universities having little say in their student admissions, academic offerings (fields of study),
staffing, and allocations of budgets; and d) teaching at the university and technical colleges
considered narrow, rigid and out of date, using old syllabi and employing traditional lecture
style pedagogy.

3.      Preparation for the Higher Education Enhancement Project, designed to address these
issues, was based in large part on a highly participatory Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE)
consultation process which culminated in a National Conference on Higher Education (2000)
and its 25-point Declaration for Action, 11 points of which became the core of HEEP. HEEP
focused on identified problems of relevance, quality and efficiency, but indirectly, by creating
the essential (“fundamental”) conditions for their improvement. The project objective, as
stated in the PAD, was to: “create the conditions fundamental to improving the quality and
efficiency of the higher education system in Egypt through legislative reform, institutional
restructuring, and establishment of independent quality assurance mechanisms and monitoring
systems.” The given objective was considered relevant to Egypt’s needs and aspirations and to
Country Assistance Strategies at the beginning and end of the project, however, the design was
viewed as lacking a set of solid outcome indicators and questions were raised as to whether all
of the “fundamental” or relevant conditions were specified in the design.

4.      Efficacy. With respect to improved efficiency (rated modest), the enactment of
legislative reforms in support of greater university autonomy, application of a rationalized
funding formula, and conduct of social assessment of cost-recovery did not come to fruition
                                             29                                   ANNEX A


during the project, putting a damper on the Project Development Objectives (PDO) of
efficiency improvement. However, despite a slow start, the MIS moved towards fruition under
HEEP, becoming fully operational under Second Higher Education Enhancement Project
(HEEP2). Its impact on efficiency is yet to be determined, but it is now providing annual and
biennial reports to the government and public. Finally, concerning academic management: the
Supreme Council of Universities has been fully established but only now under HEEP2 is it
feeding essential information to the university community, while for the Technical Colleges,
consolidating multiple middle-level training institutes under eight new regional Training
Colleges, each with its own Boards of Trustees, is leading to improved management for at least
half of the colleges.

5.      Improved quality (rated substantial) was assessed at two levels, one for universities and
the other for technical colleges. For universities, there were deep institutional changes under
this objective. State-of-the-art ICT infrastructure and IT applications have been laid down
which have brought the system into the digital age. Staff and leadership development has been
deeper than originally planned under HEEP, now being managed by a permanent,
internationally accredited center at the national level and internationally accredited instructors
at the university level, covering courses that have been refined over recent years. Its breadth
has expanded to cover all instructors, now that their promotion depends in part on their
completing course sequences. A university-wide quality assurance and accreditation system
has also been established, with faculties already undertaking self-evaluation in relation to new
national standards and receiving site visits. The competitive grant “project” (HEEPF) ran long
enough to spawn lasting new study programs and labs, and to promote a change in the
university “culture” towards the use of such grants in allocating of all kinds of funds, including
supporting accreditation preparation. These features of quality improvement reinforce one
another in various ways: ICT connectivity provides new e-channels for staff development;
increased quality standards under quality assurance and accreditation further drives the use of
new instructional media; innovative, entrepreneurial programs under HEEP feed on examples
gleaned for the world-wide web; and new research brings the university into contact with
community needs. The widespread impact of these changes on university quality was not
confirmed by hard evidence from predesigned outcome indicators, nor was there evidence of
positive change in “external” outcome measures. However, a positive picture of success was
visible from the somewhat limited project-conducted “impact analysis.” The depth, synergy,
and expanding nature of these HEEP reforms have helped to create credible – even if not all
essential – conditions for improvements in the quality of Egyptian public universities.

6.       For technical colleges, efforts to improve educational quality appear to have been
successful in increasing enrollments, while at the same time reducing staff-student ratios.
Additional quality improvement efforts were reflected in curriculum updating, lab and
workshop refurbishing, and instructor upgrading. Major restructuring of the middle-level
technical education system also appears to have better connected it to the commercial and
industrial world (relevance), through having its leaders on TC Boards of Trustees (effective in
at least 50 percent of TCs) and by linking new courses directly to productive enterprises and
their needs (expanding quickly under HEEP2). Many of the above changes were too recent to
have been reflected in improved student learning and employment outcomes; even so, as with
university education, there was no project system for measuring these systematically (a design
flaw). A challenge to the use of TCs as a “short track option” in higher education is the fact
ANNEX A                                       30


that a majority of recent graduates from large metropolitan TCs have continued on to
university education.

7.      On efficiency (rated substantial), HEEP overcame an early delay and ended up
disbursing all of its funds by the end of a one year extension, with funding distributed well
across the revised components and according to targeted amounts. The project vastly increased
the scope of two sub-components (QA and Accreditation; Faculty Leadership and
Development Training) but managed them within the original budget (with some buy-in from
universities), and appeared to have covered many of the same activities as the follow-on
government-funded HEEP2, but at lower costs.

8.      Outcome. The overall outcome of the project is rated moderately satisfactory, based on
relevance ratings that are substantial for objectives and modest for design; efficacy ratings of
modest for improving efficiency and substantial for improving quality; and an efficiency rating
of substantial.

9.      Concerning Bank Performance at Entry (rated moderately unsatisfactory), it was the
Bank that initiated the dialogue in Egypt about higher education reform and it continued to
support this dialogue during the long preparation process, including the Government’s
participatory planning process. It also brought lessons learned from similar projects and prior
operation in the sector. However, for the complex and sensitive parts of the reform agenda, it
would have been better if there had been more sector analytical work. Also, the Bank team
could have helped with stronger outcome indicators and clearer M&E strategies.

10.     On Supervision (rated moderately unsatisfactory), the Bank team worked closely with
the Project Management Unit (PMU) to ensure smooth operation and to resolve issues
encountered. However, it could have done a better job reconciling two different versions of the
projects design, helping to operationally define terms (relevance, quality and efficiency), and
establishing early on a well functioning M&E system. Also the Bank Team’s own progress
tracking left the impression that there were no issues meeting project objectives, even in the
face of problems with the legislative agenda. Finally, the Bank could have been more candid
and paid more attention to procurement issues (e.g., university staff being paid as consultants)
that arose during the project.

11.     On Government performance (rated moderately satisfactory), the Ministry of Higher
Education had full ownership of the project from the beginning and used strong participatory
processes for consensus building and broad program design. During implementation it showed
commitment to the reform agenda through the establishment of a high-level steering committee
with some quality control mechanisms. Also, despite delays, counterpart funding was
provided, and legislation was adopted to consolidate technical institutes and establish the
National Authority for Quality Assurance and Accreditation (NAQAA). However, it was
overly optimistic about its ability to push legislative reforms on university governance and
financing through the Parliament and was not able to find a compromise solution during the
course of HEEP. Concerning Implementing Agency Performance (rated moderately
satisfactory), the PMU faced real challenges in implementing such a complex and sector wide
project given the lack of details in project design. Its structure was strengthened by the
appointment of directors for the five sub-projects. The PMU had to develop action plans,
                                            31                                   ANNEX A


operation manuals and guidelines for these subprojects. Despite the additional delays due to the
change of some directors and the release of Government contribution, the PMU was able to
successfully complete almost all the activities planned in the project. The PMU performance is
however mitigated by shortcomings in monitoring and evaluation and in fiduciary compliance.

12.   The PPAR mission determined that the following lessons could be derived from the
implementation of HEEP and its performance assessment:

       Higher education reforms supporting improved quality are easier to put in place than
those for improved institutional efficiency and financial management, leading to decreases in
cost-effectiveness. In Egypt this imbalanced pace of reform (quality outstripping efficiency)
cannot be sustained.

       Programs to improve the condition for higher education quality, relevance and
efficiency cannot be expected to do so just because they have been made operational.
Appropriate outcome indicators need to be formulated and used to determine whether the
conditions have been sufficient to leverage real change.

       There are currently few disincentives for students enrolling in overcrowded and non-
employment-conducive fields. Adding some elements of student cost recovery (which did not
receive due consideration in HEEP) is a controversial topic, but some aspects of it (high
subsidies for room and board) should be open to discussion as well as fees for other non-
instructional aspects of higher education.

       When a widely adopted institutional change model is being introduced in a field like
higher education for the first time in a country, it needs to be preceded by sufficient sector
analytic work to create an appreciation of the complexities and the implications of the
proposed changes and of the likely sources of resistance; such analysis could help determine
the parts of the model that are appropriate to the context, and the pace of adoption.

      Even parts of the reform model (e.g., competitive funding), considered by leaders in
higher education to be highly appropriate in the Egyptian setting, can be met by resistance
from other quarters (or even the universities themselves), and are only accepted after a period
of negotiation and trial. This suggests getting buy-in to such change takes longer than is often
provided.

       Reform managers confirmed their assumptions (see planning HEEP documents) that a
period of time in which change comes through top-down approaches can be followed, if
significant buy-in is carefully nurtured, by a new phase of bottom-up activity (HEEP followed
by HEEP2).

       While awaiting the establishment of the complete reform package the government can
make many of the desired changes, even those contained in the stalled parts of the package, if
they are formatted in different ways, for example, achieving “decentralization” through
universities’ being allow to set up revenue-generating “parallel programs” or specialized
Research and Development centers, giving them some discretion over their finances.

Background
Overview

13.     The Higher Education Enhancement Project (HEEP) was created at a critical time in
Egypt's economic development. The country had been restructuring its economy to better
compete in the global marketplace and had recently signed a partnership agreement with the
European Union. In order to successfully compete in this international arena Egypt needed to
quickly build capacity to fully participate in new knowledge-based enterprises. The speed with
which Egypt could make this economic transition would be either facilitated or hindered by the
relevance and quality of its higher education system-its universities and middle technical
institutes (MTIs)-and its capacity to bridge the growing digital divide. Even focusing purely on
the domestic economy, Egypt recognized the need to produce higher level higher education
graduates with skills needed for an increasingly privatized labor market, which in some cases
had begun to use foreign workers instead of local ones due to the poor or irrelevant preparation
of the latter.

The Education Sector Context

14.     Change in higher education was part of a comprehensive education sector reform
strategy in Egypt at the end of the 20th century. The Bank was already supporting basic
education reform through the Education Enhancement Project (1997-2006) (US$200 million)
and the Secondary Education Enhancement Project (1999-2006 -- extended to 2012) (US$50
million). Both the Education Enhancement and the Secondary Education Enhancement Project
(SEEP) were supporting Government's efforts to significantly upgrade the quality and
relevance of education, by changing pedagogies so students' conceptual and problem-solving
capacities are developed, and by introducing information technology into classrooms and
instructional practices. Additionally, SEEP was supporting reform of the secondary technical
and vocational stream to shift current focus on narrow specialization towards generic skills
which were considered more fungible across industries and which would increase the
employability of graduates. SEEP also supported a shift in the balance of vocational vs. general
secondary schooling; targeting a shift from an existing vocational:general mix of 70:30 to
50:50 over the lifespan of the project, a move to broaden educational opportunities for youth
and provide more access to higher quality (general) education.35 Also, near universal primary
education and rapid expansion of pre-university education in the late 20th Century created a
growing demand for higher education, enrollments rates doubling over a 25 year period, a rate
that could not be matched by growth in public higher education funding.

Higher and Middle-Level Technical Education

15.    With the national constitution guaranteeing free public higher education in recent years,
including generous subsidies for student room and board, higher education has become a heavy
financial burden to the state. With the enrollment growth outstripping the central


35
  This is somewhat inconsistent with the goal of HEEP to increase the number of youth entering the middle-level
technical colleges.
                                                    33                                         ANNEX A


government’s capacity to keep pace financially, reductions have been made in the expenditure
per student, negatively affecting facilities and educational quality (e.g., high student-instructor
ratios (29:1 compared to a regional average of 23:1),36 weak ICT infrastructure, and poor
instructional supports--a timely study showed that a typical undergraduate checked out one
library book per year). Talks about diversifying sources of funding and improved efficiency
have not led far, since cost recovery has been politically difficult (except for some charging for
“parallel programs”),37 there is little precedent for self-generation of income, and a myriad of
central government structures has constrained university capacity to use their finances
rationally (e.g., national employment policies pack the staff with unneeded support staff and do
not permit downsizing).

16.     Attempts to make higher education more relevant to national needs and the workplace
have also not born much fruit. Despite an awareness of a skewed enrollment towards social
sciences and humanities (almost 80% near the turn of the century) this proportion has not
substantially changed in recent years (in part because admission by field of study is not
controlled by the universities themselves) and the proportion entering technical vocation also
been unchanged over recent years. Technical education was established to be a lower cost
option to university education and more relevant to the needs of the economy, but its low
quality (extra-ordinarily high student-teacher ratios of between 100-300), weak connection to
industry, and low job-placement of graduates have meant that it has continually struggled to
become accepted as a promising path by students and their parents.

Project Objectives and Design
17.      The objective of the project was to “create the conditions fundamental to improving the
quality and efficiency of the higher education system in Egypt through legislative reform,
institutional restructuring, and establishment of independent quality assurance mechanisms and
monitoring systems” (PAD version). The Legal Agreement uses the term “conducive” instead
of “fundamental,” which makes the conditions seem less essential than the original term did.
Since the Government of Egypt (GOE) was clearly committed to creating the essential
(“fundamental”) conditions for improved higher education, this review stands with the original
formulation in the PAD.

18.     The project originally had three components:

Component 1: Improving efficiency through the reform of governance and management
(US$29.55 million at appraisal, US$30 million actual) – efforts to reform legislation governing
higher education; rationalize funding allocation mechanisms; establish a National Quality
Assurance Council and build capacity; develop a management information system (MIS) and
train management; establish a Higher Education Enhancement Project Fund to support teaching
and learning improvements in academic departments through program and course innovations;


36
   A further illustration, according to the PAD, was that university enrollments increased by a phenomenal 42
percent between 1997/98 and 1998/99, but the teaching staff only increased by 7 percent.
37
   “Parallel programs” are those used in Egypt and Yemen in which the universities admit students whose test
scores are below the cut off for admission on the condition that they pay for their courses.
ANNEX A                                                34


improve collaboration between universities, technical colleges, and the private sector; enhance
management and administration in the higher education sector; and conduct a social
assessment of parents, students, and other key stakeholders to identify acceptable cost recovery
mechanisms.

Component 2: Improving the quality and relevance of university education (US$7.67
million at appraisal, US$6.2 million actual) – efforts to establish an integrated computer and
network infrastructure and connectivity to the world-wide web; train faculty and staff; install
and operationalize an inter-university library system; and provide competitive grants in support
of innovative programs relevant to national development and workforce needs.

Component 3: Improving quality and relevance of mid-level technical education
(US$13.55 million at appraisal, US$13.4 million actual) – efforts to consolidate of 47 middle
technical institutes into 8 self-governing Technical Colleges (TCs) (having their own Boards of
Trustees drawing from industry); enhance the quality of TCs through civil works, updated
equipment, and technical assistance; develop new TC programs in collaboration with
employers; update curriculum design and instructor training to provide customized in-service
employee training programs for industry on a cost-recovery basis; and strengthened academic
administration and management.

Implementation
19.     The project experienced substantial delays in its early implementation phases, the result
of complex and poorly defined project design features, inadequate project implementation
arrangements, a change in the Project (Project Management Unit) Director, and delays in
appointing sub-project managers. Disbursement was therefore behind schedule throughout the
project, but reaching 100 percent during a one year project extension (from December 31, 2007
to December 31, 2008).

20.     During implementation the MOHE and its project managers structured their efforts not
according to the agreed-upon project components but along the lines of 5 government “sub-
projects,” each having its own manager and emphases somewhat different from the PAD
components (see relevance of design). 38 These differences were never formally reconciled
during the project nor even mentioned in Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRs),
causing some confusion about how to charge expenses and what to monitor and evaluate
(should non-agreed upon sub-components be considered in output assessment?). Concerning
financial management, the Bank questioned the appropriateness of the Project’s paying
university professors to manage QA or HEEP fund activities on their own campuses, arguing
that this should have been part of their regular duties, and at least should have been discussed


38
  The sub-projects created by the Ministry were: 1) Quality Assurance and Accreditation Project (QAAP ); 2)
Higher Education Enhancement Project Fund (HEEPF); 3) Information & Communication Technology Project;
4) Faculty Leadership Development Project; and 5) Egyptian Technical Colleges Project. Quality Assurance and
Accreditation went far beyond the PAD-specified goal of establishing an accreditation council, adding sub-
components such as QA units in all universities, university/faculty self-evaluation activities, and campus visits by
peer reviewers; Faculty Development exceeded the original scope of training faculty in instructional technologies,
providing instead a broad range of professional development courses.

during project preparation. There were also problems with HEEP’s not having its financing
accounting and reporting systems in order at the beginning of the project, which caused some
aspects of financial management to lag behind until late in the project.

Relevance
Relevance of Objectives

21.     The improvement of the quality and efficiency of national education at all levels
remains a major challenge in Egypt. The need for improving the higher education system to
ensure competitiveness of the Egyptian labor force, mentioned in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) 2001, is still valid as the economy is becoming more global and more
knowledge-based. One of the three pillars of the CAS 2006 is to enhance the provision of
public services, including the improvement of quality and relevance of education at all levels.
The objectives are also intimately connected to the Government of Egypt’s long range plans
for higher education reform, which were articulated in a landmark National Conference on
Higher Education held at the turn of the century. It articulated 25 reform initiatives for
improving the quality, relevance, and efficiency of higher education, of which 11 were
addressed by the Higher Education Enhancement Project. One omission in the Project
Objectives statement is any specific reference to relevance as an objective, even though it was
clearly a concern in the 2006 CAS and at the National Conference, and is featured, along with
quality, in two project components.39 Since in many ways relevance in HEEP is associated
with quality (e.g. curricula more in line with country needs and conditions; the creation of
more marketable skills) this review will consider relevance as an integral part of the quality
objective. (Rated Substantial.)

Relevance of Design

22.     While improving quality and efficiency were at the core of the project’s objective, there
were no explicit indicators to monitor effects of the project on quality and efficiency; moreover
these terms were never operationally defined. Instead, success in the project was conceived
almost entirely in terms of inputs or outputs.40 Also, the project design used by the
implementers, with its 5 sub-projects, was, as mentioned, different from the design in project
documents, with its 3 components, leading to some confusion as how project success would be
determined.41 Finally, there are questions as to whether the set of “fundamental conditions”


39
   The Borrower clearly intended this project to include the objective of improved relevance as reflected in its
statement of objectives in its own implementation completion report, as follows: “The project objectives were
derived from the key issues in the Higher Education [Reform Strategy], the need to: (i) restructure the legislative,
governance, and financing systems of the higher education system to support efficiency and quality enhancement
initiatives; and (ii) improve the quality and relevance of higher education so graduates have the knowledge and
skills demanded by Egypt’s developing and globalizing economy.” (World Bank, HEEP ICR, Annex 7. Summary
of the Borrower’s ICR, p. 71.)
40
   One senior manager acknowledged that HEEP had mainly emphasized “input parameters” (PPAR mission,
December, 2010).
41
   For example, establishing a National Quality Assurance council was originally classified in the PAD as a
strategy (sub-component) for increased efficiency (considered a kind of higher education inspectorate), but as it
expanded under the government’s sub-project 1, it clearly became a program for improving higher education
ANNEX A                                               36


included all of the important ones. For example, there was no strategy for confronting high
faculty absenteeism (due to multiple jobs), reportedly to be over 75 percent in the professional
programs, nor was there any project attention to high student dropout and repetition in
universities and technical colleges, skewed admissions practices (admitting 80 percent in the
social sciences/humanities), and the generous government student subsidies for housing and
meals.42 (Rated Modest.)

Efficacy
23.     This section reviews the evidence for efficacy for the two main objectives of the
project, a) create conditions for improving efficiency, and b) create conditions for improving
quality. Since the project used mostly output indicators to show efficacy, this review will
present them first (the subheadings represent key performance indicators). Next is a set of
outcome indicators, which, given the few tracked by the project, were mainly constructed by
reviewer from non-project data for the pre- and end-of-project periods. The review for quality
improvement is in two sections, first for universities and the second for technical colleges.

24.     Objective (a): Create Conditions for Improved Efficiency. (Rating – Modest)

Outputs
a. Key legislative reforms on university self-governance. Although the project facilitated a
discussion among stakeholders on system reform, the new legislative framework to award
more autonomy to universities faced resistance in Parliament and has not yet been adopted.
The Ministry decided to pursue implementation of many elements of its reform agenda in an
ad-hoc manner until a new framework was ready for Parliament’s consideration.43
b. Rationalized funding. The MOHE has developed a model to estimate and analyze student
unit costs, and worked on a funding formula, but it was not adopted. Recurrent and investment
budgets continue to be allocated through direct negotiations between individual universities
and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning. There was no tracking of the social
assessment of cost recovery mechanisms and no record of its having been conducted.
c. Develop higher education Management Information System (operating, annual reports
published, guiding decisions). MIS applications for undergraduate students, graduate studies
and staff administration were completed and MIS centers were established in universities but




quality. Similarly, the Higher Education Enhancement Fund was originally positioned as an efficiency strategy,
but came to be recognized as a strategy for improving quality and relevance. In this review both will be assessed
as means for improving quality.
42
   According to the Strategic Planning Unit the cost to students for hostel accommodations and 3 meals a day has
been about $12 per year.
43
   For example, recently state universities have been permitted to create specialized centers that provide
consulting and problem solving services, and fee-bearing professional programs in foreign languages (English or
French) and “parallel programs” (see footnote 3), all of which generate income that the university can spend in a
discretionary manner (estimated in the OECD/World Bank (2010), Higher Education Egypt, to be about 10
percent of total revenue).
                                                    37                                           ANNEX A


were not fully operational at the Supreme Council of Universities at the close of HEEP, but
became so under HEEP2.44
d. Strengthening academic admin/management (universities and TCs). Supreme Council
of Universities and Supreme Council of TCs were in place by 2008, but at this point it is not
clear to what extent they have power or will to make substantial changes.45 The 47 MTIs were
consolidated under 8 Technical Colleges which are now guided by Boards of Trustees. A Gap
Analysis undertaken by USAID for the 3 pilot TCs (Mataria, Mahella and South Valley) in
2008, indicate that BOTs have little authority over governance of the Colleges and that the
majority of authority and decision making was done centrally at the MOHE.46

Outcomes
e. Cost per student. According to MOHE planning data, the cost per student increased by 45
percent between 2002/03 to 2006/07, a sign of diminished efficiency since at the same time the
student-staff ratio did not change.47 In other words, the government was spending more for
students on average, but a major enabling condition for improved quality (SSR) did not
improve.
f. Graduation rates. The average graduation rate for public universities in 2005/06 was 75
percent, but in the large elite public universities (Cairo and Alexandria) it was well below that
average (50 and 69 percent respectively) and international norms.48

Summary
Outcome indicators for higher education efficiency drawn from non-project sources reveal low,
and in the case of cost per student, declining efficiency. Although there were no explicit
strategies to address these specific issues, HEEP did support an efficiency improving agenda.
Many of the planned actions, however, did not come to fruition, for example, enactment of
legislative reforms for greater university autonomy, the application of formula funding, and
social assessment of cost-recovery mechanisms. HEEP was able to get a functional MIS in
place by the end of HEEP (see Box 1), with routine statistical reporting coming under HEEP2;
and to establish its higher education councils for universities and technical colleges (which are
operational but have yet to become strong agents of change). Consolidation of 47 MTI under 8
regional colleges, all guided by Boards of Trustees (about half of which are effective), was a
move in the direction of efficiency, but as of yet there is no hard evidence to demonstrate that
they are so.




44
   Improvements in ICT and the MIS system at the end of HEEP and during HEEP2 have led to the SCU being
able publish two new reports based in MIS data: a) Higher Education in Numbers (annually in January – can be
found on its website), and b) a higher education country report, that presents analysis of data and indicators
showing progress in the whole sub-sector (once every 2 years).
45
   According to OECD/World Bank (2010) SCU goes through the motions of establishing funding guidelines for
universities, but the Ministries of Finance and Planning allocate budgets by line item; also according to a recent
study (Novak, MacTaggart and Gholam, 2006) the SCU is supreme in its power but slow in its pace of managing
change.
46
   HEEP2 managers shared with the Mission more recent studies that showed 50 percent of BOT’s to be active
and effective (e.g., 4 of 8).

Universities
Outputs
a. Integrated computer network infrastructure: all faculty/students have access to IT and new
teaching methodologies. All 17 universities in 2008 were connected to the unified fiber optic
informational network and over 60 percent of university computers were connected to the
internet; videoconference, streaming and e-learning facilities were set up in all universities and
staff trained in their use. (See Box 2). Over 50 percent of students have used electronic forms
of learning and of those who have, 70 percent preferred electronic courses.
b. Integrated computer network infrastructure: inter-university library system. The Project
established the Egyptian universities libraries consortium including all the public Egyptian
Universities and some foreign and private universities in Egypt. As of 2008 the digital library
included 16 international databases and 10 free web resources that served most of the Egyptian
scholars’ academic needs. All these resources have been made available through the Egyptian
Universities Network website (see Box 2). A catalog database of the universities holdings
contained the data of 60 libraries in 15 universities. At that time more than 2,220,000 records
were indexed and stored in the system.50
c. Train faculty and staff training. Staff training goals (5000 instructors) for IT applications
was met by Information & Communication Technology (ICT) project trainers. Beyond that the
project supported a much broader staff training agenda, through its Faculty Leadership and
Development subprojects.51 The sub-project supported the establishment of training centers in
17 universities and the collaboration with an international partner (ICT project). About 760
trainers have been trained under the project, including a core group of 40 certified trainers
expected to play a leading role in promoting quality in their respective institutions. The project
supported the development of 16 specialized and 3 TOT training packages, and the delivery of
more than 220,000 trainee hours to staff members who are now required take a certain number
of courses in order to be promoted. Leading this effort was the internationally accredited
National Center for Faculty Leadership and Development.52 Results of the "impact evaluation"
covering staff members from fours fields (arts, commerce, engineering, and medicine) from 3
universities showed an average of 52 percent of courses taken was considered "clearly
beneficial."

   In this review, relevance is considered as part of quality, as discussed in paragraph 9 above.
50
   Since the close of HEEP at the end of 2008, this e-library network has continued to expand.
51
   This is an instance of the inconsistency between the government’s project structure and the original project
subcomponents. The original subcomponent had a target of only training for 5000 instructors in IT applications,
but the HEEP sub-project on Faculty Leadership and Development followed a plan to provide in-service training
to all academic staff members in the public university system. In this review the sub-project goal of reaching all
academic staff members is acknowledged.
52
   This began as the Faculty and Leadership Development “Project” under HEEP, but has now become a semi-
autonomous national center. Its accreditation is by the International Board of Certified Trainers, that has been
certifying trainers and human resource professionals in USA and Europe since 1988, and to which the Egyptian
Center is now affiliated. University efforts are now self-managed at FLD centers on university campuses, 4 of
which are also now (2010) internationally certified.

Box 2. Egyptian Universities on Line
One of HEEP’s main approaches to improving the quality and relevance of higher education was to expand
the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in the processes of teaching, learning, and
research, relying on world-wide web to help bring the university system into the 21st Century. The table
below shows the status of ICT facilities in the Egyptian Higher Education in 2004, the first full year of
HEEP and in 2010, after 5 years of HEEP support followed by 2 years of government-funded HEEP2

Currently through the Egyptian University Network website (soon to be converted into the “University
Portal”) internet browsers can download -- and even view graphic displays of -- student data (such as
student field of study by year and region), download e-learning courses, such as one on “Bovine Diseases,”
read the latest articles in the American Journal of Medicine, email instructors and fellow-students, do a
Google search, determine whether a needed book is available in a certain (or any) state university library,
and read any one of 2 million+ graduate theses.
It is difficult to determine the impact of improved ICT connectivity on learning, teaching and research, but
one piece of evidence shows an increase in research productivity: from 2003 to 2007 the number of
Egyptian studies published in international journals increased 22 percent.

d. Establishing a National QA Council through legislative reforms. A National Authority
for Quality Assurance and Accreditation in Education, reporting directly to the Prime Minister,
was established in 2006 with the mandate of assessing and providing accreditation to public
and private institutions at all levels of education (not by the legislature but by Presidential
Decree). This act was accompanied by a substantial program of staff training on QA and
accreditation processes through HEEP’s Quality Assurance and Accreditation Project (QAAP),
plus the establishment of QA centers/units in all universities and faculties, the creation of
ANNEX A                                                40


national academic standards, and the beginning of university/faculty self-evaluation and site
visits in relation to the standards.53
e. Establish an higher education Enhancement Project Fund. The HEEPF funded 159 small
projects, at least one in every public university and in 5 of 8 technical colleges (surpassing the
goal of 50 percent of universities). They were selected through competitive processes, from a
group of 563 proposals. The project contributed to creating a “culture” of competitive funding,
as shown by the number and quality of proposals submitted for other competitive programs,
such as the GOE’s Science and Technology Development Fund, the European Union’s
TEMPUS,54 and QAAP’s grants to faculties for accreditation preparation (under HEEP2).
HEEPF projects were selected on the basis of their plans to enhance quality and relevance in
areas such as new curriculum and program development, innovative teaching methods, and
entrepreneurship among faculty. Program impact was analyzed by a coalition of senior
cademics and found to have made a positive difference on many variables.55 Good examples
of the legacy of HEEPF are found on the HEEP website (www.heepf.org.eg) - at least 23
projects showing relevance to the work place or local problems. Two of those are described in
Box 3.




53
   As with item “c” this was substantially expanded in scope during HEEP and became more identified with
quality improvement. During HEEP2 the Quality Assurance and Accreditation “sub-project” matured into a
permanent MOHE program, the “Program of Continuous Improvement and Qualifying for Accreditation,” which
has awarded competitive grants to more than 1/3 of university faculties in support of their accreditation efforts,
and expects to see 80 faculties accredited by 2012. (MOHE (2010), HEEP2 Project).

knowledge and skills applicable to a specific job. These results are to be used with caution, however, since there
was low fulfillment of sample targets.

              Renewable Energy Program in the Agricultural Engineering Department,
                                    Alexandria University
For several years prior to HEEP the Department had unsuccessfully sought research funds in support of a vision to
conduct experiments in renewable energy, drawing from the sun and wind, in the desert of northern Egypt. When
the HEEP Fund came along the department submitted a proposal and was finally awarded a small HEEP grant.
With the grant the renewal energy program built a small experimental station in the desert not far from the
University, which used a hybrid mix of solar and wind energy to power a pump for a 200 foot well and a
desalination apparatus to convert the well’s water from brackish to fresh. The experiment was a success, and soon
the opportunities for new grants came along, culminating in 2010 in the awarding of a grant for over $1 million
from the prestigious national Science and Technology Development Fund. With the new grant the station will be
expanded so that it can provide sweet water for a diversity of crops to over 60 acres of land, plus enough
electricity for a small village. Added will also be fish ponds, poultry raising and other features of an integrated
renewable rural energy and production network. This station always was and will continue to be an important
location for training and education, not only for graduate students who run the station and helped to design and
construct it, but for undergraduates who go to the site to learn about renewal rural energy. (Based on PPAR

For the development of an in-house laboratory in the field of applied science and technology, the HEEP-funded
project at the Assuit University served as another model. A new chemical pathology laboratory was created with
HEEP funds in accordance with international standards for quality and quality control. The program included the
renovation of laboratories for final year students and the introduction of new statistical programs. A new diploma
for environmental chemical pathology was also created. As a result of this program, students have graduated with
certified knowledge and skills at an advance applied level, and increased practical experience, which have led to
better job opportunities.

Outcomes
a. Student-staff ratio. Used as a proxy for quality (i.e., enabling conditions for quality), the
indicator was high at the beginning of HEEP (30:1 in 2002)56 and stood almost unchanged by
its final year (29:1 in 2007).
b. Change in Instructional Methods. This was an intermediate outcome indicator taken from
HEEP’s 2007 “Impact Assessment,” which showed a before/after project change in staff use of
small group teaching (71 percent increase) and in staff using technological aids in teaching
(200 percent increase).57
c. Proportion of students enrolled in social science and humanities programs. According to
MOHE records, the proportion was 80 percent in 2003 and by 2007 it was almost unchanged
(79 percent), given particularly high unemployment rates among such graduates, the lack in
shift towards disciplines for which there is higher labor market demand is of concern. 58

not representative) showed dissatisfaction among large size of their classes and the rare use of instructional
technology.

d. Graduate Unemployment rate. Data drawn from labor force and household surveys
revealed graduate unemployment to have been around 9 percent just prior to HEEP and around
27 percent near its end, a serious deterioration in job acquisition.59
 
Technical Colleges

Outputs
a.      MTIs links to industry. The MTIs were consolidated into 8 Technical Colleges.
Boards of Trustees were formed to include representatives of the private sector. Programmatic
links to industry through customized training programs were established in some colleges, such
as the new programs in fast food service, refrigeration, and “autotronics” (in conjunction with
BMW) at Mataria TC.60
b. Curricular redesign, related instructor training, and improved facilities). The project
supported rehabilitation and equipment for 3 pilot TCs (Mahalla, Mataria and South Valley),
revision of the curricula and development of new courses, training courses to upgrade
qualifications of existing staff, and recruitment of qualified new staff, resulting in the reduction
in student-staff ratios shown above. In all, 26 academic programs were revised and 6 new
programs of improved relevance to commerce and industry (see footnote 30) were designed by
expert committees in collaboration with the potential employers.61 Also, HEEP records show
refurbishment of computer labs in ¾ of training institutes by 2008 (90 percent by 2010); and
even more extensive rehabilitation of workshops and laboratories.62
c. Collaboration between Universities, TCs, and the private sector. The project made little
effort to improve collaboration between Universities and TCs,63 however, the improved
collaboration between TC and the private sector was one of HEEP’s success stories (see points
“a” and “b” in this section).

  The survey findings are summarized in Yasmine Fahim (2009), Financing Higher Education in Egypt. An
interpretation is found in Diego Angel-Urdinola, and Amina Semlali (2010), Labor Markets and School-to Work
Transition in Egypt: Diagnostics, Constraints and Policy Framework. Washington, DC: World Bank (MNSHD).
The spiking graduate unemployment rate appears to be largely a result of the huge surge of late 90s enrollees
coming into the market with mostly social science/humanities degrees and finding both a decrease in government
employment opportunities and a stagnant private sector job market for this skill. Women were employed at lower
rates than men, and in fact had falling labor force participation rates, given that most new jobs were in the
informal sector which did not provide any protection for them in their roles as mothers, unlike government jobs, in
which most graduate women were employed in earlier years.
60
   By 2010 many new training programs connected to specific industries were added, including those with
Olympic Electric Group, CISCO labs, , Amadeus Tourism Co. (tourism software), and Proctor and Gamble, most
of which had arrangements for guaranteed hiring of program graduates.

   One new form of connection between TCs and university level education development by the MOHE is the
Integrated Technical Cluster, which the Ministry is setting up in ten locations around the country, which forms a
structural link among institutions in the same field: technical high schools, Technical Colleges, and Advanced
Technical Colleges, allowing motivated students to earn a Bachelors degree in their field after graduating from the
ATC, and even going on to earn an MA or Doctoral degree in technology.

Outcomes
a.      Student-Staff Ratio. This ratio fell sharply over the course of HEEP, from 118:1 to
40:1 in the industrial subjects, and from 305:1 to 98:1 in the service subjects, a result of hiring
more (and more qualified) TC staff.64
b.      Graduate unemployment rate. Prior to HEEP, about 60 percent of Middle Technical
Institute graduates had not found relevant employment at least 2 years after graduating (HEEP
PAD). It is unclear whether this had improved by the end of HEEP, largely because entrants
into new work-place connected programs had not yet graduated. MOHE records examined
during the Mission indicate a majority of recent graduates had deferred entry into the
workforce by moving on to university education.65
c.      Student enrollments. This intermediate outcome was tracked by HEEP. Technical
student enrollments increased by 10 percent over the project, double the targeted increase of 5
percent.

Summary
Universities. Deep changes in the university system took place under this objective. State-of-
the-art ICT infrastructure and IT applications have been laid down which have brought the
system into the digital age. Staff and leadership development has been deeper than originally
planned under HEEP, now being managed by a permanent, internationally accredited center at
the national level and internationally accredited instructors at the university level, covering
courses that have been refined over recent years. Its breadth has expanded to cover all
instructors, now that their promotion depends in part on their completing course sequences. A
university-wide quality assurance and accreditation system has been established, with faculties
already undertaking self-evaluation in relation to new national standards and receiving site
visits. The competitive grant “project” (HEEPF) ran long enough to spawn lasting new study
programs and labs, and to promote a change in the university “culture” towards to use of such
grants in the allocating of all kinds of funds, including that supporting accreditation
preparation. These features of quality improvement reinforce one another in various ways:
ICT connectivity provides new e-channels for staff development; increased quality standards
under quality assurance and accrediation further drives the use of new instructional media;
innovative, entrepreneurial programs under HEEP feed on examples gleaned for the world-
wide web; and new research brings the university into contact with community needs. The
widespread impact of these changes on university quality was not confirmed by hard evidence
from predesigned outcome indicators, a design flaw, nor was there evidence of positive change
in “external” outcome measures; but a positive picture of success was visible (however dimly)
from the somewhat limited project-conducted “impact analysis,” which, among other things
demonstrated some improvement in instruction and research productivity. The depth, synergy,
and expanding nature of these HEEP reforms have helped to create credible – even if not all of
the essential – conditions for improvements in the quality of Egyptian public universities.




64
   These findings were reported in the project’s Implementation Completion Report (World Bank 2009), but were
inappropriately placed in the Efficiency section, instead of as an outcome within the Efficacy section.
65
   Among industrial program graduates from the three metropolitan TCs, over half went on university education,
and only around 10 percent entered the working force. (Mission gathered data from MOHE, November, 2010).
ANNEX A                                         44


Technical Colleges. Efforts to improve educational quality in the TCs appear to have been
successful in increasing enrollments, while at the same time reducing staff-student ratios.
Additional quality improvement efforts were reflected in curriculum updating, lab and
workshop refurbishing, and instructor upgrading. Major restructuring of the middle-level
technical education system also appears to have better connected it to the commercial and
industrial world (relevance), through having its leaders on TC Boards of Trustees (effective in
at least 50 percent of TCs) and by linking new courses directly to productive enterprises and
their needs (expanding quickly under HEEP2). Many of the above changes were too recent to
have been reflected in improved student learning and employment outcomes; even so, as with
university education, there was no project system for measuring these systematically (a design
flaw). A challenge to the use of TCs as a “short track option” in higher education is the fact
that a majority of recent graduates from large metropolitan TCs have continued on to
university education.

Efficiency
26.     During the first two project years, during which implementation was minimal (see
Implementation section), there was little disbursement of funds. After that, and with
amendments to the budget, disbursement followed the expected curve, accelerating at the end
so that loan funds were fully disbursed within a one year extension. Disbursement was spread
evenly over all of the amended budget areas (components), aligned with the five GOE sub-
projects, averaging about 20 percent per component, and at the end spending came very close
to amended budget targets. Operational costs (e.g., funding the Project Management Unit)
only accounted for 3 percent of project expenditures, a sign of management efficiency.
Another sign of efficiency was the large expansion of project scope in both Faculty Leadership
and Development and Quality Assurance and Accreditation without the need for any increase
in project budgets. Likewise, at no additional expense, the project spawned the creation of a
Strategic Planning Unit within the MOHE, which produces regular statistical reports (drawing
from the MIS), and advises the ministry on reform options.

27.     Some locally funded civil works (for example, for TC buildings and workshop
upgrading) were delayed because of difficulties obtaining construction permits and
complexities in making payments from local funds, but all were completed eventually, even if
after the close of HEEP, and their costs, which had not grown but could no longer be charged
to HEEP (local funds having lapsed), were covered under the follow-on government funded
HEEP2. Also there was a problem with HEEP’s not having its financing accounting and
reporting systems in order at the beginning of the project, which caused financial management
to lag until late in the project (although not causing qualified audit reports), but eventually this
was rectified by the establishment of a totally autonomous and more efficient Financing Unit.
After project completion all components (subprojects) from HEEP, except the HEEP Fund,
were carried forward into the government funded HEEP2. Most of these subprojects were
funded at much higher levels than they were during the Bank loan for similar activities,
suggesting good value for money under HEEP.

Outcome
29.     The overall outcome of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based on
relevance ratings that are substantial for objectives and modest for design; efficacy ratings of
modest for improving efficiency and substantial for improving quality; and an efficiency
rating of substantial.

Monitoring and Evaluation
M&E Design

30.     The ME framework that was adopted included plans for a project information system,
the production of quarterly financial management reports, and an annual substantive progress
report, and use contracted independent auditors to undertake technical review of each
component. The set of performance indicators in the logframe to measure progress against
project objectives included five outcome indicators and 12 output indicators, but, as mentioned
under “Relevance of Design,” the indicators used to measure outcomes were actually inputs
(ICT infrastructure), outputs (consolidation of MITs, implementation of MIS) or processes
(legislative reforms). The output indicators identified in the PAD (some of which could have
been considered intermediate outcomes, e.g., were often vague and lacking baseline and/or
target values. Finally, the failure to reconcile the PAD and the GOE project structure meant
some ambiguity as to the application of the logframe indicators (see paragraph 9).

M&E implementation

31.     Although the PMU has made substantial effort to document HEEP activities and
achievements through quarterly progress reports, several publications and its website, the lack
of robust M&E output was found to be one weakness of the project. From project mid-term to
near project completion the PMU was repeatedly reminded to put in place a system to track and
report progress made towards the developmental objectives and the problems facing
implementation, and to appoint an M&E specialist, but this was not actively taken up, nor were
the technical audits commissioned. In the last year the PMU did implement an impact
assessment on a sample of students and staff, sharing the results with the Bank for the
implementation completion report, but there were some limitations, due to its small sample size
and the lack of baseline data.

M&E utilization

32.    Despite the lack of a well documented M&E system at the project level, sub-projects
such as the HEEP Fund and the Faculty Learning and Development Project had built-in
monitoring systems that allowed them to take some corrective actions such as adjusting
geographical and sectoral coverage or training content. The impact assessment (see previous
ANNEX A                                               46


paragraph) was used as an input to the ICR, was published, and was used to inform the next
phase of HEEP.66

33.     The overall rating for monitoring and evaluation is modest.

Risk to Development Outcome
34.     With an objective calling for the creation of conditions fundamental to higher education
improvement, there was an expectation from the beginning that this project would lay the
foundations for continuous change and reform. One way to assess that is to ask whether the
conditions became a permanent feature of the university and technical education systems. In
fact all of the HEEP subprojects except one (the HEEP Fund) have continued under the
government funded HEEP2 and have retained most of their original features. HEEPF was not
continued, but competitive funding has, being used as a way to distribute other funds (for
example, under the continuation of the QA and Accreditation Project (QAAP), universities are
given the chance to compete for grants to finance additional accreditation preparation activities
with a funding package far greater than that managed by HEEPF). One big difference is that
now HEEP is more decentralized: a) QAAP action is now based on university proposals;
Faculty Learning and Development is conducted and planned by local trainers at university
centers and locally funded (with only guidance from the national center); ICT use and training
for it is now controlled at university IT centers and e-learning courses are created within
faculties; and TC have their own Boards of Trustees, which provide in at least half of TCs real
“corporate” leadership. One risk is that the drafted legislative package which was stalled in
Parliament and its related formula funding strategy will lose momentum and perish, but the
Minster of Higher Education during the IEG mission and the head of the HEEP2 PMU both
indicated that the package had been revised and had a good chance of being adopted by a new
Parliament.67 (Rated Low to Negligible).

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

35.      The Bank engaged in a long process of consultations with the GOE before preparation
and supported the MOHE in the preparation of the reform. The Bank’s team also brought
lessons learned from similar projects and prior operations in the sector, and sought guidance
from its own Quality Assurance Group at the project concept stage. However, in retrospect it
is clear that the sector analysis conducted was not of sufficient depth to reveal how complex
and difficult it was going to be to put into place some of the more controversial elements of the
reform agenda (e.g., university autonomy and financial self-management) and the kinds of
opposition these reforms would face. There was some reference in the PAD to the risks

involved in these undertakings, but since the risks were not well understood mitigation
strategies did not adequately address them. Also, a chance to reconcile the project design in
the Legal Agreement with that used by the Project Management Unit (five sub-projects) was
missed at the outset, and this had repercussions in the clarity and consistency of project
strategies and their indicators. Finally, project design work left it unclear as to how specific
features of the reform agenda would be implemented, and overlooked the need for critical
outcome indicators and clear M&E strategies for use in demonstrating the fulfillment of
objectives. (Rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.)

Quality of Supervision

36.     Overall, the Bank team worked closely with the PMU to ensure smooth operation of the
project and to resolve issues encountered over project implementation. However, the Bank did
not take early actions to correct the mismatch that arose between the two versions of the
project design (components) (Bank and PMU), to help define project objectives in operational
terms (e.g., operationally defining quality, relevance and efficiency), and to ensure that a well
functioning monitoring and evaluation system was established. Also the Bank Team’s own
progress tracking was flawed: despite almost no progress on the reforms related to university
autonomy and resource allocation, supervision missions reported progress on PDOs as
satisfactory. Finally, the Bank could have been more candid and paid more attention to
procurement issues, such as university staff being paid as consultants in their own institutions
that arose during the project (see Implementation Section). (Rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory).

37.    The overall rating for Bank Performance was Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
Government Performance

38.     The Government had full ownership of the project from the beginning and used strong
participatory processes for consensus building and broad program design. During
implementation it showed commitment to the reform agenda through the establishment of a
high-level steering committee with some quality control mechanisms. Also, despite delays,
counterpart funding was provided, and legislation was adopted to consolidate technical college
and establish the NAQAA. However, it was overly optimistic about its ability to push
legislative reforms on university governance and financing through the Parliament and was not
able to find a compromise solution during the course of HEEP. (Rated Moderately
Satisfactory).

Implementing Agency Performance

39.     The PMU had to face real challenges in implementing such a complex and sector wide
project given the lack of details in project design. Its structure was strengthened by the
appointment of directors for the five sub-projects. The PMU had to develop action plans,
operation manuals and guidelines for the five subprojects. Despite the additional delays due to
the change of some directors and the release of Government contribution, the PMU was able to
ANNEX A                                             48


successfully complete almost all the activities planned in the project. The PMU performance,
however, is somewhat mitigated by shortcomings in monitoring and evaluation, and minor
problems in fiduciary compliance (see Implementation Section). (Rated Moderately
Satisfactory). Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Conclusions and Lessons Learned
Conclusions

40.     The Egyptian Higher Education Enhancement Project was designed to create the
necessary conditions for improving higher education efficiency, quality and (by implication)
relevance. This goal was vigorously pursued by the Ministry of Higher Education over a period
of 5 years (2003-2008) with financial support from the World Bank and continues into the
current decade under HEEPS with Egyptian Government funds. In retrospect, however, is it
clear that it had a serious design flaw in viewing project success almost exclusively in terms on
the delivery of programs and services, paying little attention to their relation to measures of
efficiency, quality and relevance; at least not until late in the project when implementers
hurriedly constructed an impact assessment. By then, it was essentially too late, since without
operational definitions, good indicators, baseline data, and appropriate control groups, it was
difficult to convincingly demonstrate the impact of HEEP interventions.

41.      Nevertheless, higher education managers were justifiably proud of the almost full and
complete implementation of their reform program. In almost every sub-project implementers
reached or exceeded project targets, whether they be implanting a culture of competitive grant
giving; the in-house upgrading of teaching and management skills; the use of QA and
accreditation systems and/or small grants to reinvigorate moribund programs; accelerating the
application of high speed IT to better teaching/learning, research and management; or linking
technical training directly to the workplace. It is no accident that these are all programs for
improving the quality and relevance, where change comes relatively easily. Met by hesitation
and doubt at first, these programs eventually took off and are now running almost entirely on
domestic funds, either those from the center or from the universities themselves. Risk to
development outcomes is almost negligible here, as these programs have become
institutionalized and are now entering into their “bottom-up” phase.68

42.     More difficult to sell were the intended reforms for improving efficiency – more
autonomy for universities, fundamental changes in the way funds are allocated, and exploring
mechanisms for cost recovery. These features of higher education reform were not instituted,
and in some cases (university autonomy) encountered opposition. Some of this could be traced
back to project preparation, during which there was little analysis of the political economy of
higher education governance reform, including the likely winners and losers under different
change scenarios. Likewise, diagnostic studies of the reasons for Parliamentary rejection of the



68
  Domestic HEEP planners always saw the endeavor running in two phases, the first (HEEP “1”) considered top-
down, and, the second, after the widespread acceptance of the change model, bottom up (HEEP2), namely,
reforms recommended and pursued (owned) by the universities themselves.
                                                     49                                           ANNEX A


reform package have also not been undertaken.69 Not even the analyses that were planned
under the project (e.g., the social analysis of cost-recovery mechanisms) was undertaken, even
such mechanisms are needed more than ever. Analyses like these, conducted either by Ministry
researchers or academics, could even examine whether there are features in the Bank-
advocated higher education reform package that lies at the heart of the HEEP that are not
entirely appropriate for the MNA region, at least for 21st Century Egypt; and for those reform
features that are deemed appropriate but not yet implemented, the conditions needed for them
to take root.

43.     Some things, however, are already apparent. For example, Egypt’s failure to define
precisely what it meant in HEEP by improved efficiency, quality and relevance, has led to
unanswered questions about whether the many HEEP innovations were making a difference in
the things policy makers and the public care about. Were the interventions really conditioning
change towards valued outcomes? In all fairness to HEEP organizers and managers, one
cannot expect them to do what was not envisioned at the time. However, they will certainly
need to focus on outcomes going forward, and there are indicators that the MOHE is now in a
better position to do so, for example, by its acknowledging late in HEEP the importance of
there being an impact analysis, and its current participation in the OECD partnership on the
Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcomes, which will begin to produce some
standard, comparative assessment results in 2012.

44.     Also, it has been increasingly clear that not all of the “fundamental conditions” for
improved efficiency, quality and relevance have been put in place. For example, there was no
strategy for confronting high faculty absenteeism (due to multiple jobs), reportedly to be over
75% in the professional programs. Likewise, there was little attention to high student dropout
and repetition rates at universities and technical colleges, which the Ministry’s Strategic
Planning Unit estimates wastes as much as one fifth of a year’s higher education recurrent
budget.70 Also, despite some discussion of capping higher education enrollments, especially in
over-subscribed fields, there has been no recent movement in that direction, in part because of
political pressures for continued expansion and a reality that higher education has no
responsibility for: 70 percent of secondary school graduates now come through the humanities
track. Finally, there are market signals coming to students and their families through the cost
free nature of public higher education, including almost fully subsidized room and board, that
add up to a sense of minimal loss if higher education does not lead to remunerative
employment, creating a sense of apathy about the low marketability of higher education
credentials.71

   This year ahead would be a good time for this, as new political alliances area being formed and the legislature is

Lessons Learned

45.    The following lesson can be generated from this review:

       Higher education reforms supporting improved quality are easier to put in place than
those for improved institutional efficiency and financial management, leading to decreases in
cost-effectiveness. In Egypt this imbalanced pace of reform (quality outstripping efficiency)
cannot be sustained.

       Programs to improve the condition for higher education quality, relevance and
efficiency cannot be expected to do so just because they have been made operational.
Appropriate outcome indicators need to be formulated and used to determine whether to
conditions have been sufficient to leverage real change.

       There are currently few disincentives for students enrolling in overcrowded and non-
employment-conducive fields. Adding some elements of student cost recovery (which did not
receive due consideration in HEEP) is a controversial topic, but some aspects of it (high
subsidies for room and board) should be open to discussion, as well as fees for other non-
instructional aspects of higher education.

       When a widely adopted institutional change model is being introduced in a field like
higher education for the first time in a country, it needs to be preceded by sufficient sector
analytic work to create an appreciation of the complexities and the implications of the
proposed changes and of the likely sources of resistance; such analysis could help determine
the parts of the model that are appropriate to the context, and the pace of adoption.

      Even parts of the reform model (e.g., competitive funding), considered by leaders in
higher education to be highly appropriate in the Egyptian setting, can be met by resistance
from other quarters (or even the universities themselves), and are only accepted after a period
of negotiation and trial. This suggests getting buy-in to such change takes longer than is often
provided.

       Reform managers confirmed their assumptions (see planning HEEP documents) that a
period of time in which change comes through top-down approaches can be followed, if
significant buy-in is carefully nurtured, by a new phase of bottom-up activity (HEEP followed
by HEEP2).

       While awaiting the establishment of the complete reform package the government can
make many of the desired changes, even those contained in the stalled parts of the package, if
they are formatted in different ways, for example, moving towards “decentralization” through
universities’ being allow to set up revenue-generating “parallel programs” or specialized R& D
centers, giving them some discretion over their finances.

Summary
1.      Public higher education is a relatively recent phenomenon in Yemen, with its first
state universities being founded in 1970. However, in recent years it has grown very rapidly,
as evidenced by the four fold increase in enrollments in the 1990s. Given the fact that the
system is fully state funded, this growth represents a heavy financial and administrative
burden. By the early 2000s financial allocations were not able to keep pace with expansion,
leading to sharp growth in student-staff ratios (increasing from a previous 24:1 to 41:1) and
deterioration in the condition of educational facilities and resources. In addition, planning
for and managing the growth has been beyond the capacity of central agencies, leading to a
sense of disorder. The growth in enrollment over the time has been distinctly imbalanced,
with a large majority of students (about 2/3) selecting education, humanities and social
sciences in favor of hard science and applied fields, putting university output out of synch
with Yemen’s needs and that of the sub-regional labor market to which Yemen has
traditionally contributed.

2.      The Higher Education Learning and Innovation Project (HEP) of 2002 was developed
jointly by the World Bank and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research
(MHESR) to address in an initial way many of these problems. As a Learning and
Innovation Credit (LIC), its size was modest (original total cost at appraisal $5.2 million and
actual $2.72 million) and its expected duration 4 ½ years (extended to 6). Its objectives,
based on a combination of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) formulation and the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA), were to: a) Assist the Borrower in preparing a higher
education reform strategy and in piloting initial phases of its implementation, and b) Assist
the Borrower in developing the capacity of the MHESR to carry out major reforms aimed at
the strengthening of post-secondary education

3.      The project was constructed without the benefit of strong subsector analysis, and
consequently was overly optimistic about the government capacity and motivation to carry it
out, and indeed it moved very slowly during the first two years, given reservations about it on
the part of a new Ministry team. When implementation accelerated, the main focus was on
the creation of the National Strategy for Higher Education in Yemen. The Strategy, to cover
a 10 year period, appeared in 2005, the product of effective cooperation among universities,
government officials, and private sector stakeholders, and was both approved by the Cabinet
and endorsed at the national conference in 2006. The strategy’s main objectives were to:
improve higher education governance (including efficiency); increase institutional diversity;
provide and optimally deploy sufficient resources; and improve the quality of teaching,
research and service. The strategy was relevant and comprehensive, although less focused
than expected on labor-market relevance, and logically constructed, but far too ambitious,
given Yemen’s capacity and readiness for reform.

4.     Once the strategy was produced the Ministry pressed for the implementation of initial
Strategy phases in all public universities, bolstered by its receipt of a substantial grant from
the Dutch government for higher education development. The Bank team acquiesced to this
pressure, informally merging its HEP funds with other donor resources in a system-wide
reform effort, and the concept of limited piloting was set aside. So instead of trying out new
                                             61                                    ANNEX B


approaches to university governance (creating strategic plans and connecting faculty budgets
to them through transparent processes), the expanded project provided wide-ranging training
in planning and financial management to all rectors and their management cadres, but with
little assessment of the effectiveness of the training and how well the reforms could be
operationalized. Likewise, for quality improvement, instead of upgrading the quality in a
few exemplary departments in the pilot universities, the expanded project provided general
core training in English, computer and pedagogical skills to staff members throughout the
university community, again with little assessment of the impact of this training (aside from
participant satisfaction). On capacity building for carrying out major reforms, what was
designed to be confined to the Ministry of Higher Education was spread throughout the
higher education community. In the end this dramatic expansion of scope had the effect of
diluting the project impact and, ultimately, did not lead to any major insights into the
viability or effectiveness of reform elements in the strategic plan, as would be expected from
a LIC (a combination of diluted interventions and poor monitoring and evaluation).

5.     There was some positive movement on some of the outputs. For example, self-
evaluation was conducted at selected faculties and relevant training was provided (although
planned guidelines were not produced). Also, draft standards for accreditation of private
higher education institutions were delivered, although by the end of the project they were not
formally endorsed. Furthermore, a proposal was prepared by the MHESR for a Quality
Assurance System and National Accreditation Council and subsequently approved.
Concerning the construction of a management information system, much of this was taken
over by the Dutch partner, but the HEP delivered the software, hardware and training for one
module (student registration) of the Management Information System (MIS), which was
functioning on limited basis at project close.

6.      Objective 1, covering the national strategy preparation and piloting initial phases of it
is rated Modest. Objective 2, capacity development, is also rated Modest.

7.       The expansion of the scope of the project, from two pilot universities to the sector as
a whole, clearly diluted the planned HEP interventions, but it did create some positive spins
offs. For example, delegates to a national conference on the reform plan in 2008 concluded
that training and workshop activities under the project contributed to an increased level of
understanding of the issues facing the sector, and the breadth of stakeholder engagement in
the dialogue on reform. Also, adoption of the national strategy was said to contribute to a
substantial increase in donor interest in supporting the sector (totaling some $40 million by
the end of the project). Finally, a number of policy adjustments, outlined in the main text,
were made during HEP that were not explicit goals of the project but arose from the sector
reform dialogue generated by it.

8.      Concerning Bank performance, quality at entry was solid in some ways but was not
backed up by relevant sector analytical work which contributed to an unrealistic and overly
ambitious project design, also lacking the kind of monitoring and evaluation framework that
would be expected of a LIC. Supervision of the project was characterized by varying levels
of attention and support, with less than expected support given to continued policy dialogue,
technical assistance to the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and fiduciary support. During
the middle years of the project the Bank team acquiesced to a substantial increase in the
ANNEX B                                      62


scope of the project, informally agreeing to changes in objectives and indicators, but not
formally registering these changes in a restructuring of the project, which led to a mismatch
between what was implemented during the rest of the project and what the formal documents
held the project accountable for. Quality at entry for the Bank is rated unsatisfactory and
quality of supervision highly unsatisfactory, leading to an overall Bank performance rating of
highly unsatisfactory,

9.      With respect to Borrower performance, MHESR facilitated the development and
adoption of the National Higher Education Strategy, developed relationships with other
partners, including donors and universities, and worked to ensure counterpart funding
(although the low amount provided led to problems). However, cumbersome Government
approval procedures and a new Ministry leadership that was weakly committed to the project
contributed to early implementation delays. Also implementation was slowed by friction
between MHESR and the PCU partly stemming from ambiguity about their respective roles
and responsibilities. Furthermore, the Steering Committee that was expected to meet semi-
annually to review progress and supervision reports, identify problems and take action to
remedy them, only met once a year on average. The Project Coordination Unit also got off to
a slow start and was missing crucial staff members (and familiarity/competence with Bank
procedures) during most of the project. When the project effectively merged with the Dutch
higher education support program, the PCU was called to manage the merged operation
which stretched it to the limit. The projects credit agreement required that progress reports
be produced semi-annually, but by the end of the project only two progress reports and seven
financial monitoring reports were officially produced and these did not include clear
indicators or adequate objective measures to monitor and evaluate the project. Both
government performance and implementing agency performance are rated unsatisfactory, as
is overall Borrower performance.

Lessons

        In cases where a good practice model is being tried out by the Bank and its country
         partnerships in a new location (like the model for higher education reform), it is
         important that this be preceded by significant sector analytical work of a kind that
         will predict the viability of a reform agenda or certain parts of it and the likely
         pockets of resistance;

        For projects that are created as Learning and Innovation Credits/Loans, and thus
         contain substantial piloting efforts, it is essential that a good M&E framework be part
         of the design and that government arrangements and capacity to implement the
         framework be secured prior to project start-up;

        When major features of a project are modified at the request of the borrower that
         affect fulfillment of original objectives or the continued relevance of performance
         indicators, formal restructuring must be initiated by the Bank team; otherwise,
         accounting for original expected outcomes becomes problematic;

        Capacity building for university managers and instructors needs to be grounded in a
         specific change program (e.g., creation of new departments or the implementation of
                                                 63                                       ANNEX B


          accreditation procedures) as opposed to being given as a general training exercise,
          since there was no evidence in the project that such training led to changed behavior;

         For government institutions that have not had time to build up a presence and specific
          professional expertise (the MHESR was in existence one year before the approval of
          HEP), it is best to focus lending support on specific deliverables of a tangible sort
          instead of expecting the delivery of wide-spread reforms in governance and resource
          management -- a change in emphasis recognized in the follow-on Higher Education
          Quality Improvement Project.

         For a country with an educated unemployment rate as high as Yemen’s (54 percent
          during the project), more attention to the relevance of higher education to labor
          market needs (domestic and international) – lightly emphasized in the national
          strategic plan – is called for.

Background
Overview

10.     Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Arab world, with a Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 2000 of about $550 per capita. In the mid-1990s the Yemeni economy
witnessed strong growth due to the onset of oil production and high oil prices, but has been
buffeted by periodic declines in oil prices since. In 1990 it achieved unification of its
traditionalist northern area and its formerly Marxist south, but this unity is tenuous and
various challenges to the central government demand high attention to national security. In
2003, the country’s labor force was about 3.7 million, with approximately 11 percent
working in the Government sector and 89 percent in the private sector. The official
unemployment rate stood at 14.8 per cent (unadjusted for a significant amount of under-
employment), with jobless levels being particularly high among university graduates
(estimated in 2005 Household Budget Survey to be around 54 percent!). New job creation
has been slow in recent years (although there has been some expansion in the manufacturing
sector). In 2003 the GDP growth of 3.3 percent was barely above the population growth, so
per capita GDP growth was very modest. The slow per capita income growth together with
the Government’s plan to reduce the proportion of GDP consumed by public expenditure
makes growth in public spending on universities unrealistic.

The Education Sector Context72

11.    During the past generation Yemen experienced impressive expansion in education,
halving the illiteracy rate from 90 to 45 percent. Between the late 70s and the year 2000
basic education enrollments increased 6 times, from less than a half million to over 3 million,
and since 2000 have increased further to roughly 4 million, which is approximately a 74
percent gross enrollment rate (a major increase, but still low for the region). Participation


72
  Based largely on the recent Republic of Yemen/World Bank (2010) report, Republic of Yemen: Education
Status Report: Challenges and Opportunities.
ANNEX B                                            64


also increased in secondary education (by more than 80 percent over 1996 to 2004) to a
2004/05 gross enrollment rate of 38 percent, which highly favored boys (60 percent) over
girls (26 percent). Financial support from the World Bank for basic education began in 1992
and has continued through two additional projects along side its higher education support
projects. The Bank would eventually also provide IDA support to secondary education
(2008) emphasizing enrollment of girls and improved quality (better preparation for the
workforce and post-secondary education), and to technical-vocational education (2 projects).
However, since primary and secondary education, technical education, and higher education
are all managed by different ministries, there is little coordination across the subsectors.

Issues in Higher Education73

12.      Growth has also been a dominant theme in higher education, with public university
enrollments quadrupling over 1999-91 to 1998-99 from 35,000 to 155,000, and reaching a 13
percent gross enrollment rate by 2007 (7.5 percent for females). Enrollment growth has been
distinctly imbalanced, mainly in education and other non-hard-science subjects, and bears
little relation to Yemen's skill needs, qualitatively or quantitatively, 74 or to the sub-regional
labor market in which Yemen is a traditional labor supplier.75 In recent years private
university growth has outstripped that of public, representing 70 percent of the higher
education expansion between 2002 and 2006. Such growth has been so explosive and
management systems so inexperienced that expansion has often verged on chaotic. In the
early 2000s university governance was found to be lacking in overall vision, strategic
planning and budgeting capacity, and the design and use of a monitoring/evaluation
framework. Concerning budgeting, public universities receive annual allocations directly
from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) without any obligation with respect to agreed program
objectives, instructional standards, expenditure norms, or the carrying out of audits. Another
consequence of ballooning enrollments has been reduction in education quality, as evidenced
by an increase in the student-instructor ratio (from around 24:1 to 41:1 in recent years),
without any compensatory expenditure on instructional materials. Library stocks, another
proxy for quality, stood at two volumes per student, although available library funds often
remained unspent, reflecting both a failure of instructors to keep up with recent publications
in their fields and a style of teaching which favors formal lectures and use of lecture notes
above student engagement with published material.




73
     Based heavily on the HEP Project Appraisal Document, 2002.
74
  Even though primary and secondary education has grown rapidly in Yemen over the past two decades, the
Faculties of Education (FOE) have in recent years been producing about 3 times more teachers than can be
absorbed. FOE graduates also top the list of those waiting for civil service jobs (along with those from
commerce, administration, arts and law). See Rep of Yemen and World Bank (2010), Education Status Report.
75
  Skilled labor migration rates for Yemen in 2000 was estimated to be around 35 percent, about 3 times the
MNA average, but its migration to OECD nations was well below the regional average (6 percent compared to
9 percent), given the low demand in that region for the Yemeni graduate skill types and competence levels.
Instead Yemeni emigrants were mainly taking lower skill jobs in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Trends, Impacts and Policy Responses.” World Bank Migration Series Paper.

Project Objectives and Design
13.    Project Objectives were formulated differently in the PAD and DCA as follows:

 PAD            “The development objective of the proposed Learning and Innovation
                Credit is to assist the Government of Yemen in preparing a higher education
                reform strategy and to pilot initial phases of its Implementation.”
 DCA             “The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower in: (i) preparing,
                and carrying out, a higher education reform strategy; and (ii) developing the
                capacity of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research to
                carry out major reforms aimed at the strengthening of post-secondary
                education.”

14.      Both put forward an objective to prepare a higher education reform strategy.
However, they differed in the next step, with the PAD having the further objective to “pilot
initial phases of [strategy] implementation” and the DCA that of “carrying [it] out.” Also,
the DCA presented an objective of “developing the capacity of the Ministry” which the PAD
formulation did not contain. This report will evaluate against the PDOs as stated in the DCA,
however, since this was a learning and innovation credit, carrying out reforms is interpreted
as piloting reforms, as intended by the PAD.

15.     In support of the Project Development Objectives the PAD articulated the following
three key areas or “measures” that were to become the foundation for reform and reform
implementation (used here as Project Components):

       Governance (US$1.8 million at appraisal; US$0.65 million actual): participative
       development of a national reform strategy, capacity building for the Ministry of
       Higher Education and Scientific Research, and training for two universities for the
       assumption of delegated managerial responsibility;

       Finance (US$0.3 million at appraisal, US$0.19 million actual): redesign of budget
       structures, a new funding mechanism (formula funding), and an MIS serving the
       MHESR and the two universities; and

       Quality (US$3.15 million at appraisal; US1.88 million actual): upgrading selected
       faculties (medicine, education, commerce) through faculty development, developing and
       piloting an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) network, assisting the two
       universities in self-evaluations.

Implementation
16.     The Implementation of the Project moved very slowly during the first two years,
mainly due to reservations about it on the part of a new Ministry team and management
instability. In the third year, with yet another change in the Higher Education Minister,
implementation picked up, leading to the participatory drafting of the expected National
Strategy for Higher Education in Yemen (2005/2006), which was approved by the Cabinet
and endorsed by stakeholders at a National Conference in 2006. After the National Strategy
ANNEX B                                           66


endorsement the Ministry pressed for the implementation initial strategy phases in all public
universities, bolstered by its receipt in 2004 of a 26 million Euro grant from the Dutch
government for a broad program of higher education development. The Bank team
acquiesced to this pressure, informally merging its HEP funds with other donor resources in a
system wide reform effort, and the concept of limited piloting was set aside; however, this
change was not formalized through project restructuring.76 At the point, the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) was tasked by the Minister to oversee both HEP and the Dutch-
funded sector support program.

17.     In the end only 51 percent ($2.74) of the $5.3 million in allocated funds were
disbursed (36, 48 and 60 percent respectively of Components 1, 2 and 3). The Government
was unable to deliver it’s agreed upon share of $0.3 million. The Bank disbursed 54 percent
of its $5 million commitment. The project was extended for 18 months (changing the closing
date from December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2008) to make up for lost time at the beginning; a
Government request for an additional 6 month extension was turned down by the Bank.

Relevance
Relevance of Objectives

18.     The project was consistent with CAS 2006 Pillar I (diversifying growth through better
governance and better delivery of public services, including improving skills through
technical education and vocational training and higher education), and Pillar III (increasing
fiscal sustainability through improved public expenditure management). However, neither
the recent CAS nor the one before it (1999) envisioned any lending to the higher education
sector, anticipating rather that the Bank support would help provide a technical basis for
reforms in this sector. Nevertheless, project objectives went straight to preparing, and
building capacity for, a comprehensive reform strategy, without the benefit of extensive
analytic work to inform just what a higher education reform strategy should hope to correct
or achieve. (Although the Bank produced one relevant piece of analytic work before the HEP
design, it was not cited in the PAD.) On the other hand, the piloting element of the first
objective was highly relevant to the country’s situation, and probably should have been
implemented prior to the development of a subsector strategy. (The PAD is ambivalent on
this, sometimes suggesting that piloting come first, sometimes not). The objective of
capacity building of a recently reestablished ministry (Objective 2) was beyond the
appropriate scope of a learning and innovation credit, which is meant to focus on
experimentation, learning and piloting, in advance of larger-scale operations.

  An unofficial division of labor was established in which some of the HEP programs were blended with the
Dutch grant programs and some (such as constructing a financial information system and program piloting in
two universities) were dropped.

Relevance of Design

19.     The sequencing of the objectives of the LIC was ambiguous. The PAD version of the
PDO refers to preparing a higher education reform strategy and piloting initial phases of it,
but the three components already identify some strategies in the realms of governance (pilot
universities assuming more managerial responsibility), finance (new funding formulas and
information systems designed), and quality (faculty development, use of ICT, and university
self- evaluation). In fact, one key outcome indicator suggests an intention to pilot “key
reform measures” before putting out the strategic plan. Even under the assumption that try-
out was to proceed at least simultaneously with overall strategy development, some measures
specified did not map well onto the objectives (but others do). For example, capacity
building for university staff (through faculty development) is a measure specified, but the
objective calls only for capacity building in the Ministry. Also, the key outcome indicators
(specified in the Efficacy section) are only related to the first objective (there are no outcome
indicators for the second), and not well aligned with that objectives: for example, one calls
for “strategic development plans linked with faculty budgets” in the two pilot universities,
but this is not mentioned in either the objectives statement or the components. Another calls
for “budget execution with greater transparency and accountability between the university
and faculty” but the finance component only mentions the creation of a new funding
formula. In addition, the first two of the three key outcome indicators call for outputs (e.g.,
national and university plans), not outcomes. In the PAD there is a passage describing the
outcome levels for the components (e.g., quality of the plans and how to judge it), but these
descriptions do not make it into the indicators. Finally, despite the experimental nature of the
project (with its LIC instrument), the project design did not adequately elaborate M&E
strategies for use in evaluating pilots and try-outs, and learning from them (Rated Modest.)

Efficacy
20.    Objective 1: Preparing and carrying out a higher education reform strategy77.
(Rating – Modest)

21.      The project fully achieved the first part of the objective, the preparation of a higher
education reform strategy, but largely failed to implement the piloting of strategic plan initial
phases in two universities. Instead, HEP was drawn into an agency partnership to support
initial phase implementation in all universities. This shift in HEP strategy was not covered
by project restructuring, so fulfillment of project objectives are assessed in the PPAR
according to the original performance indicators, as follows:

         A strategic plan and multi-year development program, with donor support, building
          on the measures piloted. Under the project, a sound National Strategy for Higher
          Education was developed through a consultative process including university,

  As mentioned in the Project Objectives and Design section, “carrying out” reforms is interpreted in this
review as “piloting” reforms, consistent with the vision in the PAD.

            government, and private sector stakeholders.78 Reaching consensus among
            stakeholders on this document was a significant achievement of the project.79 The
            strategy was approved by Cabinet and endorsed at a national conference in 2006 and
            five-year implementation plans were prepared. The first higher education investment
            program drawn from the strategy was included in the government’s five-year plan.
            The strategy and implementation plans were published and disseminated widely,
            including at a national conference in March 2008; however, no external quality
            assessment was undertaken as suggested in the PAD.80 Adoption of the strategy
            contributed to a substantial increase in donor interest in supporting the sector (totaling
            some $40 million by the end of the project). The Ministry is using the strategy as a
            framework for coordinating donor assistance to the sector.

           Strategic development plans linked with faculty budgets for Sana’a and Aden
            Universities. The work on strategic development planning at the University level was
            extended from two to all seven of Yemen’s universities.81 The project provided
            technical assistance, development workshops, and other assistance to the universities.
            However, only two universities completed the exercise and only one of the plans was
            considered by the Ministry to be satisfactory. In no location, not even where strategic
            plans were created, were the plans linked to faculty budgets as called for.

           Budget execution with greater transparency and accountability between the
            university and faculties for resources. Through the project a Budget and Financial
            System Plan with formula funding was developed and approved but has not yet been
            implemented even on a pilot basis.82 Development of a related financial management
            information system (FMIS) (called for in the PAD) was dropped from the project.
            Actual budget execution practices at the central and university levels have not yet
            significantly changed and there is no evidence that the project achieved “greater

  See Republic of Yemen, Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (2006), National Strategy for
the Development of Higher Education in Yemen. The strategy’s overall vision was to create “a higher education
system characterized by quality, broad participation, [and] multiple and open routes…, that is effective and
efficient and delivers quality programs… to enhance Yemen’s quality of life” (p58). The strategy’s main
objectives were to a) improve higher education governance at the national and institutional levels in order to
optimize decision making and system development; b) increase institutional diversity in order to meet
increasingly diverse needs; c) provide and optimally deploy sufficient resources to enable a high quality system;
and d) improve the quality of teaching, research and service.
79
   Retrospectively, it is clear that there was considerable skepticism about the plan, especially the decentralized
financial management part of it, within the Ministries of Finance and Planning.
80
   The IEG Mission informally assessed the plan and found it to be relevant and comprehensive (although less
focused than expected on labor-market issues), and logically constructed, but far too ambitious, given Yemen’s
capacity and readiness for reform. Some Mission informants indicated that the Ministry would not be able to
(indeed had not yet) put much of the plan into practice.
81
     One of the original 7 universities was split into two, so as of 2010 there are eight state universities.

  The 2010-approved follow-on program supported by the Higher Education Quality Improvement Project

        transparency and accountability” between the university and faculty resources. The
        project did carry out training of Ministry and university staff in university
        management and finance, as well as workshops on the funding formula, to help
        prepare for introduction of the new budget and financial system, but the effectiveness
        of this training is unknown due to inadequate evaluation. Since the funding formula
        was not put to use or even piloted, the relevant intermediate outcome indicators –
        related to transparency of income and expenditures, and annual reporting on
        implementation results – could not be addressed.

22.    Overall, for this objective, a major accomplishment was the creation and
dissemination of the new (first) national strategy for the reform of higher education, but
because of non-recognized project restructuring and poor M&E systems, piloting was either
not conducted or not learned from.

23.    Objective 2. Developing the capacity of the Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research to carry out major reforms. (Rating – Modest)

24.     The HEP worked to strengthen capacity in the new MHESR through technical
assistance, professional development, and establishment of an MIS to serve the needs of the
Ministry and the higher education institutions. This component was integrated with on-going
Dutch projects for ministry strengthening and a higher education ICT Master Plan. These
projects absorbed the Ministry strengthening component of HEP and established an ICT
center for higher education. Within the ICT Master Plan, the HEP financed software
development, hardware, and training for one module of the MIS – for student registration –
which was functioning on a limited scale. Other modules had yet to be implemented. These
activities have not yet had a substantial impact on the capacity of the Ministry which still
lacks access to an adequate current information base for policy and planning.

25.     Outputs. Outputs of the project geared to building capacity for quality improvement
were mixed. The goal of piloting renewal of medicine, education and commerce programs
was not met, although a limited beneficiary survey conducted for the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) found that training in professional skills (English, computer and
pedagogical skills) was highly appreciated and found to be useful by recipients.83 Some
progress was made in quality assurance and accreditation (after receiving some training, two
universities drafted strategic plans – one considered acceptable -- and did some self-
evaluating), although the target indicators were not fully achieved. Self-evaluation was
conducted at selected faculties and relevant training was provided, but a specific guideline
was not produced as planned. For the accreditation, the contractor delivered draft standards
for accreditation of private higher education institutions, but these were not formally
endorsed or adopted. A proposal was prepared by the MHESR for a Quality Assurance
System and National Accreditation Council, and later was approved by Cabinet and
guidelines developed. The guidelines for the Accreditation Council were also prepared, but
due to the fact that a director has not been appointed, it has not become functional.


83
  The survey was conducted in compliance with Bank requirement for a LIC, but was of limited coverage,
having been conducted in two of the seven universities and having achieved a sample size of 43.
ANNEX B                                      70


26.     Although project capacity building results were assessed by trainees during
workshops and participants in project conferences to be positive, learning from project
activities and outputs was more limited than expected for a Learning and Innovation Project.
Evidence of this was the number of the intermediate output indicators that were not
addressed due to the lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation (M&E). For example,
although indicator 1 required the project use external evaluators in assessing the effectiveness
of technical assistance at least twice (mid-term-review and project closing); such an
assessment was never conducted. Similarly, indicator 4 stipulated that the project collect
“student and faculty feedback” on the faculty upgrading pilots but this was not consistently
done, resulting in a only a limited amount of faculty feedback, and none from students.
Finally, on indicator 5 (the cost-effectiveness of the training modules for faculty upgrading):
numerous faculty training modules were created, yet no cost-effective assessment was made.

27.     Other direct and indirect effects of the project. Expansion of the project scope, from
piloting in two universities to attempts at capacity building across the higher education
sector, significantly diluted project effects on specific project targets, but it did assure that
almost the entire university community was touched by HEP in some way. As concluded by
participants in a national conference held by the Ministry in 2008, training and workshop
activities under the project contributed to an increased level of understanding of the issues
facing the sector, and the breadth of stakeholder engagement in the dialogue on reform.
Also, a number of policy adjustments were made during HEP that were not explicit goals of
the project but arose from the sector reform dialogue generated by it. For example, some of
the problems identified at the time of preparation, such as unbalanced growth/spending
among education subsectors, were addressed through policy changes during project
implementation. Also, the public accepted a major decision by the Government to reduce the
pressures imposed by uncontrolled and imbalanced growth of higher education and facilitate
internal reform: new admissions were cut by 50 percent compared to the previous year. This
policy is ongoing and resulted in setting an admissions ceiling by the Higher Council of
Universities of 80,000 students: 55,000 to be admitted in public universities and 25,000 in
private universities in the academic year 2008-2009. Similar actions have dealt with
imbalanced enrollments, with enrollment in applied fields increasing by 50 percent over
2002-2007, and in social science/humanities decreasing by 5 percent. Along the same lines,
the strategic dialogue initiated through HEP contributed indirectly to development of a
rationalization plan (approved by the Cabinet in fall 2008), defining primary and secondary
fields of specialization among Yemen’s universities. This plan provides a strong basis for the
development of individual universities’ development plans and priority programs, to be
supported under the Higher Education Quality Improvement Project. Finally, by partnering
with the Dutch project, HEP indirectly contributed to the success of three competitively
selected graduate studies centers (two in Sana’a University and one in Aden University –
funded by the Dutch grant) that have achieved world-class stature, prompting HEQIP to
showcase a similar program under its quality improvement objective.

Efficiency
28.   Total disbursement for the project was only about 55 percent of the planned total,
which might have revealed high efficiency except for the fact that most of the project goals
                                               71                                      ANNEX B


were not met. Funds for the creation of the higher education strategy can be considered well
spent, but any for capacity were not, since little of the capacity building effort resulted in
tangible improvements in higher education management effectiveness and quality (project
outcomes). Moreover, as a Learning and Innovation Credit, the project was expected to
create new policy-relevant learning from evaluated pilots and reform strategy try-outs,
which, because of lack of piloting and M&E shortcomings, did not come to fruition,
meaning that any funds allocated for reform model testing were also inefficiently spent.
(Rated modest.)

Outcome
29.    The outcome of this project is rated as unsatisfactory, given the ratings of modest for
relevance of project objectives and design; modest for efficacy of the two objectives; and
modest for efficiency.

Monitoring and Evaluation
M&E Design

30.     Although the PAD identified weak M&E capacity in both the newly-created MHESR
and in Yemen's public administration in general, the project did not have a specific blueprint
for tracking project outputs and outcomes; let alone a comprehensive plan to plan to develop
M&E capacity for the sector. The PAD did specify that the project’s startup workshop would
produce an initial evaluation plan, but this never occurred. As a learning and innovation credit
this project was expected to generate a rich flow of information from the monitoring and evaluation
of its pilots and capacity building, but this was never done; instead HEP was redefined as a
partnership for wide subsector support (without formal restructuring), leaving its knowledge-building
functions unfulfilled.

M&E Implementation

31.    Project activities were scaled up without an assessment of their effectiveness. Also,
there was no systematic monitoring or evaluation of the project’s progress. Neither clear
monitorable indicators nor instruments to measure them were ever developed and there was
no M&E officer at the PCU until four months before the project closed. Instead of being
produced semi-annually, only two reports tracking implementation were ever produced over
the course of the project.

M&E Utilization

32.     Project monitoring, documentation, and reporting were deficient overall, and in any
case, the capacity of the PCU and MHESR to utilize M&E (including MIS) data to inform
budgeting,

33.     M&E Summary Rating: negligible.

Risk to Development Outcome
34.     Under the HEP, an ambitious National Strategy for the Development of Higher
Education in Yemen was created and widely endorsed though participatory processes, and
much technical assistance provided to help with implementing some of its reform ideas and
strategies. Many reform features that were to have been piloted on a limited scale already
were, in fact, brought to scale (introduced to all universities) within the unofficial expanded
scope of the project without having been tried out and evaluated, or were dropped in favor of
a broader higher education agenda. Thus, there were few of the original HEP outcomes
(aside for the National Strategy itself) that were achieved, and thus, few outcomes to be
carried into the future. This was applicable to the governance features that were to have been
piloted (e.g., linking university strategic plans to faculty budgets, improving the transparency
and accountability of budget execution) to creating accreditation guidelines, piloting a full set
of MIS modules, upgrading specific faculties, and establishing MHESP capacity for
evidenced planning and management). A feature of the joint sector support effort, that HEP
became a part of, was the competitive funding of three graduate studies centers (two in
Sana’a University and one in Aden University – funded by the Dutch grant) that have
achieved world-class stature and will endure and become exemplary programs into the
future. The funding of special studies centers, selected competitively on strength of their
proposals and their determination to address country development needs, is an idea that has
been taken up in the Bank-supported follow-on project, Higher Education Quality
Improvement Project. In addition, the initial work on quality assurance and accreditation
will be built upon. However, given their continued risky nature, future work on governance
and financing reforms will be scaled back to pilots again.84 (Rated Significant.)

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

35.     A participatory approach was taken to solicit feedback from various stakeholders, and
their feedback was well reflected in the initial project design. However, there was little
substantive analytical work conducted by the Bank preceding or during preparation, leaving
many baseline or contextual conditions unclear, such as prevailing governance and decision-
making patterns, planning and management capacity in the ministry and universities,
financial allocation and fiduciary management patterns (e.g., within the Ministry of Finance
and the universities), prevailing incentives and disincentives for higher education reform and
quality improvement, precedents for using piloting and related monitoring and evaluation as
inputs into program and policy formulation – a factor contributing to an unrealistic and
overly ambitious project design. Concerning the design, it is unfortunate that the Bank
design team did not ensure that an adequate M&E framework was in place prior to project
start-up, particularly given the fact that the project was a LIC. Also, in the PAD, the place
and definition of some proposed activities were left ambiguous (e.g., use of a competitive
fund; student aid; FMIS; cost-effective training modules), and project development


84
     See HEQIP Project Appraisal Document.
                                            73                                   ANNEX B


objectives (PDO) outcome indicators were both poorly defined and weakly related to the
project description. Finally, Bank supports for procurement, financial and contract
management (high risks, but not identified so) were not well established, contributing to
implementation and disbursement delays, and making it difficult for PCU managers to
effectively follow Bank guidelines. (Rated unsatisfactory)

Quality of Supervision

36.     Although the PAD states that close supervision would be provided, the intensity and
quality of Bank supervision efforts were uneven. None of the project’s four different Task
Team Leaders seem to have been provided adequate resources to ensure quality supervision:
for example, supervision shortcomings were apparent in the areas of continuous policy
dialogue, technical assistance and fiduciary support. Also, the Bank did not provide
sufficiently close guidance in Bank operational procedures, procurement guidelines,
managing contracts, and financial management issues, areas needing particularly intensive
support given that the PCU burdened with managing both Bank- and Dutch-financed
activities.

37.     In the period leading up to mid-term review in 2005, the Government pressed for an
expansion of the project’s scope and beneficiaries by merging it with other donors programs
and taking a broad subsector-wide approach. During the related discussions and
consultations the Bank team consistently supported the Government’s request to move
towards a broader higher education reform strategy. However, despite the expansion of
project scope and the dropping of some of the original objectives/activities, a formal
restructuring of the project was never formally proposed. The Bank team issued non-
objection to modifications of contracts – such as dropping the FMIS – without commenting
on the possible implications for meeting project objectives and indicators. The Government
was not even made aware until the final year of the expanded project that its outcome would
have to be evaluated against the development objectives it had originally agreed to.

38.     Finally ratings in Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) were unrealistic, with PDO
progress rated “satisfactory” even though the disbursement and overall implementation was
very slow, with missed deadlines repeatedly for planned activities, and the (legally required)
six-monthly reports were not available to substantiate the progress. These problems were not
raised forcefully in management review. Until the last year of the project, ISRs failed to
highlight the disconnect between planned activities and the agreed indicators. If the team had
focused fully on the implications of the changes proposed by the Ministry and considered a
formal restructuring, the trade offs and the capacity requirements could have been better
taken into account and the indicators revised to match agreed revised objectives. As it was,
the Ministry was not fully aware until a late stage that the project would be judged in terms
of the original indicators. (Rated highly unsatisfactory.)

39.    The overall rating for Bank Performance was highly unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
Government Performance

40.      MHESR facilitated the development and adoption of the National Higher Education
Strategy, developed relationships with other partners, including donors and universities, and
worked to ensure counterpart funding. Early on, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) allocated too
little funding, resulting in counterpart funding constraints. MHESR requested additional
funds from MOF, and also requested that Bank raise the percentage of Operational
Expenditures that could be financed from the credit from 25 percent to 100 percent.
However, cumbersome Government approval procedures contributed to implementation
delays. MHESR leadership changed during the first year of the project, and there was
inconsistent government commitment, ownership, and leadership, especially during the first
two years. Early in the project, implementation was also slowed by friction between MHESR
and the PCU partly stemming from ambiguity about their respective roles and
responsibilities. The Steering Committee was expected to meet semi-annually to review
progress and supervision reports, identify problems and take action to remedy them, but only
met once a year on average. Also, the Ministry was not proactive in recruiting efforts. (Rated
unsatisfactory.)

41.     Eventually, when the PCU reached full strength, it managed a large program of
technical assistance (8 contracts) which helped move the project along and contributed
significantly staff/management training. However, much of the time the PCU lacked
familiarity with Bank procurement rules and practices, and also suffered from lengthy
vacancies, poor delegation, and confusion among staff about responsibilities. Both the
Project Director and Financial Management officer positions were vacant for many months.
For most of the project, only one staff member was responsible for all aspects of accounting,
leaving the project’s internal controls at risk. The PCU never had a contract management
specialist. There was no M&E officer until four months before the project closed. Finally,
ambiguity about distribution of responsibilities among PCU staff resulted in some staff
members being overstretched even while some responsibilities fell through the cracks.
Though the Bank team raised concerns about these staffing and fiduciary issues, the PCU
either acted late or failed to act at all to address them. The DCA required that substantive
progress reports would be produced semi-annually, but by the end of the project only two
progress reports and seven financial monitoring reports were officially produced and these
did not include clear indicators or adequate objective measures to monitor and evaluate the
project. (Rated unsatisfactory)

Conclusions and Lessons Learned
Conclusions

43.     The Higher Education Learning and Innovation Project (HEP) was designed with the
modest expectations of a LIC – the drafting of a national strategy for higher education and
the piloting of the initial phases of its implementation. Despite a slow start, a comprehensive
                                                      75                                           ANNEX B


strategy document was eventually completed through a participatory processes involving
serious engagement of the university community. At that point the Ministry started to press
for implementing initial phases in all public universities, bolstered by its receipt of a
substantial grant from the Dutch government for higher education development across the
subsector. The Bank team acquiesced to this pressure, informally merging its HEP funds
with other donor resources in a system wide reform effort, and the concept of limited piloting
was set aside. So instead of trying out new approaches to university governance (creating
strategic plans and connecting faculty budgets to them through transparent processes), the
expanded project provided wide-ranging training in planning and financial management to all
rectors and their management cadres, but with little assessment of the effectiveness of the
training and how and how well the reforms could be internalized. Likewise, for quality
improvement, instead of upgrading the quality in a few exemplary departments in the pilot
universities, the expanded project provided general core training (in English, computer and
pedagogical skills) to staff members throughout the university community, again with little
assessment of the impact of this training (aside from participant satisfaction). The capacity
building in the MHESR for carrying out major reforms was similarly spread throughout the
higher education community. In the end this dramatic expansion of scope had the effect of
diluting the project impact and, ultimately, did not lead to any major insights into the
viability or effectiveness of reform elements in the strategic plan.

44.     One outstanding feature of the partnership program that HEP evolved into was
building up of several premiere university programs (funded by Dutch grant money), and
selected through a competitive process. Three such programs, in public management,
business management, and women’s studies, have become centers of excellence in their
respective universities, with the help of their Dutch university counterparts with which they
were “twinned.”85 Such an approach was mentioned in HEP PAD as a means of upgrading
departments, but was never implemented. However, it has now become a central feature of
the Bank-supported follow-on project, the HEQIP.86 That project has adopted a much
simpler design than that of HEP, laying aside system-wide attempts to build and implement
strategic plans, and to implement wide-reaching reforms in governance and financing
systems (for which the young Yemeni higher education system may not be ready). The
World Bank’s 2008 MENA higher education paper, “The Road Not Taken,”87 demonstrated
the need for attention to incentives and accountability in addition to “engineering” (quality
program building) in higher education reform. HEP has demonstrated that it may be too


85
  The Mission received no independent evaluations of these programs in Sana’a (the first two) and Aden
Universities (the third), but was informed (and observed) that the Dutch project worked to make them
equivalent in quality to their Dutch counterparts, and at least the MBA program was accredited by an
international body, the Association of MBAs.
86
   The Higher Education Quality Improvement Project (HEQIP), an IDA grant, was approved on 4/29/2010 for
US$13 million (equiv). Its main objective is to “create enabling conditions for the enhancement of the
quality of university programs and graduate employability” (p.3). Its main component (to absorb over half of
the funding) is to raise the quality of selected priority undergraduate programs in established public universities
through a Quality Improvement Fund (QIF). (See World Bank (2010), HEQIP PAD.)

early for widespread reforms in incentive and accountability systems; that the country is still
in the engineering stage. However, HEPII may be providing a path forward, by building into
its grants program both incentives (through competitive grant giving) and accountability
mechanisms (performance-based continued support), it can present small scale but
implementable examples of how engineering, incentives and accountability can work
together.88

Lessons Learned

45.    Among the many lessons learned from the implementation of HEP in Yemen are the
following:

         In cases where a good practice model is being tried out by the Bank and its country
          partnerships in a new location (like the model for higher education reform), it is
          important that this be preceded by significant sector analytical work of a kind that
          will predict the viability of a reform agenda or certain parts of it and the likely
          pockets of resistance;
         For projects that are created as Learning and Innovation Credits/Loans, and thus
          contain substantial piloting efforts, it is essential that a good M&E framework be part
          of the design and that government arrangements and capacity to implement the
          framework be secured prior to project start-up;
         When major features of a project are modified at the request of the borrower that
          affect fulfillment of original objectives or the continued relevance of performance
          indicators, formal restructuring must be initiated by the Bank team; otherwise,
          accounting for original expected outcomes becomes problematic;
         Capacity building for university managers and instructors needs to be grounded in a
          specific change program (e.g., creation of new departments or the implementation of
          accreditation procedures) as opposed to being given as a general training exercise,
          since there was no evidence in the project that such training led to changed behavior;
         For government institutions that have not had time to build up a presence and specific
          professional expertise (the MHESR was in existence one year before the approval of
          HEP), it is best to focus lending support on specific deliverables of a tangible sort
          instead of expecting the delivery of wide-spread reforms in governance and resource
          management -- a change in emphasis recognized in the follow-on Higher Education
          Quality Improvement Project;
         For a country with an educated unemployment rate as high as Yemen’s (54 percent
          during the project), more attention to the relevance of higher education to labor
          market needs (domestic and international) – lightly emphasized in the national
          strategic plan – is called for.


88
  The HEQIP design also shows learning from HEP about the need for good M&E indicators and strategies, as
evident in the following passage from its PAD, “One of the important lessons learned from [HEP] is that
monitoring and evaluation should play a central role during project implementation. Hence, the proposed
Project will systematically document all inputs, processes and outputs to detect in a timely manner whether
implementation is on track and whether project revisions and restructuring are needed. The Project will also
devote sufficient resources to assess the extent to which the Project has achieved the intended results (p. 7).

Annex C. Summary of Jordan Higher Education
Development Project Performance Assessment
1.     IEG assessed the performance of the Jordan Higher Education Development Project
(HEDP), in a cluster project performance assessment of two Jordanian education projects.
This Annex summarizes the findings of this evaluation pertaining to the Higher Education
Development Project. The full evaluation will be available on IEG’s website.

2.     The Jordan Higher Education Development Project with a total cost of US$65.8
million, was supported by an IBRD loan (No. 4539-JO) of US$34.7 million (equivalent).
The loan was approved on February 29, 2000, became effective on October 7, 2000 and
closed on June 30, 2007.

3.      With a Gross National Income per capita of $3,310 (2008), the economy of Jordan
depends very much upon remittances from its skilled labor working abroad in the oil rich
countries of the region and external grants/loans from international and regional partners.
During the 1970s the economy showed robust economic growth in the range of 10 percent as
oil prices were high and remittances from Jordanian workers abroad drove economic growth.
However, during the 1980s, especially after oil prices dropped, Jordan experienced a difficult
economic period. After working through an IMF adjustment program the economy
stabilized, but the robust growth of the 1970s has not yet resumed. In recent years the
Kingdom enjoyed good economic growth of about 6 to7 per cent except for a slowdown in
2009 with onset of the global financial crisis.

4.      Despite this good macroeconomic growth, there are still persistent problems with
high unemployment (overall about 12.1 percent in 2008), even among university graduates
(about 17.7 percent in 2005 and falling to 12 percent in 2008). Partly this is due to rapid
population and labor force growth which requires even higher rates of economic growth.
However, there is evidence that this unemployment problem also has structural causes rooted
in mismatches between job expectations and skills needed in the growing economy. Thus the
education system is in need of reforms to produce skills needed for the global knowledge
economy. Based upon concerns about the declining quality of its higher education, the
government requested the Bank to conduct an in-depth study, resulting in the “Jordan Higher
Education Development Study” (1996), which also set the stage for preparation of the Higher
Education Development Project (2000). The objective of the Jordan Higher Education
Development Project was to: “initiate improvements in the quality, relevance and efficiency
of higher education in Jordan and support the Government’s program to reform sector
governance”. The project aimed to achieve these objectives by investing in ICT, scientific
equipment and faculty training needed to upgrade university academic programs, as well as a
Management Information System (MIS) to improve system wide efficiency. The reform
program for sector governance aimed at increasing relevance by strengthening recently
created governance structures such as the Higher Education Accreditation Council for quality
assurance and the Higher Education Council for overall policy making. The system of
Community Colleges under the oversight of Al Balqa Applied University was to be reformed
to improve links to the labor market.

5.      The overall outcome of the HEDP is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Some
improvements in quality resulted from provision of much needed ICT equipment for teaching
and learning and some changes in teaching methods. However, the reforms of governance
fell short of most of their objectives. The Higher Education Council did not implement the
formula funding for recurrent budgets, the MIS needed for the formula funding was not
completed, the competitive fund for new academic programs only became fully competitive
near the end of the project, and the reforms of the CCs under the oversight of Al Balqa
Applied University to improve labor market relevance were not completed. Thus the
objectives for quality, relevance, efficiency and governance were only modestly attained.
The risk to development outcome is moderate since there are many outstanding issues in
reform to be addressed. The performance of the Bank was moderately unsatisfactory, given
the long delays in preparation and insufficient focus on reforms during supervision. The
performance of the Borrower was moderately unsatisfactory based upon insufficient
leadership for the reforms during implementation.

6.       The performance assessment draws the following lessons:

        The continuing high unemployment rates among university graduates is a cause for
         concern, despite attempts to make higher education more relevant. Although limited
         progress has been made, the higher education system can do much more to improve
         quality and relevance, including becoming actively linked in real time with the labor
         market and economy. It has been noted that more up to date labor market information
         is needed as well as much more private sector representation in the governance of
         universities and CCs. However, education is limited in how much it can do in job
         creation and economic and education reforms need to work together.

        Despite the problems in the first two rounds of the competitive higher education fund,
         the modest success of the third round demonstrated that such competitive funding
         mechanism can work in Jordan, if time and care are taken to adapt it to local
         circumstances.

        The difficulties experienced in the formula funding arrangement for recurrent higher
         education budgets were both technical and political. The technical part has to do with
         establishing a good MIS, which was almost achieved in the first project (and was still
         on the agenda for the second project that was cancelled). The political reasons had
         more to do with the difficulty of achieving a sufficient (not full) consensus among the
         stakeholders, and many informed observers believed that increasing the public budget
         to be allocated by formula funding would have helped in achieving sufficient
         consensus. Although this reform measure did not come to pass, it generated useful
         debate and may still be feasible if more political effort is forthcoming.

        Higher education curricula need to continue adapting to the new secondary graduates
         who have gone through the secondary education reforms, which emphasize less rote
         learning and more critical thinking and problem solving skills. The admission
         procedures for higher education need to adapt to the criteria of the knowledge
         economy.

   Purchase of physical equipment for IT and science/engineering labs can go much
    faster and with less controversy compared to changes in institutional behavior
    required by the reform agenda. There was much more agreement that universities
    lacked modern equipment and the benefits were widely spread. Agreement is more
    difficult to come by on institutional reforms at higher education level or to make rapid
    changes in teacher and school behavior at the basic education level.
