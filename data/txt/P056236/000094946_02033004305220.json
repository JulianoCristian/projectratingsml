Education Enhancement Project\n            aims at laying the foundation for improving the quality of\n            the higher education system in Egypt, through legislative\n            reform, institutional restructuring, and establishment of\n            independent quality assurance mechanisms, and monitoring\n            systems. The first component will support the\n            Government's efforts to restructure system governance,\n            and management, so that conditions are in place to support\n            improved sector efficiency, and quality. Specifically, the\n            component includes reforming legislation governing higher\n            education; rationalizing funding allocation practices -\n            financing international technical assistance for resource\n            allocation across higher institutions; establishing a\n            national quality assurance council, guided by technical\n            assistance in establishing the performance standards for an\n            accredited system of higher education. Management training,\n            and capacity building will be financed, as will the\n            establishment of an integrated management information\n            system, and of a project fund for higher education\n            institutions to improve teaching/learning abilities. The\n            second component will improve the quality, and relevance of\n            university education, through the establishment of an\n            information technology (IT) integrated computer, and network\n            infrastructure, and finance in-service training to develop\n            competencies in the application of computer technology,\n            particularly in teaching methodologies. Finally, the third\n            component will improve the quality, and relevance of\n            mid-level technical education, by consolidating middle\n            technical institutes into technical colleges, designing\n            relevant curriculum, and training instruction, and,\n            strengthening academic administration and management."}, "docdt": "2002-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
