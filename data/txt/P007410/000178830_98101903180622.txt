'I4TERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPT-MT
REPORT AND RECOi,MNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA
FOR THE SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various clurrencies equivalent to US$13.5 million to
Jamaica for the Second Education Project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the second project for which the Bank
has given financial assistance to Jamaica for implementation of its
Education Development Plan for 1966-1980.  In 1966 the Bdnk made a $9.5
million loan (468-JM) to assist Government in establishing 50 junior
secondary schools and in expanding teacher, agricultural, industrial and
commercial training facilities. Construction of the schools included in the
first project is expected to be completed by December 1971. In January 1970
Government submitted for the Bank's consideration a project prepared with
UNESCO assistance. A Bank mission visited Jamaica in Flay 1970 to appraise
this project.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed loan were held from January 11 to 15,
1971.  The Borrower was represented by 1-. Horace Barber, Deputy Financial
Secretary, Ninistry of Finance; lYr. Derry Marsh, Assistant Attorney-General;
Mr. L.P. Brown, Project Director, Ministry of Education; ,ir. K.E. Taylor,
Assistant Chief Education Officer; M1r. En-in L. Angus, Counsellor, ETbassy
of Jamaica in Washington; and br. G.R. Woodham, IELnistry of Finance.
4.        The proposed loan, the eighth to Jamaica, would increale the
Bank's total lending (net of cancellations) to US$60.0 million.' No IDA
credits have been made to Jamaica. The following is a summary of Bank
loans as of January 31, 1971:
1/        A telecommunications loan (No. 481-JM) made in 1967 to the
Jamaica Telephone Company was cancelled by the Borrower
during 1967. About $13,000 withdrawn under the loan was
repaid in full.

* Loan signed on December 28, 1970, but not yet effective.
5.        After the selection of the consultants for the highway project and
the reduction in its scope in 1968 because of major cost overruns,
construction work on the project has been proceeding satisfactorily. The
water supply project was delayed initially due to the slow award of a major
pipe contract. Disbursements began in November 1970, and the project is now
expected to proceed expeditiously. Regarding the population project, progress
has been made in the selection of the rural maternity center sites; design
work is under way, and disbursement can be expected to begin during the next
few months.
6.        Several new projects are at various stages of preparation.
A DFC-type project for industrial and hotel credit through the Jamaica
Development Bank (JDB) is expected to be ready for Bank financing by the
end of 1971, about the same time as a sewerage project for Kingston. The
Government also has approached the Bank for assistance toward financing the
highway sector, and airports, and the feasibility studies of these projects
are at an early stage of preparation.
7.        IFC has so far made two investments totalling US$3.14 million in
a hotel (Pegasus Hotel) and a cement manufacturing project.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
8.        Borrower:                 Jamaica
Amnount:                  US$13.5 million
Purpose:                  To finance the foreign exchange cost of
forty secondary schools, two teacher
training colleges, two vocational
training centers, and one ITV and
educational materials and aids center,
together with technical assistance and
services.
Amortization:             In 25 years, including a 10-year grace
period, through semi-annual installmen ts
beginning August 15, 1980 and ending
February 15, 1995.
Interest Rate:            V-44 per annum
Commitment Charge:        3/4 of 1% per annum
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal report entitled "A Second Education Project in
Jamaica" (No.PE-24a) is attached.
10.       Since the mid 1960's Government has addressed itself increasingly
to the country's education problems.  Government has been seeking ways to
curb the high rate of unemployment among the unskilled workers through
making education programs more relevant to the country's needs in the
industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors.  Shortages of skilled and
semi-skilled workers were found to exist as a result of the structural
deficiencies within the present educational system and also because of the
high rate of emigration among skilled workers. With the progress made on
the first Bank-financed education project the critical area of shortage
shifted to second cycle secondary education where the total enrollment of
15,200 was insufficient to meet the needs of the labor market. Furthernore,
technical high schools have experienced difficulties in recruiting teachers.
In an attempt to narrow the gap between the demand of the labor market and
the output of the educational system, the Government has asked the Bank for
assistance in financing a second education project.



- 4 -
11.       3he pronoed project would contrib-Lte towards achieving this
objective by increasinn  the enrollment capacity by about 19,300 new student
places.  To ensure that graduates acquire usable skills the senior department
of the primary schools would be gradually eliminated, and these students
would be transferred to junior secondary schools. This phasing out of the
senior departments would have the added benefit of alleviating the severe
overcrowding in the primary schools. Those pursuing their education under
the proposed first cycle program would be instructed in industrial arts,
agriculture and home economics.   The secondary cycle curriculum would include
pre-vocational courses in industrial, commercial, home economics, agricultural.
scientific and related subjects. These courses would prepare the students
for on-the-job training, for full employment, or further education. Admissicn
to the secondary cycle would be on a selective basis. To ensure effective
selection and provide competent guidance for interested students, the Pdnistry
of Education's Guidance and Testing Division would prepare over the next
two-year period all the proper testing materials. EhrolLment under the first
cycle, on the other hand, would be open to all students who have completed
primary education, with each school serving a group of primary feeder schools.
Teachers associated with the second-cycle program would require additional
external technical assistance, initially through expatriates financed under
bilateral assistance, mainly from the U.K. and Canada.
12.       The proposed project based on the foregoing program, consists of
the followring inter-related elements:
(a)    construction and equipment for extensions of 17 existing
high schools and the addition of facilities at 9 existing
junior secondary schools for converting them into
comprehensive schools; construction and equipment for two
new secondary comprehensive schools and twelve new junior
secondary schools;
(b)    construction and equipment for a new primary teacher training
college; additions to an existing teacher training college
and additions to the College of Arts, Science and Technology
(CAST) for establishing a Technical Teacher Training
Department;
(c)    construction and equipment for two new vocational training
centers;
(d)    construction and equipment for an Instructional Television
(ITV) and Education Niaterials and Aids Center;
(e)    technical assistance and fellowships for (i) developing
training programs for the comprehensive schools, (ii) improving
ITV services, (iii) supporting the teacher training programs,
(iv) establishing testing procedures, and (v) educational
planning; and
(f)    technical services to reinforce the project unit.



-5-
13.       The total cost of the project is estimated at approximately
US$28.2 million. The proposed loan of US$13.5 million would cover the
estimated foreign exchange component of the cost of civil works, equipment,
furniture and technical assistance, as well as interest and other charges
during construction on the proposed Bank loan. A small amount of local
cost financing might be involved if some specialists to be engaged under the
technical assistance program were Jamaican.
14.       The extension of CAST to establish a technical teacher training
department has been included in the project, but will be financed by the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) writh a loan repayable over
30 years (7 years of grace) at 3 percent. CIDA has an extensive program of
assistance in the field of education for construction, equipment and technical
assistance in Jamaica and CIDA will also extend assistance to CAST outside
of the project. If, for any reason, Canadian assistance is not forthcoming,
Government has undertaken to complete this work which is an important part
of the project.
15.       Contracts for civil works, equipment and furniture would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding. Bids would be invited in
the form of packages to encourage both international and local bids.   Local
manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be given a preferential margin
of up to 15 percent or the actual duty, whichever is lower. To avoid duplica-
tion of effort and cost, the architectural designs prepared for the schools
in the first education project would be used, wherever feasible, for similar
schools included in the proposed project.
16.       The proposed project would continue to be administered by the
Project Unit, which was established in the Ministry of Education for the
first education project. Serious cost overruns occurred in the first project,
mainly due to expenses relating to late site selection, changes in site
selection after design work had been completed and increases in the cost of
labor and materials.     Government is anxious to avoid a repetition of the
situation, and all of the sites have already been selected for t.he schools
under the new project. Furthermore, closer cost control will be provided
as a result of agreement reached during negotiations whereby the Project
Unit would be enlarged to include an architect, a quantity surveyor and an
equipment specialist.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUP0E4TS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan
Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern of agreements for other
education projects.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
18.       An econoniic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Jamaica" (No. WH-187a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
December 26, 1968. The report concluded that, on the whole, the performance
of the economy had been satisfactory, and that the outlook for further growth
was quite favorable. With the expected continuation of sound economic and
fiscal policies and a more active government role in fostering agriculture
and dealing with the high rate of population growth, Jamaica was considered
creditworthy for further external borrowing on conventional terms. A new
economic report on Jamaica is currently under preparation; it is not expected
to arrive at very different conclusions. A basic data sheet is attached.
19.       Economic growth has been vigorous through the last decade.   After a
slowdown in 1966/67, growth of GDP has accelerated again and is now just under
5 percent in real terms, the rate prevailing during the early 1960's. The
growth of the various sectors of the economy has, however, been very uneven.
Bauxite and alumina production, tourism, non-food manufacturing and con-
struction were the most dynamic sectors during the 1960's and attracted much
private foreign investment. Agriculture, except livestock production, virtu-
ally stagnated with output of the main export crops, sugar and bananas, falling
steadily.  The participation of agriculture in GDP declined between 1963 and
1969 from 12 percent to 9 percent, whereas over the same period bauxite arnd
alumina production increased theirs from 9.6 percent to 11.6 percent. The
growth was supported by a high level of investment, principally in the bauxite
and alumina and the tourist sectors.   Investment accounted for 29 percent of
GDP in 1969, against just over 20 percent before 1966. Hence the prospects
for attaining a somewihat faster growth in the next few years seem quite good.
There is much need to achieve this economic expansion in view of Jamaica's
chronic high unemployment (13-15 percent of labor force).   Balance of payment
constraints should not be a brake to a rate of growth of the economy of around
6 percent a year so long as inflation can be kept under control.
20.       Inflationary pressures have recently built up as a result of an
upward movement of wages, a steady expansion of credit, the 1967 devaluation
to maintain parity with sterling, and generally rising prices abroad. Union-
negotiated wage increases have outstripped money GDP for over a decade:   they
again exceeded 13 percent on an annual basis. The Government is unlikely to
jeopardize its political support in the labor movement by advocating an incomes
policy to restrain collective bargaining gains. The authorities are relying
on credit restraint instead.
21.       Fiscal performance on the level of the Central Government has been
good, while the rest of the public sector has incurred growing deficits which
have necessitated increased transfers to these entities. Shortages of quali-
fied personnel rather than of funds have acted as the main constraint to in-
creasing investment. Nevertheless, public investment has more than doubled
since the mid-sixties. By 1969 and probably in 1970, approximately 80 percent
of public investment was covered by the rising budgetary surpluses. This was



- 7 -
made possible by a rea7. ircrease in current revenues oIf more than 12 percent
per year between 1966 and 1969, while current expendituires increased by 9
percent per year in real terms over the same period. Until 1969, revenue
growth resulted principally from the increase in personal incomes and con-
sumption and in bauxite and alumina exports. Since then, new tax measures
were introduced which aim at reducing tax avoidance and at a higher taxation
of corporate incomes. Capital gains from land and shares and idle land held
by foreigners are now also made subject to taxation. As a result, current
revenue grew in 1969 by 21 percent and approached a proportion of 20 percent
of GDP. The increase in revenue is likely to remain vigorous until about
1972, but to taper off thereafter when, as expected, bauxite production
ceases to increase significantly and the effects of the recent tax measures
are no longer felt. Current expenditures will continue to grow at a high
rate, with spending on education and social services being stepped up further.
To deal with the serious shortages in qualified manpower throughout public
administration, the Government in 1970 granted substantial salary increases,
concentrated on the higher echelons, to be spread over three years. Public
investments are likely to increase only slowly over the next four years.
The sectoral allocation of Central Government investment is unlikely to
change substantially, with transport, agriculture and education remaining
the most important sectors and each accounting for about 20 percent of
the total.
22.       The public debt is still fairly low.  The foreign debt contracted
by the end of 1969 was US$754 million (including undisbursed). Total debt
service amounted in 1969 to just under 12 percent of current revenues; service
on external debt alone amounted to 3.5 percent of export receipts (net of
factor income payments). Future borrowing, though considerably higher than
in the past few years, is expected to remain prudent.  Under these conditions,
Jamaica should remain creditworthy for considerable amounts of external
borrowing at conventional terms.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREE miNT
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOfN0vlDATION
24.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
