       Health Sector Reform Program Project for Lesotho were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            an operation can well maintain its relevance and\n            effectiveness if it is aligned with the Government's\n            own health reform program. This operation, designed to\n            support Lesotho's health sector reform program, was not\n            only appreciated by the Government, but also helped the Bank\n            provide consistent and targeted support over a relatively\n            long period of time. Similarly, a small operation could have\n            a significant impact if it is well aligned with the overall\n            health sector reform agenda. Where posts that are initially\n            funded under a project are expected to be subsumed into the\n            public service, the process of hiring should be consistent\n            with the public service regulations in order for the posts\n            to be formalized at project closing. In the absence of this,\n            it is not possible for specialists initially hired on a\n            contractual basis to be regularized to be part of the civil\n            service once the posts are approved by the public service\n            commission. Maintaining a good working relationship with and\n            winning the trust of the clients will make the Bank\n            operations more effective. One of the reasons for this small\n            operation to have a significant impact is that the Bank\n            maintained constructive dialogue with both the senior\n            management (including the Minister of Finance and Minister\n            of Health) and the implementation level of the Government."}, "docdt": "2010-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
