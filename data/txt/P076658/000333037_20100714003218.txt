    6.1 Context at Appraisal

           1.      Economic context and sectoral background.6 In 2005 Lesotho's GDP per capita was at
           US$570, and the country was better off than many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. However,
           despite average real GDP growth of about four percent per year, 48.3 percent of its population
           of 2 million was living below the poverty line, and the country ranked 149th out of 175 in the
           United Nations Human Development Index (in 2005).7 Health outcomes in Lesotho have been
           dominated by the effects of HIV/AIDS, with many indicators such as infant mortality and under-
           5 child mortality increasing after showing some signs of improvement in the 1980s and 1990s
           (Figure 10 in Annex 11). Life expectancy showed a dramatic decline after reaching a peak at 60
           years in the early 1990s--in fact, in 2007 the country's life expectancy (36.8 years) was lower
           than it was in the 1960s (Figure 5 in Annex 5). In sum, while the country's economic growth has
           been strong for most of the decade, the paths of economic growth and human development have
           started to diverge.

           2.      Health sector reform. The structure of the health system is summarized in Box 1. In
           2000, the Government of Lesotho (GOL) embarked upon a 10-year Health Sector Reform
           Program in order to strengthen health care delivery services, and achieve a sustainable increase
           in access to quality preventive, curative and rehabilitative health care in Lesotho. The reform
           program was designed in three phases: Phase I focused on building institutional capacity, Phase
           II focused on testing alternative policy and institutional reform strategies to improve service
           delivery, and Phase III involved nationwide implementation of the reform strategies and
           replacement of the national referral hospital, Queen Elizabeth II (QE-II) Hospital.8 The main
           areas of reform were: health financing, human resources, district health services,
           decentralization, pharmaceuticals, infrastructure and partnerships. The Phase I operation was
           rated satisfactory, in part because of the sound design of the operation, a view also echoed by
           QAG in its quality-at-entry review. Phase II of the program commenced after all the triggers for
           moving from Phase I to II were met (Table 18 in Annex 9).

           3.     SWAp. Donor support to the Lesotho health sector has been through a sector-wide
           approach (SWAp), with coordinated policy advice by partners, an agreed sector expenditure
           framework, harmonized fiduciary systems and common performance indicators. At the time of
           appraisal the project had just completed the first phase of the Health Sector Reform (HSR)
           Program.9 The premise of the design was that the ability Ministry of Health and Social Welfare

  Lesotho is a small mountain Kingdom landlocked by South Africa. Just over a tenth of the country's 30,355 square kilometers is arable land, and the
country is divided into four ecological zones, the Lowlands, Foothills, Mountains and Senqu River Valley. This parliamentary constitutional monarchy
gained its independence in 1966 after being a British colony for almost 100 years (1868-1966). In 2005 an elected local Government system was established
and this formed the basis of 10 district councils which incorporated the traditional authorities (Chiefs), alongside the pre-existing district administration
(representing the central Government). The legal and fiscal frameworks for the local government structures are evolving and in 2008 the Local Government
Service Act was passed.

  In the last few years the health sector has been receiving more and more donor resources and the importance of the long term sectoral reforms to improve
coherence in donor support became even more important.

 Box 1. Structure of Health System
 The health system is managed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW). Aside from the emerging private
 sector, service delivery is mainly through the MOHSW and faith-based organizations, of which the largest by far is the
 Christian Health Association of Lesotho (CHAL). The health system is divided into four levels: (i) tertiary and specialized
 hospitals; (ii) district hospitals; (iii) health centers and clinics; (iv) village health workers. The 10 health districts coincide
 with the 10 administrative districts (after several years of having 18 health service areas which did not coincide with the
 local government administrative demarcation). Health service delivery in each district is overseen by district health
 management teams, headed by a district medical officer. During the health reforms in the early half of the decade a process
 of decentralization was envisioned whereby the district health management teams would eventually be responsible for the
 management of the delivery of primary health services within the district (i.e., health centers and below). Hospital services
 were to remain the responsibility of the MOHSW. A national health policy was defined in 1993, committing the nation to
 "progressively attaining: (i) universal coverage so that every citizen will have access to essential health care, (ii) social
 justice and (iii) equity." The 1995/96-1999/2000 Health Sector Plan was a systematic attempt to identify priorities and
 better plan health care delivery. The objective of the government's Health Sector Reform Program, which has been
 implemented in two phases, is to achieve a sustainable increase in access to quality preventive, curative and rehabilitative
 health care services in Lesotho.


4.      Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank has played a leading role in the reform
program and in facilitating the SWAp based on its comparative advantages: institutional
development and the development of systems to facilitate a more coordinated donor and
government support to the health sector, ability to inform macroeconomic and fiscal policy
related to the health sector, and experience and expertise in health financing. A further rationale
was that at the time of appraisal, there were few development assistance agencies supporting the
health sector in Lesotho. The main financing agencies being the African Development Bank
(AfDB), Development Cooperation Ireland (Irish Aid), IDA and technical support from UN
agencies such as WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA. Most of these had small country offices and Irish
Aid was the only bilateral agency that over the project implementation period had health sector
expertise in country. The European Union, which provided substantial support through technical
assistance during the first phase of the program, by 2005 no longer provided such support.

5.      Links with the CAS. At appraisal the new CAS was being developed (see Box 2). The
operation's objectives were consistent with Lesotho's 1998 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
and in support of the Lesotho's Poverty Reduction Strategy (2004-2007). The improvement of
public service delivery and access to health care and social welfare are key priorities of the
Poverty Reduction Strategy.

6.       Political context. A key element of the reforms was decentralization. For many years
progress in decentralization in the sector was constrained by uncertainty about local government
institutional reform. In 2005 local government elections were conducted (followed by the
promulgation of the Local Government Act in 2008). These events provided important
institutional context to the health sector's decentralization reforms. Decentralization has also
been highly politicized and was embroiled in the party political campaigning and political
conflicts in the late 1990s.

     6.2 Original Project Development Objective(s)

           7.      The development objective of the Health Sector Reform Program Phase II (the Project) is
           to increase access to, and quality delivery of, essential health services.10 The PDO encompassed
           the breadth of the reform agenda, while focusing on the ultimate objective of the reforms,
           namely to improve service delivery. The development objective is aligned with the overall goal
           of the MOHSW's reform program--to achieve a sustainable increase in access to quality
           preventive, curative and rehabilitative health services--while selectively focusing project efforts
           on essential health services11 (rather than the ambitious scope of the reform program on
           "preventive, curative and rehabilitative health services").

     6.3 Revised Project Development Objective(s)

           8.          The project objective was not revised.

     6.4 Main Beneficiaries

           9.       The project had no specific geographic focus, in part because of the small size of the
           country.12 The project financed various health system improvements at the headquarters of the
           MOHSW, as well as at the district level. Given the activities financed by the project (Table 12
           and in Annex 4), the primary beneficiaries were health professionals and staff of MOHSW and
           the Christian Health Association of Lesotho (CHAL)13 whose human resource as well as
           institutional capacities were enhanced through project inputs. These upstream investments were


10
   This is the version of the project objective in the PAD front matter (p2) and the Results Framework (PAD, p26). In the PAD text (p7) and the DCA (p20)
the project objective is stated as "The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower in achieving a sustainable increase in access to quality preventive,
curative, and rehabilitative health services by increasing access to, and quality delivery of, essential health services." The former is used as the project
objective in this evaluation.
11
   Essential health services were not formally defined in the PAD, but it was generally understood to encompass the package of services provided at district-
level facilities (the "District Services Package").
12
   The country's geographic size is 30,355 square kilometers.
13
   Approximately half of the health facilities in the country belong to CHAL.



                                                                                3
           a means to the end of improving service delivery to the population of Lesotho and therefore the
           intended secondary beneficiaries were all Basotho. On the surface there is only a weak pro-poor
           focus in the project design, but the emphasis on decentralization and improving service delivery
           to rural areas is clearly pro-poor.

    6.5 Original Components

           10.     Component 1. Essential Health Services Delivery: (appraisal estimate: US$2.96
           million/46 percent of estimated cost; actual cost: US$2.9 million/46 percent of actual cost): The
           delinking14 of public health service management (under the management of DHMTs) from
           management of hospitals at the district level was proposed as a way to improve the effectiveness
           of the delivery of priority health interventions at district and community levels. The program
           supported the establishment of district health management teams (DHMTs) in all the ten districts
           and provided support for office space, information technology (IT) equipment, training and
           transport so that the DHMTs function properly, consistent with the GOL decentralization
           process, improved quality assurance process and improved drug regulatory environment.

           11.    Component 2. Strengthening Human Resources: (appraisal estimate: US$0.4 million/6
           percent of estimated cost; actual cost: US$0.52 million/8 percent of actual cost): Building on the
           Phase I's analytical work (e.g., a human resource needs assessment and strategic plan) the
           program endeavored to support innovative approaches required to address the severe constraints
           in human resources.

           12.     Component 3. Improving efficiency of health sector financing, financial
           management and planning: (appraisal estimate: US$1.53 million/24 percent of estimated cost;
           actual cost: US$1.53 million/25 percent of actual cost): The program supported the further
           development and implementation of a national health sector financing policy building on the
           roadmap for development of a financing policy from Phase I. The project supported the
           development of alternative health financing instruments and risk pooling mechanisms (including
           social health insurance, and community health financing) and assessment of the feasibility of
           such options in the Lesotho context. The project further strengthened the financial management
           system and the medium-term sector expenditure program process linked to the overall GOL
           MTEF. Alternative strategies for resource allocation to improve service delivery will be tested
           and monitored. For example, the effects of providing additional resources for basic service
           provision at the district level.

           13.    Component 4. Queen Elizabeth II Hospital Component/Improving referral care:
           (appraisal estimate: US$1.34 million/21 percent of estimated cost; actual cost: US$1.3 million/21
           percent of actual cost): The government was committed to replacing the old QE-II Hospital
           which should serve as the apex institution for the country's referral system. The construction of
           the new referral hospital was tied to the necessary reforms in hospital administration and
           management under the public-private partnership arrangement. IDA's engagement in the


14
   Delinking refers to the separation of management and financing of the management of clinical services and public health services. Previously both were
under the responsibility of the District Medical Officer. After the reforms the DMO was responsible for clinical services (delivered largely at the district
hospitals but also at health centers) and the District Health Management Team was responsible for public health services (delivered largely at the health
centers).



                                                                              4
          replacement was intended to ensure that the new facility is designed to deliver an affordable and
          cost-effective package of services. Phase II supported preparatory activities for the new hospital,
          including an environmental assessment and technical assistance for the Government to manage
          the PPP transaction process. Phase II also supported the implementation of a Health Care Waste
          Management (HCWM) Plan in the health sector that was prepared in March 2005.

     6.6 Revised Components

          14.        The components were not revised.

     6.7 Other significant changes

          15.    The project was not restructured. There are examples of other changes that were
          reasonable choices made by the team:
                 The scope of the waste management initiatives was reduced, and the provision of
                 protective clothing was dropped. This activity was included in the support financed by
                 the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).
                 The building of the replacement referral hospital was originally planned for Phase III of
                 the APL. The deterioration of QE-II Hospital and the continuing expenditure escalation
                 caused the planning for the replacement to start earlier. The involvement of the IFC was
                 also not fully planned. The IFC Advisory Services and their support in managing the
                 bidding process--both important contributions--were also not anticipated in the PAD.
                 While not anticipated the team was proactive and did the right thing.15

          16.     Cost and Financing. The cost of the overall program was estimated at US$135.1 million
          and this was to be financed by the GOL and eight donors (including US6.5 million from IDA).
          At closing the IDA credit was 98.1 percent disbursed (actual: US$ 6.4 million), which is in part
          due to the significant exchange rate gains (in the order of US$ 1 million).16

          17.     Dates. The project became effective about three months later than anticipated. The
          closing date was extended once by six months--according to project documents due to slow
          start-up in the first year. At the original closing date (March 31, 2009) the project had disbursed
          US$1.9 million out of the total grant allocation of US$4.5 million (42 percent disbursed). It is,
          however, important to add that an additional third of the credit proceeds had been committed at
          that time. The extension was to allow for the successful completion of project activities, in
          particular: (i) continued strengthening of the district health service delivery system through skills
          development and provision of office space to support District Health Management Teams; (ii)
          finalization of a short-term consultancy on Social Health Insurance; (iii) continued support to
          human resources management and professional staff to delivery health services; and (iv)
          continuing implementation of the health care waste management plan.




15
   The team mobilized additional resources (US$6.5 million) through the Global Partnership on Output-based Aid (GPOBA) for renovation of satellite
clinics as part of the PPP arrangement.
16
   The Lesotho Loti (LSL) is pegged to the South African Rand (ZAR). South Africa is Lesotho's largest trading partner and a large share of the
procurement was from South Africa. While the USD experienced a small weakening relative to the SDR (-4 percent), the ZAR experienced an appreciation
relative to the USD (+22 percent). These exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a ZAR7.9 million gain over the project period (see Table 6 in Annex 1).



                                                                           5
     7. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

     7.1 Project Preparation, Design Stage, and Quality at Entry

           18.     Project preparation was detailed and took place over a period of two years.17 Background
           analysis was thorough and as remarked by QAG in the QAE, the quality of the analysis and
           recommendations regarding the QE-II hospital replacement were particularly strong. The
           analysis provided a powerful rationale for the project and the Bank's involvement. QAG
           remarked that the there could have been a sharper focus on distributional aspects and equity
           concerns. This may be true to a certain extent, but a major rationale for the decentralization was
           to improve service delivery especially in rural areas, so indirectly the analysis did in fact reflect
           equity concerns.

           19.     The choice of the triggers (Table 18 and Table 19 in Annex 9) were reasonable as they
           either (i) addressed challenges that the sector was struggling with (e.g., budget execution), or
           were (ii) key milestones in the reform program (e.g., the QE-II Hospital PPP, district health
           management teams have control over their budgets). The fact that the triggers were mainly
           process-oriented is not a problem as it reflects the content of the reform program.

           20.     The project dealt with some difficult issues that in any environment would be challenging
           (decentralization, health financing policy and health insurance reform, human resource reforms
           etc.). This risk was managed by focusing on the upstream inputs for some of these complex
           topics--for example, in the area of health insurance, the project focused on analytical work to
           inform decision-making regarding insurance reform, rather than actual implementation of the
           reform.

           21.     The importance of the decentralization reforms may be questioned in a small country
           such as Lesotho. But, despite the small geographic area, the country is highly centralized in part
           because of its mountainous geography, urbanization and concentration of economic opportunity
           in the capital and major centers. The result is that oversight and supervision by MOHSW
           headquarters-based staff have proven to be ineffective after many years of attempts to improve
           the supervision of district health services. The MOHSW had realized this in the late 1990s, and
           the MOHSW's decentralization efforts were ahead of other sectors. However, for many years
           these efforts were hamstrung by the political and capacity-related factors constraining local
           government development.18

           22.     Lending instrument.19 The lending instrument--through a phased Adaptable Program
           Loan (APL)--was appropriate given the timeframe required to realize sustainable institutional
           change, and the sector-wide nature of the investment. The APL also offered continuity of
           engagement on issues that were critical to implement a multi-year reform agenda. This project is
           one of the few SWAps (the only at the time of approval) that was financed through an APL. The
           instrument offers flexibility within a multi-phase cycle that is appropriate for a reform program.



17
   The Project Concept Note Review meeting was in September 2003, and the project was approved in October 2005.
18
   In recent years decentralization became official government policy for improving service delivery across various sectors.
19
   Phase I of the ten-year APL was implemented from 2000-2005.



                                                                              6
           23.    Lessons learned and reflected in the project design. The preparation of the
           Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Phase I APL was initiated early so that the
           lessons could inform the design the Phase II. These include:
                  Country ownership and commitment to the reform is key to successful implementation.
                  Phase I was preceded by extensive consultation among stakeholders on the vision for the
                  reforms. While there was a high degree of participation and this consultation did not
                  fully translate into full ownership of the reform program among all units in MOHSW--in
                  particular ownership appeared to be higher among the HPSD than other parts of the
                  MOHSW, and higher among headquarters than at the district-level .
                  Reform change takes time. The implementation of Phase I took longer than planned,
                  especially those activities that were integrally related to processes and decisions beyond
                  the MOHSW. Two examples are: policy decisions and actions in areas such as human
                  resource (which involved the Civil Services Commission) and decentralization (which
                  involves the Ministry of Local Government).
                  Success of reform is dependent on sufficient human resource capacity. The human
                  resource shortages are often and widely cited as reasons for weak service delivery. Phase
                  I supported analyses of health manpower (numbers, skills, deployment and motivation)
                  and Phase II was supposed to implement innovative strategies for retention and
                  performance improvement of health sector workers.
                  Continued monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is key to assessing the impact of reform.
                  M&E was one of the weakest performing areas in Phase I, and despite the intentions to
                  improve M&E quality and implementation, it continued to be a serious weakness. Many
                  of the weaknesses in implementation of M&E could be traced to weaknesses in design
                  (choice of indicators, absence of some baseline and almost all endline targets--see M&E
                  section).

           24.     Risks and their mitigation. At appraisal important risks were identified.20 The risk
           mitigation measures were generally adequate, as reflected in the design. One important risk was
           that infrastructure investment in a new referral hospital without improved performance could
           lead to greater allocative and technical inefficiencies in the sector.21 The use of a PPP approach
           that included clear prescriptions regarding service delivery was an important positive feature of
           the design to improve technical efficiency. It does not, however, fully address the allocative
           efficiency concern--namely the potential impact on resource allocation between basic and
           tertiary health services. The strong emphasis on cost-containment and value-for-money in the
           PPP design partially addresses this risk. Another risk was that HIV/AIDS continues unabated.
           While HIV prevalence remains among the highest globally (despite large increases in allocations
           for HIV/AIDS control by development partners, including complementary efforts from the
           Bank22) the explosion in health service utilization did not occur.23

20
   The risks were: (i) HIV/AIDS prevalence in Lesotho may continue unabated and undermine the health sector's contribution to better outcomes; (ii)
Institutional capacity, while improved during Phase I, remains weak and results in delayed implementation of Phase 11; (iii) Government of Lesotho not able
to sustain its budget allocation to the health sector; (iv) Private medical aid scheme for civil servants may negatively distort health sector spending away
from basic services to higher level services and may not meet expectations of civil servants; and (v) Investment in a new QE I1 hospital could lead to greater
allocative and technical inefficiencies.
21
   As discussed in Annex 5 the potential technical efficiency gains stems largely from the persistent management weaknesses that dogged QE-II Hospital for
years, coupled with escalating costs. In fact, QE-II Hospital was the cost center that experienced the largest annual cost escalation compared.

           25.     Adequacy of government's commitment, stakeholder involvement, and/or participatory
           processes. The commitment of the MOHSW to the reform agenda is high and this project was a
           key part of implementing the health sector's reform agenda. The commitment of the Ministry of
           Finance and Development Planning (MOFDP) was also high, although the commitment of other
           parts of the government that also affected by the project (e.g., Ministry of Local Government,
           local government authorities and Ministry of Public Service) was uneven. Stakeholder
           consultation during project preparation was not as strong as it was in the HSRP-I.

     7.2 Implementation

           (a) Decentralization24 and service delivery

           26.      Establishment of functioning district health management teams. Despite a number of
           challenges in the decentralization process, the capacity of the District Health Management
           Teams (DHMTs) has been gradually strengthened both in hardware (e.g., office space, vehicles,
           office equipment) and in software (guidelines, operating procedures, skills-building following in-
           service training). The project was responsible for the recruitment of 10 accountants to establish
           the financial management systems needed to operationalize the expenditure responsibilities at the
           district level. Some of the project's achievements include: (i) the formulation of the MOHSW
           Decentralization Strategy;25 (ii) the official demarcation of all 10 districts as health planning and
           governance boundaries;26 (iii) the creation of separate cost centers for hospital services and
           primary health services, with the latter under the purview of the District Health Management
           Teams (DHMTs), separation of the budget accounts for the district hospital and DHMT, and
           bringing budget accountability closer to expenditure responsibility;27 and (iv) the establishment,
           staffing, and equipping of DHMTs with dedicated offices: on average, 60 percent of DHMT core
           staff had been posted (by February 2008); (v) a Decentralization Coordinator was recruited (with
           support of Irish Aid) and worked closely with the Director of PHC to strengthen the DHMTs in
           health service delivery at district level.

           27.        Some of the challenges include:
                      Definition of roles and responsibilities: The functionality of the district financial
                      management system was initially hampered by the lack of regulations and guidance on
                      disbursement and signature processes. There was considerable confusion surrounding
                      issues such as reporting lines, roles and responsibilities of the DHMTs, and implications
                      for roles and responsibilities of headquarter programs. A pilot was implemented but
                      there was no formal mechanism of assessment the pilots prior to expanding the model.


24
   The form of decentralization implemented in Lesotho is strictly termed deconcentration--the assignment of decentralized administrative responsibility for
specific service delivery responsibility. This is, however, not the weakness of the MOHSW, but of the overall government-wide institutional form of
decentralization in Lesotho that has been implemented.
25
   The health sector was a leader in operationalizing political commitments for service delivery. In many ways the health sector was ahead of the
decentralization curve, but was hamstrung by actions and institutional arrangements that were beyond the control of the MOHSW not being implemented or
resolved in a timely manner.
26
   For many years the health sector was divided into 18 health service areas (HSAs). These HSAs did not coincide with the local administrative boundaries
and this complicated planning as well as accountability for service delivery, and was a critical determinant of the success of the decentralization reforms.
27
   Financial transfers from the center are now made to the respective accounts and the district medical officer (head of clinical services) and the DHMT (who
oversees public health services delivered at health centers) are separately accountable for budget execution. This is an important achievement because when
health center budgets were previously subsumed under hospital budgets, allocations for public health services often suffered and preference was given to
hospital-based clinical services.



                                                                             8
                       Creation and institutionalization of key posts: Posts of the District Health Management
                       Team (DHMT) have been filled under the project, but two key posts, the Director of
                       District Health and Social Welfare Services and District Health Information Officer,
                       remain vacant in part due to the weak capacity at the local level, but also due to the
                       necessary agreements not being secured with the Ministry of Public Service.

           28.     Quality assurance. The quality assurance efforts ensured that the decentralization
           reforms mentioned above were linked to service delivery improvements. In 2004 the
           government commissioned a rapid assessment of: (i) the status of quality assurance and (ii) the
           feasibility of a quality assurance program. In 2006 national consultations on quality assurance
           were conducted and standards and systems of implementation were developed. A National
           Quality Assurance Committee was established, accreditation trainers were trained and a clinical
           auditor was identified in every CHAL and MOHSW hospital. A Quality Assurance Board for
           Accreditation of CHAL institutions has been established. The first round of a national
           accreditation survey (based on hospital accreditation standards from South Africa, an
           unreasonable benchmark to start off with) was conducted in 2007 and none of the hospitals or
           health centers achieved the threshold for accreditation. Following the assessment the institutions
           were supported to address some of the problems identified.28 While the performance in the first
           round was below expectations, the explicit emphasis on service quality and awareness raised
           through facilities' participation in the accreditation process created positive externalities for
           service delivery.

           29.     Drug regulatory environment. The department's attempt to strengthen the central level
           in order to provide technical leadership to the improved drug regulatory process was hampered
           by lack of appropriate staff. Initial progress was slow (hampered by failure to have the new
           posts at the central level approved) but this improved over time and two officers for drug
           regulation. In 2008 a Draft Bill on the National Medicine Act was presented to the Parliament
           Counsel for consideration, but there were delays in processing the Bill which were beyond the
           MOHSW's powers. A Medicine Access Survey was conducted in all hospitals and 62 health
           centers in 2008. The report showed an average of 89 percent drug availability of the selected
           drugs classified by disease condition commonly treated using the drug. An average of 1.6
           percent of the selected drugs was found to be expired in the hospitals (see Table 22 in Annex
           11).29

           (b) Health care financing and financial management

           30.    Health financing policy. During Phase I a consultancy outlined a roadmap for
           development of a health financing policy. The planned activities were executed--a health
           financing consultancy was successfully completed in 2008,30 and two key studies on district
           resource allocation and social health insurance were completed. Informed by these studies, the
           Health Expenditure Review was completed in 2010 that pulled the various issues together, but


28
   By late 2007 the National Quality Assurance Accreditation trainers in collaboration with COHSASA (Council for Health Service Accreditation of
Southern Africa) began the process of fine-tuning the standards in light of the first round experiences and the need to establish a facilitated accreditation
program. Consensus was reached on the new standards and assessment of the first 16 hospitals and 32 health centers was undertaken in 2008.

   Omnibus Study on Health Financing in Lesotho



                                                                                9
           follow-up in terms of decision-making on health financing policy is still unclear. The approval
           of the Health Financing Policy has not been achieved, as anticipated. It is appropriate that the
           policy approval was not rushed to meet the project dead-line given the face of policy
           disagreements (see discussion on Health Insurance).

           31.     User fees. The PAD recommended the exploration of pro-poor mechanisms to improve
           the equity of sector financing. To this end, the GOL (i) abolished user fees at the primary level
           for both government and CHAL facilities in 2007 and (ii) standardized hospital fees among GOL
           and CHAL hospitals. These were important achievements from an equity perspective because
           CHAL facilities charged higher user fees while generally serving the remotest districts. Under
           the MOU signed by GOL and CHAL facilities, CHAL was reimbursed by government for
           foregone fee revenues.31

           32.     Health Insurance. The PAD encouraged the use of risk-pooling arrangements as a means
           of improving the efficiency and sustainability of sector financing. The project funded a
           feasibility assessment and detailed actuarial analysis of a proposed social health insurance (SHI)
           program. The study was completed with close collaboration with a team from WHO. A
           Technical Working Group with representation from relevant government ministries was
           organized to spearhead the SHI initiative. The project also funded a team of Basotho on a study
           tour to visit and understand the functioning of the Tanzania National Health Insurance Fund.

           33.      At one point the government wanted to approve a health insurance scheme for civil
           servants that was poorly conceived, potentially inflationary in a weak regulatory environment
           and did not fully consider the civil service implications (as it affected the remuneration package
           of civil servants). The Bank successfully intervened and with the assistance of one of the Bank
           leading health economists was able to convince the MOFDP not to proceed.

           34.    Action towards establishing this scheme has been overtaken by a pension initiative--the
           2008 Budget Speech announced a substantial across-the-board increase in civil servant salaries to
           accommodate the planned pension program. The overtaking of the health insurance policy
           dialogue by the pension initiative is perhaps not surprising given that the dialogue on health
           insurance in Lesotho has been mainly focused on expanding the benefit package of civil
           servants, and less on risk pooling and the introduction of pre-payment to reduce of out-of-pocket
           spending as a barrier to access.

           35.     Budget execution. While the MOHSW budget significantly increased over the project's
           lifespan, the budget execution (i.e., actual spending) has continued to lag. This is a problem of
           budget planning as well as expenditure. Important steps toward improving coordination and
           coherence between capital and recurrent planning have been taken. One example is the
           integration of the project accounting unit and the procurement unit (both under the Health
           Planning and Statistics Department, HPSD) with the accounting office in MOHSW (under the
           Accountant General's office and MOFDP) in 2008.32 Another example is the separation of the


31
   There are anecdotal reports that the new user fee policy has increased patient volumes in CHAL facilities. The increase in utilization entailed an increase
in cost reimbursement to CHAL which was funded by GOL, as specified in the CHAL MOU.
32
   This integration is consistent with government-wide reforms and the integration of the Ministries of Planning and Finance.



                                                                              10
              district hospital and DHMT cost centers. These reforms do not guarantee fully improved budget
              execution, and continued work is needed. There have been some improvements, but challenges
              on the expenditure side remain (see discussion under Effectiveness).

              36.    Strengthen the financial management system. During project implementation the
              financial management system in MOHSW required additional support to build capacity and
              improve coordination. Early during the project the project accounting unit (PAU) was not
              producing financial management reports for the project as required by the project's Legal
              Agreement, but was using a self-designed financial and disbursement table. The team provided
              support33 to the PAU and compliance subsequently improved.

              (c) Human resources

              37.      The PAD (p33) identified key activities that were to be implemented, but there is very
              little evidence that these were in fact implemented. Phase II was supposed to: (i) support
              innovative development and use of e-classrooms for continuing professional education by health
              workers; (ii) facilitate the review and development of curriculum to make trained nurses multi-
              skilled; (iii) assist the MOHSW in developing a health worker posting policy where staff skills
              are matched with service delivery needs; (iv) support continuing education opportunities for
              contracted medical officers and nurses and career advancement opportunities; (v) assess the
              training requirements for staff in the sector--in light of the skill requirements and attrition
              projections--and support ways to align the training programs with new career management
              structures developed.

              38.      There was a strong emphasis in the Bank's dialogue and project oversight in this area on
              supply of human resources. Despite some recruitments, approximately a fifth of established
              posts remain unfilled. Uncertainties for health staff being transferred to local government as part
              of the decentralization have further complicated the situation. In 2008 an Emergency Human
              Resources Plan (EHRP) was developed, which outlined in detail activities over a five-year period
              to fast track recruitment, retain, and develop human resource skills and competencies for
              effective delivery of essential health services. The GOL and development partners agreed jointly
              to support the EHRP to ease the chronic shortage of health professionals. In retrospect, it seems
              that this initiative was largely to please donors, and there is only limited sense of urgency on the
              part of the Human Resource Department. The MOHSW has subsequently taken concrete steps
              toward engaging the Ministry of Public Service to ensure increases in key positions.

              39.      Much of the sectoral dialogue dwelled on exogenous factors that had only limited impact
              on the human resource problem--examples include concerns about production, out-migration
              and retention). The emphasis on addressing these supply-side issues was not balanced with
              efforts to improve the productivity of the existing staff. Only now is there some attention being
              paid to incentives and performance-based pay.34




33
     Support was in the form of additional missions by financial management specialists.
34
     It is important to add that across the board salary top-ups that have been proposed is not an efficient incentive-based approach.



                                                                                 11
           (d) Replacing QE-II Hospital

           40.     The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative for the replacement of the national referral
           hospital was one of the important successes of the project. It required the involvement of
           multiple agencies at various points in time (on the Bank's side, including the International
           Finance Corporation (IFC)35 for Partial Risk Guarantee, the Global Partnership on Output-based
           Aid (GPOBA) for grant-funding etc.), consultation and agreement with the MOFDP and Cabinet
           approval. The tender was awarded to a private firm which formed an investment vehicle that
           included Basotho shareholders. The Bank funded a short term consultant to initiate contract
           management principles and create appreciation amongst MOHSW staff of the importance of
           their role in successfully managing contracts in order for the PPP arrangement to work properly.
           The approach to replacing a national referral hospital using a model that successfully managed
           the necessary risks was recognized in the region for its innovation. A high level seminar was
           convened in Lesotho that included Ministers of Finance and Ministers of Health of the SADC
           region to share experiences on PPPs with the Lesotho case being the main model presented to the
           participants. It may too early to fully assess whether the anticipated improvements in efficiency
           have been realized. However, there are some promising preliminary indicators, notably the
           design of the contract with the provider took into account measures to contain the recurrent cost
           implications to the sector--an important consideration given that the QE-II Hospital cost center
           experienced an average annual increase of 36 percent between 2004­2007 (well in excess of the
           MOHSW average of 21 percent if QE-II Hospital is excluded).36

           (e) Health care waste management

           41.     The project proposed the following activities in support of the implementation of the
           MOHSW's Medical Waste Management Plan: (i) procurement of equipment and civil works for
           waste segregation and incineration, (ii) implementation of public awareness campaigns, (iii)
           training of health workers, and (iv) the provision of protective clothing for medical waste
           handlers. Following early implementation lags, an action plan (including additional support to
           strengthen implementation capacity) was agreed between the MOHSW and the task team in
           order to remedy the situation. The short-term technical assistance significantly helped the pace
           of implementation, and most of the planned activities were being implemented, although the
           overall implementation continued to be behind schedule.
                   Procurement of equipment and civil works for waste segregation and incineration:
                   Procurement activities have progressed with incinerators in six hospitals having been
                   refurbished under a contract with. The repairs were evaluated by the Pollution Control
                   Program staff.
                   Implementation of public awareness campaigns: Print and audio media materials were
                   developed, the formulation of policy and guidelines for storage, collection, treatment and
                   disposal of HCW was implemented.




35
   Although the IFC did not ultimately finance the PPP, it s involvement was instrumental in the dialogue and critical for some of the technical analysis that
informed the dialogue and decisionmaking.
36
   This achievement should not be under-estimated. For more than a decade it was obvious that the hospital needed to be replaced as it was not only a health
hazard and potential liability in terms of nosocomial infections and malfunctioning equipment but also because it was a major source of escalating costs in
the sector. But at the same time there was no agreed way to proceed that manages the various risks (see Table 17 in Annex 5).



                                                                             12
                     Training of health workers: Awareness training for health care personnel was
                     implemented.
                     Provision of protective clothing for medical waste handlers: This activity was cancelled
                     and deferred for implementation under the MCC support.

          42.     There is a high level of coordination with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)
          on its support in this area. A revised strategy37 on HCWM has been developed, and key
          structures such as the National HCWM Committee38 have been formed. A large part of the
          project effort was devoted to establishment of 18 Hospital Health Care Waste Management
          Committees, development of a guide for change management for HCWM committees, and
          training in their roles and responsibilities in HCWM. However, some these committees are not
          yet functional.39 The Office of Pollution Control conducted quarterly visits to all hospitals to
          assess progress of the committees and status of HCWM. Overall, the results have been positive
          especially in view of the poor HCMW practices at the start of the project.40

          (f) Partnerships

          43.     The implementation of an equity and performance-based MOU with CHAL was an
          important success that directly affects service delivery to nearly half of the country's people.
          The emphasis on performance (e.g., the explicit definition of an essential package of services to
          be provided and the performance indicators to be met) is an important achievement. Similarly,
          the reform in user-fee policy in CHAL facilities is an important step toward removing financial
          barriers to access. This reform also signified success in the uniform implementation of the
          National Health Policy across all service providers, notably CHAL--that covers about half of the
          country's health service providers--something that has not always been possible to achieve.41


    7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization42

          (a) M&E Design
          44.     The project design was articulated as a SWAp, and this strongly influenced the M&E
          design. Because it was defined as a SWAp the design did not distinguish between the indicators
          for which the project would be held accountable and indicators that donors agreed would be used
          to track sectoral performance. The results framework for HRP Phase II reflects substantial
          refinement compared to HRP Phase I, but some weaknesses remained. The project outcome


37
   The revised strategy on HCWM focused on the following areas: (i) coordination of hospital and national HCWM committees; (ii) public awareness
activities; (iii) regulation of HCWM; (iv) training on HCWM; (v) assessment of regulatory and legal frameworks; and (vi) selection of technology options
for health centers' waste treatment.
38
   The National HCWM Committee is supposed to meet quarterly to advise the MOHSW on HCWM issues, assist in the monitoring and evaluation of
HCWM activities, and oversee progress in the operation of Hospital HCWM committees. Because of this reliance, crude threats of cancellation of the MOU
were never credible threats. The new CHAL MOU is used as a much more sophisticated management tool with explicit service delivery requirements.
39
   A few hospitals (Mohale's Hoek, Butha-Buthe, Queen II) have identified members but committee meetings have not yet been initiated. The revised
strategy recommends that hospital committees have at least one meeting per month and the minutes be submitted to the National HCWM Committee.
40
   There was no system-wide implementation of managements of sharps and anecdotal reports cite dumping of raw hospital waste (and likely HIV-infected
waste) adjacent to hospitals premises.

   Implementation and enforcement of health policy in CHAL facilities has always been difficult to implement and enforce because of the government's
strong reliance on CHAL for service delivery of about half of the population.
42
   Under the SWAp division of labor among the development partners, Irish Aid, had the lead responsibility for M&E, and there is shared responsibility
among the donors for some of the M&E weaknesses cited here.



                                                                          13
           indicators were selective and generally consistent with the project objective. The consistency
           between the project outcome indicators and the some of the intermediate outcome indicators
           under Component 1 and the project outcome indicators were clear. The choice of service
           delivery indicators was reasonable for a component that focused on decentralized service
           delivery as they are fundamental measures of service delivery in a few key areas: child health
           (immunization rate), reproductive health (ANC utilization) and maternal health (facility-based
           deliveries). Rural/urban disaggregation of these indicators would have been an advantage to
           track the impact of decentralization reforms. On the surface the links are less apparent under
           components 2­4. But, if one thinks of indicators of the effectiveness of health spending as a
           means to the end of improving service delivery, then the choice of indicators seem very
           reasonable. In the PAD, one major shortcoming was the absence of baseline data for many of
           the indicators and the absence of targets for almost all of the indicators.

           45.    The need for distinction between the Project's Results Framework and a Results
           Framework for the SWAp (the Program's Results Framework) was raised in exchanges with
           QAG at the time of the QAE. It is unfortunate that the team did not amend (formally or even
           informally) the Results Framework that was tracked during implementation.

           46.     According to the PAD (p14), a Health Sector Reforms M&E Plan had been produced and
           endorsed by partners. It describes standards for structures, responsibilities, information flow,
           reports and dissemination, agreed-upon performance indicators for monitoring the reforms, the
           Annual Joint Review process and quarterly M&E meetings to track progress. On paper, this is
           certainly best practice but this was not translated into practice.

           47.     An assessment by WHO's Health Metrics Network (HMN) 43concurred with the
           adequacy of the M&E infrastructure (scored 85 percent on the HMN scorecard), as well as the
           quality of indicators that were collected (scored 81 percent on the HMN scorecard). There were
           weaknesses in the number of Health Information Officers and health information capacity
           building (causing the overall score for HIS Resources to be 62 percent).

           (b) M&E Implementation and Use
           48.      M&E Capacity. For most of the project duration capacity was limited to one
           epidemiologist and an advisor supported by a development partner. The M&E capacity
           weaknesses resulted in a limited ability to track health indicators on a systematic basis at
           national, and almost none at the district level. The limited integration of M&E functions within
           the MOHSW resulted in shortcomings in synergy and continued capacity weaknesses for data
           analysis and reporting. While the M&E Unit did a good job at collecting key data for the Annual
           Joint Review, the collection of this data was somewhat inefficient due to limited
           institutionalization of the data collection. In the HMN assessment, data management performed
           modestly (scored 39 percent).44

   Data management refers to among other things data collection, metadata dictionary, data storage, data analysis and presentation and data distribution.



                                                                            14
           49.      HIS. The MOHSW made some strides to implement its Health Information System to
           allow for the monitoring of most health conditions.45 The timeliness of data submission from
           districts remains a problem and there is high degree of variability in the proportion of facilities
           that submit monthly statistics to relevant levels by the first week of the following month. This is
           largely because of a lack of staff (Health Information Officers).

           50.      Data use. The HMN assessment remarked on the improved data use during the quarterly
           monitoring and evaluation of programs and the Annual Joint Reviews. These have been
           institutionalized over the years of the reform program, and the Bank played a key role in this
           regard. There are, however, two key weaknesses: (i) limited strategic use of the information
           presented at the Annual Joint Review by the MOHSW management to adjust programs; (ii) little
           feedback to districts of the findings of the Annual Joint Review, and disaggregation that would
           allow districts to assess how they are performing. A related shortcoming of the use of HIS data
           is the uneven way in which analysis was conducted at the district level on key health variables,
           and hence district-level management made limited use of data to inform local planning and
           decision-making. However, the dissemination and use of health information is still uneven.
           Several of these criticisms were raised by the Bank during supervision in aide memoires, but in
           no instance was M&E rated in the unsatisfactory range (i.e., moderately unsatisfactory or worse)
           in supervision reports despite the persistence of the M&E weaknesses.

     7.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

           51.     Safeguards. The project triggered Operational Policy 4.01 Environmental Assessment
           due to the potential negative environmental impacts of medical waste.46 To address these
           impacts, the MOHSW prepared and disclosed a National Medical Waste Management Plan dated
           March 2005. The plan was developed through a consultative process. It was comprehensive and
           included recommendations pertaining to: (i) the enhancement of the legal and regulatory
           framework for health care waste management; (ii) training of health care workers; (iii) provision
           of equipment and protective clothing for staff handling medical waste; and (iv) increasing public
           awareness and resource mobilization for medical waste management. The project supported the
           implementation of the National Medical Waste Management Plan by the Environmental Health
           Unit through (i) waste segregation and incineration; (ii) protective clothing, (iii) training of
           health workers, and (iv) public awareness. The implementation of the Medical Waste
           Management Plan is discussed in paragraphs 41 through 42, as it fell under Component 4. There
           were some early delays with implementation (causing safeguard compliance to be rated
           unsatisfactory in May 2007), and continued to lag during project implementation. At the facility
           level the installation of incinerators in all hospitals was one of the last accomplishments under
           the project. In selected instances, incinerators were not yet functional at project closing. Despite
           these delays, waste management continued to be prioritized by the MOHSW, and a key element
           of the on-going support funded by the MCC.




45
   Data for HIV/AIDS and TB were two exceptions, in part because these two vertical diseases result in such a significant health crisis for the country, they
continue to report on key measures for these programs separately. Over time it was expected that these diseases would be included under a single HIS but
this has not yet occurred.
46
   The safeguard screening category was S2; and the environmental screening category was B.



                                                                             15
           52.      Covenants. Seven covenants applicable to project implementation were set at appraisal
           (PAD, p3; see Annex 10). The covenants were generally complied with, albeit with some delays
           in the timing of the Annual Joint Review (which was supposed to occur before February 15 of
           each year). One of the recurrent financial covenants was also met with delays.

           53.    Fiduciary Compliance. With the exception of consistently producing late financial
           management reports47, the project was in general compliance with the financial management
           covenants. Audits complied with the Financing Agreement. Audit opinions were unqualified,
           with the exception of the audit report for the year ended March 2009.48 The project financial
           management has to be commended for the project's financial management risk rating being
           "low" even though the country level financial management risk rating was "substantial". Further
           evidence of the quality of financial management was that the project avoided corruption in an
           environment where there were instances of corruption involving donor funds (e.g., affecting the
           African Development Bank's (AfDB) Health Project). The Bank has to be commended for being
           proactive in managing this risk.49

    7.5 Post-completion Operation

           54.     The global economic downturn and financial crisis in general will likely put pressure on
           the further increases in the budgetary allocations to the sector. The assessment of fiscal space in
           the health sector suggested that improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of services are the
           most important vehicles open to the sector to free up resources.50 Furthermore, the Government
           of Lesotho is increasingly pursuing ways to maximize the impact and results of the budget. It is
           within this context that the Bank has decided not to proceed with Phase III of the APL, but to
           focus the dialogue very narrowly on the effectiveness of service delivery and value for money.
           The more direct reasons for not moving forward on Phase III are: (i) the hospital construction
           (originally planned for Phase III) was financed under a different financing arrangement (the
           PPP); and (ii) the GPOBA funds were mobilized for the renovation of the satellite clinics (also
           under a PPP).

    8. Outcomes

    8.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation51

           55.     Relevance of Objectives. The development objective of the Project was to "increase
           access to, and quality delivery of, essential health services". The objective was aligned with the
           overall goal of the MOHSW's reform program--to achieve a sustainable increase in access to
           quality preventive, curative and rehabilitative health services. It was consistent with the 1998
           CAS and the 2004 PRSP, and continues to be consistent with the 2006 CAS. The objective

   Development Credit Agreement Article IV Section 4.02(b). This aspect was repeatedly rated unsatisfactory in the financial management input into the
ISR rating, although this unsatisfactory rating did not cause the overall financial management rating to be downgraded as it was consistently rated
satisfactory.
48
   The auditors expressed an "except for" qualified opinion because of an error that resulted from deposit replenishment proceeds into the incorrect account.
49
   In September 2008 the team interviewed the key MOHSW staff--including the Operations Manager, Financial Manager, and Procurement Manager--as
well as colleagues of the AfDB. The information gathered so far indicates that the fraud is an isolated case and that the implementation of the Bank's two
projects in the sector had not been affected.

   Relevance of Implementation is discussed under the section "Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes".



                                                                             16
           continued to be relevant throughout the project's lifespan given the country and sectoral context
           described earlier. On this basis, relevance of objectives is rated high.

           56.      Relevance of Design. The relevance of design is rated substantial. The components and
           project organization matched what the project aimed to achieve. The dependence of the project
           success on external agencies (the Ministry of Local Government for decentralization reforms, the
           Public Service Commission for institutionalization of posts etc.) was underestimated. The design
           of the project as a phased Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was appropriate given the timeframe
           required to realize sustainable institutional change, and the sector-wide nature of the investment.
           The choice of the triggers were also appropriate as they either addressed challenges that the
           sector was struggling with (e.g., budget execution), or key milestones in the reform program
           (e.g., the QE-II Hospital PPP, district health management teams have control over their budgets)
           (see Table 19 in Annex 9). The fact that the triggers were mainly process-oriented is not
           necessarily a weakness as it reflects the content of the reform program.

           57.     The specific design of the PPP merits special mention because it was not part of the
           original design, but the Bank was proactive in including it in the dialogue. This dialogue
           ultimately shaped the type of PPP that was implemented. The traditional approach of
           construction through private contractors--deemed cost-ineffective by many experts52--was
           abandoned in favor of build, operate and transfer (BOT) approach. This approach combines both
           the building (B) of the facility and its operation (0), and its eventual transfer (T) to the
           government. BOT solves the moral hazard problem by making the contractor bear the risk for
           the construction as well as the operation of the facility.53

           58.    Based on high relevance of objectives and substantial relevance of design, overall
           relevance is rated substantial.

     8.2 Effectiveness/Achievement of Project Development Objective

           59.      The analysis of evidence in support of the achievement of the project objective--to
           increase access to, and quality delivery of, essential health services--is divided into two main
           parts: (i) service delivery indicators, (ii) health financing and expenditure indicators. The latter
           is included, because (although not explicitly stated in the project objective) the project included
           several efforts and indicators to improve effectiveness of health spending to the end of improving
           service delivery. Where possible the indicators have been disaggregated by rural/urban location
           because a key dimension of the project was to improve the implementation of decentralization
           reforms to health service delivery especially in rural under-served areas.

           60.    The counterfactual of "no intervention" cannot be fully evaluated because the project
           funded numerous systemic reforms that had country-wide reach. The ICR does, however, try to


52
   The IFC Advisory Services viewed the traditional approach as cost-ineffective since firms involved only in the design and construction of a facility have
the incentive to over-design because they do not bear the recurrent cost implications of implementing their design. This moral hazard problem is less of a
concern for small facilities such as health centers, as opposed to a referral hospital that in most health systems account for a large share of expenditure in the
sector.
53
   For instance, if the contractor overbuilds a facility, it will not be as profitable as when it is built of the correct size and capacity. Achieving cost-savings
through such an approach hinges on the participation of the private sector in long-term contracts for the design, financing, building, and operation of hospital
facilities.



                                                                               17
             make strong links between the project-financed outputs and the outcomes that could credibly be
             associated with the program of reform that was financed by the Bank, the MOHSW, as well as
             other partners in the sector's reform program.54 Figure 4 in Annex 4 shows the links between
             outputs on the one hand and outcomes on the other hand. This results chain that makes the link
             with service delivery is particularly important within the context of a health reform project.

             61.      How much of the results can be explained by socio-economic improvements? This
             question is especially pertinent in view of dramatic increases in GNI per capita over the project
             period--GNI increased from US$490 per capita in 2001 to US$1,000 in 2007. But, a large share
             of this increase was due to increased SACU revenues and revenues from the Lesotho Highland
             Development Project (from water sales to South Africa) that contributed to GDP growth through
             increased government spending rather than domestic economic growth. Furthermore, HDI
             actually dropped over the implementation period (Figure 5 in Annex 5). Thus, while some of the
             economic gains may have contributed to some of the outcomes, it does not explain all the
             improvements.

             62.     Triggers. While the third in the APL series is not being implemented the triggers for
             moving from Phase II to Phase III were in fact largely met (see Table 19 in Annex 9). The only
             trigger that was not met was the approval of the Health Financing Policy. As discussed earlier,
             there are legitimate reasons for not pushing the MOHSW not to approve the policy because the
             policy dialogue in the country on health insurance was skewed toward expanding the benefit
             package of civil servants.

                        Notes: a. This indicator refers to Public sector, private sector, and CHAL facilities. There appears to be some
                        inconsistency between the national average and the rural urban breakdown. This will be followed up with the
                        MOHSW before the DHS findings are finalized.

63.     Child health. Immunization coverage was relatively high at the start of the project--for
example, in 2004 DPT3 coverage was 82.8 percent and 91.4 percent in urban areas. Given this
high level it is not surprising that the national averages in immunization coverage have not
expanded, but the programmatic effort to maintain immunization coverage in excess of 80
percent should not be trivialized. It is worth noting that DPT3 coverage in rural areas expanded
(by 3.9 percent) while urban coverage shrunk by 7.7 percent. It is disconcerting that the share of
children immunized against measles and that are fully immunized decreased by about a tenth
(also in rural areas). Other measures of child health showed improvements. The share of
children with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and fever that reported accessing health services
increased substantially.

64.     Reproductive health. Lesotho has experienced steady declines in total fertility rate (TFR)
starting from a high of 5.5 in the 1970s to 3.4 in 2009. Declines in TFR have many socio-
economic determinants, but this decline was also matched with increases in modern
contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) from a low of five percent in the 1970s to 47.0 percent in
2009. This increase in CPR was also observed in rural areas (by 28.0 percent from 31.8 percent
to 40.7 percent). There is clearly still room for improvement, but what is also encouraging is the
increase in use of long-term contraceptive methods. Modern methods showed a 28.0 percent
increase while traditional methods decreased by 33.3 percent. Long term modern methods
increased in rural areas by: 20.0 percent for intrauterine devices (IUDs), 34.1 percent for
injectables compared to only a 4.9 percent increase in oral contraceptives use in rural areas.

             65.     Maternal health. Utilization of antenatal clinic (ANC) services decreased marginally in
             urban areas from 96.4 percent to 95.7 percent.55 In urban areas the share of facility-based
             deliveries is very high (85.6 percent). In rural areas this figure is much lower (50.5 percent), but
             is increasing at a higher pace than urban areas (6.5 percent increase between 2004 and 2009 in
             rural areas compared to 2.8 percent in urban areas). There is a high level of consistency in the
             trends in facility-based deliveries and the share of deliveries with a health professional (nurse of
             doctor)--each increasing by just over a tenth (Table 1). The increase in each of these indicators
             was largest in rural areas, and well in excess of the increase in urban areas.

             66.     PMTCT is increasingly provided at health facilities--increasing from 9 facilities in 2004
             to 136 facilities in 2007. Over this period PMTCT coverage increased from 3.1 percent to 31
             percent (Table 23).56

             67.     Tuberculosis. TB incidence in Lesotho is strongly driven by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
             According to the 2009 WHO Global Tuberculosis Report, Lesotho has 637 incident TB cases per
             100,000 population in 2007 placing the country 5th among 15 countries of the world with the
             highest per capita incidence. It is, however, important to add that the trend in TB incidence has
             stabilized in recent years (Figure 2). The most recent estimate released at the 2010 Annual Joint
             Review is 545 per 100,000 for 2009. Lesotho has maintained a case detection rate of close to 80
             percent for 2004­2005 but there was a slight drop toward the latter half of the project period.
             The treatment success rate averaged at 70 percent between 2004 and 2007. The high (albeit

    burden the sector for many more years.

    68.     Finally, an important contextual point. There may appear to be a disconnect between the
    positive service delivery achievements mentioned earlier and health outcomes (impact indicators
    such as IMR, child mortality) (see Figure 10 in Annex 11). But, one has to consider this within
    the context of the country's HIV prevalence--the second highest globally--and a key
    contributor to mortality. The most recent DHS data suggests stabilization a decade-long of
    increasing trends in infant and child mortality. For example, over the period 1996­2002 the
    average annual rate of increase in U5MR was 4.3 percent and for 2002­2009 it was 0.5 percent
    (Figure 10 in Annex 11).

    69.                      On the basis of the evidence presented above and the effectiveness is rated modest.

8.3 Efficiency

    70.                      Efficiency of project execution.

                             There were some initial delays, although the disbursement profile suggests that in the first
                             year of the project the disbursement exceeded the expected. Although the project was
                             only 42 percent disbursed at the original closing date (March 31, 2009) approximately an
                             additional 30 percent in project costs had been committed at that time.
                             Project supervision was particularly efficient and the team realized efficiencies across
                             multiple projects. The result is that total Bank management costs were less than
                             $400,000/106 staff weeks for supervision, which is commendable.
                             The implementation of the SWAp realized the anticipated reduction in transaction costs
                             to government associated with donor coordination to (e.g., using a common budget
                             planning process (the MTEF), using common reporting systems etc.) while it also
                             avoided some of the inefficiencies that have plagued many of the SWAps (e.g., these are
                             especially transaction costs to donors such as increased donor consultative meetings


                                                                                 21
                    among donors and also with government to arrive at and oversee common fiduciary
                    requirements).57

          71.    Contribution to efficiency gains in the sector. The project was instrumental in
          consolidation of the systems and management of donor-funded initiatives. This was an
          important efficiency gain to the Ministry because separate mechanisms for accounting or
          procurement units existed for separate donor projects. Another efficiency gain is the
          consolidation of recurrent and capital planning into one single integrated process. Furthermore,
          while the size of the operation (US$6.5 million) is relatively small it was able to successfully
          leverage a relatively large reform agenda in the sector. These efficiency gains are impossible to
          quantify but they are important features of the current health sector that was not the case 5 years
          ago. In Annex 5 the discussion on allocative and technical efficiency in the sector as a whole
          provides further context to the relative efficient use of resources in the sector.

          72.    Returns to project investment­systems investments for high impact interventions.
          Health system inputs are key elements in the production function for health outcomes. These are
          important upstream investments that are often shared with multiple health outcomes although the
          proximate impacts cannot be directly quantified. The strong emphasis on cost-effective
          interventions initiated in the essential health package that was developed in HRP-I was
          maintained, and the expansion of access to some of these high impact interventions was
          demonstrated in the previous section on effectiveness. The other important source of efficiency
          was the choices made in the contracting of the PPP for the replacement of the referral hospital.

          73.     Returns to project investment­PPP for referral hospital. The health team successfully
          negotiated the most cost-effective approach to replacing QE-II Hospital. For cost-effectiveness
          reasons the traditional approach of construction through private contractors was abandoned in
          favor of build, operate and transfer approach (BOT). As mentioned this approach aligns
          incentives facing private contractors with that of the MOHSW and addresses the moral hazard
          problem by making the contractor bear the risk for the construction as well as the operation of
          the facility. The key drivers of value-for-money from BOT are: (a) Risk transfer: The transfer to
          the private sector of those risks that it is better able to manage, which includes most risks
          associated with the design, construction, operation, technological change, and finance; (b)
          Output-based specification: The requirement that services are specified in terms of payment for a
          specified output, on which performance can be measured, has been linked to quality and timing
          of delivery. This contrasts with the conventional input-based approach to public procurement for
          large construction; (c) Long-term nature of contracts: The time profile of contracts provides
          scope to recover costs of the initial investment, develop alternative approaches to service
          delivery, and focus on costing over the whole life of the project; (d) Competition: Value-for-
          money is easier to demonstrate where there is effective price-led competition. The detailed risk
          assessment manages the risks to each of these dimensions of value-for-money from being
          realized (see Table 17 in Annex 5).

          74.       On the basis of these factors, efficiency is rated substantial.

8.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

    75.     Despite the mentioned shortcomings, the project's achievements have to be viewed
    within the context of: the accomplishments in a difficult environment posed by the HIV/AIDS
    disease profile; the fact that a relatively small project was able to successfully leverage a
    relatively large reform agenda. Furthermore, the project was able to navigate the most sensible
    way of moving forward on the issue that plagued the sectoral dialogue for about a decade--
    namely the replacement of QE-II Hospital. Finally, this is a quintessential example of how the
    resources of the World Bank Group were brought to bear to offer to the client the World Bank's
    public sector policy dialogue, coupled with the IFC's advisory services and to mobilize private
    sector resources for public ends. On the basis of the substantial relevance, modest efficacy and
    substantial efficiency, the overall project outcome rating is moderately satisfactory.

          services



8.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

    76.    Institutional Change/Strengthening. Institutional strengthening has been a central
    theme of the Bank's engagement in the sector. Progress in the area of institution building
    include:
           Improving the capacity to coordinate and monitor the reform program, especially in the
           Directorate of Planning, as evidenced by the MOHSW's development of a 10-year health
           sector policy and strategic plan and the first three-year rolling health sector expenditure
           program that is linked to the government's overall medium expenditure framework
           (MTEF).
           Improved financial management evidenced by the improved financial management and
           information system in the MOHSW, standardized budgeting procedures, decentralized
           cost centers, improved application of budget against plans, and all audits of external
           funds conducted on time with unqualified reports. A five-year strategic plan for
           monitoring and evaluation was developed and institutionalized, with regularly conducted
           quarterly activity monitoring reports and with annual joint sector reviews, consistent with
           the sector-wide approach.
           There were also some improvements in strategic planning for infrastructure needs and
           estate management. There are, however, areas where progress on institutional capacity
           building has not been fully satisfactory, especially in the area of human resource planning
           and management.
           The formulation of the MOHSW Decentralization Strategy; the official demarcation of
           all 10 districts as health planning and governance boundaries; the creation of separate
           cost centers for hospital services and primary health services, with the latter under the




                                                          23
                       purview of the District Health Management Teams; and the establishment, staffing, and
                       equipping of DHMTs with dedicated offices.

           77.     Unintended Outcomes and Impacts. One key area where institutions were strengthened
           and also led to a stronger emphasis of performance and service delivery is in the MOHSW's
           approach to contracting. Ministries of Health are often reluctant to accept contracting
           mechanisms. The MOHSW in Lesotho has come to approach contracting as a key strategy to
           achieve its mandate. The PPP experience has also led to improvement in the institutional
           capacity of the MOHSW to oversee and manage sophisticated performance-based contracts has
           substantially increased through the experience of implementing the PPP for QE-II Hospital.58
           The PPP utilized output- and outcome-based reimbursement, i.e., linking payments to the results
           actually delivered, not merely the financing of inputs. Why is this important? This approach has
           the potential to provide a sharper focus on outcomes, as well as in the way the MOHSW
           manages the contractual relationship with CHAL, which is now increasingly becoming
           performance- and equity-oriented. While the implementation of the MOHSW/CHAL
           partnership is not without challenges, the new MOU reflects a step away from the traditional
           incremental budgeting approach to performance-based financing and creates incentives for
           improving service delivery. During the MOU process, some institutional mechanisms have been
           developed (e.g. accreditation), which can be helpful for transforming the MOHSW to embrace
           the results-based financing principles and mechanisms.

     9. Rationale for Rating of Risk to Development Outcome
           78.      External or exogenous risks. One of the most important external risks that faces
           Lesotho's health sector is human resources. There is a strong pull-factor that will continue to
           attract skilled health professionals to South Africa, as well as further afield to countries such as
           the United Kingdom. There is very little that Lesotho can do to mitigate this risk, other than
           reducing the push-factor (i.e., factors that make working in the health system unattractive), and
           facilitate the re-entry and return of health professionals.

           79.    Internal risks. Several of the risks identified at appraisal continue to be important--not
           necessarily due to failure of the risk mitigation measures--but because of the enormity of the
           challenge.
                  HIV/AIDS. One notable example is HIV/AIDS and its impact on the supply of human
                  resources in the health sector.
                  Distortions caused by the new referral hospital. Also important is the risk that
                  infrastructure investment in a new referral hospital fails to deliver the anticipated
                  allocative and technical inefficiencies. This is mitigated to some extent by the design of
                  the PPP. A risk that is unaddressed is the potential that the PPP contractor may distort
                  the distribution of the already constrained supply of human resources in the sector away

  QE-II hospital accounts for 27 percent of MOHSW's recurrent expenditure. In recent years there has been a dramatic escalation in the recurrent budget
consumed by hospital--in less than five years the budget has doubled to almost US$20 million. Despite this increase in costs, service quality was poor,
average waiting time was reported as high as seven hours, and the hospital is in a dilapidated and dysfunctional state. Because of the hospital's national
referral function these problems not only spill over to Maseru district, which serves a quarter of the population, but also to the entire health service delivery
system. For many years the discussions of the replacement of the hospital has languished in the health policy debates with little progress. In 2006, with the
assistance of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the government examined different financial options to replace the national referral hospital. In
September 2006, Cabinet approved a private-public partnership (PPP)-based plan to build a new national referral hospital to replace the existing one.



                                                                               24
            from essential district-level services. This risk is being managed by restrictions on the
            ability of the PPP operator to recruit from MOHSW staff members that were not
            employed at the old QE-II. But, this restriction was viewed as being unfair by non-QE-II
            staff as depriving them from the opportunity to apply to a post at the new hospital, which
            is a public sector institution. There are no simple solutions, but the issue is actively
            managed with close attention from the Minister.
            Formalization of posts created under the project. The failure of the Public Service
            Commission to formally approve posts created under the project also poses a risk,
            although this issue is still being discussed between MOHSW and the Public Service
            Commission. On the positive side, there is a high level of ownership of the reform
            agenda (within the MOHSW and the MOFDP) to contribute to the sustainability of the
            gains made under the project, and the MOFDP has remained committed to the sector in
            terms of budget allocations especially in recent years.

   80.      Overall the risk to development outcome is rated as moderate.

10. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

10.1 Bank

   (a) Quality at Entry

   81.     As mentioned, the project objective was aligned with the overall goal of the MOHSW's
   reform program while selectively focusing project efforts on essential health services (rather than
   the ambitious scope of the reform program on "preventive, curative and rehabilitative health
   services"). The high quality technical analysis provided a powerful rationale for the project, but
   it was less strong in informing the design of the project. In the results framework the project
   outcome indicators were selective and generally consistent with the project objective. The main
   M&E design challenge was (i) coherence between the project outcome indicators and the some
   of the intermediate outcome indicators; (ii) consistency between activities being financed
   (inputs) and intermediate outcome indicators; and (iii) measurability of some indicators and the
   absence of baseline data for some indicators and targets for almost all indicators. The use of an
   APL was appropriate given the timeframe required to realize sustainable institutional change. At
   appraisal important risks were identified and the risk mitigation measures were generally
   adequate as reflected in the design. Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory because
   many (but not all) of the positive design features were inherited from the first APL, but the most
   important weaknesses in M&E were not addressed.

   (b) Quality of Supervision

   82.     The Bank's leadership in the SWAp and the reform agenda that has spanned more than a
   decade should not be underestimated. Reporting, follow-up of agreed actions, and compliance
   with covenants were generally adequate. Missions were adequately staffed, and were more
   frequent than the norm--in part because more than one project at a time was usually being
   supervised. The Bank did well to consistently engage CHAL and other service providers in the
   sector (as they contribute to about half of service delivery in the sector). ISR ratings were
   reasonable, but in some instances IP and DO ratings were generous and, in the case of the DO


                                                25
          ratings, could have been better supported by empirical evidence. While M&E weaknesses were
          repeatedly stressed during supervision, the Bank was largely ineffective in bringing about
          improvements.59 Furthermore, at no point was M&E rated in the unsatisfactory range.
          Supervision could have been more results-oriented, but it focused mainly on the achievement of
          the triggers (which were largely process oriented). The Bank could have done a better job at
          stressing the reforms and process achievements as a means to the end of improving service
          delivery especially at the district level. On the other hand, there was an excellent relationship
          between MOHSW (headquarters) and development partners. The Bank was responsive and
          innovative in the way it designed and supervised the PPP. The Bank also has to be commended
          for being proactive in managing the fiduciary risks (when there were instances of corruption in
          the sector involving other donor funds). Against the backdrop of no dedicated health staff in the
          country office in Maseru, the excellent relationship with government, leadership in the sector,
          responsiveness and the project's solid fiduciary track record have to be commended. Quality of
          supervision is rated satisfactory.

          (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

          83.    Based on the moderately satisfactory quality at entry and satisfactory quality of
          supervision, overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

    10.2 Borrower

          (a) Government Performance

          84.     There was a high degree of ownership and commitment to the APL's development
          objectives, especially on the part of MOFDP. Other ministries, notably the Ministry of Local
          Government and Ministry of Public Service were somewhat less responsive and/or less engaged.
          The coordination weaknesses between these ministries and the MOHSW led to delayed
          implementation and incomplete institutionalization of some of the reforms. The MOFDP was
          responsive and highly satisfactory in its processing of the credit, providing leadership to the PPP
          dialogue and implementation, and meeting effectiveness conditions (albeit with some delay). On
          this basis, overall government performance is rated moderately satisfactory, largely due to
          weaknesses on the part of the Ministry of Local Government and Ministry of Public Service.

          (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

          85.     The MOHSW was the main implementing agency. Project implementation was generally
          adequate, although with some delays in selected areas (waste management, health financing).
          The implementation of M&E was particularly weak (see discussion on M&E). Annual Joint
          Reviews were successfully conducted and have generally been institutionalized (but not the data
          collection), but links with national and district-level decision-making could be strengthened.
          Significant institutional capacity was built at headquarters and at district-level. All legal
          covenants were met, albeit with some delay (see Annex 10). Performance in financial
          management and procurement was generally good. While Phase III of the APL is not being

   This weakness has to be shared with the MOHSW and other development partners, notably Development Cooperation Ireland who had special
responsibility for M&E under the SWAp division of labor among development partners.



                                                                        26
          implemented, the triggers for making that transition were largely met (see Annex 9) and
          represent important achievements under the project. Implementing agency performance is rated
          moderately satisfactory.

          (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

          86.     Based on the satisfactory government performance and moderately satisfactory
          implementing agency performance, overall Borrower performance is rated moderately
          satisfactory. Greater weight was given to the implementing agency's performance because the
          latter had a greater impact on project outcomes.

     11. Lessons Learned
          87.     An operation need not be a SWAp that involves pooled financing or common financing
          arrangements in order to benefit from the principles of SWAp (harmonization, alignment,
          accountability for results etc.).60 In many ways this operation can be described as a "practical"
          SWAp (which fits into the reality for a small and low capacity country like Lesotho), and was
          able to avoid the high transaction costs associated with many SWAps, as IEG's recent review of
          SWAps showed.61

          88.     An operation can well maintain its relevance and effectiveness if it is aligned with the
          Government's own health reform program. This operation, designed to support Lesotho's health
          sector reform program, was not only appreciated by the Government, but also helped the Bank
          provide consistent and targeted support over a relatively long period of time. Similarly, a small
          operation could have a significant impact if it is well aligned with the overall health sector
          reform agenda.

          89.     The Adaptable Program Loan is an underused instrument, and is particularly suited for
          projects implementing a multi-year sectoral reform agenda. Some of the health systems
          strengthening projects in other countries may want to consider this instrument.

          90.     An operation supporting a government program needs to carefully sort out the Bank's
          requirement for a project. When supporting a government program jointly with other partners,
          some requirements for a stand-alone project may not be fully met (e.g. performance indicators
          jointly selected may not be the best ones to the Bank). In this case, the Bank needs to flexible in
          order to ensure a balance between program vs. project.

          91.    For health reform projects to be successful, the links between the policy and institutional
          reforms on the one hand and the service delivery objectives on the other should consistently be
          made to ensure that the reforms are viewed as a means to the end, and not an end in itself.



60
  OPCS defines a SWAp as "an approach to a locally-owned program for a coherent sector in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, moving toward the
use of country systems. SWAps represent a ... shift in the focus, relationship and behavior of donors and governments. They involve high levels of donor
and country coordination to achieve program goals, and can be financed through parallel financing, pooled financing, general budget support, or a
combination." (OPCS 2008 cited in IEG 2009).
61
   In this sense it is unfortunate that IEG's evaluation of SWAps paid only limited attention to the Lesotho SWAp. The countries that the evaluation
focused on were: Bangladesh, Ghana, Kyrgyz Republic, Malawi, Nepal and Tanzania.



                                                                          27
92.     Where posts that are initially funded under a project are expected to be subsumed into the
public service, the process of hiring should be consistent with the public service regulations in
order for the posts to be formalized at project closing. In the absence of this, it is not possible for
specialists initially hired on a contractual basis to be regularized to be part of the civil service
once the posts are approved by the Public Service Commission.

93.    The Bank can serve our clients better if we could break the organizational barriers and
take advantage of the expertise and skills in different units. This operation was instrument in
involving IFC and GPOBA as well as the Partial Risk Guarantee program. The internal
coordination was crucial to realize the hospital PPP.

94.     Maintaining a good working relationship with and wining the trust of the clients will
make the Bank operations more effective. One of the reasons for this small operation to have a
significant impact is that the Bank maintained constructive dialogue with both the senior
management (including the Minister of Finance and Minister of Health) and the implementation
level of the Government.

Figure 4. Results Chain linking Outputs to Outcomes

Explanation of the Results Chain framework. The results chain represented below uses the framework of the
HNP Results Chain developed by AFTHE to provide a unifying framework that HNP projects can use to plan
results frameworks and track results. The HNP Results Chain has having two dimensions: Levels and
Categories. The categories have been identified along the lines of the key inputs into the building blocks of a
functioning health system (infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, human resources, accountability and quality
structures etc.). The levels make the links between outputs and outcomes and ultimately impacts. Level IV
denotes outputs, Level III and II denotes intermediate outcomes and Level I denotes outcomes. Level 0 denotes
impacts that are usually beyond the full influence of any project such as IMR, MMR etc.

Annex 5. Economic and Financial Analysis

        Annex 5 provides some background information on the macroeconomic conditions and
information on major sources of health financing, to provide context for the discussion of
allocative and technical efficiency in the sector. It also provides some information on the
distributive changes in access and improvements in health outcomes.

Macroeconomic Conditions

        Lesotho has experienced strong growth performance over the past two decades--real
average annual growth between 1991 and 2006 exceeded the Sub-Saharan Africa average (3.6
versus 3.3 percent).63 The country's growth path has historically been strongly linked to South
Africa although this has diminished over time and Lesotho now produces 80 percent of its GDP
(compared to half in the 1980s).64,65 Per capita GNI has steadily increased to reach LSL7,045
(US$1,030) in 2007, just short of the cut-off for IBRD eligibility.66 For many years the
country's strong economic growth performance has been mirrored in improvements in the human
development index, but over the past six years the country's paths of economic development and
human development have diverged (Figure 5).67 Over the period 2000­2005 per capita GNI
increased by 30 percent in Loti (and 42 percent in US$), whereas HDI dropped by 6 percent.
This is strongly related to consequences of the AIDS epidemic, especially its impact on life
expectancy (one of the main elements in the calculation of HDI).

Health Expenditure and Financing Trends

Total and government expenditure

        While per capita public health expenditure more than doubled between 2001 and 2005
(from US$16 to US$4268), the increase was eroded by appreciation of the South Africa Rand
(against which the Loti is pegged69) and inflation. Total health expenditure, as a share of GDP,
decreased from 7.1 percent in 2001 to 5.5 percent in 2005 (Figure 6), strongly influenced by the
robust GDP growth performance.70 Public health expenditure, as a share of government
spending, also decreased between 2001 and 2005 from 8.8 to 6.7.71 (Figure 6). After
experiencing a steady downward trend, health expenditure as a share of government spending
has since 2005 increased to reach 11.4 percent in 2007, an unprecedented increase. While other
ministries contribute to health spending, the magnitude of health expenditure from the non-
MOHSW ministries is less than 5 percent of the MOHSW expenditure. The major source is the
Ministry of Defense and accounts for 86 percent of the non-MOHSW health expenditure.72

Notes: a. The data point for 2007 is 11.4 percent from the World Bank (2008, PRSC PAD), which is almost double the 2005
figure.
       Over the period 2004/05­2006/07 total budget of the MOHSW increased substantially
with the MOHSW programs showing the largest average annual increase being: (i) the Program:
Disease Control (113 percent increase driven by the sub-program HIV/AIDS) and (ii) the
Program: Queen Elizabeth II Hospital (36 percent). The program with the largest average annual
decrease was the Program: Social Welfare (-12 percent).

   This represents an average annual increase of 41 percent. Total health spending experienced similar increases--from LSL240
(US$28) to LSL259 (US$46) between 2001 and 2005.

Private and household expenditure

        The private share of total heath spending remained relatively constant between 2004 and
2008, at an average of 43 percent (Table 13) and per capita private expenditure increased at an
average annual rate of 4.2 percent (in US$). This relatively modest increase appear contrary to
the projections of HIV/AIDS impact studies that households with people with HIV/AIDS will
experience substantial increases in health spending for the person with HIV. There are two
possible explanations: (i) health spending on a person with HIV/AIDS has displaced other health
spending in the household; or (ii) that care for the person with HIV/AIDS is subsidized from
public sources (government services or donor-funded services). Unfortunately, the recently
completed National AIDS Spending Assessment did not collect household-level data.73

Development assistance for health

        Development assistance for health dramatically increased in recent years. The
development assistance allocated to health, as a share of total health spending, has progressively
increased from 5.2 percent in 2002 to a high of 18.2 percent in 2005 (Figure 7).74 After 2005
there has been some leveling off (Figure 8a). In absolute terms the increase over the period
2002­2005 was from US$2.3 million to US$8.4 million--almost a 300 percent increase. These
increasing trends are fully consistent with the global trends in development assistance for health
and for HIV/AIDS in particular.75 The most important sources76 of development assistance for
health are: the Global Fund to fight Malaria, Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS (the Global Fund) (43
percent) and between 11 and 13 percent from each Government of Ireland, World Bank, the
African Development Bank (Figure 8b). Four MOHSW programs capture about 95 percent of
the cumulative donor contributions. About 58 percent of donor support is channeled through
central services and programs of the MOHSW. The Program: Disease Control (especially the
HIV/AIDS sub-program) receives just under a quarter (22 percent) of development assistance.

Breakdown of Health Expenditure

        The economic and functional breakdown of health expenditure that underpin the analysis
of allocative and technical efficiency have to be qualified because of data quality limitations.
For more than a decade most analyses of the distribution of expenditures have used the spending
categories as reported by MOHSW as proxies for the various functional and economic
expenditure categories usually employed in expenditure analyses. This approach has serious
weaknesses as the match between the categories is imperfect:
             The CHAL subvention (which includes expenditure on staff, drugs etc.) is
                aggregated under the Program: Administration. The implication is that the trends
                in the expenditure categories that make up the subvention are seldom analyzed
                alongside the analysis of staff, drugs etc. in the MOHSW budget.


                                                                 43
                    Analysis of the geographic distribution of expenditure is seriously compromised
                    by the failure to break down the CHAL subvention by district and using it in the
                    analysis of expenditure patterns by district. The Oxford Policy Management
                    (2008) study made a special effort to address this shortcoming, but this
                    breakdown is not routinely available for analysis and planning.
                    Expenditure data for QE-II Hospital and Maseru district are imperfectly assigned.
                    For example, in FY2004/05 Maseru district's expenditure on drugs was reported
                    as zero.77 This is clearly not the case and is likely explained by the fact that these
                    drug expenditures are generally included under the QE-II Hospital expenditure.

        The weaknesses cited above hampers some of the analysis that should be informing
major issues that confront the system: budget execution, technical and allocative inefficiency.
Nonetheless, below are some possible explanations. More systematic investigation of these
possible explanations is needed in order to concretely plan how to address this chronic weakness
of the public health sector.

Geographic distribution of health expenditure

         In Table 14 the districts have been divided into three categories based on per capita
spending: (i) High: greater than LSL80 per capita), (ii) Medium: between LSL50 and LSL80 and
(iii) Low: less than LSL50.78 Berea and Thaba Tseka districts have the lowest per capita
spending. It is worth noting that two of the districts with the lowest per capita expenditures,
Berea and Mafeteng, drain into the Maseru district. On the other end of the scale are two
districts in the highlands (with low population density and weak accessibility). This is somewhat
contrary to what is often seen in other countries where the most rural have among the lowest per
capita spending. This is in part explained by the distance and cost of the Lesotho Flying Doctor
Service.

  Note that this covers only the MOHSW recurrent expenditure and excludes the distribution of CHAL subvention, an important
omission as CHAL facilities account for just under half of non-private facilities.

         The expenditure breakdown by district suggests that Maseru district has the lowest per
capita spending. This is an artifact of the program classification--specifically the fact that QE-II
Hospital expenditure is excluded in this category. On the other hand, when the QE-II
expenditure is included in the Maseru district expenditure this district has by far the highest per
capita spending.79 It may be argued that QE-II serves a national referral hospital and the
expenditure should not fully be ascribed to Maseru district. The majority of people using QE-II
resides in Maseru, so this approach while imperfect is valid. A future refinement would be to
assign weighted recurrent costs of QE-II (weights determined by the patient load) to the various
districts it serves.

Allocative efficiency

        Allocative efficiency refers to the allocation of resources to maximize welfare by
producing the maximal improvement in health outcomes for a given level of resources--i.e., it
requires the alignment of resources (and the numbers and types of services purchased and
consumed) with the distribution of the disease burden. The data shortcomings to assess this form
of efficiency are particularly acute. For example, no data exists on expenditure by disease
outcome such as child health, maternal health, family planning, etc. and to see how this matches
with the burden of disease in these areas. HIV/AIDS is the only disease entity for which
systematic data collection and analysis has been done.

       Data to analyze the resource allocation between primary care services versus hospital
services are quite limited. Table 15 shows the data for only public/MOHSW facilities and
excludes CHAL facilities, and suggests that half (51 percent) of recurrent spending goes of
hospitals. In many other countries this share is often closer to two thirds. These findings are
also consistent with regional data that suggests Lesotho's supply of beds is moderate. Relative to
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Lesotho ranks at the 60 percentile in hospital beds to population
(Figure 9), but compared to the four SACU countries, the country's bed capacity is modest.80

        QE-II hospital accounts for 27 percent of MOHSW's recurrent expenditure.81 In recent
years there has been a dramatic escalation in the recurrent budget consumed by hospital--in less
than five years the budget has doubled to almost US$20 million. Despite this increase in costs,
service quality was poor, average waiting time is reported as high seven hours, and the hospital is
in a dilapidated and dysfunctional state. Because of the hospital's national referral function these
problems not only spill over to Maseru district, which serves a quarter of the population, but also
to the entire health service delivery system. For many years the discussions of the replacement
of the hospital has languished in the health policy debates with little progress. In 2006, with the
assistance of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the government examined different
financial options to replace the national referral hospital. In September 2006, Cabinet approved
a private-public partnership (PPP)-based plan to build a new national referral hospital to replace
the existing one, in a cost-effective manner that mitigates the risk to the sector's allocative
efficiency of continued increasing recurrent expenditures on QE-II (see discussion of the cost-
effective option chosen under the section on technical efficiency).


Technical Efficiency

      Technical efficiency refers to the way in which inputs (personnel, drugs, etc.) are
combined to produce maximum health service outputs at a specific quality level.82 Salaries


81
   While the share is high, it is also generally known that this line item also includes drug expenditure for the clinics in the Maseru district,
making the available data hard to interpret.
82
  A frequently used non-parametric methodology to assess technical efficiency is data envelopment analysis (DEA). After being
extensively used in OECD countries, DEA is increasingly applied in LICs and MICs (e.g., Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa


                                                                                          46
accounted for 32 percent of the MOHSW recurrent expenditure for 2006/07, followed by
operating costs (29 percent), the grant to CHAL (15 percent) and drugs (13 percent). Spending
of a third of recurrent expenditure on salaries is quite low although this is likely an underestimate
of the true salary allocation (because a substantial share of the CHAL subvention includes salary).
Nonetheless, compared to other countries the MOHSW salary expenditure is not at risk of
crowding out non-salary expenditures as one sees in many other health sectors.83

        Data weaknesses preclude a more detailed analysis of technical efficiency. The health
sector in Lesotho will be well served to conduct a data envelopment analysis (DEA) analysis to
better understand technical efficiency of the service delivery units and track it over time.
Another weakness is that some large categories are ill defined (e.g., the expenditure category
"Operating costs" is the second largest category, yet this category is poorly defined).

        The cost-effectiveness and technical efficiency considerations were prominent in
discussions regarding the replacement of the referral hospital. The health team successfully
negotiated the most cost-effective approach to replacing QE-II Hospital. The traditional approach
of construction through private contractors--deemed cost-ineffective84--was abandoned in favor
of the BOT approach. This approach combines both the building (B) of the facility and its
operation (0), and its eventual transfer (T) to the government. BOT solves the moral hazard
problem by making the contractor bear the risk for the construction as well as the operation of
the facility.85 The key drivers of value-for- money from BOT are: (a) Risk transfer: The transfer
to the private sector of those risks that it is better able to manage, which includes most risks


and Zambia). DEA is a linear programming methodology for evaluating relative efficiency of each production unit among a set
of fairly homogeneous service delivery units (e.g., district hospitals, health centers, etc.). A production possibilities frontier is
derived using combinations of inputs and outputs from best performing health facilities. Health facilities that comprise the
frontier are assigned an efficiency score of one. The efficiency of health facilities below the efficiency frontier is measured in
terms of their distance from the frontier and on this basis a score of between one and zero is assigned--the larger the score the
more efficient a health facility. Stochastic frontier analysis is another methodology to assess technical efficiency, although this is
more data intensive.
83
   In most instances expenditure on salaries is in excess of 50 percent of recurrent spending. According to the review of district
expenditure "the key factor affecting the technical efficiency of the district health services is the lack of health personnel"
(Strachan, 2007, p34).
84
   It was viewed cost-ineffective since firms involved only in the design and construction of a facility have the incentive to over-design because
they do not bear the recurrent cost implications of implementing their design. This moral hazard problem is less of a concern for small facilities
such as health centers, but for a referral hospital that in most health systems account for a large share of expenditure in the sector.
85
   For instance, if the contractor overbuilds a facility, it will not be as profitable as when it is built of the right size. Achieving cost-savings
through such an approach hinges on the participation of the private sector in long-term contracts for the design, financing, building, and operation
o f hospital facilities, which may be as long as 15 years.

Output-based specification: The requirement that services are specified in terms of payment for a
specified output, on which performance can be measured, has been linked to quality and timing
of delivery. This contrasts with the conventional approach to public procurement that is based on
pre-determined funding of inputs. (c) Long-term nature of contracts: The time profile of
contracts provides scope to recover costs of the initial investment, develop alternative
approaches to service delivery, and focus on costing over the whole life of the project. (d)
Competition: Value-for-money is easier to demonstrate where there is effective price-led
competition. There was also a very detailed assessment of the risks to the value-for-money
projections (Table 17) coupled with mitigation measures.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Borrower's ICR

  Ministry of Health and Social Welfare input on the Implementation Completion Report
                      (ICR) of Phase II of the Health Sector Reforms

   1. Introduction

Phase II of the Health Sector Reforms was based on the three year costed sector plan (MTEF) of
the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. This was presented to all partners that attended the
5th annual joint review meeting in January 2005 and accepted as the document that all health
development partners would buy into. The World Bank committed USD 6.5 million towards
implementation of objectives in the plan, Irish Aid committed 3.72 million Euro. Other partners
joined in a sector wide approach (SWAp) to complement support to the plan on an annual or
biennial (WHO) basis.

The focus for the 2nd phase of the HSR emphasized objectives that will lead to implementation of
health and social services at district and community levels for sustainable better health outcomes.
This was to be a seamless continuation of the first phase with the key programme management
staff like the Financial Manager, the Procurement Manager and the Operations Manager
remaining in place including the MOHSW counterpart, the Director of Health Planning and
Statistics. The objectives had been jointly identified from the three year sector plan to be:

   i)      Essential Health Service delivery

Improving the delivery of health services at district and community level is essential to reach the
reform objectives of improved health outcomes. This, according to the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) of the World Bank, would be achieved by de-linking the management and
funding of public health programs from hospital services. It builds on the reforms in the 1st Phase
on decentralization and the essential health package. Establishment of DHMTs would be
supported based on lessons learned from the three learning areas. All ten districts will have
DHMTs and support to establish these and make them functional to implement services at this
level will be essential. Support will be in the form of office space, transport, information
technology equipment, and training in district health systems development. The delivery of
essential drugs and their rational use will be supported as part of the essential health package.

   ii)     Human Resources

The 2nd Phase would build on the human resource needs assessment and strategic plan dev
eloped in the 1st Phase. The human resource crises facing the sector would be addressed in order
for quality health and social services to be delivered. The 2nd Phase would support continuing
education for health workers, facilitate review and development of curriculum to make trained
nurses multi-skilled and assist the MOHSW to develop a health worker posting policy where
staff skills are matched with service delivery needs.




                                                50
   iii)    Health sector financing, financial management and planning

The second phase of the reforms prioritized the development of a health financing policy and
would provide consultancy support to explore the feasibility of social health insurance schemes
as a means of health resources mobilization.
Building on developments in the first phase, the 2nd phase would further strengthen the financial
management system and the medium-term sector expenditure framework process linked to the
overall Government of Lesotho MTEF. With new infrastructure development more resources
were to be allocated to equipment and infrastructure maintenance. In addition human resource to
overcome the acute shortage of accounting staff at district level would be supported.

    iv)     Medical Waste Management
The Medical Waste Management Plan developed in the 1st Phase was ready for implementation
in the 2nd Phase of the HSR. The interventions would consist of providing skills to health
workers in proper segregating, storing and disposing of medical waste generated in health
institutions. Procurement of protective clothing, code coloured bins and repair or purchase of
incinerators was also to be done

    v)      National referral hospital
The government had expressed its commitment to replace the present QEII with a new facility
that would adequately serve as the apex specialist hospital for the referral system. Based on
recommendations in studies done in the 1st Phase, the management problems and poor quality of
services at the current institution would be addressed. The new referral system had to be
streamlined to play its envisaged role in the reforms. Government decided on a private public
partnership arrangement to replace the existing hospital and the services offered there.

  2. Institutional set up to monitor progress of implementation of Phase II

 Institutional and implementation arrangements for 2nd Phase was similar to that of the 1st Phase.
The annual operational plan of the MOHSW served as the basis of implementation of the
reforms. Monitoring the implementation of the 2nd Phase was to be achieved by trekking a set of
indicators that were reviewed at the annual joint review meetings which also served as a platform
for assessing the rolling three year MTEF and areas of support for the following financial year.
The triggers that were to be met to enter the 3rd phase of the Health Sector Reforms were the
following:
   I. The Public Private Partnership contract related to the new national referral hospital
         acceptable to IDA is finalized
  II. The National Health Financing Policy is approved
 III. All district Health Management Teams have control over their budgets and have authority
         to incur expenses
 IV.     Tuberculosis treatment success rate increased from 52% to 60%
  V.     Disbursement of credit exceeds 50% of total project amount


3. Overview of implementation of Phase II of the HSR programme




                                               51
This part of the report deals with the World Bank contribution of the 2nd Phase of the HSR .
Interventions from other Health Development Partners, especially in the Human Resources arena,
became more and more significant with additional partners like USAID coming on board.
Significant support was also rendered in HIV and AIDS and TB with the implementation of the
Global Fund Rounds Two, Five, Six and Seven.
The progress in areas of support were:

   i)      Essential Health Service delivery

The 2nd Phase of the HSR programme set out to roll out decentralization to all 10 districts of the
country as a means to achieve accessibility, equity, improved planning and management of the
health services. The following interventions took place:

Designation of District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) in all districts and capacitating the
functioning of these teams by providing office space, office equipment and transport took
achieved except provision of office space in the form of prefabricated structures that was done in
only of four districts of Mokhotlong, Botha Bothe, Berea and Leribe. The teams in Maseru,
Mohale's Hoek and Berea were accommodated in rented offices. Development of the teams by
training in some key areas of district health services management was out-sourced to
management training institutions in Lesotho.

A Decentralization Coordinator was recruited with Irish Aid support. The Coordinator worked
closely with the Director of Primary Health Care to strengthen the DHMTs in health service
delivery at local level. Support for the Coordinator was rendered through funding by the World
Bank for training, supervisory and support visits to the DHMTs.

Quality Assurance was supported through capacitating the Unit with a vehicle and office
equipment. A Quality Assurance team was also funded for a study tour to South Africa to assist
the team in improving quality assurance functions in the MOHSW

ii) Human Resources
The implementation of the Human Resources Strategic Plan 2005-2025 was the main thrust of
this intervention. The World Bank support in the 2nd Phase consisted of funding key positions in
support of decentralization, affording government time to fund these positions at the end of the
2nd Phase. These positions were: 10 District Health Information Officers, 10 District Accountants
and two Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Officers. In addition the Reforms
funded the contracts of the Project Accounting Unit (PAU) Manager, the Operations Manager
and the Procurement Manager. At central level the ICT officers and the Public Private
Partnership Coordinator was supported to attend training courses outside the country. Staff of
Directorate of Health Planning and Statistics benefitted from seminars on Result Based
Financing, National Health Accounts training, and Social Health Insurance

iii) Health sector financing, financial management and planning
Support to this component was geared at strengthening financial management; improved
planning and budgeting based on the MTEF system; and improved resource mobilization for the
health sector. District workshops and central level planning and budgeting workshops were



                                                52
funded with technical input from the Directorate Health Planning and Statistics (DHPS) and the
Operations Manager. This resulted in production of Three Year Health Sector plans and Annual
Health Operational plans based on the three year sector plans. Improvement of Financial
Management systems was supported by the introduction of financial analysis and reporting
software and training of financial officers and managers both locally and outside the country.
Training outside the country on conducting National Health Accounts was done and a schedule
of putting the exercise in place in Lesotho was drawn up. A Financial Management body,
established in the first phase that integrated the Government of Lesotho Financial Controller
Office with the PAU, strengthened links as the offices were juxtaposed on the same floor with
the DHPS in the new headquarters office complex. A Procurement Manual was produced and
training provided through the Procurement Manager to staff working in MOHSW stores and
project procurement in order to unify the procurement process.
 Analytical work in health care financing was also supported. A short-term consultant to
determine a district resource allocation formula was funded and a consultancy firm undertook a
Public and Private Expenditure review. This analytical work fed into the development of a
Health Care financing Policy a draft of which was available at the end of September 2009.
Mobilization of additional resources was a major thrust of this component of the 2nd Phase of
HSR. Analytical work was performed by the World Bank and World Health Organization on the
feasibility of Social Health Insurance in Lesotho. It was established that Social Health Insurance
was indeed feasible in Lesotho starting with the formally employed public sector workforce,
followed by the formally employed private sector and over a period of about 10 years extend
health insurance universally, i.e. include the informal sector and unemployed.
An inter ministerial team was funded for a study tour to Tanzania to learn good practices and
pitfalls in the implementation of SHI from the Tanzanian National Health Insurance Fund.

    iv)     Medical Waste Management
Training on health waste management was done in all hospitals and district committees on health
waste management formed. In addition, incinerators that needed to be repaired were refurbished
and 11 new ones were purchased. Colour coded disposal bags and bins were purchased. A
partnership to fund the Medical Waste Management Plan was formed between the World Bank
and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the latter being responsible for purchasing
protective clothing. The MCC will continue to support activities in Medical Waste Management
especially to do with health centres (clinics), updating the Plan and producing a legislative
framework.

    v)      National referral hospital
The Government of Lesotho made a decision to enter into a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) to
replace the Queen Elizabeth II Referral Hospital. The 2nd Phase saw this decision being
implemented. The tender was awarded to Net-Care which formed an investment vehicle that
included Basotho shareholders. By the end of September 2009, construction work had begun on
a new site at Botsabelo and was progressing well. Three filter clinics in Maseru were also
included in the PPP arrangement.
The World Bank funded a short term consultant to initiate contract management principles and
create appreciation amongst MOHSW staff of the importance of their role in successfully
managing contracts in order for the PPP arrangement to work properly.




                                                53
A top level seminar that included Hon Ministers of Finance and Health of the SADC region and
their officers in planning was held in Lesotho to share experiences on PPPs with the Lesotho
case being the main model presented to the participants.

    vi)     Monitoring and Evaluation
      nd
The 2 Phase continued to build on the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Unit in the DHPS
that was established in the 1st Phase. The thrust in the 2nd Phase was to decentralise the M&E
functions to the district level. In this regard 10 Health Information Officers were recruited with
World Bank funding. Funding was also made available to train these officers, as well as central
level officers, in Health Management Information Systems
Quarterly and Annual Joint Review meetings continued to be held in the 2nd Phase of the HSR.
Six weekly meetings had a slump at the beginning of the 2nd Phase but started again towards the
end of the phase.
Fortnightly financial and general management meetings of the senior managers in the MOHSW
were held regularly during the phase.


4. Procurement and expenditure:

Expenditure is expected to be above 90% at end of project. At end of September 2009 it was at
86%. Procurement may see the construction of DHMT offices at Leribe and Berea going beyond
the end of December 2009 when all payments are to be concluded.
The draft Health Care Financing Policy still needs stakeholders input for its approval

5. Lessons learned in the implementation of the 2nd Phase of the HSR

   a) Collaboration with partners

The signing of the Code of Conduct based on the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness formed
a framework of collective collaboration of all Health Development Partners on the one hand and
the provision of oversight of this partnership and the terms of engagement by the MOHSW on
the other. This framework was applied very well in the beginning but with more partners coming
on board, especially numerous implementing bilateral partners, principles of the framework were
no longer adhered to as strictly as at the beginning. For example, some partners continued not to
follow the agreed lines of communication, which were that the Principal Secretary of the
MOHSW, or the designate, was the point of engagement of partners; some preferred to directly
engage the Hon Minister. The planning cycle was not always in sync between the partners and
the MOHSW although this was the spirit of the Code of Conduct. The MTEF which was
supposed to identify funding gaps could not always be modified as new funding partners came
on board with new resources during the implementation of MTEF. This would have required a
dedicated Senior Economic Planner, whose absence was felt in the 2nd Phase of the Reforms, to
tract these inputs for updating the MTEF.
It is therefore important to regularly visit the Code of Conduct to remind one another of its
principles so that these could be adhered to as much as possible. To keep the planning as realistic
and collaborative as possible clear communication of when planning meetings of both central




                                                54
level and district level are to be conducted needs to be improved on. The Senior Economic
Planners posts are very important for updating of funding gaps and estimation of true costs.
The Joint Monitoring and Evaluation system created in the DHPS with the Health Development
Partners was generally successful. Agreed on indicators were tracked annually in review
meetings and frank discussions, including a statement by partners of the areas that they
considered ministry had done well in and where they considered improvements were required,
were entered into. These meetings between the MOHSW and its partners ensured that challenges
were identified and possible solutions explored.
The Adaptable Development Loan (ADL) of the World Bank and to a certain extent that of Irish
Aid made it possible to shift the budget amongst budget lines as the needs changed with the
implementation of the programme. This became very helpful with, for example, the
implementation of decentralization where flexibility was allowed from topping up of salaries by
(Irish Aid) recruitment of staff under contracts, renting office space for DHMTs and construction
of DHMT pre-fabricated offices; items that were not specifically identified at project appraisal

   b) Inter-ministerial collaboration

The case of the MTEF as a trigger to move from the 1st Phase of the Reforms to the 2nd Phase
illustrates how important it is to get all crucial ministries on board in order to have a successful
product at the end. While the Health Development Partners were all quite pleased with the
MTEF end product, the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MOFDP) was
concerned that the MOHSW had proceeded with the exercise without their guidance as they are
the lead ministry in planning and budgeting. MOFDP eventually took the lead role in the MTEF
exercise producing a format that was considerably different from that of the MOHSW. This after
considerable resources had been expended during the sectoral MTEF of the MOHSW caused a
lot of discomfort and discouragement.
Another illustration of the importance of being on the same wavelength with the key Ministries
is the issue of creation of posts for the DHMTs. While MOHSW had done as requested to create
posts for the district teams and seemingly with the agreement of the Ministry of the Public
Service, it later transpired that these posts could only be created after a comprehensive review of
the structure of the MOHSW and the endorsement by the Ministry of Local Government and
Chieftainship. This happened after considerable frustration of the district teams and the drivers of
the decentralization process at central level in the MOHSW.
Thus it is very important to get all key ministries on board for new initiatives to be appreciated
by decision making entities. Time spent advocating and awareness creation amongst sister
ministries is bound to bear better fruit. The same can be said about Social Health Insurance
where it seems that what the MOHSW was advocating was not well appreciated by the other key
ministries. Having made this point, it should also be appreciated that the MOHSW had worked
very hard to get issues discussed but the other key ministries were not always forthcoming.

   c) Change in management culture

While the MOHSW acknowledged the need to make managers and their teams more accountable
for their actions and the need to motivate the workforce to improve performance, one of the
major tools to achieve this, a Performance Management System (PMS) for internal use, was
never appreciated or implemented. While the two top managers (the PS and Hon Minister) had to



                                                55
come up with Key Result Areas for appraisal by their principals, the Senior Managers were not
required to come up with something similar. The Public Service Appraisal Form was not always
filled in quarterly but only served as an administrative requirement for promotions rather than a
proper PMS. Granted this was not only a challenge within the MOHSW but all Ministries failed
to utilise it effectively as a management tool.

   d) Decentralization

The centralization of health and social services is key to improved health outcomes of the
population and their social wellbeing. Most of the Health Development Partners contributed to
the processes involved in decentralization. While the MOHSW was clear about the model of
decentralization it envisaged for the health sector and how this would unfold from de-
concentration, delegation and eventual devolution, the main actor in decentralization, the
Ministry of Local Government and Chieftainship (MOLG&C) was slow to develop its strategy
and appreciate the need to fast track the processes.. The MOHSW had three pilot districts to test
its sectoral de-concentration by establishing DHMTs. MOLG&C, however, did not pilot in the
same three districts. So the lessons learned could not be generalized to a multi-sectoral
decentralization process. In addition, at central level inter-sectoral meetings to provide guidance
and leadership to the process delayed to gather momentum. The MOHSW therefore proceeded
with rolling out the decentralization exercise to the remaining seven districts before the MLG&C
had functional District Councils with the requisite skills in place. The MOHSW also developed
its decentralization strategy before the lead ministry. Therefore the DHMTs worked initially
without a district council or local authority framework in place resulting in a very sectoral
approach to planning and budgeting. The MOHSW was conscious that a key requisite for
effective community input into planning, managing and monitoring health and social services is
the presence of a functional district council that oversees these three spheres for the improvement
of the health status of communities.
While awaiting creation and filling of the leadership positions of the DHMT, focal persons were
chosen to lead but because this did not come with remuneration some of them were not as
dedicated as expected. Capacity building of the DHMTs therefore had its drawbacks.

It is essential that the DHMT posts become substantive for capacity building at this level to
become sustainable. There are some good signs that the MOLG&C is now taking its leadership
role in decentralization and the MOHSW is capitalising on this to advise on the speed and
conditions required on the ground for decentralization to become successful. More clarity on the
specifics of what is required of the central managers in support of decentralization still has to be
shared by everybody. Similarly the collaboration and supportive role of the district and local
hospitals need further understanding in relation to the DHMTs.

   e) The Public Private Partnership (PPP) National Referral Hospital

One of the triggers of the 1st Phase of the HSR to move to the 2nd Phase was the need of GOL to
make a decision on the replacement of the QEII Hospital as the referral system was not
functioning poorly. GOL decided on a PPP arrangement for the replacement of QEII rather than
it going on its own or replacing it with a completely private hospital. The PPP model chosen by
GOL was a trail-blazer in Africa in that it went the full spectrum of construction, management,



                                                 56
provision of a service package and taking over of all staff rather than the usual model where the
PPP arrangement is confined to construction only or construction and hospital management only.
The process of decision making by GOL was assisted by the World Bank and the International
Finance Corporation (IFC). The process of deciding what facility was required was very
consultative and at the end of the process the facility agreed on was quite modest, commensurate
with the budget available.
 Construction of the hospital has begun and issues of contract management have already arisen.
Both the MOHSW and the MOFDP have had to play catch up to position themselves for the
challenges ahead in managing PPPs. It is absolutely necessary that the PPP Units in both these
ministries are capacitated urgently for the success of the project. These units will require
expansion to deal holistically with all other PPPs and outsourcing of services that may become
necessary in future.

6. Outstanding issues that need attention

   i)      Health Care Financing

Social health Insurance (SHI)
One of the main outstanding issues is that of Social Health Insurance. All analytical work on SHI
has been completed and a study tour successfully conducted. The Director General of the
Tanzania National Health Insurance Fund was identified as a consultant to assist with the
sensetisation of the Government top Management establishment of an appropriate SHI scheme
for Lesotho. This did not materialize because of the tight schedule of the consultant.
Establishment of SHI is thus work in progress that has fallen behind in implementation. Health
Development Partners will still be pursued to fund this work to completion so as to achieve
equity and affordability in health as per the Primary Health Care approach as recently re-
affirmed in the Ouagadougou Declaration.



National Health Accounts (NHA)

In both the 1st Phase and the 2nd Phase of the HSR economic planners and Financial Controllers
have been sent to learn on how to conduct National Health Accounts. As far as feasible these are
to be conducted at least biennially to inform management of where and how resources are spent
and for what purposes. An implementation schedule was drawn up but because of inadequacy in
staff numbers within the Planning Department, this has not been implemented. It is still the
intention to institutionalize the process for conducting NHA as soon as adequately skilled staff
becomes available.

   ii)     Strengthening the Policy Formulation function

The Directorate of Health Planning and Statistics is mandated with overall planning and policy
formulation. While the planning function is fairly adequately executed the policy formulation
function requires improving especially when policy formulation is viewed as a dynamic process
that needs review and updating constantly with the changes that occur in the health sector. Due

to inadequate Human Resources in the DHPS there is very limited time given to research and
debate that should inform policy before it is enacted. For example, the establishment of urban
gateway clinics, while a noble idea as it is pro-urban poor, the budgetary implications in terms of
human resource, equipment and supplies and infrastructure development could have been
researched more thoroughly to inform the MOHSW of a more realistic budget for the coming
financial year.


   iii)    Hospital Reforms

The Health Sector Reforms never addressed the issue of reforms that are required at hospitals in
the country except at the QEII Hospital which has resulted in the replacement of the hospital
altogether. Improving Public Health programmes was the main target but in the process
management of district hospitals has lagged behind. There is no doubt that better run hospitals
would contribute a lot to health outcomes. This becomes more urgent now that the benefits of the
PPP national referral hospital will to a large extent depend on an efficient referral system
resulting from appropriate referrals from well run regional and district hospitals.

   iv)     Coordinating Human Resources for Health (HRH) Development

The Human Resources crisis has taken centre stage for some time and it is lately getting the
attention of the Health Development Partners (HDP). A number of HDPs have now put aside
resources to support the efforts of the Ministry to tackle the challenges in HRH. The MOHSW
came up with a framework for capacity development which would see all partners pool resources
to fund identified gaps in Human Resource requirements. With the Ministry of Public Service
having approved the Restructuring Exercise of the MOHSW the capacity framework document is
now a very useful guide as to how to address the HRH requirements. It is a document that will
need regular updating as some requirements contained in the document are met as new needs
arise. Other issues in the document that need follow up address the issue of how best recruitment
could be achieved in a transparent manner with the inputs from HDP, and that of retention
allowances and general incentives to assure a committed and motivated workforce.

   v)      Establishing HMIS at district level

The central level Monitoring and Evaluation Unit was strengthened throughout the reforms
period. During the 2nd Phase attempts were made to decentralize the HMIS to district level by
recruitment of District Health Information Officers. However, there was a challenge in retaining
the engaged staff because of the problems elaborated earlier. This resulted in disruption of the
HMIS offices at district level. The new District Health Information Officers have been recruited
and hopefully their capacity building will not take too long because of the experience of the
central level. The Ministry has also successfully established a data warehouse at central level
which will improve data management to a large extend. For decentralization of health and social
services to be successful, a robust quality health management information system is essential for
district managers to be able to plan and manage health and social services properly at this level.
Concerted effort is required going forward to re-establish a district HMIS and getting the

DHMTs and Hospital management to appreciate the use of reliable information for improvement
of health outcomes. In addition, there will be need to coordinate all the initiatives in HMIS.

7) Conclusion

The Health Sector Reform Programme, both 1st and 2nd Phases, presented a very good
opportunity for partners and the MOHSW to improve the health outcomes of the nation through
a systematic manner that first put in place institutional capacity and then built on that by
supporting actual implementation of services that would achieve better outcomes. A SWAp was
built based on a common Strategic Plan and three year MTEF plans, a common Monitoring and
Evaluation mechanism, and a common accounting unit for all donor funds. Pooling of funds into
a common basket did not occur due to different HDPs requirements to keep funding separate but
close collaboration at project/programme design using the MOHSW three year MTEF sector
plan as the main framework resulted in well coordinated programmes in most cases. Willingness
to work in a SWAp environment was further strengthened by partners signing up a Code of
Conduct with the MOHSW. All these interventions of both the phases were ultimately meant to
improve health outcomes. Whether these outcomes improved or not will be seen when the
second Lesotho DHS results are out. These will be compared to the DHS results of 2004. The
second Lesotho DHS is currently being undertaken.
