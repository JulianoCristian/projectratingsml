   GUINEA-BISSAU — MULTI-SECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION
                              PROJECT
                               P097975

1. The Closing Date of the project will be extended from September 30, 2012 until June
   15, 2013.

2. Project implementation was progressing well until the occurrence of a military coup,
   which triggered the Bank Policy OP 7.30 on April 17, 2012 and led to the suspension
   of disbursements. The project’s disbursement rate is 78%, and there are activities yet
   to be procured and paid for such as some sector studies and technical assistance. The
   Project is up-to-date with its audits.

3. Due to the fact that the Bank is still assessing the situation and has not resumed
   communications with the Government, there is currently no request from Government
   to extend the Project. The extension is motivated due to the extraordinary
   circumstances in the country and as a precautionary measure, in order to give time to
   the Bank to assess the situation. The Project Development Objectives are still
   achievable and the project implementation unit is functioning.

4. Once the Bank determines to reestablish dialogue, the Bank will seek from
   Government the formal validation of the extension and an action plan for the
   extension period.

5. This will be the second extension of the project. A first extension from June 30, 2011
   to September 30, 2012 has already been approved.
