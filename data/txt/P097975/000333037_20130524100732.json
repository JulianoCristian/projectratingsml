to improve the institutional and management capacity and\n            governance in the power, water and roads sectors. The\n            changes will: (i) reallocate resources from the initially\n            planned roads rehabilitation works and water storage\n            construction towards: (a) increasing energy supply to the\n            city of Bissau by financing 5.5 MW of thermal generation\n            capacity (3MW bought and 2.5MW leased) and the acquisition\n            of power distribution equipment for Electricidade e Aguas da\n            Guink-Bissau (EAGB), the national electricity and water\n            utility. (Political instability and sector mismanagement\n            contributed to the difficulty of attracting private\n            participation in the power sector. This private\n            participation, which did not materialize, was initially\n            foreseen to add 15 MW of leased generating capacity.); and\n            (b) providing technical support for the preparation of\n            EAGB's restructuring under a Private Public Partnership\n            (PPP) arrangement, complementary to funds made available\n            under the proposed Emergency Electricity and Water\n            Rehabilitation Project (EEWRP); (ii) allow for additional\n            time to complete project activities for which some delays\n            have been experienced; and (iii) revise the results\n            framework to reflect the corresponding changes in the\n            project's expected results."}, "docdt": "2013-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
