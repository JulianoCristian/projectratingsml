1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background

1.     At appraisal Guinea-Bissau was one of the world’s poorest countries where more
than two-thirds of the population of about 1.5 million people lived under the poverty line,
with an average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of US$195 per annum.

2.      The country entered into a period of armed social conflict in 1998, which resulted
in the dismantling of large segments of the economy, social disruption, and physical
destruction of economic, infrastructure, and social service delivery assets and systems. A
new Government was elected in 2000, which was able to undertake a series of successful
recovery activities, but the country continued to suffer from lack of political, economic,
and social stability. A reform-minded transition Government was put in place following
the parliamentary elections of March 2004. This Government established an encouraging
record in the area of economic management and launched the preparation of a highly
participatory Poverty Reduction Strategy. The presidential election of August 2005 was
followed by a brief period of political tension. By January 2006 the Government had
stabilized, and in March 2006 a new government program was approved providing the
necessary political and institutional stability for the government to reconfirm its standing
commitments with the donor community.

3.      While there was a broad consensus on the need to support all sectors and regions
of the economy, there was agreement within the Government of Guinea Bissau (GoGB)
and the donor community that the rehabilitation of basic urban infrastructure, especially
power and water services, was paramount in the process of underpinning economic
recovery and political stabilization, and, singularly, to support the revitalization of the
public and private sectors of the economy.

Sector Background

4.       Power sector. Electricidade e Águas da Guiné-Bissau (EAGB, the Electricity and
Water Utility of Guinea Bissau) was established in 1983 to handle supply and distribution
to the public of electricity and water. EAGB’s situation at appraisal was characterized by:
(i) an insufficient and unreliable supply of electricity (both production and distribution well
below demand); (ii) high technical losses; (iii) a weak commercial management, including
poor revenue collection systems; (iv) a high (US$0.45/kwh) and ineffective tariff structure;
and (v) negative environmental consequences associated with an oil spill behind the EAGB
plant in Bissau. EAGB’s nominal installed generation capacity was about 16 MW.
However, due to frequent breakdowns, lack of maintenance and a fire breakout in
December 2003, the available capacity fluctuated between 2.6 MW and 3.6 MW. Basic
needs of households suffered from unreliable electricity supply. Economic activity was
also severely handicapped by insufficient power supply.


                                              1
5.     As all electricity generation in the country was based on diesel systems, the
improvement of the supply system and, in particular, the improvement of governance and
transparency in the petroleum sector were sine qua non to the improvement of the
functioning of the power sector and to the country’s overall economic competitiveness.

6.      Water sector. Guinea-Bissau faced major challenges in supplying water to its urban
population, which accounted for 60 percent of the total population. The status of water
services in the city of Bissau (326,000 habitants) was especially alarming and had
continuously deteriorated over the past decade. Only 18 percent of households had access
to private connections in the capital city. About 8 percent of the households were supplied
through 53 free public standpipes under precarious hygienic conditions. The majority of
the population (74 percent of the total), including all slum dwellers, relied on traditional
shallow wells highly exposed to the risk of pollution by wastewater from pit latrines. Bissau
was supplied by 11 boreholes with a total assessed production capacity of 30,000 m3/day.
However, only 56 percent of this capacity was utilized because of frequent interruptions in
pumping operations due to electricity shortage and an insufficient water storage capacity
(1130 m3, or seven percent of the daily production). Most parts of the water distribution
networks in the capital city consisted of old asbestos cement pipes in such poor condition
that 70 percent of the water produced was lost through leakage and un-metered household
connections. Overall, the water service was poor and intermittent, limited to three or four
hours per day in most neighborhoods in Bissau. The average water tariff (US$0.25/m3) did
not cover production costs. The low bill collection rate (60 percent) combined with high
technical losses (70 percent) resulted in very poor overall sector efficiency, which did not
exceed 20 percent.

7.      Roads sector. Guinea-Bissau had a 2,755 km national road network, including 770
km of paved roads and 1,985 km of modern earth roads. The network was largely
dilapidated due to the non-existence of a maintenance policy and program, the State’s
financial difficulties, institutional weaknesses, and the physical effects of the civil wars.
The city of Bissau had a network of communication routes comprising 50 km of paved
roads and 150 km of earth roads. Most of this network was built between the 1950s and
1970s. Its maintenance was almost non-existent with very few rehabilitation works
undertaken since they were constructed. About 80 percent of the national fleet of 5,240
vehicles was concentrated in Bissau, which had resulted in the marked deterioration of the
main roads linking the center, the port, and the industrial zone to the residential areas.
Within this context, the immediate priorities for the urban road sector were to: (i)
rehabilitate existing paved roads; and (ii) surface or re-gravel/reshape existing earth roads.
The state of the roads in Bissau constituted a major barrier to the normalization of economic
activity and delivery of social services in the city.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

8.     The Project's Development Objective (PDO) was to increase the availability of
urban power, water and roads infrastructure services. That objective was to be pursued
through: (i) improving the institutional and management capacity and governance in the

                                              2
power, water and roads sectors; (ii) restoring the access, reliability and quality of electricity
supplies and services in the city of Bissau to pre-conflict levels; (iii) restoring and
increasing access to and quality of water supply services in the city of Bissau to the pre-
conflict levels; and, (iv) rehabilitating damaged roads in the city of Bissau.

9.     The following indicators were included at approval to measure Project
performance:

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

10.      The revised PDO is “to assist the Government in increasing the availability and
reliability of electricity and water supply in its capital city and improve the institutional
and management capacities in the energy and water sectors.” The PDO was revised as part
of the first Project restructuring due to ambitious project design and lack of private sector
interest in the energy sector and to better reflect the cancellation of the road rehabilitation
activities; it was also slightly modified to reconcile a discrepancy between the Financing
Agreement and the Project Appraisal Document (PAD).

11.     Indicators were also revised as part of the first Project restructuring to better reflect
the restructured Project activities and to incorporate new core energy sector indicators as
shown below (Annex 10 includes the revised results framework):

  1.4 Main Beneficiaries

  12.     Original Project beneficiaries were the urban population of Bissau benefiting from
  improved electricity, water, and road services. With the first Project restructuring,
  beneficiaries were identified as the population benefiting from improved/expanded
  electricity and water supply systems in the capital.

  1.5 Original Components

  13.    The Project included five main components: (i) Institutional Development and
  Sectoral Studies; (ii) Restoration/Rehabilitation of the Power System; (iii) Rehabilitation
  of Water Production, Treatment and Urban Distribution; (iv) Limited Rehabilitation of
  Urban Road Infrastructure; and (v) Project Management, Monitoring & Evaluation. The
  components are summarized below:


                                                        5
14.    Component 1: Institutional Development and Sectoral Studies (US$2.50
million). This component would undertake institutional and capacity development support
and sectoral studies for the Ministry of the Economy, State Secretariat for Energy, Ministry
of Natural Resources, EAGB, and the Ministry of Public Works, Construction and Town
Planning to achieve the development of the energy, water, and road sectors and the
improvement of the technical and financial management of the respective sectors’ assets.

15.     Component 2: Restoration and Rehabilitation of the Power System (US$2.35
million). This component would essentially support a fast-tracked restoration and
rehabilitation of power generation and distribution and commercial operations in Bissau,
including: (a) the restoration of power generation via the competitive contracting of a
private operator for the generation of 15 MW for a period of three to five years (henceforth
denominated as Private Operation Scheme, or POS); (b) the rehabilitation of the electricity
billing collection system by the establishment and operation of an electricity pre-payment
meter system (15,000 units) by a private operator through a Build, Operate and Transfer
scheme (BOT, financed by IDA through the Private Sector Rehabilitation and
Development Project, PSRDP); and (c) the rehabilitation of the distribution network
(financed by the West African Development Bank, BOAD).

16.      Component 3: Rehabilitation of Water Production, Treatment and Urban
Distribution (US$4.85 million). This component would finance the rehabilitation and
reinforcement of water production systems in the city of Bissau and included the following
sub-components: (a) Water Production including: (i) the construction of a new reservoir
(700 m3) within the existing premises of EAGB in the vicinity of the “August 3 Hospital”;
and (ii) replacement of the pumping system of the existing borehole; (b) Water Distribution
including (i) replacement of 3.6 km of primary water distribution networks along existing
roads and 9 km of tertiary water distribution networks; and (ii) extension of 26.3 km of
tertiary water distribution networks to unserved areas and the construction of 700 water
connections and 50 public standpipes in peri-urban areas of Bissau; and (c) Billing System
and Operation tools including (i) supply and installation of 6,000 water meters; (ii) supply
and installation of 11 macro water meters; and (iii) equipment and logistical supplies to
EAGB, including water analysis kits, fire standpipes, operation tools, and vehicles.

17.     Component 4: Limited Rehabilitation of Urban Road Infrastructure (US$3.20
million). This component included a limited rehabilitation of “pot holes” along a set of
roads of 20-30 kilometers in the city of Bissau. This component would finance: (a)
feasibility studies to determine the type of works needed as well as the eligibility criteria
and timing for reconstruction of urban roads in the Recipient’s territory; (b)
implementation of a limited roads rehabilitation program, including civil works,
acquisition of equipment, and provision of consultant services to rehabilitate the primary
and secondary road network in the city of Bissau; (c) supervision activities for civil works
under item (b) above; and (d) acquisition of one 4x4 vehicle.

18.    Component 5: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.60
million). This component would finance the operational costs of the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU). There was also a contingency of US$1.50 million included under the Project.

1.6 Revised Components

19.  The first Project restructuring in July 2010 canceled some of the activities under
Components 3 and 4 and reallocated IDA funds to emergency power generation.

20.         The following activities were cancelled:

           Component 3: Rehabilitation of Water Production, Treatment and Urban
            Distribution. Financing for the water reservoir was cancelled. The financing of the
            reservoir was added to a new project under preparation – the Emergency Electricity
            and Water Rehabilitation Project (EEWRP), which was approved by the World
            Bank Board on July 23, 2010.

           Component 4: Limited Rehabilitation of Urban Road Infrastructure. The
            following sub-components were cancelled: 4.2. Supervision/Control of roads
            rehabilitation works (US$0.30 million) and 4.3. Road Rehabilitation Works
            (US$2.60 million). The rationale for the cancellation of these activities was the fact
            that the European Union (EU) was preparing a project that would include a larger
            roads rehabilitation program, making the small road components in this project
            obsolete. The sub-component 4.1: Preparation of a road rehabilitation investment
            program was deemed crucial in planning sector development and in mobilizing
            resources from the donor community.

21.     The resources released from the cancelled activities were used to address
emergency power generation capacity needs. New activities included the purchase of 3
MW of thermal generation capacity and the extension of the lease on the existing 2.5 MW
generation capacity for one year. The purchase of 3 MW of generation capacity was
originally tendered under the IDA funded PSRDP. The selected bid of €1.5 million
exceeded the available budget by US$600,000. The IDA reallocation was essential to
maintain a minimum level of electricity supply in Bissau and avoid a complete blackout of
the city, which could have had humanitarian implications.

22.         Table 3 below shows the changes in IDA funding allocation by component.

23.     A second restructuring in September 2012 extended the Project closing date from
September 30, 2012 until June 15, 2013. A third restructuring in May 2013 included an
extension of the closing date from June 15, 2013 to March 31, 2014, and a reallocation of
the proceeds of the IDA grant. In total, the three closing date extensions amounted to two
years and nine months.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.    Project preparation and implementation must be viewed through the lens of a fragile
and volatile political context. The fragility of the post-conflict situation influenced the
design of the Project and later modifications.

Soundness of the Background Analysis

25.     Technical analysis of the sectors to be supported by the Project was thorough and
the activities to be supported by the Project were aligned with Government priorities in the
water and energy sectors as reflected in the GoGB’s 2005 Interim National Power and
Water Sector Rehabilitation and Development Programs. Within the overall context of the
Interim National Program for the Power and Water sectors, a short-to-medium term
investment program was jointly identified by the GoGB, IDA, and BOAD. The Multisector
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (MIRP) focused on key activities for the city of Bissau
within those sectors. In addition, the Project included some priority activities to be financed
for the roads sector such as the rehabilitation of the primary and secondary road network
in the city of Bissau, which were later dropped during the first project restructuring as
explained in Section 1.6. The project was appraised by a team with the required technical
skills.

26.      Lessons learned and incorporated in Project design. Project preparation benefited
from the experience gained from the World Bank’s operational involvement in
infrastructure projects in the Africa region and in Low Income Countries Under Stress
(LICUS) and incorporated key lessons learned, especially: (i) the need to adopt a flexible
approach allowing a parallel implementation of the investment program and the
institutional reforms; (ii) the need to implement measures aimed at restoring power and/or
water production and distribution accompanied by the implementation of activities
intended at establishing a system-wide culture of bill payment; (iii) providing support to
the development and adoption of an appropriate tariff policy in order to restore the financial
equilibrium of the water and electricity sectors; and (iv) allowing the mobilization of fixed-
term specialized external expertise to support the utility in sanitizing the technical and
commercial management systems while allowing the utility to concentrate on handling a
the physical assets restoration/rehabilitation process

27.   Rationale for Bank involvement. After years of political instability, on March 16,
2006 a new government program was approved providing the necessary political and
                                              8
institutional stability for the country to be able to reconfirm its standing commitments with
the donor community. The rehabilitation and expansion of the country infrastructure
systems and services was considered a key input and precondition to economic stability
and growth, private sector development, social services delivery, and employment and
income generation. In that context, the Project was critical to the rebuilding of basic urban
power, water, and road infrastructure in the city of Bissau, which, in the absence of
immediate external support, would further deteriorate with unforeseeable consequences on
economic growth, health, and other social services.

28.     Moreover, the participation of IDA in the infrastructure sector was considered
essential for the re-engagement of the broader donor community in Guinea Bissau, not only
from the funding point of view, but because of the need to restore governance,
transparency, and credibility to the Government’s capacity to implement donor funded
programs and projects. Furthermore, given its long standing experience on energy and
water sector rehabilitation and reforms and on road maintenance, management, and
financing in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA), the Bank had a comparative advantage to support
the design and implementation of strategic rehabilitation work in the energy, water, and
roads sectors.
 
Assessment of Project Design

29.     The Project design responded to the immediate needs of the country at the time.
However, the Project objective of increasing the availability of urban power, water, and
roads infrastructure services and expected outcomes were ambitious compared to the size
of the operation (US$15 million of new IDA, US$5 million of parallel BOAD financing,
and US$5 million reallocation under an existing IDA project). Even given the small size
of the country, the Project targeted three major infrastructure sectors (electricity, water,
and roads) which required substantial financial resources and implementation of important
reforms to achieve the expected results. Moreover, the design of Component 2 supported a
fast-tracked restoration and rehabilitation of power generation and distribution and
commercial operations in Bissau, relying heavily on private sector participation for a power
plant in an unstable political and macroeconomic environment with a utility in a difficult
financial situation. While it is understandable that the Government and donors partners,
including IDA, wanted to take a comprehensive approach, it was not realistic given the
situation on the ground. Ultimately, lack of interest from the private sector in the
installation and management of the pre-payment metering systems and its commercial
operation, and in Public Private Partnerships (PPP) for the water sector resulted in changes
to those activities.

30.      As mentioned, the Project’s scope was quite ambitious, and valid reasons existed
at the time of appraisal to justify the approach that was adopted, including: (i) the fact that
the Project would finance activities that were considered an “urgent first and critical step”
towards the rebuilding of basic urban power, water, and road infrastructure in the city of
Bissau and contribute to the long-term development of those sectors by laying the
foundation for the required future investments; (ii) the absence of alternative sources of
financing; and (iii) the fact that this design was a proactive response in a post-conflict

                                              9
context where the Project was the first donor intervention in infrastructure. Moreover,
projects in small countries tend to include a range of components/sectors as there are often
fewer but more multi-sector operations in the country.

31.     The initial indicators were a mix of inputs and outputs. Baseline data was not
collected for various subcomponents. The PDO indicators listed in the Financing
Agreement were listed as output indicators in the PAD. Some of the indicators relied not
only on activities to be implemented under the Project.

32.     Project components and organization are considered adequate as they were
separated by sector with clear sub-components/activities to be implemented by a
centralized PCU (given the shortage of skilled staff in the sector agencies and the need to
coordinate among agencies). This was a suitable arrangement given the limited capacity of
sector institutions.  
 
Adequacy of Government Commitment

33.      The Government and a key set of stakeholders who supported project preparation
were committed to the reform agenda and restoration of the sectors included in the Project,
but the volatility of the political environment reduced buy-in with respect to expectations
at appraisal. The Government’s commitment to undertake wide-ranging reforms in the
power and water sectors to improve the availability and reliability of electricity supply and
water services in the country at the time of Project preparation was evident by the activities
implemented or pledged to be implemented by the Government prior to Project appraisal.
For the energy sector, the GoGB had taken important steps including: (a) the ratification
of the standing “Energy Sector Policy Note” and the commitment to update it to incorporate
the findings and recommendations of several ongoing and planned studies for the
development of the energy sector; and (b) the revision of and commitment to promulgate
a new “Electricity Law” acceptable to IDA by December 31, 2006. For the water sector,
the Government had issued a Letter of Sector Development Policy (LSDP) to formulate
sector reforms aiming at: (i) increasing water coverage in urban centers; (ii) restoring
financial viability with an appropriate tariff policy based on cost recovery; and (iii)
improving the sector management and performance through PPPs.

Adequacy of Risk Assessment

34.     The PAD includes an assessment of risks and proposed mitigation measures. Some
of the identified risks turned out to have a significant impact on the Project’s
implementation performance. For example, the political/social context of the country was
identified as a risk at appraisal and this risk materialized: in March 2009 the President of
Guinea-Bissau was assassinated, and in 2012 the country experienced a military coup. The
coup triggered Bank Operational Policy (OP) 7.30 on April 17, 2012, which led to the
suspension of disbursements, which in turn led to delays in Project implementation. As a
result of this volatile political situation, the GoGB was not able to implement reforms
needed to put the sectors targeted by the pojrect on a road to recovery. Some risks that
affected Project implementation, such as the financial sustainability and the technical


                                             10
performance of the utility, were not identified at appraisal, but were addressed during the
2010 restructuring. 

35.      The risk of lack of interest from the private sector in investing on the energy and
water sectors was identified at appraisal and was proposed to be mitigated by IDA’s
involvement in the Project and the setting-up of an IDA Partial Risk Guarantee instrument
for the power component (POS. scheme and fuel supply). This risk materialized, as the
proposed POS scheme was no longer considered appropriate during the mid-term review
and was cancelled during the restructuring of 2010 (see section 2.2 for details cancellation
of this scheme). 

36.     The project also identified risks related to financial management (FM) due to the
country level weaknesses in the budget execution process. The mitigation measure was to
create a PCU within the existing and experienced Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of the
Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project (PSRDPPIU) located in the
Ministry of Economy to mitigate the risk. This was an adequate mitigation measure and
the risk did not materialize. FM and procurement ratings were satisfactory for most of the
Project implementation period.

37.   There was no Quality at Entry assessment undertaken by the Bank’s Quality
Assurance Group (QAG).

2.2 Implementation

38.   The Project was approved by the Board on June 15, 2006, became effective on
August 30, 2007, and closed on March 30, 2014. As described in Section 1.7, the Project
underwent three restructurings.

39.     The activities co-financed by the BOAD for the rehabilitation and installation of
urban distribution network were completed during the first two years of Project
implementation. These activities contributed to the reduction in electricity losses and
increasing power distribution for end-users.

40.     Also, after some initial delays, the investments in the water networks (with the
exception of the construction of the water reservoir) were nearly completed by the time of
the Project mid-term review (MTR) in November 2009. By the MTR, the implementation
of the roads rehabilitation component was significantly delayed, and the activities initially
planned for the electricity to be financed by IDA had changed. The MTR showed solid
performance in procurement and disbursements. This was in large part due to an efficient,
competent, and well-managed PCU under the Ministry of Economy. At MTR, progress
towards achieving the PDO was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) while
implementation progress was rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

41.     By the MTR, it was obvious that power generation capacity available for
distribution and water pumping had decreased in Bissau. This was due to the
decommissioning of unusable nominal installed capacity and the serious delays in the

                                             11
commissioning of regional power infrastructure. EAGB was not able to lease power
capacity or purchase enough fuel to run additional capacity due its dire financial situation.
A collapse of electricity generation in Bissau in December 2007 underlined the need for
financing emergency generation.

42.     At MTR, the Bank was requested to restructure the Project to extend the closing
date and reallocate funds to allow for the co-financing of emergency generation capacity
and leasing of emergency generators. As such, the Project was instrumental in maintaining
some public power generation capacity given the significant operational and financial
problems of EAGB. The first Project restructuring in July 2010 responded to the evolving
emergency situation and extended the Project closing date from June 30, 2011 to
September 30, 2012 to allow the PDO targets to be achieved. Project resources were
reallocated to co-finance the purchase of emergency generation capacity (2 x 1.5 MW) and
to finance a contract for leasing emergency generators (3 x 850 kW) that had been signed
in January 2008.   At the same time, by the MTR it was clear that the POS was no longer
appropriate since the OMVG hydropower project would not be operational before 2017,
and thus a leasing contract of eight years did not make economic sense. Also, it was very
unlikely that a private operator would take the risk of leasing capacity to EAGB even with
a Bank provided partial risk guarantee given EAGB’s financial situation and
macroeconomic risks in Guinea Bissau. Lastly, as part of the first restructuring the transport
component was mostly cancelled and resources reallocated.

43.    At the same time, a new IDA project of US$12.7 million was prepared under the
Rapid Response to Crisis and Emergency OP/BP 8.00 and financed by the IDA Crisis
Response Window. The Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation Project (EEWRP)
was designed to assist the GoGB in the rapid restoration and improvement of electricity
and water supply services in its capital city by investing in physical assets for electricity
generation and water storage, thereby restoring essential utility services to households and
the means of production and economic activities for firms.

44.      From 2009 to early 2012, Project implementation was progressing well and
disbursement had reached 78 percent by the end of the first quarter of 2012. However, the
military coup on April 17, 2012 triggered Bank OP 7.30 and led to the suspension of
disbursements. The suspension was lifted in January 2013. To address delays in Project
implementation resulting from the suspension, a second restructuring extended the Project
closing date from September 30, 2012 until June 15, 2013. This was to allow time for
completion of activities yet to be procured and some sector studies and technical assistance
that still needed to be finalized. 

45.     A third restructuring included a final extension of the closing date from June 15,
2013 to March 31, 2014, and a final reallocation of Grant proceeds. The extension of
closing date was requested so that the technical assistance, environmental clean-up works,
and some other activities could be completed. A minor reallocation of proceeds among
disbursement categories was carried out to: (i) accommodate the additional operating cost
related to the extension of the closing date; (ii) reflect the latest procurement plan; and (iii)



                                               12
accommodate a slight increase in the cost of works, training, and goods, which was
compensated by savings in consultant services.

46.     After the first restructuring in 2010, Project implementation was consistently rated
moderately satisfactory or satisfactory. At closing, all Project activities were implemented
(except for the environmental clean-up works for the new generation plant since the new
plant was not installed – see para 52). Final disbursement was US$15.14 million, slightly
above the approved US$15 million (and 96 percent of the US$15.77 million available at
Project closing due to exchange rate gains). The approved SDR Project amount was 10.3
million and final disbursements were SDR 9.89 million.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

47.     Design of M&E System. The results framework included in the original Project
design covered activities to be financed by the MIRP, the funds to be reallocated under the
PSRDP, and the BOAD parallel co-financing. The justification for this was the integrated
and interdependent nature of the projects that were all part of the same framework of
outcomes. In hindsight, the M&E system design led to difficulties in monitoring activities
to be implemented by other financing sources. It also created a “double accounting system”
in the case of the indicator “Improve collection rate of electricity bills,” which was
measured both by the PSRDP and MIRP. 

48.     Implementation of the M&E System. Monitoring and evaluation was challenging
throughout Project implementation due to EAGB's low capacity to provide reliable
technical, commercial, and financial data, as reflected in various Implementation Status
and Results Reports (ISRs) and Aide-memoires. The quality of data improved overtime.
During the 2010 restructuring, the new M&E framework tried to address some of its initial
deficiencies, but ended up including indicators related to activities to be implemented by
the EEWRP (i.e., electricity generation capacity owned by EAGB, collection rate of
electricity bills, installation of the pre-paid meters).

49.     The changes in the M&E framework created confusion for EAGB and the PCU in
terms of what needed to be measured. For instance, the addition of new core indicators to
be measured (i.e., Direct/indirect beneficiaries to water supply services (number, female
(percent)); number of people provided with access to “improved water sources”) needed to
be clarified after which the PCU collected the required data.
 
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

50.     Financial Management. Financial management was rated satisfactory throughout
Project implementation. PIU staffing remained adequate and proper books of accounts and
supporting documents were kept in respect of all expenditures. The auditors’ opinions on
the annual financial statements were submitted on time and were unqualified. The interim
un-audited financial reports were also submitted on time and the quality of the reports was
satisfactory.



                                            13
51.    Procurement. Procurement was rated satisfactory throughout Project
implementation. All Project components were implemented following the Bank’s
applicable procurement guidelines for works, goods, and services. The PCU was staffed
with a Procurement Specialist proficient in Bank procedures. The Project faced a
problem with a bidding process that took place 2008 for extending the contract with
MARFORCE for the leasing of the generators, but it was satisfactorily addressed with the
re-launch of the procurement process.

52.     Safeguards. The Project was classified as category B and triggered OP 4.01.
Safeguards were rated S or MS throughout Project implementation. During the MTR, it
was agreed to reinforce the PCU by recruiting a qualified Social and Environmental
Specialist to ensure appropriate implementation of social and environmental aspects of the
Project. At Project closing, the environmental clean-up of the power plant site was not
implemented due to delays in finalizing the contract for installing the new generators that
did not allow the launch of the environmental clean-up. This activity will be financed by
the Emergency Water and Electricity Services Upgrading Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

53.     The ongoing Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation Project (EEWRP)
and a new IDA operation - the Emergency Water and Electricity Services Upgrading
Project (EWESUP) - approved by the Bank Board in the first semester of 2014 for US$22.5
million will continue supporting the water and energy sectors. The country’s power supply
will remain dependent on oil-based generation for the next three years at least. The Bank
is providing support to shift from more expensive diesel oil (distillate diesel oil) to lower-
cost heavy fuel oil (HFO) and to re-establish revenue collection. In that context, the
EWESUP is financing the provision of HFO in order to help build a sustainable supply
chain for the power plant, improving the reliability and efficiency of overloaded medium
and low voltage, securing the electricity supply of water production, and improving
customer management and revenue collection, among other activities. EWESUP is also
financing rehabilitation of distribution networks and additional prepayment meters that are
expected to reduce losses and increase revenues. At the same time, financing for the
OMVG interconnection is likely to be approved by various donors (including the Bank) in
the first half of 2015, which over the longer term is expected to help reduce generation
costs. 
 
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

54.      The Project is assessed as highly relevant to the development priorities of the
Government both at outset and at completion. The country urgently needed to increase the
availability and reliability of electricity and water supply in its capital city and improve the
institutional and management capacities in the energy and water sectors.

55.    The Project supports the Bank’s twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and

                                              14
boosting shared prosperity by providing access to safe water to the poor in unserved peri-
urban areas of Bissau and by restoring water and electricity services under affordable
conditions throughout the city. The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) finalized in
in November 2014 points out that poverty is broadly distributed across the population and
country, including the capital city, and that the lack of reliable basic public utilities,
electricity and water, constrains livelihood and business development opportunities.

56.     The Project is highly relevant to the Government’s Second Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP II). The Project is fully aligned with two of its core areas: (i) Pillar
3, Promoting sustainable, inclusive and broad-based economic growth through support to
economic sectors with strong growth potential; and (ii) Pillar 4, Developing human capital
within the framework of a better life for the people, as well as gender equity, in the context
of the new sectoral and cross-cutting policies.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

57.     The achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDO) is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory (MU). It should be noted that, despite this rating, the Project had a
considerable positive impact on the electricity sector in Guinea-Bissau and helped maintain
and restore electricity and water services during a very difficult period. This had economic,
health, and the security benefits in a fragile country.

58.      In accordance with the Bank’s Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR) guidelines, since the PDO and some of the PDO targets were formally modified
during the July 2010 restructuring, the Project has been assessed against both the original
and the revised PDO. The achievement against both the original and the revised PDO
results in an MU rating.

electricity bills


59.    Prior to the Project restructuring of 2010, PDO achievements were rated as MU.
The rehabilitation and installation of urban distribution network had contributed to the
reduction in electricity losses and increasing power distribution for end-users.
Considerable progress was achieved on rehabilitation of water infrastructure (with the
exception of the construction of the water reservoir). However, several activities were not
on track, especially the reduction and billing recovery and the POS for a 15 MW power
generation leasing contract. The road rehabilitation activities had seen very little progress.

60.     The achievement of the PDO after restructuring is also rated as MU. This rating
takes into consideration that the Project almost reached or exceeded the targets for two
PDO indicators, but only partially achieved the targets for four other PDO indicators. The
indicator that exceeded its target was the number of “Direct/indirect beneficiaries to
electricity supply services” thanks to the successful installation of more than 15,000 pre-
paid meters. In addition, the target for “Number of people provided with access to
“improved water sources”  is estimated to be 99 percent achieved due to the successful
implementation of all Project activities in the water sector (more below).

61.    The PDO target on “annual electricity distribution to end-users (GWh)” was mostly
achieved in 2013 when it reached 33.2 GWh. However, due to external problems with fuel
supply in 2014, the amount of electricity distributed decreased in 2014. Thus only 35
percent of the target was achieved at Project close. It should be noted that the installed
capacity to generate and transmit the power is available and once the fuel supply issue is

                                                    16
solved, distribution to end-users is expected to reach and exceed the 35 GWh target. The
current fuel supply crisis can be attributed to various factors, including the dire financial
situation of the utility, which does not have the financial resources to pay for the required
fuel; technical problems related to the difficulties to switch some of the generators to
operate on less expensive HFO; and macroeconomic problems due to the GoGB’s lack of
resources to pay for diesel imports. Moreover the focus of the MIRP was on supporting the
restoration and rehabilitation of critical infrastructure in the energy and water sectors in the
city of Bissau and not on the utility´s financial and commercial recovery. The improvement
of the utility´s financial and commercial performance is being addressed by the ongoing
Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation Project (EERP) and the Emergency Water
and Electricity Services Upgrading Project (EWESUP) - approved by the Bank Board on
July 29, 2010 and May 29, 2014 respectively.

62.    The targets for “direct/indirect beneficiaries to water supply services” was 77
percent achieved, and the target for the “level of water losses” was 86 percent achieved.
The partial achievements of these water targets can be explained by a disconnect between
the PDO targets, which were overestimated, and the activities. All activities related to water
supply services were adequately implemented, includes: (i) replacement of 3.6 km of
primary water distribution networks and 9 km of tertiary water distribution networks; (ii)
an extension of 26.3 km of tertiary water distribution networks to unserved areas; (iii) the
construction of 700 water connections and 50 new public standpipes in peri-urban areas of
Bissau; and (iv) the supply and installation 6,000 water meters and provided equipment
and logistical supplies to EAGB to improve operational performance of the water utility.

63.      The target on the “collection rate of electricity bills” was 77 percent achieved. This
can be explained by the fact that EAGB faced problems with the new billing software
installed in 2013 by SENELEC (the Senegalese electric utility), which resulted in delays
in billing of an important number of customers during the first semester of 2014. Problems
with the software were mostly resolved after the Project closed. A large number of pre-
paid meters were installed at the end of Project implementation and have led to collection
rate improvements since Project closing. However, this improvement was not captured
before Project closing, which is the date that indicators were monitored for ICR purposes.
In addition, improvement of collection rates for government customers was difficult to
achieve since the utility did not stop providing electricity to those customers even given
lack of payment. The collection rate has improved since Project, closing, reaching 98
percent for household and commercial customers. However, the collection rate for central
government and local authorities remains less than 50 percent, impeding achievement of
the overall target of 83 percent.

64.    In addition to the PDO indicators, four of the five intermediate indicators were
achieved. The reduction in total energy losses was the only intermediate indicator that
could not be achieved mostly due to the poor technical and financial performance of
EAGB. The situation of the distribution network in the country has further deteriorated due
to the state of the country and the energy sector, leading to more technical losses. In
addition, some of the private “independent” energy suppliers are still able to connect to
EAGB’s network due to the confusion derived from the de facto situation where there are

                                              17
multiple producers. This situation will improve once EAGB is able to supply all the
demand in Bissau and shut down the illegal private producers. However, with the
installation of the 15,000 pre-paid meters and the additional ones that will be installed in
the next couple of years, it is expected that the commercial losses will be substantially
reduced.

3.3 Efficiency

65.     The original Project documentation included an economic and financial analysis
for the power and water investment activities. The institutional development and road
maintenance activities were not included in the analysis, which is justifiable given the
largely qualitative nature of the expected outcomes. 

66.     The analysis performed at appraisal was primarily a financial analysis rather than a
full economic analysis. The forecasts considered only the expected additional costs and
revenues accruing to the utility (EAGB) as a result of the Project. The impact on users
(additional consumer surplus, increased tariffs, etc.) was not part of the analysis. The
Project document provided only the estimated Net Present Value (NPV) for power
investments, and only an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for water investments.

67.     It is important to properly assess ex post the Project impact. The Project has
contributed to maintaining water supply in Bissau as well as some level of electricity
service. The Project also contributed to EAGB continuing to provide minimum electricity
services, although those were was rationed and mostly directed to the following
beneficiaries: government services, health facilities, water supply (pumping), peace
keeping forces, and public lighting. Even if provided at a loss by EAGB, electricity services
had a significant economic value for users. Deriving estimates of the value of the
willingness to pay (WTP) from the prices paid by private users (commercial or households)
to alternative suppliers (micro-generators operating with diesel) results in a more nuanced
assessment of the project efficiency.
 
Financial analysis

68.    An implied IRR has been calculated for three scenarios using the original economic
analysis in the PAD.

69.       The three scenarios analyzed in the PAD were the following:

         “Short term energy scenario” considering EAGB costs and revenue over only a
          five year period (2007-2011) corresponding to the duration of diesel-fueled
          generation capacity;
         “Worst case scenario” consisting of the continuation of rental for an additional
          15 years (until 2026);
         “Realistic Scenario” assuming the transition to HFO-based generation from 2012
          onwards (also until 2026).

                                             18
70.     The last two scenarios consisted of forecasts far into the future and thus largely
depended on factors that were unrelated to the Project itself (e.g., investments in HFO
generation). Also, the forecast of cost and revenues over the long term were very uncertain,
leading for instance to a feature in the “Worst case scenario” of large deficits at the end of
the period resulting in a dual IRR (-1 percent and +269 percent).

71.     The assumptions for the financial and economic analysis at appraisal stage were
very optimistic for all three scenarios. All three scenarios assumed an immediate reduction
of total (technical and non-technical) distribution losses from over 40 percent to eight
percent. A dramatic reduction in distribution losses was optimistic and unlikely, especially
in view of the fragile situation of the country. For all three scenarios, assuming distribution
losses of 20 percent (already a very significant improvement) would have resulted in
negative NPVs.

72.     In reality, distribution losses remained very high (around 45 percent). The analysis
done for the purpose of the ICR takes into consideration these actual losses and results in
a negative NPV for each scenario.
                             Table 6: Financial analysis – electricity

                                                             -1%

Water Sector

73.     It is difficult to reassess the Project IRR and NPV for water investments ex post
given the original methodology. The PAD indicated an Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR) of 43 percent for water investments. No NPV was provided. This can be explained
by the methodology, which did not take into consideration the costs of the initial capex
investments in water (US$4.3 million), but only modest increase in interest costs for five
years (two percent of the initial investments) and capital repayments over 15 years starting
in year six. Furthermore, the calculation assumed a reduction of water distribution losses
from 70 percent to 40 percent over a two year period (the PAD main text indicates a
reduction to only 50 percent, but this does not reflect the actual assumption used as per
calculations in the relevant Annex). Also, the calculation of benefits includes extra revenue
from a future 20 percent increase in water tariffs), which was not logically attributable to
the Project. 




                                                19
Ex post economic analysis

74.     At the time of Project preparation, EAGB’s operational and financial performance
was very weak. The Project did not bring about sufficient improvement in EAGB’s
performance to restore the company’s financial viability. However, EAGB continued to
provide essential services. For the purpose of the ICR, an ex post economic analysis has
been carried out to assess the economic impact of the Project based on a comparison of
electricity service cost of EAGB services to that of private micro-generators (small diesel
gensets ), which range from 500 to 1,000 CFAF per kWh (~USc 100 to 200). This is
equivalent to two to four times EAGB’s tariffs.

75.    An ex post economic analysis shows an EIRR of 32.9 percent for incremental
generation investments. The ex post analysis assumes a willingness to pay (WTP) at the
lower bound of the range of observed prices for micro-generation in Bissau (USc 100 per
kWh). The analysis applies a discount of 20 percent to this value in order to reflect the fact
that due to the relatively high level of non-payment, the electricity supplied by EAGB is
presumably used less efficiently than for private micro-generators. Assumptions on the cost
are based largely on the technical and financial reporting from EAGB for 2013 and 2014.
An assumption was made that generation equipment is used for five years, which is a worst-
case scenario as generation equipment might have a useful technical life of 15 years if
properly maintained. On this basis, the levelized cost of electricity delivered to EAGB’s
customers through incremental investment in thermal generation is estimated at US$0.69
per kWh with a 10 percent discount rate (and 0.71 with a 15 percent discount rate).

76.     The ex post economic analysis suggests that there is a good economic case for
supporting EAGB in the provision of essential services. It is also clear that there is a
significant scope for reducing EAGB’s supply costs (reducing specific consumption,
switching to lower cost HFO instead of DDO, increasing load factor, improving
maintenance, etc.). Details of the economic analysis modelling are provided in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
 
77.     Overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, taking into consideration the
high relevance of the Project, the Moderately Unsatisfactory PDO achievement, and the
Moderately Satisfactory achievement in terms of efficiency per discussion above. Despite
the MU rating, it should be noted that Project was able to achieve much in a difficult
political situation. The Project addressed urgent needs in the water and energy sectors, and
the Project helped maintain and restore electricity and water services in a fragile country.
The fuel supply crisis in the last years of Project implementation had a negative effect on
the achievement of the PDO targets. Also the targets for the water sector activities were
overestimated at Project design. The financial analysis shows the major financial problems
of the utility EAGB, but the economic analysis shows the economic value of the services
provided to households and business as a result of the Project.




                                             20
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

78.     Poverty, gender, and social impacts are not easily estimated under the Project due
to the lack of baseline analysis and follow-up surveys and end of Project surveys; gender
disaggregated data was estimated per the figures on female beneficiaries in the results
framework. However, it should be highlighted that without the Project the electricity and
water and related health situation in the country would have further deteriorated following
the energy crisis of 2007.

79.     On the energy sector, the number of electricity connections increased more than
anticipated by the Project, and the installed capacity for power generation is available,
however power generation has been constrained since late 2013 (especially due to fuel
supply problems) and load shedding is a problem. It is expected that once the fuel supply
issues are resolved, the utility will continue to increase access to more people in the
country.

80.    With regards to water sector, health and gender impacts due to increased and better
water services are directly correlated. Better water services in the city of Bissau due to the
Project activities benefit all residents, andt women in particular. The reduction in the
extensive time and effort spent gathering water spent mainly by women allows them to
devote more time to educational, productive, and recreational activities, and/or for doing
other household chores. Moreover, adequate water services reduce the incidence of cholera
and other water related diseases that affect the city population, particularly vulnerable
groups, such as children, the elderly, and women.
 
    (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

81.     The Project contributed moderately to the strengthening of the technical and
managerial capacities in EAGB as well as the water and energy directorates at the Ministry
of Trade, Energy, Industry and Environment through in-country formal and informal
training sessions as well as through the participation of staff in the preparation and review
of studies. Staff increased their competencies and know-how in areas such as energy and
water policy formulation, energy and water regulation, commercial and financial aspects
of the utility, and technical aspects, such as the installation and maintenance of pre-paid
meters.
 
(c) Other unintended outcomes 
 
82.     No unintended outcomes. 
 
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

83.   There was neither a beneficiary survey nor a stakeholder workshop done at
completion in the context of this ICR.



                                             21
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

84.      This ICR rates the risk to the sustainability of the development outcomes as
Substantial. This rating is largely due to the political situation of the country and the
fragility context, characterized by instability, frequent political changes, and a weak central
government, coupled with the persistent problems faced by EAGB (e.g., difficult financial
and commercial situation) that make it difficult to implement any major reform or
investment program, attract private sector participation in the sector, or even attract support
from development partners. Nonetheless, it is expected that the two IDA sector projects
under implementation will continue supporting the objectives of the MIRP and improve
the financial and commercial situation of EAGB.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

85.     The Bank’s performance during the Project preparation is rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory. The Bank did a thorough analysis of the energy, water, and road sectors to
be supported by the Project. As a result, the Project design focused on responding to real
and urgent needs faced by the country at the time of Project appraisal. The Project was also
in line with the country’s and the Bank’s development priorities and integrated lessons
learned from previous Projects in the region. However, the Project design was overly
ambitious vis-a-vis the available funds and in terms of expected outcomes.  
 
86.     Implementation arrangements were well designed and allowed to implement all
Project activities despite the political situation. The M&E framework and the financial and
economic analysis showed shortcomings. Social and environmental mitigation measures
were adequately incorporated into Project design. 
 
87.     Risks were identified, but some risks were underestimated. For instance, the risk
regarding the willingness of the private sector to invest in a small fragile state was
underrated. Also, the risk mitigation measures related to the financial and technical
weakness of the utility identified at appraisal were insufficient.  


(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.    The Bank team closely supervised Project implementation, including fiduciary and
safeguards issues. The Bank team adopted an adaptive and flexible approach that ensured
the continued relevance of Project activities in a rapidly changing environment through
consecutive restructurings. For example, the lease of 2.5 MW of capacity and purchase of

                                              22
3 MW of additional capacity not initially included in initial Project design was instrumental
in overcoming blackouts and ensuring continued electricity services in Bissau.

89.     The Bank provided hands on support that helped implementation of Project
activities to continue during various political crises and a period of suspension of
disbursement. The Bank undertook regular missions to supervise the energy sector
technical aspects and was proactive in supporting and providing advice to the Government
in addressing key challenges and emergency situations. The continuity of the Bank team
over the Project preparation and implementation period helped to customize
implementation support to the specific circumstances in the country. The Project had three
task managers over a period of preparation and implementation stretching over a decade.
In both transitions of task managers, the new task manager was a team member already.

90.    Supervision of the water and the roads sector was sometimes uneven, as noted in
various ISRs. Fiduciary supervision was carried out regularly and no major fiduciary
problems occurred. Environmental and social issues were adequately monitored and the
Bank team provided support to strengthen the PCU´s safeguards capacity.  

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

91.     Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating
combines the Bank performance rating in ensuring quality at entry (MU) and the Bank
performance rating for quality of supervision (MS). The overall rating takes into account
the deficiencies in Project design as well as the importance of adaptable supervision of a
project in post-conflict states. It should be noted that any project, whatever the quality at
entry, would have faced obstacles given the coup d’état and the breakdown of the electricity
system in Guinea-Bissau during Project implementation. The team was able to deal with
issues as they arose, and took proactive actions accordingly (restructuring, support on
M&E, etc.).  

5.2 Borrower Performance
 (a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

92.     Performance of the GoGB vis-a-vis the Project is rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory. In addition to the difficult political issues faced by the country that resulted
in the assassination of the President in 2009 and a military coup in 2012 delaying Project
implementation, the Government did not fulfill expectations regarding to the use HFO for
the ABC generators installed in 2012 to lower cost of production.

93.     Even though the focus of the Project was on supporting the restoration and
rehabilitation of critical infrastructure in the energy and water sectors in the city of Bissau
and not on the utility´s financial and commercial recovery, adjusting water and electricity
tariffs and other sector reform measures would have helped improve the financial and
technical situation of the utility. The GoGB understands the problems faced by the
electricity and water sectors and the need to implement significant reforms. However, the

                                              23
political situation in the country has been an obstacle to implement such reforms. The
transitional Government established after the military coup of 2012 did not have the
necessary political power to implement the measures needed. The Bank will continue its
work in the sector under the ongoing projects, and will work with the new Government,
established in July 2014, on sector reform, which remains challenging.

94.     The limited performance of the power utility, EAGB, also had a negative impact
on Project implementation and the achievement of the project development objectives.
Despite some improvements, EAGB is still in a dire financial situation as evidenced by the
fuel crisis and the lack of maintenance of the distribution network. The commercial
situation is improving with the installation of the pre-paid meters, and this is expected to
be reflected in an improvement on the financial situation overtime.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

95.     The PCU performance was satisfactory as evidenced by the mostly Satisfactory and
MS ratings on ISRs throughout Project implementation. Project activities were completed
despite some delays mostly due to the 2012 military coup that hindered completion of some
activities. Procurement, financial management, and safeguard issues were adequately
handled by the PCU. Despite the lack of capacity of the beneficiary institutions (i.e., EAGB
and the relevant departments at the sector ministry) as well as multiple changes in
management in those institutions that could have resulted in significant delays, the PCU
took the leadership on the implementation of the various components and activities and
maintained a proactive role throughout Project implementation ensuring that activities
could be successfully completed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.     The overall rating for Borrower Performance is Moderately Satisfactory. The
Moderately Satisfactory rating recognizes the vast amount of work done by the PCU in a
difficult political context that allowed the completion of all Project activities despite the
limitation in the performance of the Government and the utility.

6. Lessons Learned

97.     Adaptability and flexibility during project implementation. Designing multi-
sectoral projects can be appropriate in small fragile countries where the needs are often
numerous and the number of projects limited. In these situations a flexible approach should
be adopted and the implementation should be especially aggressive in exploiting every
available opportunity to revise, restructure, and retain only the sub-components with the
highest potential. This was the case of the MIRP where a flexible approach was adopted
and allowed the Project to better serve the needs of the country and respond to an
emergency situation (i.e., lack of power at the end of 2007, extensions of closing date to
account for a political situation, etc.). The flexibility in Project implementation allowed to

                                             24
country to maintain a modicum of power supply in critical moments averting an even
bigger crisis.

98.     Project development objectives and outcomes need to be defined realistically in
capacity constrained and fragile countries. Fragile environments are characterized by risks
that are hard to mitigate. In order to allow for the unforeseen, project teams should allow
for long implementation periods. Given uncertainties in fragile countries, PDO level
indicators should be closely related to project activities to avoid a disconnect between the
completion of activities and the achievement of the PDO level indicators. In the case of the
MIRP, all the anticipated activities were implemented, but not all PDO indicators were
achieved. This is partly due to the fact that some of the activities were only implemented
at the end of the Project period and therefore were not yet reflected in the final indicator
values. However, some PDO indicators were too broadly defined and had very ambitious
targets that did not reflect the activities financed by the Project.

99.     Strong Implementation Unit. Another lesson from the MIRP for projects where the
existing institutions are fragile and unstable is the importance of building a strong PCU. A
key reason for the achievements of this Project was the capacity and quality of the PCU.
Over time, strong PCU capacity needs to be transferred to and local institutional capacity
built.

100. Multi-sectoral projects require engaged multi-sectoral supervision teams. Multi-
sectoral projects, especially of a small size, are challenging and expensive to supervise. In
the case of MIRP, it was mapped to the energy unit and as such, the unit took leadership in
its supervision. This led to an imbalance in supervision, with water and transport specialists
less actively involved in Project supervision. This was a missed opportunity to provide
much needed advice and support to the country in those areas and improve implementation
(especially in the transport sector before the restructuring). Internal Bank incentives for
cross-sectoral collaboration have since evolved.

101. The willingness of private sector to invest in fragile states is limited and should be
realistically assessed in project design. The Project was initially designed to have
participation of the private sector in the energy and water sectors. However, during
implementation it was clear that the willingness of the private sector to get involved in a
volatile political environment was overestimated. While private sector investments are
needed in fragile states, a realistic analysis of the willingness of the private sector to get
involved in such a context should be conducted.

102. M&E design should be simple in a weak institutional setting. In the case of MIRP,
the M&E design changed, including with the introduction of core sector indicators. The
lack of reliable data limited the ability to measure the degree to which specific components
achieved the desired goals. In hindsight, seeing the difficulties in gathering reliable data
since the beginning of project implementation, it would have been desirable for the Bank
team to proactively address this issue early on during project implementation. Furthermore,
the MIRP indicators relied on activities to be achieved by the PRSDO, EEWRD, and the
BOAD operations, which though they were interrelated proved difficult to monitor.

                           Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.     Component 1: Institutional Development and Sector Studies (Original Project
US$2.50 million, Final Cost US$2.53 million) This component supported institutional and
capacity development and sector studies for the Ministry of Economy, State Secretariat for
Energy, Ministry of Natural Resources, EAGB and Ministry of Public Works, to achieve
the development of the energy, water and road sectors and the improvement of the technical
and financial management of the respective sectors’ assets. This component included:

2.      Sub-Component 1.1: Power Sector (Original Project US$1.51 million;
Restructured Project US$ 1.65 million). This sub-component included the following
activities:

(i)     Preparation and implementation of a comprehensive re-organization plan for
        EAGB, including a productivity enhancement program, capacity development,
        training, and technical assistance for the improvement of its power operations. A
        first study to assist the GoGB to identify the best option for reform of EAGB was
        financed under the Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project
        (PSRDP), but was not completed (Guinea-Bissau was under suspension at the
        time); an individual consultant was recruited under the MIRP for finalizing the
        study and recommending options for institutional reform of the water and electricity
        sectors and for restructuring EAGB.

        Based on the conclusions of a workshop held in December 2009, the Government
        adopted the recommendations of the workshop and updated the sectoral policy by
        2010. It was decided to finance under the restructured MIRP human resources study
        and evaluation of the operational assets for EAGB (US$100,000). This study was
        completed.

        It was also agreed to finance under the EEWRP operation the following activities:
        i) update legislation and related decrees water and electricity (US$350,000); ii)
        EAGB restructuring preparation activities; and iii) technical assistance to ensure
        operational management of EAGB during the transition period of two years and
        prepare its restructuring.

(ii)    Technical assistance to EAGB for the elaboration of an efficient and transparent
        electricity tariff structure and indexation formula (US$100,000). The final report
        was submitted to the Government in 2014 after extensive consultation with all
        stakeholders and is awaiting Governmental approval.

(iii)   Elaboration of a comprehensive assessment of the potential to sustainably produce
        modern energy (power and other fuels) from the country’s existing and potential
        agro-industrial and forestry base (agricultural/agro-industrial and forestry residues
        and bi-products, energy crops, woody biomass, etc.); and preparation of a “Medium
        to Long Term National Energy Development Strategy,” specifically including
        least-cost and renewable energy options capable of supporting the establishment of

                                             28
       a sustainable national energy platform, and the elaboration of a “National Energy
       Sector Investment and Resource Mobilization Plan” (US$930,000). The Medium
       to Long Term National Energy Development Strategy was finalized in 2014 and
       various workshops were held to discuss it with the different stakeholders. This
       activity also included training of two EAGB staff on NEPLAN and ArcGis
       programs.

(iv)   Engineering studies and preparation of Bidding Documents for the Generation
       contract, the Network Rehabilitation and expansion including the procurement of
       necessary tools and equipment, and Metering and Billing System. A new technical
       assistance to complete the engineering studies and preparation of Bidding
       Document for the new investments to be financed under the EEWRP was financed
       under the MIRP (US$170,000).

(v)    Procurement of a Financial and Accounting Management System for EAGB,
       including the necessary training for the utilization of such system and Technical
       Assistance. These activities were implemented through the technical assistance
       contract to manage EAGB’s commercial and financial departments. The budgeted
       amount for this task was reallocated to component 2.2 under the restructured MIRP.

(vi)   Institutional development and strengthening support for the Ministry of the
       Economy, for the Secretariat of Energy and, when established, for the Multisector
       Regulatory Agency. Support in the form of purchasing vehicles, computers, office
       equipment, and training was provided to the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry
       of Energy, the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Ministry of Economy. An
       estimated budget of US$75,000 was allocated to support each of these ministries,
       and additional funding of US$50,000 was allocated to the Department of Energy.
       The total budget was US$275,000. This activity was managed under the component
       5 of the restructured MIRP. The Multisector Regulatory Agency has not been
       established yet, even though the Government has already approved it and is
       expected to be put in place in the next six months.

3.      Sub-component 1.2: Water Sector (US$0.64 million). This sub-component included
support for the preparation and implementation of the sector reform, ensure the
establishment successful public-private partnership (PPP) to improve EAGB’s commercial
and financial management performance, and help implement provisions of the LSDP
(regulatory framework, tariff policy, management of public standpipes, etc.) through
technical assistance, consulting services and public communication. In addition to the study
completed under component 1.1.1, the Project financed:

(i)    Engineering studies, preparation of Bidding Documents and supervision of works
       for the 700 m3 reservoir, the water network rehabilitation and expansion including
       the procurement of necessary tools and equipment, and metering. Due to the delay
       in the commissioning of the reservoir, a new supervision contract had to be
       procured to supervise the completion of the reservoir (Estimated value:
       US$150,000); this activity was financed under the restructured MIRP.


                                            29
(ii)    Diagnostic study of water production systems (US$50,000). Problems with the
        selected consultant led to the cancellation of the contract. The PCU is still waiting
        for reimbursement of the advance by the Bank that provided the commercial
        guarantee. This study was not undertaken.

(iii)   Establishment of a new management system for public standpipes. The Project
        supported the establishment of the system and provide communities with
        sensitization training on challenges involved in this new mode of community
        management of public standpipes. The study has been completed and 58
        management committees have been created for the 58 standpipes funded and
        commissioned by the Project.

(iv)    Technical assistance to EAGB Commercial and Financial management including
        software, TA & training for EAGB Financial and Accounting Operations: Increase
        the efficiency of EAGB and public entities involved in the water sector by
        strengthening their capacities in management and planning, through technical
        assistance, training and equipment supplies.

        These activities were realized through the technical assistance contract to EAGB
        for its commercial and financial management. Also, the budgeted amount was
        reallocated to the component 2.2 under the restructured MIRP.

4.      Sub-component 1.3: Roads Sector (Original Project US$0.35 million; Restructured
Project US$0.50 million). This sub-component financed the institutional and capacity
development needs of the Ministry of Public Works to enable it to effectively manage its
resources and efficiently run its road and water sanitation rehabilitation, construction and
maintenance works, and to enable it to effectively discharge its sector planning, policy
making and regulatory responsibilities, especially with regard to the coordination and
harmonization with the other Ministries (for example the Ministry of Transport and
Communications). This sub-component was meant to support the reforms undertaken in
the road sector (sector strategy, road fund) to improve the sector institutional and regulatory
framework.

5.      One of the specific objectives of the transport component was to provide technical
support to institutions of the Ministry responsible for infrastructure and road transport and
for the development of a strategic framework This strategic focus has been made even more
necessary by the redevelopment intervened in the government structure and now between
the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry responsible for infrastructure. The two
ministries received technical assistance to: (i) finalize the Transport Sector Strategy and
development of a Letter of Transport Sector Policy; the transport sector strategy has to be
inclusive with regard to infrastructure development and transport services; it also has to be
carried out on an internodal based approach (US$50,000); (ii) develop a Road Sector
Investment Plan that takes into account the medium and long term investment needs,
including the road network maintenance requirements. During the MTR mission, it was
agreed to cancel the road investment component (Component 4) and therefore to postpone
the development of a road sector investment plan; (iii) mobilize and coordinate donor
investment support for the roads sector and participate in the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport

                                              30
Program (SSATP) (US$50,000); iv) establish of a revised road code (US$50,000); v)
strengthen institutional capacities (US$160,000); (vi) undertake training in the fields of
management and financing of road maintenance, management of projects, administration
of land transport, road safety and procurement. (US$50,000); and (vii) provide equipment
and logistical supplies, vehicles, computer equipment and software, office furniture
(US$90,000).

6.     Component 2: Restoration and Rehabilitation of the Power System. (Original
Project US$2.35 million, Final Cost US$5.64 million). This component supported a fast-
tracked restoration and rehabilitation of power generation and distribution, and commercial
operations in Bissau. This objective was achieved through three cross-supporting actions,
with some of the sub-component being financed by the MIRP, by the closed IDA Private
Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project (IDA-PSRDP), by BOAD, and by the
EEWRP.

7.      Sub-component 2.1: Restoration of power generation (Approved Project US$2.10
million; Restructured Project US$3.24 million). This sub-component included the
following activities:

(i)         Leasing contract: Mobilization and demobilization costs: the original Project
            envisaged that 15 MW of thermal power generation capacity would be leased by
            EAGB for a period of three to five years via the competitive contracting of a private
            operator (denominated as Private Operation Scheme - POS.). It was also envisaged
            that the Project would finance transportation and small works for site preparation
            for the mobilization and de-mobilization costs, up to a ceiling of US$1.1 million,
            of the POS. Such a POS was not possible, therefore the restructuring of 2010
            included support for the purchase of additional generation capacity (see (iii) below).

(ii)        Environmental management plan for the current generation site: this activity aimed
            at implementing the recommendations of the consultant's report on environmental
            auditing and environmental and social assessment for new generation investment
            and rehabilitation of the main production of electricity in Bissau. The
            implementation of the mitigation plan, control, and organization was estimated at
            about US$390,000. This activity was not implemented due to delays by the
            contractor of the new generation plan that delayed the procurement of the contractor
            for the clean-up works.



                                                 31
(iii)   Generation, emergency investments: the situation in terms of generation capacity
        had considerably worsened in 2007 that resulted on the implementation of a number
        of emergency operations by the Project. Those activities were not included in the
        original Project, but were included in the restructured MIRP as follows:

        a. Purchase of emergency generation capacity (2 x 1.5 MW): co financed by the
           PSRDP (US$1,726,326) and the MIRP (US$600,000). To enable the
           performance of the contract and allow EAGB to operate the two generators
           under the best conditions, the MIRP also financed some additional works and
           supplies (approximately US$180,000). Both generators started operation in
           2008, but are now awaiting repairs and have not been operational since June
           2012. One of the generators is now with the supplier outside Guinea-Bissau and
           it has not been repaired due to discrepancies between the supplier and EAGB.
           The second generator is not working either, but is expected to be repaired by
           EAGB.

        b. Leasing of 2.5 MW of power capacity: Given the delays in the commissioning
           of the (2x1.5 MW) mentioned in (a.) above, and the urgency of providing some
           electricity to Bissau (no power at all at the end of 2007), a contract for leasing
           emergency generators (3 x 850 kW) was signed and generators were
           commissioned in January 2008 for the first two, and in February 2008 for the
           third. This lease contract was extended until June 2012 to facilitate the
           production of power by EAGB. In addition, the MIRP financed the purchase of
           spare parts and lubricants for the MTU and ABC generators.

                                                                     Estimated
                    Generation, emergency investments
                                                                        cost
                                                                    IDA-MIRP
                                                                    US$ million
             a. Purchase of emergency groups (2 x 1.5 MW)                0.6
             b. Provision of a power of 2.5 MW                          2.25
            Sub-total                                                   2.85

(iv)    Implementation of decentralized power generation - cogeneration from biomass:
        The purchase of cogeneration equipment initiated by LICAJU and SICAJU
        (Sociedade de Transformacao de Caju Lda and Sociedade Industrial de Caju) was
        completed. The equipment for these plants have been financed by the PSRDP.
        Additional financing by this activity was provided by the restructured Project and
        was completed.

8.      Sub-component 2.2: Rehabilitation & improvement of Commercial Management
System. (Approved Project US$0.25 million; Restructured Project US$1.47 million) The
strategy to improve commercial and financial performance of EAGB was based on the
implementation of two specific activities: (i) a technical assistance contract for
commercial, accounting and financial management of EAGB; and (ii) a supply and



                                             32
installation contract of prepayment meters and setting up a new commercial management
system. The MIRP financed the following activities:

(i)     Technical Assistance for the improvement/recovery of the commercial, accounting
        and financial management of EAGB. The Technical assistance contract was
        considered essential for the success of the strategy. After an international
        competitive bidding process, a three years TA contract was signed in February,
        2009 and became effective in May, 2009. Originally, the MIRP was financing only
        the first year of the contract (US$0.85 million), but due to the financial situation of
        EAGB a provision of US$500,000 to finance the second year of the contract was
        added in the restructured MIRP. This contract was suspended by the contractor in
        2009 due to the instability in the country that followed the assassination of the
        President at the time. A renegotiated agreement with the contractor was processed.

        To assist the Technical Assistant in the implementation of its activities, the Bank
        also financed various support contracts: (i) purchase of four pick-up vehicles (about
        US$90,000); (ii) purchase of seven motorcycles 50 cm3 (about US$5,000); (iii)
        hardware (about US$15,000); and (iv) fuel for above vehicles for a period of six
        months (approximately US$10,000).

(ii)    Supply and installation of prepayment meters (15,000 units) and associated
        commercial management systems: The rehabilitation of the electricity billing
        collection system by the establishment and operation of an electricity pre-payment
        meter system (15,000 units) was one of the main pillars of the strategy to improve
        commercial and financial performance of EAGB. Initially, this activity was
        supposed to be financed by the PSRDP and therefore not budgeted by the MIRP.
        This expenditure was financed through the EEWRP (US$2.5 million). A technical
        study as well as the procurement of the meters was carried-out by the MIRP.

(iii)   Sub-component 2.3: Rehabilitation & reinforcement of Urban Distribution
        Network (Approved Project US$0.00 million; Restructured Project US$0.17
        million). The rehabilitation of the distribution network was financed by BOAD and
        included: (i) the rehabilitation and extension of the existing urban distribution
        system, including replacement of transformers, and the upgrading of the
        distribution voltage to 10 kV for the existing leftover of 6 kV systems; (ii)
        establishment of necessary equipment pool for the operation and maintenance of
        the urban distribution network; and (iii) training of EAGB staff on the operation,
        maintenance, and management of the power distribute on network. A small contract
        for purchase and installation of power cells (at the Bissau power plant) was included
        in the Project restructuring and financed by the MIRP (US$170,000).

9.     Three intermediate indicators measured achievement of the component activities as
follows:
     Increase electricity generation capacity owned by EAGB from 3 MW to 5.5 MW1
       through the Project. This indicator was achieved as MIRP financed the purchase
       of 3 MW (2 X 1.5 MW) of new generation.
     Number of prepayment meters installed (15,000). By Project completion 15,137
       prepayment meters have been installed. However, it should be noted that the
       purchase of the pre-paid meters was financed by EEWRP.
     Reduce total energy losses from 50 percent to 35 percent. This indicator was not
       achieved. At Project closing, energy losses were estimated at 47 percent.

10.    Component 3: Rehabilitation of Water Production, Treatment and Urban
Distribution. (Original Project US$4.85 million, Final Cost US$4.13 million). This
component included the following sub-components.

11.    Sub-component 3.1: Water production (Original Project US0.86 million;
Restructured Project US$0.14 million) This sub-component was financed by IDA and
included:

(i)         Rehabilitation and reinforcement of water production systems in the city of Bissau.
            To improve water storage capacity and the distribution network equilibrium, the
            Project included the construction of a new reservoir (700 m3) within the existing
            premises of EAGB in the “August 3 Hospital”. A first contract was signed in 2008,
            but due to many deficiencies of the company, it was decided to terminate the
            contract. The termination process was completed and a new consultation was
            completed. A new estimate of the cost of the reservoir was conducted by the
            consulting engineer that estimated the cost at US$1.23 million. This was financed
            under the proposed EEWRP, as it exceeded the funds available through the MIRP.

            An environmental impact study was financed under the restructured MIRP (US$
            100,000).

    This is minimum capacity to be made available through MIRP.

                                                   34
(ii)    Replacement of the old pumping system at the “August 3 Hospital” to increase the
        volume of water produced and satisfy the medium term water demand
        (US$33,000).

12.    Sub-component 3.2: Water Distribution and Sub-component 3.3: Billing system &
operational tools (Original Project US$3.99 million; Restructured Project US$4.60
million). These two sub-components included:

(i)     Replacement of: (a) 3.6 km of primary water distribution networks along existing
        roads (November 14 Avenue and Pansauna Isna Avenue); and (b) 9 km of tertiary
        water distribution networks in the neighborhood of Ajuda. On completion of these
        works, water losses were expected to be reduced from 70 percent to 50 percent.

(ii)    Extension of 26.3 km of tertiary water distribution networks to unserved areas and
        the construction of 700 water connections and 50 new public standpipes in peri-
        urban areas of Bissau (particularly in neighborhoods of Luanda and Bandim).
        Private connections called “social connections” were subsidized by the Project with
        beneficiaries making only a small contribution. Public standpipes 100 percent
        financed by the Project will be operated by private entrepreneurs on a fee-for
        service basis.

(iii)   Supply and installation 6,000 water meters. All water connections were to be
        equipped with meters so that users could be billed for their actual consumption,
        rather than on a lump sum basis as it is the case currently

(iv)    Equipment and logistical supplies to EAGB: water analysis kits, fire standpipes,
        operation tools and vehicles, to improve operational performance of the water
        utility.

13.   All activities under this sub-component were successfully implemented by the
MIRP.

14.   The intermediate outcome indicators to measure progress in implementing this
component were:
     Improved community water points constructed or rehabilitated under the Project
      (number): the target was 58 and it was achieved by the MIRP.
     Extend water distribution networks to unserved areas under the Project. The target
      was 43.7 kms and it was achieved.  

15.    Component 4: Limited Rehabilitation of Urban Road Infrastructure. (Original
Project US$3.20 million, Final Cost US$0.33 million) Within the Project’s IDA resource
constraint, this component financed the following activities:

(i)    Preparation of road rehabilitation investment program through feasibility studies to
       determine the type of works needed, as well as the eligibility criteria and timing for
       reconstruction of urban roads in the Recipient’s territory;

(ii)   Implementation of a limited road rehabilitation program, including civil works,
       acquisition of equipment and provision of consultant services to rehabilitate the
       primary and secondary road network in the city of Bissau. It was confirmed during
       the Mid Term Review Mission the cancelation of this road rehabilitation component
       and an agreement was concluded between the Government and the Mission to
       reallocate the resources originally destined for the road investments to the energy
       component.

Ex post Economic Analysis of Generation Investments

At the time of Project preparation, EAGB’s operational and financial performance was
very weak. The Project failed to bring about sufficient improvement in EAGB’s
performance to restore the company’s financial viability. Still, EAGB provides an essential
service, as evidenced by the existence of private micro-generators in Bissau. The prices
practiced by private micro-generators vary significantly, ranging from 500 to 1,000 CFAR
per kWh (~USc 100 to 200), equivalent to two to four times EAGB’s tariffs. For the
purpose of the ICR, an ex post economic analysis has been carried out to assess the
economic impact of the project based on a more realistic estimate of the value of the service
provided.

The ex post analysis assumes a willingness to pay (WTP) at the lower bound of the range
of observed prices for micro-generation in Bissau (USc 100 per kWh) and applies a
discount of 20 percent to this value in order to reflect the fact that due to the relatively high
level of non-payment, the electricity supplied by EAGB is presumably used less efficiently
than for private micro-generators. Regarding the cost of supply by EAGB, the modelling
assumptions are estimates, based largely on the technical and financial reporting from
EAGB for 2013 and 2014. The assumptions are meant to reflect the observed inefficiencies
and high cost per unit of EAGB, erring on the pessimistic side.

On this basis, the analysis indicates that the levelized cost of electricity delivered to
EAGB’s customer’s through incremental investment in thermal generation would be
US$0.69 per kWh with a 10 percent discount rate (and 0.71 with a 15 percent discount
rate). This assumes that new generation equipment are used for five years (with the
assumption that inadequately maintained generation equipment will have in reality a useful
technical life well short of the norm which would be 15 years). When compared to the
discounted benefits derived from the estimated WTP (US$0.80 per kWh), the discounted
Project costs results in an EIRR of incremental generation investments of 32.9 percent.

The ex post economic analysis suggests that there is a good economic case for supporting
EAGB in the provision of essential services, as long as the fact that expanding supply will
require additional financial transfer to support the utility. It is also clear that there is a
significant scope for reducing EAGB’s supply costs (reducing specific consumption,

                                                38

etc.).

   I.     DESCRIÇÃO DO               PROJECTO         E    EVOLUÇÃO          DA     SUA
          IMPLEMENTAÇÃO

   1. INTRODUÇÃO

O Projecto Multissectorial de Reabilitação das Infra-estruturas (PMRI) é composto por
cinco componentes principais, isto é: (i) Desenvolvimento Institucional e Estudos
Sectoriais, (ii) Restauração e Reabilitação do Sistema de Eléctrico, (iii) Reabilitação da
Produção, Tratamento e Distribuição de Água Urbana; (iv) Reabilitação Limitada de Infra-
estruturas Rodoviárias urbanas, e (v) Gestão, Monitorização e Avaliação do Projecto.
O Acordo de don IDA H2350 foi assinado em 2007 e entrou em vigor apenas em 2007
devido as suspensão imposta ao país nessa data.
O baixo nível de desembolso associado ao risco de não serem atingidas as
metas/(performances) programadas para os sectores de agua e electricidade influenciou a
decisão de reestruturação a quando da revisão a meio percurso realizado em 2019 que, para
alem da reestruturação propriamente dita do projecto foi identifica a insuficiência de
fundos para se poder atingir os objectivos.
Assim, o banco optou em vez de reforçar os fundos do PMRI, pela criação de um novo
projecto(PURSEE) com as mesmas componentes e os mesmos objectivos.

Os investimentos e actividades levadas a cabo em simultâneo pelos dois projectos
possibilitara a rápida melhoria no desempenho dos sectores de água e electricidade e
provocaram o alívio das pessoas que foram afectadas negativamente pela crise económica
global. Assim, o PMRI foi complementado pelo PURSEA, através das seguintes quatro
componentes que se sobrepõem parcialmente com as componentes do PMRI: (i)
Desenvolvimento Institucional e Melhoria do Desempenho Sectorial, (ii) Restauração e
Reabilitação do Sistema de Electricidade, (iii) Reabilitação de Produção/Armazenamento
de Água, e (iv) Gestão, Monitorização e Avaliação do Projecto.


                                           42
Em baixo vem descrita com detalhes a evolução da execução do PMRI, as sua componentes
e as       suas interligações com o PURSEA. As acções de desenvolvimento
institucional/planos e o programa de investimento que foram desenvolvidos em paralelo.

Componente 1: Desenvolvimento Institucional e Estudos Sectoriais

Esta componente tem como objecto o apoio ao desenvolvimento institucional, reforço de
capacidade e estudos sectoriais para o Ministério da Economia, Secretaria de Estado da
Energia, Ministério dos Recursos Naturais, EAGB e Ministério das Obras Públicas,
concretamente no desenvolvimento dos sectores de energia, água e estradas e a melhoria
da gestão técnica e financeira dos bens activos do respectivo sector.

Sub componente 1.1: Sub-componente energia

    (vii) Elaboração e implementação de um plano de reorganização global da EAGB,
        incluindo um programa de aumento da produtividade, desenvolvimento de
        capacidades, formação e assistência técnica para a melhoria das suas operações.
Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: Um primeiro estudo para apoiar o Governo da
Guiné-Bissau a identificar a melhor opção para a reforma da EAGB foi iniciado e
financiado no âmbito do Projecto de Reabilitação e Desenvolvimento do Sector Privado
(PRDSP). Contudo , o referido estudo não foi concluído (a Guiné-Bissau encontrava-se em
regime de suspensão). Posteriormente um consultor individual foi recrutado, sob
financiamento do PMRI, para finalizar o estudo e formular recomendações sobre as opções
para a reforma institucional do sector da água e electricidade e para a reestruturação da
EAGB. O relatório do consultor foi discutido num workshop com as autoridades ,
sindicatos e a sociedade civil , em Dezembro de 2009 na cidade de Bissau. O Governo
exprimiu o seu empenho relativamente a reforma proposta através de (i) adopção das
conclusões do referido workshop, e (ii) através da actualização da sua carta de política do
sector, concluída e aprovada em Março de 2010.
 Com base nas conclusões do workshop, decidiu-se pelo financiamento, no âmbito do
PMRI reestruturado e no quadro da operação PURSEA, as seguintes actividades:
            a. A actualização da legislação e dos decretos relacionados (US$ 350.000)-
               transferido para o PURSEA.
            b. Preparação da reestruturação da EAGB (US$ 350.000), actividade essa que
               está a ser financiada pelo PURSEA;
            c. Estudo sobre os recursos humanos e avaliação de bens activos operacionais;
            d. Avaliação das opções de PPP, incluindo riscos e respectivas medidas de
               mitigação (estava a ser executada através da CFI, mas neste momento esta
               actividade está suspensa );
            e. Consulta das partes interessadas e campanha de comunicação estratégica-
               Transferido para o PURSEA

  (viii) Assistência técnica a EAGB para a elaboração de uma estrutura tarifária
      eficiente e transparente e fórmula de indexação;
   Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: Esta actividade foi concluída em 2014.
     No dia 17 de Dezembro de 2013, fez-se um ateliê de validação do documento do

                                            43
      estudo, com a participação de quase todas as instituições ligadas ao sector. Após a
      recolha de sugestões e comentários, o Consultor produziu o relatório final do
      documento a ser submetido ao Governo para que uma decisão seja tomada
      relativamente à alteração da grelha tarifária de água e electricidade em Bissau.
      Convém salientar que 3 técnicos da DGE/EAGB receberam uma formação na
      Tunísia sobre a projecção financeira e cálculo de tarifas de água e electricidade,
      tendo os mesmos efectuados simulações com dados da EAGB. O estudo foi
      concluído e a proposta de reestruturação da grelha tarifaria para agua e
      electricidade aguarda a aprovação e adopção do Governo.

   (ix) Elaboração de uma avaliação abrangente do potencial para produzir de forma
        sustentável energia moderna (electricidade, e outras formas de energia ) a partir da
        base existente e potencial do país nos domínios agro-industrial e florestal
        (agrícola/agro-industrial, resíduos e subprodutos florestais, culturas energéticas,
        biomassa lenhosa, etc.); preparação de uma "Estratégia Nacional de
        Desenvolvimento de Energia de médio a longo prazo", incluindo especificamente
        opções de menor custo e de energias renovável capazes de apoiar a criação de uma
        plataforma nacional de energia sustentável, e a elaboração de um "Plano Nacional
        de Investimento no Sector da Energia e Mobilização de Recursos";

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: O Estudo para Elaboração do Plano Director para
Energia foi concluído em 2014. Várias sessões (reuniões) de trabalho foram feitas a fim de
se discutir e validar os diferentes documentos do estudo. Foram produzidos os seguintes
relatórios:
     Relatório de Síntese Documento estratégico;
     Parte 1 Estudos Técnicos;
     Parte 2 Projecção Financeira;
     Relatório Potencial Energético;
     Relatório Definitivo de previsão das Necessidades Energéticas;
     Plano de Desenvolvimento para as Energias Domésticas e Alternativas;
     Relatório Definitivo de Base de Dados;
     Relatório Definitivo do Potencial Energético – Anexos;
     Anexo 1 “Ensoleillement” na Guiné-Bissau;
     Anexo 2 – Estudo dos Ventos na Guiné-Bissau;
     Anexo 3 Estudo sobre o Consumo em Energia e Água na Guiné-Bissau.

Houve formações dos técnicos da EAGB e da Secretaria de Estado da Energia no domínio
dos programas NEPLAN e ArcGis, que foram previstas no âmbito do estudo.

   (x) Estudos de engenharia e preparação dos cadernos de encargos para o contrato de
       Produção, a Reabilitação da Rede e a ampliação, incluindo a adjudicação das
       ferramentas e equipamentos necessários, e o Sistema de Medição e Facturação;

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: Esta actividade foi concluída parcialmente em
2006 e foi financiada no âmbito do crédito PRDSP.


                                            44
 Posteriormente, devido as novas actividades identificadas como necessárias, as mesmas
foram retomadas e concluídas com os fundos do PMRI, financiada ao abrigo da
Componente 5 do PMRI para uma nova assistência técnica a UCP com o propósito de
realizar estudos de engenharia e preparar os Cadernos de Encargos para os novos
investimentos programados no âmbito do PURSEA.

   (xi) Implementação dum Sistema de Gestão Financeira e Contabilidade para a EAGB
        incluindo a formação necessária para a utilização desse sistema e Assistência
        Técnica.

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: Essas actividades foram realizadas através do
contrato de assistência técnica para gestão comercial e financeira da EAGB. O valor
orçado para essa tarefa foi atribuído a componente 2.2 no quadro do PMRI reestruturado.
No cumprimento do contrato assinado com a empresa SENELEC, para a Assistência
Técnica à Gestão Comercial e Financeira da EAGB (ATGC-EAGB), foram realizadas as
seguintes actividades:

       a) Produção do relatório sobre o diagnóstico na central eléctrica de Bissau.
       b) Instalação de um sistema informático com vista a “Securização da caixa” no
          sistema de cobrança da EAGB: É uma actividade proposta pela SENELEC, no
          sentido de permitir a EAGB de organizar a sua gestão e garantir a arrecadação
          das receitas no período que antecede a implementação de um novo sistema de
          gestão clientela e de contadores pré-pagos. Inicialmente com algumas
          deficiências, o sistema instalado está a ser melhorado gradualmente.
       c) Recenseamento parcial dos clientes da EAGB. Esta prestação foi interrompida
          e só depois concluída através de uma adenda igualmente financiada pelo PMRI.
       d) Elaboração do Caderno de Encargo (DAO) para a aquisição de contadores pré-
          pagos: O referido DAO foi elaborado com o apoio do PMRI.
   (xii) Desenvolvimento Institucional e apoio para o fortalecimento do Ministério da
       Economia, Secretaria de Estado da Energia; criação de uma Agência Reguladora
       Multisectorial. Foi Proposto um orçamento estimado em US$ 75.000 apoiar cada
       um destes ministérios, e um financiamento adicional de US$ 50.000 foi atribuído a
       Secretaria de Estado da Energia. A estimativa/orçamento total foi de US$ 275.000,
       e ao Ministério das Obras Públicas foi atribuído um orçamento separado ( de
       USD500.000) no quadro da componente 1.3.

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: O apoio na forma de aquisição de veículos,
computadores, equipamentos de escritório e formação foi concedido ao Ministério das
Obras Públicas, Secretariado de Estado da Energia, Ministério de Recursos Naturais e
Ministério da Economia, e posteriormente foi gerida no âmbito da componente 5 do PMRI
reestruturado. Não foi possível até a presente data a criação de uma Agência de Regulação
apesar de no âmbito dos compromissos assumidos com a UMOA, o Governo ter aprovado
a legislação e os Estatutos do referido órgão.




                                           45
Sub componente 1.2: Sub-compnente Água

Apoiar o Governo na elaboração e implementação da reforma do sector, assegurar o êxito
do estabelecimento da parceria público-privado (PPP) para melhorar o desempenho da
EAGB nas áreas da gestão comercial e financeira, e ajudar a aplicar as disposições do
LSDP (quadro regulamentar, política tarifária, gestão de fontanários públicos, etc.) através
de assistência técnica, serviços de consultoria e comunicação pública. Além do estudo
realizado ao abrigo da Componente 1.1.1, o Projecto financiou:

   (v) Estudos de engenharia, preparação de Cadernos de Encargos e fiscalização de obras
       de construção do reservatório de 700 m3, reabilitação e extensão das redes água,
       incluindo a aquisição equipamentos e utensílios de trabalho.

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas :esta actividade foi concluída parcialmente no
âmbito do PMRI. Devido ao atraso que se verificou na construção do reservatório, um novo
contrato de supervisão foi celebrado para a conclusão do reservatório e que foi igualmente
financiado pelo PMRI reestruturado.
    (vi) Estudo/diagnóstico sobre sistemas de produção de água

Actividades levadas : O contrato com a HYDROPLAN foi assinado em …. O referido
gabinete fez a sua primeira deslocação a Bissau em Abril de 2011. Mas logo na reunião d
o inicio dos trabalhos, o representante do gabinete afirmou não poder fazer os ensaios
porque não estava previsto no contrato e na proposta por eles formuladas. Afirmação essa
que foi logo contestadas visto que se tratava de ma interpretação dos TDR’s/contrato por
parte do consultor. Facto esse que conduziu, posteriormente à rescisão do contrato. Uma
carta datada de 27 de Junho de 2011, foi endereçada ao Banco emissora de garantia de
avanço dos trabalhos, a fim de solicitar a devolução do montante pago no avanço. Até a
presente data, não foi restituída esse montante avançado por parte deste Banco comercial.
Outras acções necessárias: É necessário relançar outra vez este estudo/diagnostico
importante para se conhecer as condições de exploração dos furos de água na cidade de
Bissau.
    (vii) Criação de um novo sistema de gestão de fontenários públicos: O Projecto
        apoiará a criação do sistema e proverá as comunidades com formação de
        sensibilização sobre os desafios envolvidos nesta nova modalidade de gestão
        comunitária dos fontenários públicos.

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: O estudo foi concluído e 58 comités de gestão
foram criados para os 58 fontenários financiados pelo Projecto.
    (viii) Assistência técnica para a gestão comercial e financeira da EAGB; Software,
        AT e formação para as Operações Financeiras e Contabilísticas da EAGB:
        Aumentar a eficiência da EAGB e das entidades públicas envolvidas no sector da
        água, através do reforço das suas capacidades de gestão e planeamento, através de
        assistência técnica, formação e fornecimento de equipamentos.

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: Esta actividade foi restruturada, passando para o
sub-componente da Assistência Técnica à Gestão da EAGB, atrás mencionada.

                                            46
Sub componente 1.3 Sub-componente Estradas

Esta sub-componente previa o financiar o desenvolvimento da capacidade institucional e
as necessidades do Ministério das Obras Públicas de modo a permitir-lhe gerir eficazmente
os seus recursos e executar as suas obras de reabilitação de estradas, água e saneamento,
além de permitir-lhe assumir com eficácia as suas responsabilidades de planeamento do
sector, tomada de decisões e regulação, especialmente no que diz respeito à coordenação e
harmonização com os outros Ministérios (Por exemplo, o Ministério dos Transportes e
Comunicações). Esta sub-componente destina-se ainda a apoiar as reformas realizadas no
sector rodoviário (estratégia sectorial, o fundo rodoviário) com vista a melhorar o quadro
institucional              e               regulamentar             do              sector.

Um dos objectivos específicos da componente transportes era o de fornecer apoio técnico
às instituições do Ministério responsável pelos transportes e infra-estruturas rodoviárias e
para o desenvolvimento de um quadro estratégico. Este foco estratégico tornou-se ainda
mais necessário pela alteração na estrutura do governo e agora entre o Ministério dos
Transportes e do Ministério responsável pelas infra-estruturas.

Os dois ministérios receberam assistência técnica para:

Finalizar a Estratégia do Sector dos Transportes e o desenvolvimento de uma Carta de
Política Sectorial dos Transportes; a estratégia para o sector dos transportes tem que ser
abrangente no que respeita ao desenvolvimento das infra-estruturas e serviços de
transportes. Não é de mais referir que o estudo tem como principais objectivos, por um
lado, procurar dar resposta aos constrangimentos que afectam o funcionamento da DGVTT,
tanto a nível da sua orientação estratégica como do seu funcionamento operacional
(compreendendo a realização de inspecções e fiscalizações, recolha de receitas para o
Tesouro), por outro lado, a intervenção visa actualizar o quadro legal do sector dos
transportes rodoviários, particularmente no contexto de regras de UEMOA (tráfego,
regulamentação do transporte automóvel, inspecções de veículos e outras normas exigidas).

Actividade concluída até a presente data: Ao todo, foram produzidos os seguintes
relatórios, em versão francesa e portuguesa:

   a)   Relatório de Instalação;
   b)   Relatório de Diagnóstico
   c)   Relatório Intermédio;
   d)   Regulamento de Sinalização de Trânsito
   e)   Regulamento das Inspecções e dos Centros de Inspecção;
   f)   Bases Gerais da Concessão para os Centros Privados de Inspecção;
   g)   Código da Estrada;
   h)   Regime Geral das Contra-Ordenações;
   i)   Regulamento Sobre o Ensino da Condução;
   j)   Manual de Procedimentos;
   k)   Regulamento de Matrículas;
   l)   Regulamento da segurança Rodoviária;

                                            47
   m) Regulamento dos Transportes em Automóvel;
   n) Plano Estratégico para a DGVTT
   o) Relatório Final

                          (i) Desenvolver um Plano de Investimento do Sector
                              Rodoviário, que leva em conta a médio e longo prazo as
                              necessidades de investimento sectoriais, incluindo os
                              requisitos de manutenção da rede rodoviária;

Durante a revisão meio percurso do projecto, em concordância com o Governo, foi
decidido o cancelamento da componente de investimento rodoviário (Componente 4) e,
portanto, o adiamento do desenvolvimento de um plano de investimento do sector
rodoviário.
                        (ii) Mobilizar e coordenar a assistência dos doadores para
                             investimento no sector rodoviário e participar na
                             iniciativa SSATP

Actividades concluída: com ajuda do Banco, o Governo da Guiné-Bissau aderiu
oficialmente ao Programa de Transportes da Africa Saariana (SSATP). Em princípio, o
PMRI deveria financiar a primeira contribuição anual de participação da Guiné-Bissau nas
reuniões anuais (US$ 50.000). Mas, felizmente o representante do Ministério dos
Transportes participou na sua primeira reunião anual, utilizando custos próprios da SSATP.
Assim, este montante foi reafectada.

                           (iii)AT-Sistema de Informação Portuária, com a finalidade de
                                apoiar a APGB na sua gestão portuária.
Actividades concluída: Este estudo foi concluída no segundo trimestre de 2012: O gabinete
TIS.pt encarregue da realização do estudo sobre a instalação de um sistema de informação
para o porto de Bissau, concluiu o estudo, e produziu o relatório final em duas versões,
francês e português, tal como foi solicitado. Esse relatório foi enviado às instituições
beneficiárias (Secretaria de Estado dos Transportes e Comunicações, APGB).

                          (iv) Revisão do código da estrada;

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: Esta actividade foi reagrupada no ponto acima e
foi concluída em 2014 (ver atrás).
                         (v) Reforçar as capacidades institucionais, no tocante à
                              assistência técnica para actividades específicas, a missão do
                              BM e o Governo concordaram em considerar os seguintes
                              campos e perfis de competências: (i) um perito em estradas
                              para apoiar o Director-geral de Estradas e Pontes nos
                              domínios de gestão de contratos, incluindo a criação de
                              instrumentos de acompanhamento de construção, (ii) um
                              especialista de renome internacional na área do transporte
                              terrestre para apoiar a Direcção-geral dos Transportes
                              Terrestres na sua reorganização, a concepção de novos

                                            48
                              bilhetes de transporte e o desenvolvimento de um
                              instrumento de recolha de estatísticas de acidentes de

                              marítimo para assistência à Direcção-geral da Marinha
                              Mercante.

Actividades concluídas: Devido o atraso verificado na implementação destas actividades,
a União Europeia e o BOAD disponibilizaram fundos para esse efeito. Assim, esta
subcomponente foi cancelada e o montante reafectado.
                         (vi) Formação dos quadros e técnicos: uma dotação específica foi
                              reservada para os custos de apoio a participação numa
                              formação contínua nas áreas de gestão e financiamento da
                              manutenção de estradas, gestão de projectos, administração
                              de transportes terrestres, segurança rodoviária e adjudicação
                              de contratos (US $ 50.000).

Actividade concluída: Tal como a actividade anterior, esta actividade foi financiada por
outros financiadores.
Formação para os Ministérios das Obras Públicas e dos Transportes (US$ 50.000).
Actividade concluída: Infelizmente esta actividade não foi realizada pelo pessoal do
Ministério das Obras Públicas, uma vez que nunca chegaram de responder as cartas
enviadas pela UC-PMRI, anunciando a programação do projecto disponibilidade dos
fundos.
                         (vii)        Fornecer equipamento e material logístico, veículos,
                             equipamentos de informática e software, mobiliário de
                             escritório (US$ 90.000).

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: Foi comprado uma viatura, computadores e
materiais de escritórios para o Ministério das Obras Públicas.

Componente 2: Restauração e Reabilitação do Sistema de Electricidade

Esta componente fundamental do projecto apoiou a restauração acelerada e reabilitação do
sistema de produção e distribuição de energia electrica, e operações comerciais na Bissau.
Esta sub-componente foi realizada através de três acções transversais de apoio, com
algumas das sub componentes que foram financiados no quadro do Projecto de
Reabilitação e Desenvolvimento do Sector Privado da IDA (PRDSP-IDA), BOAD, pelo
PURSEA e PMRI.

Sub componente 2.1: Restauração da produção de energia eléctrica

           (v) Esquema de Operação Privada (EOP): custos de mobilização e
               desmobilização: o projecto inicial previa que 15 MW de capacidade de
               produção de energia eléctrica seriam alugados e postos a disposição da
               EAGB por um período de 3 a 5 anos através da contratação competitiva de
               um operador privado (denominado como Esquema de Operação Privada -

                                            49
              EOP). Estava também previsto que o projecto financiaria transportes e
              pequenas obras de preparação do local para os custos de mobilização e
              desmobilização, até ao limite de US$ 1,1 milhão, do esquema de operação
              privada (EOP).

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: um tal Esquema de Operação Privada (EOP) não
foi possível devido a insolvência da EAGB constatada na altura e da iminente
disponibilidade de produção de energia hidroeléctrica da OMVG anunciada , que foi agora
adiado para 2016/17.Havia necessidades de garantias a serem dadas pelo governo ou pelo
MIGA, montagem essa que não foi possível atempadamente provocando atrasos
irreversíveis no processo. Por conseguinte, a nova proposta consistiu em realizar um
estudo das opções para uma nova central eléctrica para expansão da capacidade de geração,
em paralelo com a aquisição de capacidade de produção adicional.
Houve a necessidade de modificar as actividades do projecto, porque as componentes
inicialmente concebidas e o montante do empréstimo não seriam suficientes para atingir os
objectivos de desenvolvimento desejados.

           (vi) Plano de Gestão Social e Ambiental para o local de produção actual: Esta
                actividade destina-se a implementar as recomendações do relatório do
                consultor de auditoria social e ambiental e a avaliação ambiental e social
                para novos investimentos de produção de electricidade em Bissau. A
                implementação do plano de mitigação, controlo e organização foi estimada
                em cerca de US$ 390.000. Dado o estado das instalações existentes do ponto
                de vista ambiental e social, esta actividade devia ser lançada rapidamente
                sob pena de abandono do local.

Actividades até à data: Houve necessidade de finalizar os trabalho de instalação dos
equipamentos para depois finalizar o programa de saneamento. O consultor procedeu a
actualização do referido Plano e a elaboração do DAO para os trabalhos e aquisições de
equipamentos.
Contudo não foi possível materializar esses planos de aquisições e trabalhos por falta de
tempo (devido ao fecho do PMRI).
Houve inclusive o lançamento do concurso para aquisição de equipamentos para segurança
no trabalho mas que depois foi suspenso, por falta de tempo.

Outras acções necessárias: Esta actividade deve retomada logo que houver verbas para o
efeito.

           (vii)       Produção, investimentos de emergência: A situação em termos de
               capacidade de produção piorou consideravelmente em 2007, uma série de
               operações de emergência foram entretanto realizadas. Essas actividades não
               estavam incluídas no projecto inicial e foram incluídas no PMRI
               restruturado.




                                           50
Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas:

a. Compra de geradores de produção de emergência (2 x 1,5 MW): o contrato para a
compra de geradores foi assinado e foi co-financiado pelo PRDSP (US$ 1,726.326) e pelo
PMRI (US$ 600.000). Para possibilitar a execução integral do contrato e permitir a EAGB
operar os dois geradores nas melhores condições, o PMRI também financiou algumas obras
e fornecimentos adicionais (cerca de US$ 180.000) (celas e sistemas de protecção para
permitir a evacuação de energia em melhores condições.
 Ambos os geradores entraram em funcionamento desde 2 de Dezembro de 2008. Mas,
devido aos vários problemas ligados à manutenção/exploração, estes geradores estão
avariados e fora de serviço desde Junho de 2012. Um dos motores com o transformador foi
enviado a Dakar para expertise do fabricante cummins/Matforce e o dossier encontra-se
em litígios. A MATFORCE apresentou recentemente, uma proposta de reparação dos dois
grupos no valor de 140 milhões de F CFA. O eventual financiamento dessa operação
poderá ser feito pelo governo.
b. Aluguer de 2,5 MW de potência: Em virtude do atraso no processo de aquisição dos
grupos (2x1.5 MW), e a urgência de fornecer alguma electricidade a cidade de Bissau (sem
nenhuma electricidade no final do ano 2007), um contrato de aluguer de geradores de
emergência (3 x 850 kW) foi assinado e os 2 primeiros geradores foram instalados em
Janeiro de 2008, e um terceiro grupo, em Fevereiro de 2008. Este contrato de aluguer foi
prorrogado varias vezes até Junho de 2012.
Por forma a colmatar as deficiências financeiras da EAGB, com os fundos do PMRI, foram
recentemente (2014) adquiridos peças sobressalentes e 107 tambores de 200 litros de óleo
para grupos MTU, aumentando assim a potência da central eléctrica para 3 MW. De igual
forma foram comprados 15 tambores de 200 litros de óleo para os grupos ABC.
            (viii)     Implementação de geração descentralizada de energia – co-
                produção de energia a partir de biomassa: A compra de equipamentos de
                co-produção iniciada por LICAJU e SICAJU foi concluída. Os
                equipamentos para estas unidades fabris foram financiados pelo PRDSP.
Sub componente 2.2: Reabilitação e melhoria do Sistema de Gestão Comercial

A estratégia para melhorar o desempenho comercial e financeiro da EAGB foi baseada na
implementação de duas actividades específicas: (i) um contrato de assistência técnica para
a gestão comercial, contabilística e financeira da EAGB e (ii) um contrato de fornecimento
e instalação de contadores pré-pagos e definição um novo sistema de gestão comercial.
            (iv) Assistência técnica para o melhoramento/recuperação das áreas gestão
                 comercial, contabilística e financeira da EAGB. O contrato de assistência
                 técnica era fundamental para o sucesso da estratégia.
Actividades concluídas: Após um processo de licitação internacional competitiva, um
contrato de três anos de assistência técnica foi assinado em Fevereiro de 2009 e entrou em
vigor em Maio de 2009. O Projecto PMRI financiou o primeiro ano do contrato, que não
chegou a ser concluído devido aos acontecimentos politico/militar que levou a suspensão
do contrato por parte do consultor (valor orçamentado US$ 0,85 milhões).
Para facilitar a execução das suas actividades, o Banco deu também a sua não objecção
para assinatura de vários contratos de apoio à EAGB: (i) compra de quatro viaturas pick-
up (no montante de 47 milhões de FCFA (cerca de US$ 90.000)), (ii) compra de 7

                                           51
motocicletas de 50 cm3 (no montante de 2.520.000.00 FCFA (cerca de US$ 5.000)), (ii)
computadores hardware (valor: 6.990.000.00 FCFA (cerca de US$ 15.000) e (iv)
combustível para os veículos acima mencionados para um período de 6 meses, num
montante de aproximadamente US$ 10.000.
Outras acções necessárias: Deve-se implementar uma acção de assistência técnica à gestão
da EAGB no quadro da nova estratégia para a reforma e transformação da EAGB.
           (v) Realização de APD e DAO para fornecimento e instalação de contadores
               pré-pagos (15.000 unidades) e respectivo sistema de gestão comercial: A
               reabilitação do sistema de facturação de electricidade pela criação e
               funcionamento de um sistema de contagem baseado em contadores pré-
               pagos (15.000 unidades) é um dos principais pilares da estratégia para
               melhorar o desempenho comercial e financeiro da EAGB.
Actividades concluída: O estudo foi feito assim como DAO que serviu para aquisição dos
contadores no âmbito do PURSEE

Sub componente 2.3: Reabilitação e Reforço da Rede Eléctrica de Distribuição
Urbana

A reabilitação da rede de distribuição foi financiada pelo BOAD e tinha as seguintes
actividades:
                    (i) reabilitação e ampliação do sistema eléctrica de distribuição
                         urbana existente, incluindo a substituição de transformadores, a
                         adaptação da tensão de distribuição de 10 kV para o remanescente
                         existente de sistemas de 6 kV;
                    (ii) estabelecimento de uma reserva de equipamentos necessários para
                         a operação e manutenção da rede de distribuição urbana e
                    (iii)a formação de pessoal da EAGB nas áreas de funcionamento,
                         manutenção e gestão da rede de distribuição de energia. Todos os
                         elementos operacionais desta componente foram objecto de
                         estudos de desenvolvimento institucional e sectoriais incluídos no
                         projecto, especialmente a reconstrução de toda a gestão comercial
                         da EAGB.
Actividades concluídas: Esta componente do projecto foi financiada na sua totalidade pelo
BOAD. Foi assinado um contrato com a RMT para o fornecimento e instalação de
equipamentos para o sistema de energia de Bissau (incluindo o fornecimento de
ferramentas e equipamentos para a rede de O&M e formação). O contrato de supervisão
das obras foi financiado pelo PMRI esteve a cardo do gabinete CABIRA. Essas duas
actividades foram concluídas com êxito (ver a tabela em anexo 1).

Outras acções necessárias: ( por insuficiência de fundos, os investimentos programados
no âmbito do estudo (APD) financiado pelo PRDSP foram separados em duas fase (A e B).
Deve-se notar que as obras executadas reflectem apenas a primeira fase de reabilitação e
extensão das redes de energia em Bissau. A segunda fase devia ser financiada pela UE (10º
FED). Mas, devido ao golpe militar de 12 de Abril de 2012, houve sansões ao país por
parte da EU, e este cancelou o financiamento.



                                            52
Componente 3: Reabilitação da Produção, Tratamento e Distribuição de Água
Urbana


Sub componente 3.1: Produção de Água

Esta sub componente foi financiada pela IDA e incluiu:

Reabilitação e reforço dos sistemas de produção de água na cidade de Bissau. Para
melhorar a capacidade de armazenamento de água e o equilíbrio da rede de distribuição,
estava programada a construção de um novo reservatório (700 m3) no " Hospital 3 de
Agosto".

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: um primeiro contrato para a construção do
reservatório tinha sido assinado em 2008, mas devido a muitas deficiências apresentadas
pela empresa construtora , decidiu-se pela rescisão do contrato. O processo de rescisão foi
concluído e uma nova consulta foi lançada. Uma feita nova estimativa do custo do
reservatório pelo consultor e, finalmente o reservatório foi estimado em US$ 1,23 milhões.
Por falta de verbas no PMRI, esta actividade foi transferida e executada no âmbito do
PURSEA.
Foi realizado um estudo de impacto ambiental no quadro do PMRI reestruturado.

                    (iii)Substituição do antigo sistema de bombeamento no "Hospital
                         3 de Agosto" para aumentar o volume de água produzida e
                         satisfazer a procura de água a médio prazo.

Actividades concluídas: a consulta foi realizada e as duas (2) bombas foram entregues pelo
fornecedor a EAGB. O valor do contrato foi de US$ 33.000

Sub componente 3.2: Distribuição de Água e
Sub componente 3.3: Sistema de facturação e ferramentas de trabalho

Estas duas sub componentes incluem:

                    (v) Substituição de: (a) 3,6 km de redes de distribuição primária de
                         água ao longo das estradas existentes (Avenida 14 de Novembro e
                         Avenida Pansau na Isna), e (b) 9 km de redes terciárias de
                         distribuição de água no Bairro da Ajuda. Estima-se que após a
                         conclusão destas obras, as perdas de água foram reduzidas de 70
                         por cento para 50 por cento.
                    (vi) Extensão de 26,3 km de redes terciárias de distribuição de água
                         para áreas não cobertas e construção de 700 ligações de água e 50
                         novos fontenários públicos nas áreas semi-urbanas de Bissau (em
                         particular nos bairros de Luanda e de Bandim). As ligações
                         privadas, denominadas de "ligações sociais" seriam
                         subvencionadas pelo projecto e os beneficiários dariam apenas

                                            53
                       uma pequena contribuição à EAGB para o contrato de serviço.
                       Fontenários públicos totalmente financiados pelo projecto seriam
                       operados por gestores privados mediante o pagamento de uma taxa
                       do serviço efectuado. Por forma a utilizar o saldo nesta actividade,
                       foram executadas
                   (vii)     Fornecimento e instalação de 6.000 contadores de água.
                       Todas as ligações de água deverão ser equipadas com contadores
                       para que os consumidores possam ser facturados pelo seu
                       consumo real, em vez de se utilizar uma avença, como estava a ser
                       praticado.
                   (viii)    Equipamentos e material logístico para a EAGB: kits de
                       análise de água, bocas-de-incêndio, ferramentas de trabalho e
                       veículo, para melhorar o desempenho operacional da empresa de
                       água.
Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: As actividades de (i) a (iv) foram realizadas
com sucesso no âmbito de um único contrato (ver anexo 2).

Componente 4: Reabilitação Limitada das Infra-estruturas Rodoviárias Urbanas
Esta componente tinha como plano o financiamento das seguintes actividades:

                     (iii)elaboração do programa de investimento em reabilitação
                          rodoviária através de estudos de viabilidade para determinar o tipo
                          de obras necessárias, assim como os critérios de elegibilidade e o
                          calendário para a reconstrução de vias urbanas (Bissau);

Actividades levadas a cabo e concluídas: o estudo foi realizado (APD, DAO) e foram
entregues ao Ministério das Obras Públicas.
Outras acções necessárias: O financiamento necessário para implementar o programa
prioritário foi estimado em US$ 30 milhões.
                      (iv) implementação de um programa limitado de recuperação de
                           estradas incluindo obras de construção civil, aquisição de
                           equipamentos, e prestação de serviços de consultoria para
                           reabilitar as redes de estradas primárias e secundárias na cidade de
                           Bissau. Actividades de supervisão de obras de construção civil.
Decisão de cancelar esta actividade: o cancelamento desta componente de reabilitação de
estradas foi confirmado durante a revisão intercalar do projecto e um acordo foi celebrado
entre o Governo e o Banco para reafectar os recursos inicialmente previstos para os
investimentos rodoviários para a componente de energia.
Neste momento, parte desta actividade esta a ser executada com o financiamento da BOAD.
Componente 5: Gestão, Monitorização e Avaliação do Projecto

Disponibilização de fundos para formação, aquisição de equipamento e apoio operacional
à UCP para a coordenação global, avaliação, supervisão e execução do projecto, incluindo,
nomeadamente: (a) reforço da capacidade da UCP para cumprir as suas responsabilidades
no âmbito do projecto, (b) formação ao pessoal da UCP para lhe permitir melhorar os seus
conhecimentos em questões de desembolso, gestão financeira, políticas sociais e

                                             54
ambientais e políticas de salvaguardas e procedimentos de adjudicação, (c) a realização de
auditorias para o projecto; (d) a implementação de um programa para monitorar e avaliar
a realização do projecto, e a aquisição de uma (1) viatura 4x4 para uso da UCP.
