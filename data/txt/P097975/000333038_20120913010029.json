and\n            governance in the power, water, and roads sectors. The\n            closing date of the project will be extended from September\n            30, 2012 until June 15, 2013. The project implementation was\n            progressing well until the occurrence of a military coup,\n            which triggered the Bank Policy OP 7.30 on April 17, 2012\n            and led to the suspension of disbursements. The\n            project's disbursement rate is 78 percent, and there\n            are activities yet to be procured and paid for such as some\n            sector studies and technical assistance. Due to the fact\n            that the Bank is still assessing the situation and has not\n            resumed communications with the Government, there is\n            currently no request from Government to extend the project.\n            The extension is motivated due to the extraordinary\n            circumstances in the country and as a precautionary measure,\n            in order to give time to the Bank to assess the situation.\n            The project development objectives are still achievable and\n            the project implementation unit is functioning. Once the\n            Bank determines to reestablish dialogue, the Bank will seek\n            from Government the formal validation of the extension and\n            an action plan for the extension period. This will be the\n            second extension of the project. A first extension from June\n            30, 2011 to September 30, 2012 has already been approved."}, "docdt": "2012-08-29T00:00:00Z"}
