NEKORANDUK AND RECOMMENDATIO  OF THE PRESIDOm
OF THE IETERNATIONAL DEVEWPNT ASSOCIATIO
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CRED&a
TO TRE YENEk ARAB REPfBLIC
FOR A HEALTH SECTOR DVELOKPENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Yemen Arab Re-ublic for SDR 11.7 million (US$15.0 million) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40-year maturity and would help finance a Health Sector Development
Project. The Government of YAR would contribute the remaining US$4.1 million
equivalent of the project cost.
2.    iakzLa un.  The country's health indicators depict serious problems,
the level of services is low, and only 40 percent of the population have
access to basic health care. The Government's current sectoral strategy
focuses on the development of a cost-effective primary health care progr;tm
which will target, through phases, the majority of the rural population ay the
year 2001. However, the nationwide expansion of the program faces constraints
because of the weakness of the regional administrative capabilities and
limited support services, notably maintenance and supplies systems.  Extension
of service coverage is also hampered by the acute shortage of health
personnel, primarily nurses and midwives, whic1 is largely due to the lack of
regional training institutions.
3.    IDA's past lending to the sector consisted of one credit of US$10.5
million in 1983. This involved strengthening key central administrative and
planning units of the Ministry of Health (MOH), as well as supporting the
Health Manlpower Institute. The 'Iemeni team involvement in project preparation
was minimal. Thus, the project was relatively isolated from KOH and, during
the difficult initial phases of implementation, commitment was weak and the
project's management was not adequately monitored by the Government.
Consequently, the intended 3-year implementation period for the project soon
proved unrealistic, and its closing date had to be extended three times prior
to project completion on June 30, 1989. Important lessons learned during the
course of IDA support for the health sector in YAR include: a) the necessity
of avoiding complex and overambitious project designs in a country with
limited institutions; (b) the necessity of broad based local participation of
sector officials in project preparation and implementation; (c) the advantages
of locating the project implementation unit within the sectoral ministry;
d) the limited benefit of long-term consultant advisors without local
counterparts; and (e) the extended time required to introduce innovations in
the system and the need for phasing institutional development compor.ents.
These lessons were taken into account during the preparation of the proposed
project.
4.    In the current Five-Year Plan, the Government has allocated the largest
share of its 1987-1991 health investment plan to support basic health care and
preventive services, amounting to 40 percent of MOH capital budget. In
addition, the Government has been successful in mobilizing substantial
community resources to finance about 30 percent of new basic health services
program extensions through the Local Councils for Cooperative Development



(LCCD). The Government also recovers annually three to four percent of MOH
current expenditures through direct user charges. Total mobilized resources
are estimated to be six percent of the total MOH budget. Public and private
health expenditures are equivalent to about 4.1 percent of the GDP with an
estimated annual per capita health expenditure of US$21, of which about one
third is from public resources, one half from private resources, and the
remainder from external assistance.
5.    Further strengthening of health services, and enhincement of equity by
broadening access to health care for the remaining 60 percent of the
population who remain underserved, cannot develop in a vacuum. What is needed
now, in addition to trained human resources, is a critical mass of
administrative and support service capabilities to strengthen the operations
of the regional sectoral network through a broad non-marginal approach and to
facilitate the expansion and sustainability of health services and sectoral
investments. Strengthening regional roles would also enhance the
participation of the Local Councils so that they support even further health
service development from ccmmunity resources rather than exclusively from the
central Government budget.
6.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project is consistent with IDA
lending strategy for YAR, and indeed illustrates the need for sustained IDA
assistance to the country. It would support the Government's assignment of
top priority to institutional and human resources development in the sector.
The assistance of the many other donors involved in the sector is relatively
narrow. IDA's involvement can provide a broader and more comprehensive
sectoral approach which raises the return to, and reinforces the
sustainability of, sectoral investments, while enhancing regional and local
administrative roles and efforts.
7.    Prolect Objectives.  The project would have two main objectives:
(a) increase the quality, effectiveness and level of services of the
existing healt.. care system; and
(b) facilitate the extension of health services to underserved
communities.
8.    Project Description.  The project would include three main components:
(a) Strengthening Regional Administration. Maintenance of Medical
Eauipment and Medical SuMDlies Management. The project would finance the
strengthening of managerial and technical skills and capabilities through
staff training and retraining involving 600 people in all of t' country's
11 governorates; the construction of nine pharmaceutical storage
facilities, nine maintenance workshops for bio-medical equipment; the
development of planned preventive maintenance programs; and the provision
of equipment, office materials and furniture. Key operations that would be
strengthened include: general administration; personnel administration;
accounting and budgeting; statistics, information management and computer
training; maintenance of medical equipment; food program supervision;
medical supplies management; public relations and secretariat and archives.



(b) Health Manpower Development. Three regional institutes with
dormitories would be built for nursing and midwifery training in Dhamar,
Ibb and Sa'ada. The Central Health Manpower Institute would be expanded
through the addition of classrooms and three laboratories for environmental
health, midwifery, and pharmaceutical sciences. The resulting increase in
national training capabilities for nursing is estimated to be 30 percent.
The project would finance the provision of training materials, equipment,
and student buses; and would assist in financing curriculum upgrading for
nursing and medical technicians.
(c)  Health Care Manazement Development.  This component would support an
initial phase for strengthening the skills and capabilities of a nucleus of
managers within YAR's health system. Twelve person/months of technical
assistance would be provided to the main referral and medical training
hospital to strengthen its capabilities as a center for hospital management
training. The referral hospital has already succeeded in its pilot efforts
of outreach supervision and organization of referrals. Main areas to be
addressed include: general management, financial management, strategic
planning, information management, materials management, maintenance
administration, medical records, and nursing administration. The technical
assistance team would work with designated staff, provide hands-on-
training, and design and coordinate a program to address the training needs
of 60 management level employees including a number of persons selected
from other hospitals. Concurrently, the team would review the current
level of management practice in the country, determire the qualifications
and quantity of managers needed, their utilization patterns, design
appropriate programs to address those needs at the national level, and
develop a national action plan for strengthening health care management
systems at the referral level. The project would also finance the
development of a maternal and child health emergency unit and a blood bank
to support ongoing parallel efforts for improving the management of
clinical services and referrals.
9.    Project Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project including
contingencies is estimated at US$19.1 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange cost of US$11.1 million. The proposed cred. of US$15 million would
finance 79 percent of the total cost including 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost.  A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan is shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. Incremental recurrent expenditures are
estimated to be about one percent of the total yearly recurrent health budget.
A Project Management Office, directly linked to the Minister of Health, has
been established at Muuji HeadquarLerS Lo coordinate implementation activities.
10.   Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following actions: (a) the secondary technical school level would be required
as a selection criterion for Bio-Medical Technician training; (b) the Borrower
shall, by December 31 of each year or such later date as IDA may agree, ensure
that annual budgetary allocations required for the maintenance of medical
equipment and project facilities during the following year are made;



- 4 -
(c) employment of thirty instructors in the three health manpower institutes
by June 1993; (d) formulation of a training program with monitorable
objectives for hospital management by December 1991; (e) submission of the
review and action plan involving multiple systems for strengthening health
care management for joint review with IDA by June 1993; and (f) maintaining
the Project Management Office, with qualified staff under terms of reference
s&tisfactory to IDA, throughout project implementation; (g) meeting conditions
for progress reports and audit reports. The fturnishing of evidence
satisfactory to IDA that sites for the bio-medical equipment maintenance
workshops and pharmaceutical storage facilities have been acquired for
purposes related to the project is a cordition of effectiveness of the
proposed credit.
11.      Benefits.  (a) By improving sectoral services and the operational
standards of the existing system, the project would raise the standard of
health care and ultimately contribute to improving the health status and
quality of life of underse7 ted communities. (b) The project would create the
capabilities to sustain fi ther development and improvement of health services
through the 1990s. Moreover by providing support to the primary health care
network, the project would c ntribute to a more efficient use of resources and
to restraining the progressively escalating demands for the more expensive
levels of health care.  (c) The human resources development aspects of the
project would promote professional opportunities in the health ,{ector for
women.
12.      Risks.  Possible risks are related primarily to limited management
capacities at all levels and to difficult communications with the remote
governorates, which set limits on the pace of pro ect implementation. The
nationwide administrative strengthening supporte by the project is expected
to increase MOR project implementation capacit    considerably.  The project's
focus on strengthening the Governorate Health    ectorates to act as regional
project implementation agents, the experience a.quired by MOH through the
first project, and the assistance of the Mini_ -y of Public Works should also
help to minimize the risks.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
