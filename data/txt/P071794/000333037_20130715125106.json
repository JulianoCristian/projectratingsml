follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, Global Environment Objective\n            (GEO) outcomes were satisfactory, risk to GEO outcomes was\n            moderate, the risk to development outcome was moderate, the\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: at the beginning of the project, there were\n            concerns over up-take among rural households, particularly\n            due to the risk that the Solar Home Systems (SHSs) might\n            become unnecessary if the households received grid\n            electrification. In order to reduce the household's\n            purchase risk, the Partner Organizations (POs) offered to\n            buy back any SHS in the case the grid arrived to the\n            community. In most places, even where the grid did reach,\n            consumers chose not to sell back their SHS. POs felt that\n            this increased the initial uptake of SHS. It is crucial to\n            establish quality assurance of product performance at the\n            beginning of a project, and quality monitoring and\n            enforcement among POs is essential. The experience of the\n            first phase of the Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) component\n            highlighted the need for testing before shipment and\n            stronger eligibility criteria at the time of procurement to\n            ensure the supply of high quality CFLs. A few countries have\n            now introduced a pre, qualification stage in which the\n            manufacturing facility and product quality are verified by\n            an independent party, and only the vendors that meet the\n            eligibility conditions are allowed to submit their bids.\n            There is also a need for in-country testing for CFL bulbs.\n            Having testing centers will allow manufacturers to compare\n            products and will allow products to be tested against the\n            specific grid conditions in Bangladesh."}, "docdt": "2013-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
