POs are allowed to set up their own terms for customer
lending and credit sales, although they must comply
with IDCOL guidelines. Typically, the credit sale terms
involves a customer down payment of 15% of total
costs, and loan with flat interest rates of between 6%
and 15% to be paid over 3 years.

OUTCOMES
The project has been successful, shown by the
significant increase in the number of SHS sold and
installed since the project started in 2002, as shown in
the figure.
