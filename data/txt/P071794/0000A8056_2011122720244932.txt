                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been making satisfactory progress in meeting its development objectives of increasing access to electricity in rural areas of Bangladesh. Allocations for the Solar
                         Home Systems (SHS) component under the first additional financing has been fully exhausted supporting 340,000 systems against a target of 300,000 systems. Together with
                         support from IDA and other development partners, Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) and its partner organizations have installed more than 1.1 million SHS in
                         remote rural areas of Bangladesh. Considering the funding needs, IDA Board has approved a second additional financing of US$172 million for supporting another 630,000 systems..

                         The project is also supporting the Government's Efficient Lighting Initiatives for Bangladesh (ELIB) program under which about 10 million Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) have
                         already been distributed in exchange of incandescent bulbs. There have been concerns about the quality of the CFLs distributed. The Bank is working with the implementing agency
                         REB to establish the lamp failure rates through re-testing and post-installation surveys. A second phase procurement could not be concluded due to issues related to bidders'
                         submission of performance guarantees. Government is exploring options for the second phase procurement given the limited time before project closing in December 2012.

                         The team is in discussion with the government to find out ways to strengthen REB and the rural cooperatives (PBSs) to meet the challenges of universal access by the year 2021.
                         The Bank continues to remain committed to support the government in its efforts to address the challenges in the rural electrification sector of Bangladesh.
