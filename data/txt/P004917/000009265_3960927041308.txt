FOR A THIRI) PORTS PROJECT
1.       The  following report oni a proposed loan to the Democratic and
Popular Republic of Algeria in the amount of US$63.0 million equivalent is
submitted for approval.  The proposed loan weuld be repayable over 15 years
with five years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and
would assist in: (a) modernizing essential port facilities to meet demand
at reasonable efficiency; (b) improving the financial viability of the port
enterprises (EPs); and (c) strengthening their managerial and operational
capacity.
2.       Backyround.   Before  the mid-1970s,  little was  done  to  improve
the transport system in Algeria. Rapidly increasing traffic, combined with
aging facilities, gave impetus to major Government investments in the
transport  sector  in  the  1975-79  and  1980-84  Development  Plans.   The
Government now gives priority to the rehabilitation and modernization of
the transport sector with a view to improving operational efficiency,
investment planning and coordination, and domestic resource mobilization.
Similarly, the rapid growth in port traffic during the late 1970s and early
1980s resulted in considerable emphasis being given to the development of
new  port  infrastructure.   However,  the  sharp  decline  in  hydrocarbon
revenues beginning in 1985 culminated in traffic stagnation chrough
reduction of imports.  Consequently, Algerian authorities began to revise
their  port  investment  program  by  giving  greater  emphasis   to  the
rehabilitation and modernization of existing infrastructure.  Whereas the
Algerian port system comprises ten separate EPs, three main ports (Algiers,
Oran, and Annaba) account for about 70 percent of general cargo traffic
(Map IBRD 20910).  In 1987, port traffic consisted mainly of hydrocarbon
exports amounting to some 56 million tons as well as major import volumes
of general cargo and bulk traffic (mainly cereals and cement) estimated at
about 12 million tons. Total general cargo traffic is estimated at about
8 million tons of which just over half can be containerized.   However,
containerization in Algeria affects only 8 percent of the cargo that can be
containerized compared with levels of between 25 and 50 percent in some
*        other  Mediterranean  countries.   Thus  there  is  considerable  scope  for
increasing containerization levels, as well as for improving efficiency in
port operations by rehabilitating existing facilities and by introducing
modern cargo-handling technology.
3.       Projeet Objectives.   The  proposed  project  would  broaden  Bank
lending activity in the transport sector.   It would improve operational
efficiency, financial viability, and investment planning in the ports
subsector.   In  this  context,  it  would  set  priorities  for  essential
rehabilitation and modernization of existing facilities and strengthening
the performance of port enterprises. These objectives are consistent with
the Bank's assistance program in the highway and railway subsectors.

4.       Project Description.   The  proposed  project  would  constitute  a
first phase in a rehabilitat.on and modernization program for key Algerian
ports.  It would provide support in three areas: remodelling of existing
berth  facilities  and  provision  of  specialized  handling  equipment,
investment and financial planning, and port operations.  Modernization of
existing port facilities would be undertaken as follows: (a) construction
of container berths in the port of Algiers based on the remodelling of
existing facilities and the provision of container handling equipment;
(b) modernization of existing berth facilities in Oran and Annaba and the
provision of equipment for container traffic; and (c) provision of a
grain-handling facility at Annaba (Maps  IBRD 20911. 20912,  20913).   The
second area of activity would provide assistance for studies on cost
accounting and port tariffs and subsequent phases of port modernization as
part of the effort to encourage the adoption of cost-based tariffs and to
introduce improved investment planning.  The third area of activity would
include a training program designed to support the introduction of modern
container-handling technology, including trade facilitation, oper%ting
methods, and equipment maintenance.
5.       Project Cost and Fnancina  .  The total cost of the project with
contingencies  is  estimated  at  US$127.8 million.   The  Bank  loan  of
US$63.0 million would cover the foreign exchange cost of the project,
equivalent to just under half the total cost. Local costs in the amount of
US$64.8 million  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  and  the  EPs.   A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Algeria are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A general map and port plans are attached.   The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 7409-AL, dated May 31, 1989 is being distributed separately.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The  primary  rationale  for Bank
involvement is to assist the Ministry of Transport in improving port
efficiency and investment planning.   As such the project would set the
stage for a longer-term program of rehabilitation and modernization in the
port subsector. Through the introduction of cost accounting systems, which
would better differentiate among the various port services and would
provide for adequate depreciation of fixed assets, the Bank would assist
the responsible authorities with the formulation of appropriate port
pricing policies.  On a global basis, the financial viability of the port
enterprises is within reach and only modest adjustments to tariffs would be
required to achieve full cost recovery. At the same time, by adopting new
technology for cargo handling, the operational efficiency of the ports in
general would be  raised.   The  introduction of new technology would be
accompanied by institutional improvements related to the documentation and
handling of container traffic.  Because of the low level of containerized
cargo, considerable scope exists for reductions in cargo handling costs and
in sea freight rates applied to Algerian foreign trade.
7.       Agreed Actions.  Agreement  has  been  reached  on  the  scope  and
priorities of the overall port investment program and the need to furnish
annual investment and operational budgets to the Bank.  In particular, the
investment  program  would  focus  on  rehabilitation,  modernization  and
maintenance works which would account for about 60% of total investment
expenditures during project implementation.  The Government has agreed to



- 3 -
appoint a project coordinator.  The project EPs also have agreed  to set
tariffs and charges to produce revenues sufficient to maintain satisfactory
financial ratios, consisting of: (a) working ratios of .90 for the EP of
Algiers and .75 for each of the EPs of Oran and Annaba; and (b) starting in
1993, debt service coverage ratios of at least two on the debt incurred in
the financing of the container and grain handling ard storing facilities.
A Project Action Plan gives details of the financial objectives and
provides for the introduction of more adequate cost accounting systems and
port pricing policies, including appropriate depreciation of infrastructure
costs,  Specific actions have also been defined to mitigate any adverse
impact on the environment, particularly in relation to the disposal of
dredged materials.
8.       Justification.   The  project  should  bring  substantial  benefits  in
the form of savings in foreign exchange, particularly through lowered
transport costs on many of the country's high value imports.  In the longer
term, the development of container traffic would also encourage the growth
of selected commodities for export.  The project would lead to an improved
financial position for the ports and would help the responsible authorities
develop a cost-based tariff system.  In addition, international competitive
bidaing for the infrastructure construction activities is expected to
result  in  lower  prices  on  coost-ruction  contracts.   Savings  in  ships'
service time and in reduced handling costs would constitute the main
benefits of the container port program. The savings would be reflected in
reduced frei-ht rates on a large part of Algeria's  foreign trade.   The
economic return (ER) of the container program ranges from 14 percent to
18 percent with an overall average of about 17 percent. Higher returns in
excess of 3J percent are expected on the proposed bulk cereals handling
facility in the port of Annaba which will provide substantial savings in
sea freight rates through the use of large bulk carriers for cereals
traffic. Overall savings in foreign exchange are estimated to be at least
US$12 million annually in the early years of operation.
9.       Risks.  The principal risk lies in the pace at which port users
will shift  to container technology.   However,  the  assumptions  made  are
relatively conservative and traffic developments will be closely monitored
during the early stages of operation to provide for adjustments during a
second phase program. A secondary risk relates to the impact of the likely
change in value of the dinar on the financial viability of the proposed
facilities.   In view of  the high share of foreigr exchange  in project
costs,  overall  costs   could  increase  in   line  with  exchange   rate
t       adjustments.  However, the proposed container handling tariffs are set at a
relatively high level and the corresponding revenue would be able to absorb
a  substantial  increase  in  costs.   Moreover,  increased  overall  price
flexibility is being introduced in the economy through a new law on   ices
prepared  by   the  Government,   which  will  facilitate  further  ttriff
adjustments  if  required  by  the evolution  of  the  cost  structure.   The
financial viability of the proposed facilities would, therefore, remain
acceptable.  Another risk relates to implementation delays,  particularly
those arising from the project agencies' inexperience in following Bank
procurement guidelines. With this in mind, steps were taken during project
preparation to minimize this risk by developing coordination among
concerned agencies, by preparing bidding documents in advance to allow for
early  prequalification,   and  by  strengthening  project  implementation
capability through provision of technical assistance for construction
supervision.
