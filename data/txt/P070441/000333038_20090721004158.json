"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Tri-Provincial Highway\n            Project, and Hubei Xiaogan- Xiangfan Highway Project for\n            China were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was negligible to low, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) it is\n            important to ensure during project preparation that the\n            mandate of the implementing entity is consistent with the\n            scope of the project. The implementation of the two highway\n            projects in China proved unexpectedly challenging because\n            the implementing entity had no jurisdiction over the rural\n            roads and the traffic safety components; 2) some adjustments\n            in the scheduling of safeguards procedures can be\n            considered. The completion of the full resettlement action\n            plan before the preliminary engineering highway design was\n            completed wasted scarce resources as it had to be re-done\n            because the road alignments changed significantly; and 3)\n            since the gap between safeguard policies in the Bank and\n            China on highway projects is now quite small, good\n            supervision is the key to ensuring that the policies are\n            followed. In China, at least in the provinces where the\n            projects were assessed, performance-based project lending\n            has sufficed in respect of safeguards, but the application\n            of the country systems with periodic supervision by the Bank\n            can be contemplated."}, "docdt": "2009-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
