were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: it is important that the Task Teams allow\n            sufficient time to properly inspect projects during the\n            construction phase and that the team has the skills to cover\n            all potential issues, especially road safety. With\n            expressway projects such as the Xiaogan-Xiangfan Expressway\n            (XXE), some 224 km long, it can take several days in the\n            field to do a proper inspection. Budget and time constraints\n            can lead to the temptation to reduce the time in the field,\n            but this is to the detriment of the overall project. Through\n            supervision visits, the Task Team helped identify a number\n            of critical issues which, if left unresolved, will have\n            potentially compromised the project's ability to meet\n            the project development objective (PDO). The practice on\n            Bank-financed expressway projects in China has been to\n            include a local road improvement program, typically on the\n            order of 10 percent of the total project size. These have\n            been included to help further ensure that the projects\n            benefit the poor."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
