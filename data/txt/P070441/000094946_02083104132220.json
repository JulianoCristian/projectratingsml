regional integration in Hubei\n            Province, as well as improve transport links to lagging\n            western provinces. The project components will: 1) increase\n            highway capacity, and regional integration, through capital\n            investments in the construction of the Xiaogan - Xiangfan\n            Expressway (XXE). It will link major industrial, and hub\n            cities, and reach less developed counties in the western,\n            and mountainous part of Hubei, stimulating socioeconomic\n            development; 2) include a rural road improvement program, to\n            facilitate accessibility in low-income areas. This component\n            comprises various subprojects for the rehabilitation, and\n            upgrade of existing road sections. The road selection\n            criteria include county income levels, expected impacts on\n            the population served, consistency with provincial\n            priorities, and, economic rate of return; and, 3) strengthen\n            the capacity, and sustainability of highway management in\n            the Province, by building sector institutions, and\n            facilitating institutional transition to the needs of a\n            market economy. To this end, training programs will be\n            provided for government agencies on highway planning,\n            design, supervision, management and operation, and road safety."}, "docdt": "2002-08-19T00:00:00Z"}
