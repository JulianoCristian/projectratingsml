The increased transport capacity in the\n            Xiaogan-Xiangfan corridor, while improving accessibility in\n            low income areas, will nonetheless affect populations due to\n            necessary reallocation needs. Thus, engineering designs will\n            follow four basic principles: 1) avoid construction in areas\n            close to towns, villages, schools, hospitals, factories, and\n            mining areas; 2) avoid cultural heritage sites; 3) avoid\n            cultivated, and ore deposits areas; and, 4) minimize\n            disturbance to basic infrastructure. This resettlement\n            action plan (RAP), based on public participation, looks at\n            the activities to be carried following consultation with\n            project affected people (PAP), and, assesses compensation as\n            follows. The RAP aims at improving, or at least restore,\n            living conditions of PAPs, and, stipulates that material\n            losses will be compensated at replacement costs, with equal\n            treatment in the absence of property ownership, rather\n            providing help for recovery, and compensation on assets\n            lost. Land compensation will be based at six times the\n            annual average output value, per cultivated land unit, for a\n            period of three years, while crop compensation shall be\n            based on the classification of cultivated land levied.\n            Grievance mechanisms include complaints and appeals at\n            county/district levels, and the right to present lawsuits to\n            civil courts. Volume II provides the policy framework for\n            resettlement, and land acquisition."}, "docdt": "2002-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
