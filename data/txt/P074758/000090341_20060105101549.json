The experience with PRSC-I\n            draws attention to the importance of maintaining good\n            coordination with the IMF in the formulation of policy\n            conditionalities. PRSC-I was prepared mainly with Bank staff\n            that also was involved in the preparation of investment\n            operations in the various sectors focused on in the PRSC\n            policy matrix. The experience with PRSC-I indicates that it\n            is important to be realistic in setting program targets and,\n            especially, to avoid being overly ambitious in the period\n            before elections. Finally, the non-enforcement of the\n            ministerial resolution issued by the health ministry in\n            compliance with a Board presentation condition for PRSC-I\n            would be tantamount to a policy reversal if left unaddressed."}, "docdt": "2005-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
