Reduction\n            Support Credit (PRSC) Project for Honduras were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: to improve\n            predictability of resource flow, PRSC operations can be\n            designed such that the timing of the tranche release is held\n            constant while the amount is adjusted in line with borrower\n            performance. The non-approval of the PRSC-II operation\n            suggests that this instrument has not yet been able to\n            deliver on the promise of greater predictability in the\n            annual resource flow made available to Honduras. In\n            response, International Development Association (IDA) has\n            been preparing a new budget support operation that seeks to\n            keep the timing predictable, but adjusting the credit amount\n            according to the number and substance of the triggers\n            achieved within that pre-determined period. Effective donor\n            coordination during the formulation of policy conditionality\n            reduces the danger of providing conflicting policy advice.\n            Staff of the Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF),\n            Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and bilateral donors\n            consulted regularly on policy matters relating to poverty\n            reduction strategy (PRS) implementation in Honduras during\n            program preparation. Program design should be simple\n            (limiting the amount of triggers) and targets should be\n            realistic, particularly where political consensus is\n            lacking, such as during pre-election periods. In such cases,\n            it is often better to focus on consolidating existing gains\n            and avoiding policy reversals."}, "docdt": "2008-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
