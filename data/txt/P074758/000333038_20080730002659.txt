F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
In line with the pillars of the Honduras PRSP and the medium-term priorities identified
in the PRSP Progress Report, the PRSP aims to support the Government's efforts to (i)
accelerate pro-poor growth, via support for reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness
and maximizing the potential for new investment and employment creation for men and
women in both urban and rural areas in the wake of new regional and international

agreements, in particular, DR-CAFTA, (ii) increase the impact and efficiency of
resources devoted to human development and social protection, with a focus on
deconcentration of responsibilities for service provision and increased empowerment of
beneficiaries of key services, and (iii) increase the medium- and long-term sustainability
of poverty reduction initiatives through policy and institutional reforms geared to
strengthening governance and public sector management and improving management of
the environment, especially in the protected areas. In addition, the PRSC supports the
Government's initiatives to systematize consultation processes around the poverty
reduction strategy and strengthen monitoring and evaluation at the national and
community levels.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       The First Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC-I) was appraised in April
2004 in support of Honduras' Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) of October 2001.
Progress in implementing the PRS had been disappointing by the Government's own
assessment, as reported in the first progress report (PRS-PR) discussed at the Board in
February 2004. Prime factors included the deterioration of the country's fiscal position
and slow progress on related structural reforms, as evidenced by deviations from
economic targets and consequent derailment of the IMF PRGF arrangement at the end of
2001. Towards the end of 2003, however, the Government had reestablished a viable
macro framework following a broad-based consensus building effort involving a wide
cross-section of society, parts of which had resisted prior, notably fiscal, reform efforts.
In its PRS-PR, the Government set forth detailed medium-term priorities, expected
outcomes and revised institutional arrangements aimed at accelerating PRS
implementation. The joint IDA-IMF staff review concluded this to be a sufficient basis
for support to Honduras. A new PRGF arrangement was thus approved in February 2004
and PRSC-I was approved in June 2004.

2.       Poverty in Honduras was widespread and stagnant. In 2004, 50.7 percent of the
population lived below the poverty line, including 23.7 percent living in extreme
poverty--a small, but statistically insignificant decline, compared to five years earlier.1
Lack of progress in poverty reduction is explained by the combined effects of stagnant
real GDP growth per capita of 0.3 percent per year over this period, and the country's
exposure to external shocks and natural disasters. Inequality in Honduras was also higher
than in the rest of Latin America as measured by a Gini coefficient of 53.0 compared to
51.5 for the region.2 Rural-urban disparities were pronounced.

3.       Although progress in reducing income poverty had been limited, Honduras
managed to considerably expand public service delivery in key sectors during the 1990s,
often with positive implications for development outcomes. Health service provision
improved markedly as vaccination programs achieved near universal coverage, chronic
malnutrition declined and the rate of infant and maternal mortality fell.                           Similar
improvements were observable in education, where primary enrolment ratios rose and
illiteracy declined. Despite these advances, Honduras continued to lag behind other
countries in key social indicators. Infrastructure access had also expanded considerably,
including water, sanitation, electricity and transportation. However, while Honduras had
made progress towards the attainment of the PRS targets and MDGs during the 1990s,



1Refers to the consumption-based measure of poverty based on ENCOVI (1998/99, 2004). See Honduras
Poverty Assessment (2006). The income-based measure of poverty based on the semi-annual EPHPM
survey is consistent with this observation: the proportion of poor households fell insignificantly from 65.9
percent in 1999 to 64.3 percent in 2004 (Source: INE).

achievements were much more limited during 2002-2003, following the finalization of
the PRS in late 2001.

4.      The PRSC operation responded to a window for reform that had opened given the
PRGF agreement and a well-articulated government plan in an environment of slow
progress of PRS implementation. As planned in the FY03-06 CAS, the series of quick-
disbursing credits, supported by the PRSC TAC technical assistance (which financed
technical assistance for implementing PRS measures targeted by the PRSC-I), aimed to
support and consolidate reforms across a wide range of areas where the Bank had
substantial expertise through its involvement in existing investment operations. The
PRSC constituted an important vehicle for country dialogue, especially regarding cross-
cutting reform areas.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.      In line with the pillars of the Honduras PRS and, in particular, the medium-term
priorities identified in the PRS-PR, the PRSC aimed to support Government efforts to:

    (i)   accelerate pro-poor growth, via support for reforms aimed at increasing
          competitiveness and maximizing the potential for new investment and
          employment creation for men and women in both urban and rural areas in the
          wake of new regional and international agreements, in particular, DR-CAFTA,
    (ii) increase the impact and efficiency of resources devoted to human development
          and social protection, with a focus on deconcentration of responsibilities for
          service provision and increased empowerment of beneficiaries of key services;
          and
    (iii) increase the medium- and long-term sustainability of poverty reduction
          initiatives through policy and institutional reforms geared to strengthening
          governance and public sector management and improving management of the
          environment, particularly in Honduras's extensive protected areas.

In addition, the PRSC aimed to support the Government's initiatives to systematize
consultation process around the poverty reduction strategy and strengthen monitoring and
evaluation at national and community levels.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)3

6.      Within the growth strategy contained in Honduras's PRS and PRS-PR, a main
emphasis concerned the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework, focusing
on sustained fiscal discipline. Maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework was



3With the exception of the energy sector, this summary (and subsequent evaluation) includes prior actions
supported by PRSC-I only.


                                                   8

an indispensable element of the successful implementation of the PRS and was therefore
included as a benchmark of the PRSC-I and subsequent PRSC operations.

7.      In addition to maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, the Government
prioritized the improvement of the national investment climate and competitiveness as a
principal means of breaking the cycle of low growth and high poverty. The PRSC
supported the Government in implementing reforms to ensure an appropriate regulatory
and policy environment for Honduran firms to enable them to take advantage of the trade
and investment opportunities offered by the DR-CAFTA free trade agreement.              In
particular, the Bank supported the passing of the administrative simplification law
aimed at reducing the regulations and administrative procedures for business start-ups
and registration.    Other areas of support to improve the investment climate and
competitiveness included the transport and telecommunications sectors as well as land
rights and access (see below).

8.      To effect improvements in the transport sector, the Government's planned
program aimed at increasing the efficiency, quality and security of the country's airports
and ports systems (Puerto Cortes, in particular); improving the maintenance of the road
network; strengthening sector regulation; and improving sectoral resource allocation in
line with a transport sector master plan. Specific measures included: (i) the amendment
of an airport concession contract and appointment of a public-private monitoring
committee, (ii) submission to congress of a port law, (iii) increased budgetary allocation
for maintenance of the national road network, and (iv) the development of a new
transport sector framework law.

9.      In the telecommunications sector, the Bank supported the Government by
developing a regulatory framework in favor of new investment by facilitating exit and
entry in the sector, with the overall aim of increasing private sector productivity. The
sector was previously plagued by poor service quality, inadequate coverage and
institutional irregularities (red tape and corruption).   The key actions in the sector
included: creating a telecom cabinet for sector policymaking; implementing a universal
access policy to significantly increase service coverage (especially in rural areas);
strengthening the sector regulatory agency; and repositioning the state telecom company
(HONDUTEL) to compete with private operators in the national and international call
markets.

10.     Given the critical importance of the energy sector as a contributing factor to the
deterioration in macroeconomic management, it is important to emphasize the PRSC
support in this area, even if no prior action was included in PRSC-I. Insufficient
generation capacity, high technical and commercial losses and persistent operative losses
in the state electricity company, ENEE, were among the chief challenges. To address
these, the Government proposed structural reorganization of ENEE. An important action,
which was to be supported by PRSC-II, was the separation of ENEE accounts for
generation, transmission, dispatch and distribution. These efforts stagnated, however,
because the necessary technical assistance contract had to be ratified by Congress, where
it was blocked.



                                           9

11.     The PRSC also supported Government efforts in improving land rights and
access. This included, inter alia, the approval of a property law; establishment of a
unified property registry; and strengthening and consolidation of the laws and
institutional arrangements for land regularization. These measures aimed to address
insecurity of land titles arising largely as a result of poorly enforced land rights owing to
a weak and uncoordinated set of land administration institutions and an unclear and
fragmented land policy.        The supported measures ultimately aimed at removing
constraints to raising rural productivity and household incomes.

12.     Support in the education sector focused on complementary reforms in three
inter-related areas--school decentralization, teacher management and resource
management--all of which aimed to ensure effective implementation of the Education
For All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Strategy. PRSC-I supported two Government
actions aimed at addressing fundamental problems in the education system, such as poor
accountability, high teacher absenteeism, and inadequate teaching and learning processes
in schools. The first related to the strengthening of community participation and school-
based management through the expansion of Local Education Development Associations
(ADELs), which provide a framework for increased parental involvement in school
management. The second supplementary action was the publication and dissemination of
the 2003 school census data, particularly teacher and student distributions as well as the
teacher payroll data. PRSC-I support to the education sector was part of the first
diagnostic phase of an overall education reform aimed at reducing considerable waste of
public funds, geographic misallocation of teachers, and poor teacher performance. A
second corrective phase and a third sustainability phase were also planned to be
supported by subsequent tranche releases.

13.     The challenges and supported actions in the health sector bear some resemblance
to those of the education sector. The quality of the health care system remained low, with
a large number of facilities failing to meet minimum licensing standards due to shortages
of personnel, basic materials, and equipment. Moreover, a significant number of the poor
(about 15 percent of the population) remained outside the effective coverage of the health
care system. The cost of bringing the quality of health care to acceptable standards and
extending coverage was to be covered by improvements in efficiency, particularly
through improved human resources management. A two-pronged plan was adopted
namely to, first, establish strong personnel information systems and, second, to address
identified rigidities, including the assignment of individuals to health units according to
established staffing norms.

14.     Poverty targeting and medium-term program budgeting. With the aim of
improving donor coordination and budget execution, the Government engaged in efforts
to shift donor assistance toward a programmatic basis. In particular, it aimed to introduce
a medium-term expenditure framework and facilitate the management of sector-wide
approaches (SWAPs) that would be coordinated by sector working groups. A new
programmatic budget was being developed on the basis of the Government spending
priorities articulated in the PRS.



                                              10

15.     Financial accountability and transparency.            The implementation of an
integrated financial management system (SIAFI) improved the Government's ability to
control and manage expenditures. SIAFI's usefulness was limited, however, by rigidities
in its format, a lack of comprehensive access to the system by all sectors resulting in
delays, and a failure to integrate SIAFI with other systems. The 2004 Budget Framework
Law aimed to address these challenges, by mandating the use of SIAFI in all central
government agencies.

16.     Support to civil service reform aimed at addressing two major challenges
plaguing civil service and human resources administration in Honduras: (1) the existence
of separate employment regimes, which provide extraordinary benefits to parts of the
public sector labor force, such as teachers and health workers, and which have led to
uncontrolled increases in the public wage bill and (2) the politicization of public
employment, which reduces the capacity of public institutions to deliver public services
efficiently. To address these problems, a Public Salary Law (2003) was introduced,
eliminating special regimes and restoring the Executive's control over public wages.
Legislation was also presented to Congress, which provided the basis for a professional
civil service.

17.     The PRSC also supported measures to reduce deforestation and develop
protected areas--partly on environmental grounds and partly because of the poverty-
reducing potential. The principal drivers of deforestation in Honduras are conversion of
forestlands for agriculture and livestock; unmanaged exploitation for domestic use (e.g.,
fuelwood); fires; and wasteful and illegal logging activity. The problem is magnified by
the limited effectiveness of the State Forestry Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR). At
the same time, and as pointed out in the PRS (2001), the sustainable use of forest
resources deserves priority attention on account of its potential contribution to economic
growth, employment generation, and reduction of poverty, especially in rural areas. The
PRSC supported measures to reform the legal, regulatory and institutional arrangements
in the forestry sector, with the objective of strengthening institutional capacity to protect
forests and manage them in economically rational ways.

18.      Monitoring and evaluation of the PRS. At the time of appraisal, Honduras had
a well-defined institutional framework containing clearly defined and properly
coordinated functions for implementing, monitoring and evaluating the PRS. This was
outlined in the amended Poverty Reduction Fund Law, which also established a
satisfactory mechanism for the tracking of HIPC resources. The challenge, however, was
the development of a system to monitor and evaluate the policy measures, projects and
indicators contemplated in the PRS. To assist the Government's capacity for monitoring
and evaluation of PRS implementation, the Bank (and the IDB) provided technical
support.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

19.      Preparation of PRSC-I began in January 2003 with a scoping mission.                         An
important message to the Government was that if the country moved ahead on needed
reforms at that time, it would become eligible for a variety of external assistance
programs, including the PRSC, PRGF, HIPC, and additional bilateral support. The
Government was largely receptive to this proposition and worked hard over the next 18
months to make progress on its reform program (for this and other reasons). PRSC-I was
appraised in April 2004 and approved in May 2004 shortly after the authorities had
reached agreement with the Fund over a new PRGF and completed its first PRS progress
report. Several key factors contributed to implementation performance, as detailed below.

20.      Strong government ownership and a well-designed operation were conducive
to program implementation. At the center of the operation was a detailed, 12-page
policy matrix of policy and institutional benchmarks and triggers covering 19 policy
themes.4 Each tranche had between 10 and 15 prior actions. The matrix, which enjoyed
strong support in Government and had been developed jointly with other development
partners, represented a summary of the reform program and was used as the main vehicle
for PRSC dialogue. A majority of the actions in the matrix had been proposed by the
Government, with the important exception of civil service reform. The level of detail at
each stage of operation was very high, suggesting that the authorities and the Bank had a
clear idea of the medium-term objectives of each of the broad range reforms that were
simultaneously pursued.5

21.      Preparation of the PRSC was exceptionally well-coordinated with other
external partners. Numerous consultations took place with the IMF on the amount,
timing, and contents of the operation, and a joint review was undertaken of the PRS-PR,
on which the PRSC operation was based. There was an extremely close relationship with
the IDB on the design of the policy benchmarks and in the design of investment
operations pertaining to the areas covered in the policy matrix. Several bilateral donors,
including DFID, SIDA, CIDA, and the German Financial Cooperation Agency, also
participated closely in the design of selected aspects of the PRSC. This approach was



4In addition to the 12 PRSC-I-related themes evaluated here, these included energy; nutrition and social
protection; water and sanitation; expenditure controls; internal and external audits; procurement;
consultation; and public information.
5While the complexity of the operational design conformed well to best practice at the time, such practice
has recently tended to favor a more simple design--with fewer policy areas, triggers, and outcome
indicators--with a particular emphasis on actions critical to achieving results as conditions for
disbursement (see `Good Practice Partnerships on Conditionality').


                                                  14

highly appreciated within the Government, in an aid environment which was, and to
some extent still is, characterized by fragmented and uncoordinated efforts.

22.     A strong link between the PRSC and the project portfolio contributed
positively to performance. The Bank project portfolio in Honduras was highly diverse
at the time, growing substantially from 13 to 22 projects over the FY2003-06 CAS period.
The PRSC provided an additional leverage to the Bank to support reform measures in
sectors where the Bank was already providing project assistance.           Project support
coincided with PRSC support in almost all of the policy areas supported in the PRSC,
including administrative simplification, transport, telecoms, land, education, health, water,
nutrition, public resources management, and forests. Notable exceptions were the energy
sector and support to civil service reform, where progress eventually stalled (though this
was not necessarily related to the lack of project involvement). The PRS-TAC project
contributed to the satisfactory implementation of the program by funding timely technical
assistance in critical areas (e.g., implementation of SIAFI; strengthening of the oversight
institution). The PRS-TAC steering committee, which included the Ministry of Finance
and the Presidency, gave particular support to fast-moving sectors and withdrew support
from slow reformers, and this helped to ensure a more effective implementation of reform
efforts.

23.     Strong analytical underpinnings and the related policy dialogue furthered
program objectives. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, 2003)
and Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR, 2004) identified a number of
strengths and weaknesses of Honduras's financial management and procurement systems.
While these reports provided sufficient comfort to proceed with the operation, the PRSC,
in turn, became the main vehicle for implementing their recommendations.               The
Development Policy Review (DPR, 2004) motivated reform efforts in education,
infrastructure, and good governance, while the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA,
2004) had highlighted the importance of reducing red tape in business regulation and
promoting private sector involvement in infrastructure. The operation also drew upon the
findings of the Public Expenditure Review (PER, 2001), emphasizing the importance of
attaining fiscal balance, public service delivery, public resources management, and
effectiveness of health and education programs. Finally, a Poverty Diagnostic (PD,
2001) pointed to room for improvement in education, health, and nutrition.

24.     The choice of a multiple-tranche instrument was appropriate, even if only
one tranche was disbursed. The PRSC instrument proved the most effective Bank
instrument for sustained dialogue on policy priorities and for assisting the Government to
address the challenge of reform implementation, as highlighted in the CAS Completion
Report (FY03-06). The associated policy dialogue lasted for a sustained period (and
more than a single disbursement would suggest), starting in 2003 and continuing to 2006.
Though the marginal returns of this dialogue were diminishing over time, eventually
leading to the official closure of the series, the Bank was able to support reform efforts
that were taking place after PRSCI was completed (more than half of PRSC-II triggers
were also achieved), through subsequent supervision/appraisal missions and the PRSC-
TAC.



                                           15

25.     Improvements in external economic environment contributed positively across
the board to an improved implementation of PRS measures in 2004 and 2005. During
this period, Honduras experienced high exports growth on the back of higher commodity
prices and increased maquila activity.      Foreign direct investment increased, with a
substantial share going to the maquila sector, as did inflows of remittances. These
developments raised the level of economic activity in Honduras and boosted fiscal
revenues, rendering it easier for the authorities to achieve their PRS spending targets.
The only major negative shock in the 2004-05 period was the hike in oil prices, which
kept the inflation rate above target and forced the authorities to make some compensatory
fiscal adjustments, including abandoning the automatic electricity tariff adjuster and
introducing fuel subsidies.

26.     The timing of the operation, though not under the control of the Bank, was
not ideal and this had consequences on the outcome of the PRSC series. PRSC-I
took effect in the third year of a four-year electoral cycle. At the risk of simplification,
the first year of a new administration in Honduras is typically negatively affected by
changes in key personnel, making it difficult to initiate a reform program (hence, the need
for a civil service reform). Similarly, the fourth year is often characterized by electoral
campaigning (which may even start earlier). To some extent, therefore, the prospect for
progress on key reform initiatives is greatest in the second and the third year of any
administration. The passage of the ports and telecoms laws was delayed in Congress
mainly on account of electoral considerations in the run-up to the presidential elections in
November 2005. The new Administration has taken a long time to define a program of
its own and this, combined with increasing macroeconomic pressures, delayed PRSC-II
and the PRSC series was subsequently closed.

27.     Incentives for accelerated program implementation diminished during 2005.
Apart from the improved fiscal performance (which reduced the immediate need for
budgetary support) and the emerging electoral campaign (which made legislative
measures increasingly difficult), the Government had considerably less to gain from the
international community proceeding with PRSC-II-supported reforms. IDA's shift to a
performance-based lending allocation system (CPIA) rendered the high-case CAS
scenario irrelevant and meant that achieving early approval of PRSC-II would not have
resulted in additional IDA assistance as originally envisaged.        Moreover, Honduras
reached the HIPC completion point in March 2005; qualified for an MCC program in
May 2005; ratified DR-CAFTA in August 2005; was on-track with its PRGF program
with the Fund; and experienced a strong increase in bilateral support. To the extent,
therefore, that the Government's reform drive was positively affected by the prospect of
financial support from the external community, this incentive fell gradually during 2005.
These developments could possibly also have reduced the reform drive of the incoming
administration.

28.     Risk assessment. The Bank was aware of the high degree of risk that pursuance
of the PRSC operation implied. While it was right to emphasize the risks of a fragile
political environment, these risks did not play out as expected.          The approaching



                                             16

presidential elections stalled the PRSC program, not because it derailed the
macroeconomic program, as suggested in the program document, but rather because of
the difficulty of passing legislative measures. The Government actually displayed a
surprising degree of fiscal discipline during 2005-06. The Bank team was right in
emphasizing opposition from interest groups as a risk, which clearly became a problem in
the education and health sectors, thereby hindering reform progress. Financial sector and
natural disaster risks were also highlighted, but did not materialize.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

29.     Design. During preparation, a set of performance indicators were identified.
These indicators were selected in agreement with Government counterparts and other
development partners through a highly participatory process. A total of 55 medium-term
outcome indicators (with associated targets) were identified for the PRSC series. Of
these, 22 indicators relate to thematic areas that were relevant for PRSC-I. Strong
emphasis was put on quantifiable performance indicators as only 5 of the 22 PRSC-I
indicators were qualitative. Medium-term targets were also identified, as this was a
programmatic series. These targets were, of course, beyond the scope of the 2004 PRSC-
I operation alone and would have required additional policy actions to be supported under
subsequent PRSC operations. Nevertheless, these targets are useful in assessing outcome
performance in the different policy areas supported by the PRSC, as detailed in section
3.2.

30.     Implementation. On balance, the monitoring and evaluation system could have
been more effectively designed by implementing a smaller set of monitoring indicators
selected on the basis of existing data collection mechanisms. At the time of the ICR, only
three quarters of the PRSC-I outcome indicators (16 of 22) had sufficient data to enable
an assessment of whether targets were attained (around half of them were). While most
indicators had clear targets, baseline values were also missing for several of the indicators
(12 of 22). The evaluation of outcome performance could therefore only rely to a certain
extent on the proposed performance indicators.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

31.     PRSC-I was designed to be the first of a series of three quick-disbursing
programmatic credits in support of the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy. However,
as the process of strategy implementation slowed down, the series was closed after the
first disbursement. It is important to stress, however, that the Bank has continued the
policy dialogue with the Government on the basis of the PRSC matrix even after the
formal closure of the PRSC series.

32.     The first PRSC series had established 11 triggers for PRSC-II that were scheduled
to be met by mid-2005. Only 5 of these triggers were achieved by September 2006,
according to the Simplified ICR for this operation (Report No. 33809-HO). At the time
of the ICR, a further two triggers had been met: (1) the Protected Areas Fund had been
created under a new Forestry Law and (2) the participatory program for PRS monitoring
has been designed and is in implementation as social monitoring initiatives. The four


                                           17

triggers that have still not been achieved include the legislative approval of the General
Ports Law and of the Civil Service Law. Both laws continue to face stiff political
resistance, are unlikely to get passed and have effectively become redundant. Further
progress within those two areas is expected to be possible within the framework of
existing legislation.      The other two unmet triggers refer to the adoption and
implementation of a program to improve the performance of the public electricity utility
(ENEE) and the reorganization of the departmental offices in the education ministry. The
new authorities have indicated that the original formulation of the last two triggers no
longer coincide with current government priorities.

33.     In light of these problems, a new non-programmatic development policy credit is
currently being considered to be presented to the Board before the end of the calendar
year 2008. The design of the new operation has been greatly simplified to reflect the
priorities of the new government. It has only 7 thematic areas, substantially fewer
program triggers and outcome indicators, and the credit amount has been reduced
accordingly to US$20 million. The focus has been revised toward the adoption of
corrective actions needed to restore the fiscal framework with particular emphasis on
actions related to teachers' salaries and badly targeted electricity subsidies. All of the
thematic areas of the new operation reflect a continuation of the policy reforms pursued
in the previous series, including public sector professionalization, public financial
management and procurement, telecommunications, energy, education, and forest
protection.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

34.     Most of the 12 thematic areas supported by PRSC-I continue to be highly relevant
to current priorities, as reflected in the current Country Assistance Strategy for Honduras.
This is also evidenced by the thematic focus of the proposed development policy credit,
which is closely aligned with the previous PRSC-I series, as mentioned above. With the
risk of anticipating some of the conclusions of the subsequent section, it is worth
emphasizing the continued relevance of the PRSC-I-supported themes in more detail here.

35.     Macroeconomic stability returned to the forefront of the country dialogue during
2007 due to a weaker policy stance, combined with less favorable trends in the external
environment.     The absence of an adequate legal and regulatory framework in the
transport sector continues to be of concern. While substantial progress has been realized
in telecommunications, further reforms continue to be necessary. While advancements
have been made in improving security of access to land, continuous government efforts
are imperative.     The education and health sectors, on the other hand, continue to
constitute significant challenges, particularly in terms of controlling the wage bill and the
related areas of institutional strengthening and human resources management. A possible
development policy credit will follow up on these themes along with a new investment
project.   This will be supported by a public expenditure tracking survey and an
institutional governance review, which also covers the health sector. The CAS is also



                                               18

supportive of continued support to sector-wide approaches, which have yet to take off
fully in Honduras. The planned development policy credit will continue to provide
support in the areas of financial accountability, civil service professionalization, and
forestry and protected areas.        Finally, the extended PRS-TAC will support poverty
monitoring and evaluation, public financial management, amongst others.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

36.     While stagnant at the time of appraisal, poverty fell significantly during the period
of PRSC-I implementation. The proportion of Hondurans living below the poverty line
reduced from 71.2 percent in 2005 to 68.0 percent in 2007 and extreme poverty declined
substantially from 53.4 to 42.9 in this period.6 The corresponding increase in household
incomes coincided with a period of unusually high economic growth (see para 37).
Although a favorable external environment has an important role in this achievement, the
reform measures supported by the PRSC may also have contributed positively to growth
and poverty reduction as explained in this section.

37.     Honduras maintained an adequate macroeconomic framework from 2004 until
mid-2006 when a weakened policy stance and a deteriorating external environment
started to lead the economy towards an unstable trajectory, suggesting a moderately
unsatisfactory rating.

38.     The economy generally benefited from a benign external environment throughout
the 2004-07 period. The economy has grown by around six percent over the past five
years, almost twice as fast as in 2001-02, owing to increased growth in international trade
and the US economy after 2001.               This, among others, boosted Honduran wage
remittances, which soared from around 10.3 percent of GDP in 2003 to 20.9 percent in
2007. Meanwhile, external public debt fell from 69.2 percent of GDP in 2004 to an
estimated 17 percent at the end of 2007. This reflects not only improved fiscal policy,
but also, more importantly, the implementation of several debt relief initiatives, as
Honduras reached HIPC Completion point in April 2005 and became eligible for
subsequent assistance provided by the World Bank, IMF and IDB under the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The CAFTA-DR agreement, which came into effect in
April 2006, also has helped to raise Honduras's attractiveness to private investors.

INE, in May 2005 and 2007.

 39.       Macroeconomic policy remained broadly on track during the first two of the three
 years under the PRGF arrangement (February 2004), as reflected in the favorable
 evolution of some of the key macroeconomic indicators. Inflation stayed in single-digits
 and fell gradually; the external current account deficit was on a declining trend; and the
 combined public sector fiscal deficit declined substantially. In 2006, however, the policy
 stance began to weaken. On the fiscal side, these weaknesses related to an increase in the
 public wage bill and a deterioration in the public enterprise balance, particularly in the
 electricity utility, ENEE, and the state-owned telecoms company, HONDUTEL. In
 regard to public sector wages, the Government had succeeded in containing wage
 pressures with the enactment of the public sector pay framework legislation in 2003,
 which PRSC-I supported (see paragraphs 70-72).                The August 2006 teacher wage
 agreement, however, exploited a sunset clause in the framework legislation and teacher
 salaries are projected to double in nominal terms over the next three years, raising the
 overall public wage bill by between 0.8 and 1.3 percent of GDP over the medium term.
 The monetary stance was also loosened during 2006, as the Central Bank of Honduras
 reduced the short-term policy interest rate from 7.0 to 6.0. This pro-cyclical monetary
 easing led to rapid credit growth, which fueled a strong increase in imports, to a
 worsening external balance, and contributing to higher inflation (in addition to higher
 international food and fuel prices).

 40.       Administrative simplification of business regulation. This component is rated
 highly satisfactory as Honduras has made substantial progress in the simplification of
 administrative procedures for businesses. The time needed for starting a firm fell from
 62 days in 2003 to 21 days in 2007, well below the target of 43 days and about a third of
 the time needed in the average Latin American country (68 days).                         With this
 improvement, Honduras is currently ranked 2nd in Latin America on this Doing Business
 (DB) indicator. The cost and minimum capital of starting a business also fell (see table


                                                      20

3). Reductions in red tape had a positive impact on the number of new companies
formalized, which increased from 700 in 2006 to more than 5,000 in 2007 in Tegucigalpa
and San Pedro Sula.

     Source: World Bank, Doing Business 2008.

41.     Honduras also made progress in the area of regulating existing businesses. The
DB index of the time for `dealing with licenses' fell from 184 to 125 days between 2005
and 2007--the fastest in the region (average: 238 days). This includes reductions in the
time needed to register property (from 25 days to 1 day) and to register with the social
security administration (from 7 days to 1 day). Additional work is ongoing, with support
from IDA and IFC, to reduce the time for issuing construction permits in several
important municipalities, including the opening of one-stop business shops planned for
February 2008.

42.     With respect to competition policy, the new Competition Commission is now
fully operational, having issued 28 competition judgments or opinions regarding relevant
draft laws during its first year of operations and prepared 3 sectoral studies. Partly as a
result of this, Honduras's ranking improved from 105 to 84 (between 2006 and 2007) as
measured in the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index that relates to
effectiveness of anti-trust policies.

43.     Several factors explain the substantial progress in this area. This includes the two
actions supported by PRSC-I, namely (1) the legal and institutional framework created by
the Administrative Simplification Law (2002) and (2) the creation of the Administrative
Simplification Committee (in 2005) to coordinate all initiatives. Moreover, the passing
of a Competition Law (2005), aimed at reducing collusive practices and facilitating the
entry and exit of firms, was identified as a PRSC-II trigger. Other contributing factors
were the technical support offered by the Bank through the Trade Facilitation and
Productivity Improvement Project (effective in 2004), as well as the technical assistance
of the IFC, particularly at the municipal level.

44.     The transport sector outcome is rated moderately satisfactory.              Actions
supported under PRSC-I have made a positive impact on the reduction of high transport
costs and improved quality of services. These actions focused on specific aspects of the
transport network, including operational improvements of the key road trade corridors
and the functioning of the airports and port system, especially in Puerto Cortes. Draft
legislation, clarifying institutional arrangements for the management of Puerto Cortes and
providing for private participation, met with opposition in Congress, largely due to
resistance from the business community. PRSC-I actions have been supported by new,
mostly public, investments, in support of the goal of providing infrastructure
commensurate with the needs for enhanced competitiveness. The policy framework


                                             21

within the roads sector is broadly agreed and is being consistently implemented with the
support of external partners. Some positive actions have been taken within the ports
sector, but there has been no consistent application of an appropriate sector strategy. The
most serious obstacle to progress, however, has been the absence of progress in attaining
the medium-term goal of putting in place an adequate legal and regulatory framework.

45.     In 2004, in a bid to improve the service quality and infrastructure in the airports,
Congress approved an amendment to an existing 20-year concession contract granted to a
US-based consortium in 2000 (the PRSC-I trigger). The concessions have since been
transferred to a Honduran company and this helped speed up the process of upgrading the
airport. Terminal buildings have been significantly improved, particularly in Tegucigalpa
and La Ceiba, although the repair of runways and steps relating to air safety has been left
aside (see PER, 2008).

46.     Neither of the three outcome targets in this thematic sectors were fully met and
this would have required follow-up actions beyond PRSC-I. First, and most importantly,
a satisfactory legal framework and development strategy to support effective multi-model
transport and implementation is yet to be developed.              The second objective--
improvement in handling costs, turnaround times and service quality at Puerto Cortes--
has been partially achieved. In spite of the lack of action regarding the passage of a new
Ports Law (identified as a PRSCII trigger), sector performance has improved and security
certification for US markets has been achieved.       To illustrate, Puerto Cortes now has
customs officers from five different countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Guatemala and the US) who are authorized to clear domestic cargo to all these
destinations. The Government has recognized the need for additional investment and is
lining up funding through the Central America Bank for Regional Integration. Private
sector participation is being expanded very cautiously. Third, the outcome target of
adequately maintaining at least 8,842 km of road was not met. Although progress has
been achieved and sustained since 2004, about 7,250 kilometers were under regular
maintenance at the end of 2007, representing 55% of the network. Finally, on a positive
note, some 70 road maintenance micro enterprises have been established, operating under
one-year government funded contracts (compared to an objective of 60 enterprises at the
time of a possible PRSC-III operation) covering about 2,870 kilometers of the paved road
network.

47.     The progress in the telecommunications sector since 2004 has been satisfactory
as coverage expanded, competition increased, and prices fell--contributing positively to
private sector productivity. To guide reform efforts, the authorities developed a sector
strategy and formed a telecommunications cabinet to oversee and implement it. The
policy recognized the complementary role of the private sector and the lack of
transparency with public contracting at the state-owned operator, HONDUTEL.

48.     The reform process was initiated by the award of a second cellular license to
MEGATEL to compete against the incumbent CELTEL (both companies are
international subsidiaries). This action partly explains the increase in cellular phone lines
from 326,000 in 2002 to 2.3 million users in 2006. Further, to increase fixed line access,



                                             22

the Government promoted the `Telephones for All' program by awarding 27
`commercialization' contracts to private operators to compete with the previous state
monopoly, HONDUTEL. In three years, these companies installed around 234,000 new
fixed lines contributing substantially to the increase in coverage from 335,000 lines in
2003 to 708,000 in 2006. This exceeds the PRSC target of 150,000 new lines (even when
excluding cell lines). The concurrent expansion in HONDUTEL lines was supported by
a modernization process of replacing outdated technologies. Moreover, in December
2005 the exclusivity of HONDUTEL over long distance and international services
expired, opening this service to competition for the two cellular phone operators. As a
result, the price of a call to the USA fell from 85 to 10 US cents a minute between 2005
and 2007. The PRSC outcome target of reducing this price by 50 percent was attained.

49.     Despite these achievements, the sector continues to face a number of challenges.
The most important challenge is the pending congressional approval of a new Telecom
Law, which would allow the `Telephone for All' operators to provide international
service, strengthen and increase the independence of CONATEL (the telecom regulator),
and create a fund to promote telecom investments in isolated and poor areas. The other
major obstacle is the lack of reform at HONDUTEL, which needs to adapt to the new
market conditions and adopt a more transparent governance structure that would prevent
accusations of unbilled traffic (also known as gray traffic). The resulting losses of
revenues in HONDUTEL is a major fiscal challenge that would require an in-depth
analysis and action plan, which could be facilitated through the identification of a suitable
private partner.

50.     The land rights and access component is rated moderately satisfactory. The
passing of the Property Law (2004)--including the integration of cadastre and registry
information, the creation of the Property Institute, and the development of the integrated
national registry-cadastre system--put Honduras ahead of many countries in the region
and the developing world, with respect to land administration and property rights. On the
other hand, progress on the regularization program has been slow and more could have
been achieved had the Government given consistent support to the program.

51.     The 2004 Property Law consolidated and systematized the legal and institutional
framework for land administration in Honduras, including land regularization processes.
Reflecting international best practice, the Law integrated cadastre administration and real
estate property under the new property institute (Instituto de la Propiedad). The Law has
allowed the Government to make progress in the development of the integrated national
registry-cadastre system (SURE), which is contributing to more efficient property right
titling and registration across the country. The Law, however, remains without
regulations that should help clarify certain ambiguities and overlaps, particularly
regarding the responsibilities of the property institute vis-à-vis agencies such as the
National Agrarian Institute (INA). Certain articles of the Law require further dialogue,
including those regarding regularization of ethnic lands.

52.     The design of the Regularization Program was very comprehensive and included
surveying, titling and registering land rights of populations on national lands and of



                                            23

indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups. The Program, however, has suffered delays due
to the political cycle, lack of clarity and consensus regarding some regularization
processes, and lack of implementation capacity.                    As a result, progress on the
regularization program has been slow.

53.      Performance assessment against the monitoring indicators identified in the PRSC
Program Document was challenging, since targets were overly ambitious and in many
cases the suggested indicators have not been monitored. Nevertheless, as of December
2007, 135,356 land parcels (45 percent by women) had been registered under folio real
compared with the target of 750,000 land parcels by end-2006. Due to several factors,
including opposition from NGOs, little progress has been made regarding the
demarcation of indigenous communal land. The PRSC also stipulated a target of 25,000
regularized forest land parcels and, although final data was not available, preliminary
field work suggests that this target has indeed been achieved.

54.      The Government has not developed a comprehensive national land policy.
However, since early 2007, it has scaled up at the national level a relatively successful
pilot program for decentralized land access and supporting services for poor farmers
developed initially with IDA support. The pilot Land Access Program (PACTA) was
implemented between 2001 and 2006, allowing 991 poor families to purchase land and
establish rural enterprises. In total, 2,398 hectares of land were acquired by these
beneficiaries. To continue the Program, the Government has allocated 16 million
Lempiras per year over the next three years.

55.      Education sector outcomes under the PRSC have been moderately
unsatisfactory.         Although community participation and school-based management
improved substantially, no significant progress was registered in the more critical area of
institutional strengthening.

56.      Community participation was reinforced through support to PROHECO schools
and Local Education Development Associations (ADELs).7 PROHECO schools were
successful in mobilizing parents in rural areas that previously lacked school coverage and
in promoting greater accountability of teachers. The ADEL, a model of school
governance for rural communities where schools services were already provided by the
public schools, had lower effectiveness because of a more limited community
involvement in key decisions. The ADEL did not have any role in the selection and
payment of teachers, which was a key factor to increase teacher accountability to citizens
in the PROHECO model.8 The Zelaya administration has continued to advocate a role



7The school board of a PROHECO school is composed only by parents who share roles of president,
treasurer, secretary, auditor, and support members. Their main functions are to select and pay teachers;
promote parental involvement in schools; monitor teacher and student attendance and performance; manage
funds for non-durable school materials; and manage funds for implementation of school improvement
activities in the school board, Proyecto Educativo de Centro (PEC).
8The member composition of the ADEL includes the principal, teachers, parents and students, and the
ADEL. The main functions of the ADEL include promoting parental involvement in school; monitoring
teacher and student attendance and performance; managing funds for non-durable school materials; and


                                                    24

for parents and communities in schools through their active involvement in the first
assessment of teacher attendance in early 2007.

57.     The Government initially supported ADELs, but from 2006 onwards--and
partially explained by the nationwide application of Matrícula Grátis 9 in 2006--it
focused entirely on supporting PROHECO schools.10 A total of 3,750 ADELs were in
place by the time of the ICR compared to around 2,700 at appraisal, but less than the
PRSC outcome target of 5,000. By mid-2005, virtually all ADELs (98 percent) received
fund transfers, implying compliance of the relevant PRSC-II trigger. At the same time,
Honduras was also on track in complying with another trigger: legal establishment
("personería jurídica") of 50 percent of the ADELs (45 percent in May 2005). However,
owing to budget constraints, the Government decided to cut financial support for the
ADELs in the 2006 Budget. To its credit, the Government continued to promote the roll-
out of PROHECO schools, including financial support. By the end of 2006, PROHECO
covered more than 2,100 schools (against 1,081 in 2002), with 111,000 students (8
percent of enrollment) and around 4,200 teachers.

58.     Community-based school management was also strengthened through the
implementation of school networks in rural areas, which rose from around 33 in 2004 to
100 in 2008. The networks are typically comprised of 10-12 schools, at all levels, which
jointly participate in developing educational processes relevant and culturally appropriate
to the schools in the network. This effort involves teachers, parents, and the communities.
This model is a strategy of the Ministry of Education to reduce the presence of single
teacher multi-grade schools in rural areas (another outcome indicator, but no data was
available).

59.     Progress in the institutional strengthening component has been rather limited.
This assessment reflects a comparison of the expected achievement in the period 2003-07
with what was actually achieved.             An important observation in this respect is that
Honduras today continues to struggle with the same challenges of inaccurate human
resources information and unreliable education statistics that had prompted the PRSC-
supported reforms five years earlier. Although the Zelaya administration has displayed a
genuine interest and commitment to making progress in this area, e.g. a Teacher Census
and Audit of Post is currently under way, much work still remains. To illustrate, the
share of teachers working in schools to which they have been formally assigned was 81
percent in 2008 compared to a PRSC-I target of 90 percent.

60.     Although the Ministry of Education complied with the two trigger conditions
relating to the publication on its website of the 2003 school census data and payroll by
department in the human resources information system (SIARHD), the latter remains



managing funds for implementation of school improvement activities in the Proyecto Educativo de Centro
(PEC).
9Through the Matrícula Gratis initiative, transfers are made to schools instead of money being collected
through matriculation charges.
10By mid 2007 some ADELs started to receive transfers for their Proyecto Educativo de Centro (PEC).


                                                 25

unreliable. The MOE also approved regulation, which allocates key responsibilities for
planning, resource management, and technical/pedagogical supervision, to the
departmental level. However, departmental offices are not functioning accordingly and
the SIARHD is not kept up to date on a real time basis. Further, due to lack of controls at
the school and departmental level, there have been inconsistencies between the
information in SIARHD and the real allocation of teachers to schools, and this has
negative implications for the payroll. As a corrective measure, since early 2007 the
Government has been conducting a nationwide teacher census and post audit, which is
expected to be completed by July 2008.         Once completed, the SIARHD will have
accurate information on the percentage of teachers who work in schools where they have
been formally assigned by the department director (an outcome target).

61.     The actual number of days that teachers worked in schools improved in 2007 after
a dismal performance in 2006. At appraisal, it was estimated that students had 110 days
out of the official 200 days school calendar. In 2006, mostly due to teacher strikes, the
estimated average days of classes had decreased to 72. In 2007 the official estimate
indicates 170 days of classes, which would be consistent with the reduced number of
strikes in 2007. Finally, there are substantial delays and inaccuracies in the reporting of
educational statistics from the departmental offices to the MoE. As a consequence, there
is a lack of official information on key educational parameters for the years covered by
the PRSC.

62.     The outcome of the actions supported in the health sector was moderately
unsatisfactory, as progress in improving personnel information systems and an M&E
system for a basic health care package was outshadowed by the reversal on one of the
PRSC-I triggers related to transfer of ministry personnel.

63.     The Ministry of Health (MOH) made good progress on the diagnostic part of the
proposed measures to improve efficiency and on expanding coverage.               Personnel
information systems to identify the functional assignment of each staff member were
improved. As of July 2005, post audits had been completed for 100 percent of MOH
staff, implying attainment of one of the PRSC-II benchmarks.           A monitoring and
evaluation system for the Basic Health Care package program, another PRSC-II
benchmark, also became fully functional. Moreover, MOH signed 26 contracts with
qualified NGOs to deliver the health care package, covering 290,000 beneficiaries. This
(spending) measure aimed to extend effective coverage of the health system to hard-to-
reach rural areas.

64.     The MOH missed an important opportunity to reap efficiency gains by failing to
enforce an important resolution that it had itself issued. To finance improvements in
quality and extension of coverage, it was critical that MOH made effective use of the
improvements in information systems.        The PRSC supported one such measure--a
resolution issued by the Minister of Health prohibiting the transfer of ministry personnel
without the authorization of departmental and hospital directors. This resolution was
passed, but not strictly and consistently enforced. This situation may be explained by the
change in sector management that took place after the resolution was issued (the health



                                             26

minister was replaced, as well as the head of the Planning and Management Unit), which
may have disrupted continuity in sector policies. Moreover, around 3,000 health workers
were hired during this period without proper contracts. In mid-2006, the Government
replaced the health minister and addressed the issue of the 3,000 workers by formally
contracting them and paying them for the months they worked and then terminating their
contracts With this change in leadership, the Ministry tried to regulate and monitor the
placement of health workers by establishing a payroll mechanism whereby workers have
to be confirmed to report to their assigned work place; unexplained absence from the
workplace for three straight days would result in non-payment. It is not clear how well
this system has been functioning, although there are still some anecdotal reports of health
workers working in a different regional health department yet receiving a salary from
another regional health department.

65.     The outcome target--that at least 90 percent of health ministry staff work in the
facilities to which they have been assigned--is unlikely to have been attained. At the
time of the ICR, there was still no official data to make this assessment. A MOH survey
was reportedly conducted in 2006, but the results were not made public. Anecdotal
evidence, however, suggests that the target has still not been attained.         A public
expenditure tracking survey, supported by the Bank, aims to fill this important
information gap, at least for doctors and nurses. Results are expected in early 2009.

66.     Poverty targeting and medium-term budgeting. The outcome of this area of
support is rated moderately unsatisfactory as limited progress has been made in
developing sector-wide approaches (SWAPs).

67.     Honduras has yet to put in place a full-fledged SWAP. During the Maduro
administration, efforts were made to develop sector plans in the key PRS sectors,
including education, health, agriculture, and water and sanitation. For the most part,
these lacked the operational arrangements, monitorable results, and sector expenditure
frameworks needed to translate the plans into working tools for Government and external
partners. Consequently, the sector plans have yet to have any significant role in decision-
making and have enjoyed limited appropriation by the incoming administration of
President Zelaya. The Strategic Plan for Water and Sanitation (PEMAPS)--with a clear
sector vision, operational and financial plan, prepared under the Maduro administration,
and finally approved under President Zelaya--is the notable exception. The Education
For All (EFA) initiative, supported by twelve external partners, five of whom finance a
pooled fund executed by the Ministry of Education, constitutes best-practice in donor
harmonization and alignment at the sector level in Honduras. In other sectors, including
the education sector, projects continue to be prepared without foundation in a sector
strategy and--all too often--in isolation from other externally financed initiatives. This
has resulted in a proliferation of pilot initiatives, many of which lack a permanent
institutional framework.

68.     Improvements in the policy alignment of external assistance will largely depend
on the Government's ability to build consensus around operational sector strategies. In
late 2006, the Government issued new instructions establishing seven sector and three



                                           27

cross-cutting working groups, expanding membership to include civil society, and
providing guidelines for the development of sector strategies, multi-year sector
expenditure plans, and supporting results-based monitoring frameworks. Development
and implementation of sector plans, building on those already in place and aligned with
the PRS, give the sector working groups a purpose, and can provide a framework for
policy dialogue and operational coordination.

69.     The medium-term outcome target that `100% of poverty-reduction expenditures
are tracked in SIAFI and incorporated in the medium-term programmatic budget' has
largely been achieved.11 All government-financed poverty spending is tagged, can be
monitored in SIAFI, and are reported in the budget. This is also the case for PRS
spending financed by external loans or credits, although grant-funded projects may not
always be adequately recorded.

70.     The Financial Accountability and Transparency component is rated
satisfactory. Honduras, with technical support from the Bank and the IDB, has made
significant progress with respect to the Public Financial Management (PFM) reform
program that was launched in early 2004. Important advances to date include (i) the
passage of a comprehensive Financial Management Law and its regulations; (ii)
improved budget classification and formats; (iii) technical upgrades to the Government's
integrated financial system, SIAFI, that increased its programmatic functionality and
expanded the system's coverage across the central government; (iv) improved and
functioning treasury operations; (v) the production of the first government financial
report prepared by the Tribunal Superior de Cuentas (TSC) together with the
promulgation of new regulations for external audits by the TSC; (vi) new internal audit
standards and regulations; and (vii) the presentation of a multi-annual budget to Congress
with overall fiscal and poverty-reducing targets. The two outcome targets of PRSC-I--a
strong legal framework to support PFM and improved government management
information systems--have been achieved, as explained below.

71.     The establishment of a legal framework to support PFM reform through the SIAFI
Law (2004) was a major achievement as it modernized the roles, responsibilities, and
functions of several directorates in the Ministry of Finance and formalized the use of
SIAFI to manage all budget expenditure transactions. The law was further modified and
expanded to eventually form the basis of the 2004 Organic Budget Law, which provided
Honduras with a modern legal framework for all PFM operations, including budget
management, treasury operations, public credit investment, and the adoption of
international standards for accounting and fiscal reporting.

72.     The functionality and reliability of government information systems have
improved in recent years, leading to greater transparency in the allocation and use of
budgetary resources. As of 2006, SIAFI has been operating in all central government
ministries/agencies and a number of decentralized and de-concentrated agencies, ensuring



11This outcome target was, to some degree, inappropriate or overly ambitious, if interpreted in a strict
sense. The important point for the evaluation, though, is that the target was met `in spirit if not in metric'.


                                                   28

more reliable financial administration information.            Financial and budget reports
produced by the Government still present data in aggregated form, however, which limits
their usefulness and information content to analysts. Financial reporting on government
expenditure and programs have improved considerably in the past two years--financial
reports generated by SIAFI are primarily budget execution reports and cash flow
statements.     More information regarding government operations, including debt
management and treasury information, is available and published on the websites of the
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Notwithstanding these improvements, the
Government could attempt to improve the timeliness of publication and posting of
information.

73.     Efforts to professionalize the civil service stalled, implying an unsatisfactory
outcome. Presentation of a civil service law to Congress was identified as a trigger for
PRSC-I and passage of the law as a trigger for PRSC-II. Although the legislation was
submitted, there was limited political commitment from Government and within
Congress, largely because the establishment of a professional civil service would run
counter to the interests of the political parties by limiting the scope for rewarding political
activists with appointments following changes in administration. Moreover, the 2006
wage agreement with the teachers' union exploited a sunset clause in the framework
legislation that allowed for substantial pay increases to teachers.

74.     As a result of the lack of progress, the most important issues and challenges
facing Honduras in the area of public management, as outlined in the PRSC-I document,
remained valid at the time of the ICR. These challenges refer to the need for (i) restoring
government control over salary and wage policies, (ii) reviewing the macro-structure of
the public sector to clarify the roles among various agencies and focus on enhancing
overall government effectiveness in delivering public services, and (iii) establishing a
new normative and institutional framework for public employment that limits political
influence, promotes a merit-based civil service and reduces labor turnover in critical
functions of the Government.

75.     In recognition that the prospects for passing the necessary legislative measures in
Congress are limited, the current strategy of the Zelaya administration is to implement a
professionalization process through administrative means. The Government has put
together an alternative set of actions, to be supported by the planned development policy
credit, which would provide the necessary elements for advancing the implementation of
the civil service reform agenda, while building consensus around new legislation among
the relevant stakeholders.

76.     Forestry and protected areas development. The outcome of PRSC-supported
reform measures is rated satisfactory (even if progress took longer than anticipated).
The two major achievements in this area include: (i) the establishment of a Protected
Areas Trust Fund with an adequate initial endowment, and (ii) the approval of a new
General Forestry Law in 2007.




                                             29

77.    The previous Administration established the Honduran Fund for Protected Areas
(FHCAP) through an Executive Order, with an initial endowment of US$3 million, and
made some progress in establishing the Fund's Board of Directors and in preparing its
technical regulations.    The Zelaya Administration has made further progress in
consolidating the sustainable establishment of protected areas through the creation of the
Honduran Foundation for Conservation and Nature (FHCN), which replaced FHCAP,
including the approval and publication of adequate statutes. It has also made good
progress in preparing and reaching consensus with key actors on the operating regulations
of the Foundation, including adequate provisions for professional management of the
FHCN. The FHCN corrected various technical deficiencies of the FHCAP and has a
governance structure that provides equal weight to governmental and non-governmental
representatives. While the FHCN statutes were published in July 2007 and progress was
made toward operationalizing the Fund, it still remains without a Director and operational
procedures.

78.    In September 2007--after public discussions that lasted for three Presidential
terms--a new General Forestry Law was approved by the Honduras National Congress.
The law remains to be fully regulated and applied. The law aims to raise the profile of
forestry issues, recognizing forestry as a separate sector; revitalize the state forestry
authority; reactivate the Social Forestry System; provide incentives for sound forest
management and conservation; and increase the effectiveness of forest protection. In
addition, the Government also has advanced in drawing up and agreeing on a sound,
updated Forestry and Protected Area Policy framework, which includes clear policies for
enhanced sustainable management of forestry and PA resources, institutional roles, and
budgetary structure and allocations for the State Forestry Corporation (which is
undergoing various reforms).

79.    The monitoring and evaluation component is rated satisfactory. Honduras
made good progress on several fronts, including (i) regular submission of Annual
Progress Reports (APRs), (ii) inclusion of PRS indicators in the results-based
management system (SIERP), (iii) preparation of several relevant poverty and social
impact assessments (PSIA), and (iv) initiating the use of community score cards and
social audits.

80.    Since appraisal, the authorities have prepared an additional three APRs on the
implementation of the PRS (2001) thereby attaining the relevant outcome objective. The
first APR, discussed at the IMF and World Bank Boards in February 2004, played a
pivotal role in leveraging PRGF and PRSC support. Presentation of a second APR, with
detailed information of PRS spending by program, source and economic classification,
constituted a PRSC-II trigger, which the authorities achieved in March 2005. The third
and the fourth APR were submitted jointly and discussed at the Boards in July 2007,
implying a slight delay in processing the third APR owing to the change of administration.

81.    In 2004, the authorities introduced a PRS Information System (SIERP) as a
framework for compiling data on PRS global and intermediate indicators. The system
was intended to provide access to regularly updated information, with some information



                                            30

disaggregated geographically to allow regional monitoring of the PRS. In 2006, the
Government introduced a results-based management system used to set sector and agency
level institutional targets and monitor performance across the entire public sector. While
SIERP has proven very successful in holding public offices accountable, some of the
original objectives of the system lost emphasis in the process, notably regional PRS
monitoring, which is still not taking place. Initially, there were also concerns that
progress was too slow in terms of integrating SIERP with the PRS. In 2007, however,
PRS indicators were finally included in the results-based management system, marking
the first time that a link was established between the PRS and an operational planning or
decision-making process. The next important steps in integrating the PRS with agency
level planning and budgeting would be to include a set of PRS intermediate indicators,
establish sector goals based on those of the PRS, and consolidate targets with those used
for budget monitoring in SIAFI.

82.       While SIERP is a potentially powerful tool for the disclosure of information on
progress in PRS, the quality and timeliness of information available depends on
administrative information systems and surveys, which are generally weak. This is
particularly so in the health and education sectors that absorb a substantial share of
poverty spending, as evidenced by the data gaps and inconsistencies in these sectors. In
this context, the lack of attention given to support of administrative statistics systems
across the Bank's portfolio, including the PRSC, represents a missed opportunity.
Household data, particularly those collected in the Living Standards Measurement Survey
(LSMS) and the Demographic and Health Survey, constitute a more accurate source of
information on the poverty situation. The 2004 LSMS was supported by the Bank, as
envisaged in the PRSC, and formed the basis of several poverty and social impact
assessments on key policies issues, including the impact of tax reforms, the rise in oil
prices, and the beneficiary incidence of spending.

83.       In line with the principle of promoting greater ownership and accountability
around poverty strategies, Honduras has also been successful in piloting participatory
evaluation mechanisms whereby users evaluate the quality, impact and transparency with
which public services are delivered.                 These mechanisms are often referred to as
scorecards.       Under PRSC I, pilots using a community scorecard mechanism in the
education and health sectors were undertaken.12 The authorities are currently in the



12These pilots have been evaluated and the Ministries of Education and Health have provided UNAT with
the list of clinics and schools for scaling up the scorecard initiative. Also, UNAT met with INE to re-
establish a plan for scaling up the scorecards initiative in (i) all the clinicas maternos infantiles and (ii) all
PROHECO schools in 2 departments. INE had advanced with the definition of the sample, and INE and
UNAT have provided a timeline of actions to comply with this trigger. This includes a copy of the sample
for both sectors, an implementation plan, an agreement with both ministries to publish the results of the
scorecard exercises, and a list of measures taken to incorporate the results of the earlier pilot in the
education sector. In addition, discussions on how best to use this feedback with the line ministries are
being initiated and the idea of establishing service benchmarks in five sectors has emerged. The aim of this
initiative is to improve the quality and responsiveness of key public services, as well as foster a more
results-based approach to assessing services.

process of scaling up the scorecard initiative. The Government is also paying increasing
attention to social monitoring of PRS implementation. During 2006, the Government
began work on a social audit methodology, linking social monitoring efforts to those of
the planning and oversight agencies.           The Government has agreed to assign PRS
resources to support these initiatives.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating. Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

84.     This rating reflects a combination of the high relevance of program objectives and
a mixed outcome performance with predominantly satisfactory outcomes. In summary,
outcome was considered highly satisfactory in two of the 12 areas (administrative
simplification and telecommunications), satisfactory in three areas (financial
accountability, protected areas and PRS M&E) and moderately satisfactory in transport,
land rights and health.       On the other hand, performance was deemed moderately
unsatisfactory in the education sector and poverty targeting (SWAPs) and unsatisfactory
in civil service professionalization.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts. (if any, where not previously
covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

85.     The specific actions supported by PRSC-I are likely to have overall positive
poverty and social impacts and there was limited evidence to the contrary. Although, no
specific Poverty and Social Impact Assessments were conducted to evaluate the impact of
the PRSC-supported government reforms, the available evidence supports the finding of a
positive or neutral impact.

86.     As explained in section 3.1, Honduras has experienced high economic growth in
recent years and poverty has fallen due to higher household incomes. Reductions in
extreme poverty, especially in the urban areas, was particularly pronounced.                 This
represents important progress given that one of the key objectives of the PRSC was to
accelerate pro-poor growth in Honduras. On the other hand, the current growth pattern
also shows tendencies of a rise in inequality, particularly an increasing urban-rural divide.

87.     Recent research at the Bank also suggests that the poor, and women in particular,
have benefited from the growth in the maquila industry over the past 15 years, which has
expanded due to improved trade preferences from the US.13 While it is too early to
estimate the impact of DR-CAFTA, these findings underscore the relevance of PRSC
support in this area.

88.     The PRSC also supported the pilot Land Access Program (PACTA), which
allowed 991 poor families to purchase land and establish rural enterprises. An impact
assessment prepared for the ICR of the PACTA project found that the average income of
families in PACTA enterprises increased by around 130 per cent. In addition, the
program was successful in generating employment in rural areas. The Government is
currently in the process of expanding the program.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome. Rating: Moderate

89.     Overall, the development outcomes achieved by the Government, with PRSC-I
support, face a moderate risk of setbacks or reversals. This rating, however, varies across
themes. Out of the 12 policy areas, 1 has a negligible to low risk rating, while 7 have a
moderate rating, and the remaining 4 have a significant risk rating.

90.     Negligible to low risk: Administrative simplification reforms were implemented
with full ownership of the corresponding institutions.        In particular, the Business
Simplification Committee supports administrative reform programs in various
government offices at the central and municipal level.

Moderate risk: (i) Macroeconomic stability is threatened by the re-emergence of fiscal
imbalances brought on by external shocks in the form of rising global food and fuel
prices and the US slowdown. Implementation of the Stand-by Agreement with the IMF
and the Bank's proposed DPC should help to mitigate this risk. (ii) Transport sector:
Follow-through on the required actions has been uneven and support to enhanced private
sector participation has been weak, especially in the ports sector, where the lack of a
strategy poses risks to sustaining operational improvements in the future. (iii) Telecoms:
There is some political pressure to backtrack on reforms.          (iiii) Land rights: The
Government is committed to continue modernizing the land administration system in the
country. However, reaching financial sustainability to maintain the system's operation
will require additional political will and continued support to the institutional
development of the property institute. Moreover, to maintain the gains achieved through
the modernization of key registry offices, it is important to ensure confidence in the
system. (v) Health: The special regime for health workers continues to limit the ability of
regional health departments to hire and fire workers. The politically strong unions remain
a countervailing force for progress in this area and concessions to these may lead to
further setbacks. (vi) Financial accountability and transparency: Unless the Government
establishes a permanent team based in the Ministry of Finance to operate and manage the
new system, it could eventually fall into disrepair. The high turnover of government
employees associated with changes in Government also poses risks, as future staff may
resort to traditional opaque processes and procedures due to unfamiliarity with the system.


                                          33

(vii) The Protected Areas and Monitoring and Evaluation components were also assigned
a moderate risk rating.

91.     Significant risk: (i) Education: Frequent personnel changes threaten the
continuity of the strategy. Learning curves of new personnel take up valuable time in an
environment dominated by strong teacher unions that resist innovation and needed
changes through strikes. (ii) Civil service reform: There is a significant risk of further
reversals on the public wage framework legislation, due to the precedent set by the 2006
teachers' agreement. (iii) The risk of lack of progress in developing sector strategies and
SWAPs continues to be significant, as the Government is hesitating to take leadership.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance. (relating to design,
implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase).
    Rating: Satisfactory.

92.     Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was rated satisfactory across most
thematic areas with three exceptions (see next paragraph). The following aspects are
worth noting amongst the areas with satisfactory performance: (i) specific actions were
appropriately identified in the transport sector; (ii) the Bank worked closely with the IDB
on the health sector to establish realistic milestones; and (iii) the first CFAA helped
support policy recommendations to improve public financial management.

93.     The three exceptions were: the education sector (where Bank performance was
highly satisfactory); land access (moderately unsatisfactory); and civil service reform
(moderately satisfactory). In education, PRSC-supported measures addressed the key
bottlenecks that continue to challenge the sector today. The selection of monitoring
indicators and outcome targets was similarly highly relevant, even if data was not
available at the time of the ICR. The PRSC also provided additional leverage to further
the objectives of the concurrent education sector project.           In the area of land
administration, the Bank had a good knowledge of the implementation capacity and
political challenges to move forward on modernization. Nevertheless, outcome targets
agreed for PRSC-I were overly ambitious and performance indicators could have been
better selected. Further, the Bank was right to press for change on civil service reform
due to the fundamental importance of this issue and because the impulse for reform was
unlikely to come from within the Honduran polity itself due to the vested interest in `the
status quo' that all political parties share. On the other hand, the strong focus on
legislative action to achieve this result eventually became a serious obstacle for further
progress on the PRSC-II.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)
    Rating: Satisfactory.




                                             34

94.     A PRSC-I supervision mission was conducted in May, 2005 as the team scoped
the possibility of continuing with the quick-disbursing series. In this process, detailed
matrices were prepared outlining the progress in attaining PRSC-II triggers and, as it was
decided that the operation could not continue, a simplified ICR was prepared for PRSC-I,
forming a useful basis for the full ICR presented here. A series of other supervision
missions were also conducted as the Bank team continued the policy dialogue with the
Government even after the formal closure of the series.

95.     A component-by-component review of supervision performance also supports a
satisfactory rating across the board, with the exception of the health sector, which was
rated moderately unsatisfactory as the Bank tried to emphasize the need to adhere to the
milestones, but the change of ministers made this difficult. Nevertheless, the Bank team
could have strongly encouraged the Government, as part of its health sector dialogue, to
undertake periodic random audits after the ministerial change in mid-2006, to publicly
release the results, and to take additional steps to address any deviations or anomalies in
staff placement. The Government resisted to comply on the grounds that this was not one
of the milestones in the Bank's Health Reform Project, suggesting a disconnect between
the milestones of the two projects.

96.     Amongst the other components that were rated satisfactory, the following aspects
are worth highlighting: (i) the administrative simplification component benefited from
ongoing Bank supervision under a TA loan; (ii) in the transport sector, Bank staff
continued to support a reform program for the port sector, even in the face of political
opposition within parts of Government (a weakness, however, was the lack of systematic
follow-up on the overarching legal and regulatory framework); (iii) in the telecoms sector,
the Bank provided highly relevant advice on key aspects of the reform process; (iv) the
technical assistance program (PRS-TAC) and the ongoing Economic and Financial
Management technical assistance program were designed/re-structured to assist the
Government in implementing the reforms targeting public financial management; and (v)
in education, Bank staff was available on a just-in-time basis to assist MoE in addressing
implementation issues on the community participation reforms.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

97.     This rating follows from the fact that both components of Bank performance were
rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

98.     The Government initially demonstrated a high level of commitment to its own
comprehensive reform program, although this commitment waned somewhat as elections
approached, the fiscal situation improved, and the external financial incentives dried out.
The new administration was less interested in continuing the PRSC series than expected,


                                           35

but may opt for a substantially reduced version of essentially the same reform program
through a new development policy credit.

99.     The moderately satisfactory rating is supported by a case-by-case assessment of
each of the 12 thematic areas. Two distinct experiences predominate: a satisfactory
group (5 counts) and a moderately unsatisfactory one (6 counts). Satisfactory ratings
were attained by: (i) telecommunications reform (strong political will and execution); (ii)
simplified business regulation (strong political will in both administrations); (iii) land
reform (high government commitment); (iv) financial accountability and transparency;
(v) forestry and protected areas (the final approval of the forestry law spanned three
administrations); and (vi) PRS monitoring and evaluation.

100.    Performance      was  moderately     unsatisfactory   in    the   following    areas:
(i) Macroeconomic policymaking, while initially prudent, slipped considerably during
2006, especially on the fiscal side. (ii) In the transport sector, insufficient attention and
commitment were devoted to supporting the implementation of required policy
measures--especially the lack of progress on the Ports Law--whereas alternative actions
were not of equivalent substance. (iii) Even though a long-term commitment to improve
land administration in the country exists, program implementation at times suffered due
to political interference or lack of support to the concerned institutions. (iv) In the
education sector, insufficient advances were made on human resource information and
management reforms.       (v) In the health sector, although MOH complied with the
benchmarks, it did not make sufficient effort to enforce them in practice. (vi) There was
insufficient government support for developing sector strategies needed to support
SWAPs. Finally, failure to gain political consensus to approve the Civil Service Law and
the partial reversal on the Public Wage Law merit an unsatisfactory rating.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

101.    The rating of implementing agencies largely mirrors the `government
performance' rating. The Administrative Simplification Committee (business regulation),
the telecom regulator and telecommunications cabinet, the Directorate of Modernization
in MOF (SIAFI team), the state forestry corporation and UNAT (PRS monitoring) all
performed satisfactorily. A good illustration of satisfactory performance is the SIAFI
modernization project that was implemented by a technically strong project management
team consisting mainly of consultants and headed by the Director for Modernization.
The team took a proactive approach to train line ministries in the use of the upgraded
system, including the provision of technical support on demand.

102.    On the other hand, several implementing agencies performed moderately
unsatisfactory. This includes education, health, and land. Continuous personnel changes
in the Ministry of Education threatened the continuity of the strategy. Weak procedures,
lack of monitoring and follow-up, undefined or unclearly delegated functions and
responsibilities at the MoE level were also contributing factors. Similarly, the Ministry
of Health neither systematically monitored the application of its own rules (such as the
transfer request approval) nor did it undertake any random personnel audits. Sanctions


                                             36

were also reportedly not well enforced. Further, even though a long-term commitment to
improve land administration in the country exists, program implementation has, at times,
suffered due to political interference or lack of support to the concerned institutions.

103.    Finally, in areas where the `implementing agency' was indistinguishable from
`government,' the Government performance rating (see section 5.2) was used to inform
this sub-rating.   This included macroeconomic policy (MOF did not directly affect
higher-level decisions), transport (multiple agencies, including general government), civil
service reform, and SWAPs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

104.    This rating follows from the fact that both components of borrower performance
were rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

105.    The limited experience obtained from the first PRSC operation for Honduras
tends to support many of the findings reported in the Bank's PRSC stocktaking
report (IDA/SecM2005-0238). That review concluded that PRSCs were emerging as
effective and flexible lending instruments for helping to improve the operational
framework of the PRS, strengthening M&E frameworks and medium-term strategic
budgeting, and providing a useful platform to coordinate and harmonize budget support
programs in support of PRSs.

106.    To improve predictability of resource flow, PRSC operations could be
designed such that the timing of the tranche release is held constant while the
amount is adjusted in line with borrower performance. The non-approval of the
PRSC-II operation suggests that this instrument has not yet been able to deliver on the
promise of greater predictability in the annual resource flow made available to Honduras.
In response, IDA has been preparing a new budget support operation that seeks to keep
the timing predictable, but adjusting the credit amount according to the number and
substance of the triggers achieved within that pre-determined period.

107.    The PRSC relied on legislative instruments to advance many of the key
reforms. This may not always be the most effective means of supporting reform in
Honduras. This was particularly pertinent for the general ports law and the civil service
reform. This lesson has been incorporated into the design of a new PRSC series, where
civil service reforms are pursued via administrative measures.

108.    A strong link between policy lending and investment lending promotes
consistency in policy advice given at the central and sector level. PRSC-I was
prepared mainly with Bank staff that also was involved in the preparation of investment
operations in the various sectors focused on in the PRSC policy matrix. This also
permitted a better coordination between the adoption of sector-wide measures and
project-level actions.


                                            37

109.   Effective donor coordination during the formulation of policy conditionality
reduces the danger of providing conflicting policy advice. Staff of the Bank, IMF,
IDB and bilateral donors consulted regularly on policy matters relating to PRS
implementation in Honduras during program preparation.

110.   Program design should be simple (limiting the amount of triggers) and
targets should be realistic, particularly where political consensus is lacking, such as
during pre-election periods. In such cases, it is often better to focus on consolidating
existing gains and avoiding policy reversals.

   Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Comments on the ICR were received from the Ministry of Finance. The comments are
summarized as follows:

  1. The Government shares the views expressed in this ICR with respect to the
     evaluation of the objectives, design and implementation of the operation as well
     as the achievement of results.
  2. The Government agrees that the program design should be as simple as possible
     to ensure the effective participation and commitment of the executing agencies,
     including keeping the number of policy areas and triggers within reasonable limits.
  3. A multi-tranche operation was adequate, but it is important to ensure that each set
     of tranche-releasing conditions do not contain too many key reforms since this
     increases the probability of not disbursing the credit.
  4. The following lessons are considered relevant for future operations:

     a. A budget support operation is an effective and flexible instruments to support
         the Government policy framework and its Poverty Reduction Strategy within
         the context of a medium-term expenditure framework.
     b. It is important to strengthen coordination and harmonization between the
         Bank, other development partners and the Government to improve the
         predictability of external resources flow as well as to reduce political risks and
         conflicting policy advice.
     c. Given the political context with the absence of a clear majority and the
         existence of fragile coalitions it is preferable to pursue reforms through
         administrative measures rather than legislative ones.
     d. The success of future operations depend critically on careful program design,
         follow-up and technical assistance, especially in the areas where progress has
         been limited in the past.
