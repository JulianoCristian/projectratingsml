The main\n            objective of the PRS, which analyzes the causes of poverty\n            and encompasses reforms and investment programs in a broad\n            range of sectors, is to reduce poverty by 24 percentage\n            points over the period 2001-2015. Overall, the Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the associated first\n            Progress Report (PRSP-PR), which was discussed by the Board\n            in February 2004, present a strategy to reduce poverty in\n            Honduras. The strategy itself is structured around six\n            pillars: (1) accelerating equitable and sustainable growth\n            to levels consistent with the income poverty reduction\n            targets; (2) reducing rural poverty; (3) reducing urban\n            poverty; (4) enhancing investment in human capital; 5)\n            strengthening social protection for specific vulnerable\n            groups; and (6) ensuring the sustainability of the strategy\n            through governance and institutional reforms and enhanced\n            environmental sustainability. In line with these pillars,\n            the PRSC aims to support Government's efforts to:\n            accelerate pro-poor growth, via support for reforms aimed at\n            increasing competitiveness and maximizing the potential for\n            new investment and employment-creation for men and   women\n            in both urban and rural areas in the wake of new regional\n            and international agreements, in particular, the Central\n            America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA); increase the impact\n            and efficiency of resources devoted to human development and\n            social protection, with a focus on deconcentration of\n            responsibilities for service provision and increased\n            empowerment of beneficiaries of key services; and increase\n            the medium- and long-term sustainability of poverty\n            reduction initiatives through policy and institutional\n            reforms geared to strengthening governance and public sector\n            management and improving management of the environment,\n            particularly in Honduras' extensive protected areas. In\n            addition, the PRSC will support the Government's\n            initiatives to systematize consultation processes around the\n            poverty reduction strategy and strengthen monitoring and\n            evaluation at national and community levels."}, "docdt": "2004-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
