                                         I.INTRODUCTION

1.       This program document describes a single-tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC) to the Republic o f Honduras for SDR 40.54 million (US$58.8 million equivalent), which
includes an original amount o f SDR 38.6 million (US$56 million equivalent) and a supplemental
credit in the amount o f SDR 1.94 million (US$2.8 million equivalent). The supplemental credit i s
made available under IDA'S Fifth Dimension Program, financed by reflows to offset interest
payments to the IBRD. The PRSC i s the first in a series o f quick-disbursing, programmatic credits
in support o f the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).                The PRS, which the PRSC
supports, was developed via a process o f extensive consultation with stakeholders throughout the
country. The main objective o f the PRS, which analyzes the causes o f poverty and encompasses
reforms and investment programs in a broad range o f sectors, i s to reduce poverty by 24 percentage
points over the period 2001-2015. Overall, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the
associated first Progress Report (PRSP-PR), which was discussed b y the Board in February, 2004,
present a coherent and credible-if ambitious-strategy to reduce poverty in Honduras. The
strategy i t s e l f i s structured around six pillars as follows: (i)
                                                                     accelerating equitable and sustainable
                                                                                  i)
growth to levels consistent with the income poverty reduction targets; ( ireducing rural poverty;
  i ireducing urban poverty; (iv) enhancing investment in human capital; (v) strengthening social
(i)
protection for specific vulnerable groups; and (vi) ensuring the sustainability o f the strategy
through governance and institutional reforms and enhanced environmental sustainability. These
pillars and the three transversal or cross-cutting themes - gender equity, environmental
sustainability and decentralization - prioritized in the PRSP are shown below in Figure 1.

2.      In the first two years since completion o f Honduras' PRSP in October 2001,
implementation progress was disappointing b y Government's own assessment in i t s PRSP-PR.
The PRSP-PR contains a comprehensive assessment o f the challenges encountered in
implementing i t s poverty strategy and candidly identifies factors related to less-than-satisfactory
implementation. Prime among these factors was the deterioration o f the country's fiscal position
and slow progress on related structural reforms, as evidenced b y deviations from economic targets
and consequent derailment o f the country's PRGF arrangement at the end o f 2001. For the next
14-18 months, Government efforts to reestablish a satisfactory macroeconomic-especially fiscal
-framework suffered a number of setbacks in the face o f opposition from vested interests (e.g.,
civil service unions) and Congressional critics. In the last quarter o f 2003 and early 2004,
however, a viable macro framework was reestablished, following the implementation o f a broad-
based consensus building effort, including a National Dialogue and associated Fiscal
Responsibility Pact involving a wide cross-section o f society. This, in turn, opened the way for a
new PRGF arrangement with the Fund, which was approved b y the IMF Board in February, 2004.
In i t s PRSP-PR, the Government also set forth detailed medium-term priorities, expected outcomes,
and revised institutional arrangements aimed at accelerating PRSP implementation over the next 3
or so years. These have been jointly reviewed by IDA and the IMF and found to be a satisfactory
basis for enhanced IF1 support to Honduras. The PRSC operation described in this report
represents the first in a proposed series of annual operations designed to support the
implementation o f this medium-term poverty reduction strategy.

                    11. POVERTY STATUS AND PRSP IMPLEMENTATION

                                  A. Trends in Poverty and Inequality

3.       Present-day Honduras, reflecting a legacy dating back to colonial times, i s one o f the
poorest and most unequal countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region. With a per capita
GNI o f US$920 in 2002, the country i s the third poorest in Latin America, and, given high
inequality (the national Gini coefficient i s 0.6), income poverty i s widespread. Nearly two-thirds
o f the population i s poor and nearly half i s extremely poor'. Table 1 below shows trends in poverty
for the period 1991-2002. As the table indicates, poverty headcounts fell steadily, albeit slowly,
from 1991 to 1998, before rising again in the last year o f the decade following the onslaught o f
hurricane Mitch. Since Mitch, poverty has again been on a downward trend, although
improvement has been slow-only about 1 percent between 2001 and 2 0 0 2 4 u e to low GDP
growth and high population growth rates (2.6 percent per year). At this pace, 56 percent of
Honduran households w i l l s t i l l be living in poverty in 2015, far short o f the PRSP goal o f 42
percent. To achieve the PRSP goal, a sustained reduction in poverty o f around 2 percent per
annum w i l l be needed-implying the need both for accelerated growth and direct measures to
enhance income-earning opportunities for the poor.

4.      While absolute levels of poverty declined slowly during the 1990s, relative levels o f
poverty increased somewhat, as measured b y increased inequality in per capita income. Analysis
using three different measures o f inequality confirms that inequality increased b y about 3
percentage points nationally from 1991-99. In urban areas, there was a decrease in inequality but
this was offset in the overall numbers b y a marked increase in rural areas. Moreover, the
inequality between urban and rural areas has risen, contributing to national inequality. Thus
rural households fare relatively worse than urban households, indicating an urgent need to develop


' The extreme poor are those living below the extreme poverty line, which i s the cost o f a food basket designed to
   meet basic nutritional needs. The moderate poverty line multiplies this cost b y a fixed factor in order to also
   take into account the cost o f basic non-food needs.

number o f urban poor i s nearly equal to the number o f rural poor, in turn implying the need for
improved services and employment opportunities in marginal urban areas.

5.       Although progress in addressing income poverty has been slow in Honduras, due largely to
sluggish GDP growth, other indicators o f welfare, such as health and education indicators,
improved significantly over the last decade. This i s reflected in the Human Development Index2
(HDI), which i s slightly above expectations for the country's per capita GDP level, and i s at least
partially attributable to the high priority attached by successive Honduran administrations to
protecting spending on education and health care, particularly at the basic levels. Thus, despite a
reduction in public deficits and rapid population growth in the 1990s, basic expenditures per capita
in both education and health actually increased over the period. This in turn allowed for expanded
coverage o f basic social services with positive outcomes for the poor. Over the past decade, health
service provision has improved markedly: vaccination programs achieved near- 100 percent
coverage; maternal mortality fell b y 38 percent (to 108 per 100,000) between 1990 and 1997;
chronic malnutrition in children 1-5 years declined from 44 percent in 1987 to under 33 percent in
2001; and, infant mortality declined, albeit more slowly, from 39 per 1,000 in the 1986-1990 period
to 34 per 1,000 in 1996-2000. Similar improvements are observable in education where the net
primary school enrollment rate i s now about 85 percent, illiteracy has fallen from 29 to 19 percent
between 1990 and 2000 and improvements in access to early childhood and secondary education
have taken place, although absolute levels are s t i l l low. Despite these advances, health and
education indicators s t i l l lag considerably behind other countries in the region and there are s t i l l
important inequities in quality and access.

6.       The population's access to basic infrastructure and services has also expanded considerably
over the past 10-12 years. Official statistics indicate that 89 percent o f the population has access to
potable water-one o f the highest coverage rates in Central America. However, continuity,
reliability and quality of service i s s t i l l poor, implying the need for major changes in sector
performance in order to meet the MDG goal of reducing b y half the number o f people without
sustainable access to an improved water source. Currently, coverage numbers mask huge
disparities in continuity o f water service, particularly in marginal urban areas have to cope with
uncertain quality and intermittent distribution o f water, sometimes amounting to only one hour o f
water service every four days. Future progress w i l l also be made difficult b y the fact that the
majority o f those currently without access live in hard-to-reach dispersed rural communities or
marginal urban areas. The picture with regard to sanitation i s s i m i l a r to that for water. While
Honduras made important headway in improving coverage o f sanitation services for the
population as a whole (reaching 70 percent in 2002), there are a number o f concerns related to the
type o f infrastructure services, environmental impacts and sustainability o f investments. While
coverage expanded in rural areas (from 3 1 to 72 percent over the past decade), this has been mainly
through "latrinization" which has a limited life and which must be accompanied b y improved
hygiene information and practices to realize the full health benefits. Moreover, waste disposal
remains a major challenge in large urban centers, where untreated waste water i s s t i l l sometimes
dumped into rivers and informal dumping of solid waste i s common, with potentially serious health
consequences. Coverage o f electricity services showed improvement during the 1990s, rising
from 33 to 52 percent o f households between 1989 and 1999, with the increase benefiting
households across the income spectrum. In contrast, transportation services, while expanding,
have not reached poor Hondurans. Household data indicate that 63 percent of people in the lowest
income quintile have no access to transportation and less than a quarter use buses as a principal
means o f transport.

              B. PRSP Targets and the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)

7.       Table 2 on the preceding page provides an overview o f the PRSP targets and MDGs as
applied to Honduras as well as the current status with respect to each MDG target. As indicated in
the table, overall trends on most indicators have been favorable for the past 10-12 years and many
MDG targets could be achieved i f long-term trends continue unabated. However, progress during
2002-2003, following finalization of the country's PRSP in late 2001, fell short of established
annual goals in key areas including economic growth, income poverty, infant mortality, and the
environment. This casts doubt on successful implementation o f the strategy unless there i s a quick
improvement in implementation performance.

8.       The Government's PRSP-PR and the Joint Staff Assessment carried out b y the IMF and
the Bank (Report No. 27648 HO, presented to the Board in February 2004) contains a candid
assessment of PRS results over 2002-2003 and an in-depth analysis o f the factors which impeded
implementation during the first two years. Cited among the important factors are: (i)         policy
failures with respect to achieving a sustainable macro framework; (ii)            adverse external
developments (including the prolonged U S recession and high o i l prices); and (iii)          weak
institutional mechanisms to implement the PRSP in a coordinated fashion and ensure effective use
o f available resources. Together these factors combined to dampen economic growth, cause
declines in per capita income and reduce access to programmed external resources through I F I s
(including HIPC debt relief). In turn, this meant weak economic growth, actual reductions in
incomes per capita and constraints on the implementation of social and basic service programs. In
addition to assessing past experience, the PRSP-PR also identifies detailed priorities and plans for
addressing implementation constraints in the short- to medium-term, which were evaluated
favorably b y the staffs and Boards of the IMF and IDA. These are summarized in Section C
below, as background to the PRSC operation described in this document.

                     C. PRSP Implementation and Government Priorities

Political Context

9.       Efforts to implement the Honduran PRSP began in early 2002, coinciding with the
transition to the administration of President Ricardo Maduro o f the National Party, who assumed
office on January 27, 2002. From the outset o f i t s term in office, the Maduro administration
affirmed i t s commitment to the PRSP-which had been completed in the final months o f the
previous administration-and          the targets and strategies contained therein, making poverty
reduction the central theme o f Honduras' development agenda. Nonetheless, the Government
faced (and, to some extent, continues to face) an uphill battle with respect to implementing several
aspects o f the PRSP. Despite the broad consultations on the macroeconomic and structural reform
measures contained in the PRSP, efforts by the Maduro administration to implement them-
especially fiscal reforms-triggered        some social unrest (including street protests b y powerful
teachers' and health workers' unions and other special interest groups) driven b y fears o f salary
cuts and new taxes, coupled with long-standing concerns over weak institutions and corruption. In
this context, maintenance o f a governing coalition in a Congress dominated b y special interests
proved difficult, and the Government suffered setbacks in moving forward i t s development agenda,
especially i t s efforts to put in place a viable macroeconomic framework. This, in turn, delayed the
achievement o f a new PRGF agreement with the IMF, slowed movement toward the HIPC
completion point and associated debt relief, and reduced access to assistance from other external
institutions, including quick-disbursing funds from IDA and IDB.




                                                 5
10.       B y the second half of 2003, given the continuing stalemate on the reform agenda, the
Government set in motion a broad process of consensus-building to diffuse social tensions and build
support for reforms. In September 2003, i t formally initiated a broad-based National Dialogue and
associated Fiscal Responsibility Pact, building on the PRSP participatory process that had begun in
2000. The Dialogue was largely successful in generating wider acceptance of the need for an
adjustment program. I t also highlighted the need for improvements in governance, which
Government has begun to tackle through major judicial reforms well as electoral reforms aimed at
increasing the accountability o f public officials in Congress and the Executive and increasing the
transparency o f the electoral process. The Dialogue process facilitated Congressional approval of a
package of reforms adequate to the establishment of a sustainable macro framework, enabling the
achievement o f a new PRGF arrangement with the IMF. The approval of the PRGF arrangement by
the IMF's Board in February 2004 has brightened the prospects for an accelerated implementation of
Honduras' poverty reduction strategy in the next 2-3 years. It should be noted, though, that t h i s w i l l
require concerted efforts to sustain the momentum generated by the Dialogue process, which could
become increasingly complicated once the campaign cycle for the November 2005 presidential
election begins.

Macroeconomic Developments

11.      When the Maduro administration assumed office in January 2002, i t inherited a slowing
economy and a deteriorating fiscal balance, which had fallen under the previous Government from
a surplus o f 1.8 percent o f GDP in 1998 to a deficit of 3.2 percent in 2001. As shown in Table 3,
the Honduran economy has been essentially stagnant since 2001. The growth rate increased
modestly to 3 percent in 2003, driven b y a mild recovery in construction, tourism and maquila
activity, while inflation declined to 7.2 percent, in line with the exchange rate crawl.
Unfortunately, the fiscal and external deficits also increased, limiting the prospects for an early
economic take-off. The external current account deficit increased from 3.1 to 5.2 percent o f GDP
in 2003 due to the continuing deterioration of the terms o f trade, weak export growth (except for
the maquila services sector), and a significant jump in imports (9 percent) that i s partly attributable
to higher o i l prices.

12.       Depressed global economic conditions, particularly in the United States, partially account
for Honduras' lackluster export performance. Another likely contributing factor i s the appreciated
real exchange rate. Although the real effective exchange rate depreciated by a cumulative 8
percent in 2002 and 2003, this did little to compensate for the 35 percent appreciation that occurred
between 1997 and 2001. The real appreciation has been driven by two main forces, the first of
which was the significant inflow of foreign aid in the aftermath o f hurricane Mitch, which struck
Honduras in late 1998. These aid inflows abated in 2000-01 when post-hurricane reconstruction
activities came to an end, but have since been largely replaced b y the rapid growth of foreign
remittances. Net current transfers from abroad have grown steadily from under 7 percent o f GDP
in 1997 to 15 percent in 2002. Moreover, even though the exchange rate band allows significant
flexibility, the market exchange rate has remained at the most appreciated side o f the band since
 1999.

13.     The public sector deficit (after grants) deteriorated progressively, from 0.2 percent o f GDP
in 1999 to 4.6 percent in 2003. This deterioration was mainly attributable to declines in the
operating surpluses of the public enterprises and the erosion o f tax revenues. The decline in
operating surpluses was largely associated with rising o i l prices and sluggish tariff adjustments by
the public enterprises, while the erosion o f tax revenues can be attributed mainly to the
proliferation o f tax exemptions, weak tax administration and declining import duties.
Administrative measures taken b y the government have halted this deterioration in the operating
surpluses o f the public enterprises, but not reversed it. The government also implemented a three-
stage tax reform in July 2002, April 2003, and December 2003, which has succeeded in partially
reversing the earlier tax revenue decline.

14.      Total public expenditures have become somewhat more stable in recent years; however,
the composition o f total public expenditures has changed considerably. Current expenditures and
central bank losses both increased, while capital expenditures declined. The main factor driving
the rise in current expenditures was the public sector wage bill, which increased from 9 percent o f
GDP in 1997 to 13.6 percent in 2003, linked to the special wage regimes that emerged for various
public sector employee groups. These regimes, covering over 80 percent o f central government
employees, were created b y Congress in 1997, and initially responded to a persistent erosion of real
wages during the first half o f the 1990s. The two largest regimes pertained to the teachers and
health workers, which together account for three-fourths o f the total central government wage bill.
A consequence o f these regimes was that public sector wages became the product of political
negotiations in Congress, and not linked to performance or budget considerations. The authorities
took an important first step to reverse this process with the approval o f a public wage framework
law in December 2003. This law was designed to restore executive control over the public wage
setting p r o ~ e s sand i s expected to halt the upward creep in the wage bill as a percentage o f GDP.
                     ,~

15.      The deteriorated fiscal and external deficits led to unsustainable negative non-interest
balances. This, in turn, put pressure on international reserves, which exhibited a decline of US$lOO
million in 2003, and led to an increase in arrears on the repayment o f Honduras' substantial foreign
debt. The authorities have been reluctant to respond to this situation b y allowing the monetary base
to decline (and interest rates to rise), fearing that this could exacerbate weaknesses in the country's



  The law eliminates the special wage regimes, broadens the scope o f wage policy to cover all government
    employees, and places caps on government salaries. A temporary exemption was made for teachers, who
    will be fully incorporated into the new wage framework by the end o f 2006. Until that time, the base pay o f
    teachers will increase by slightly less than the inflation target rate, while non-base wage payments (e.g.,
    seniority, education attainment) are capped at end-2003 levels

very fragile financial ~ y s t e m . However, without an adjustment there were bound to be further
losses in reserves. Recognizing this untenable situation, the authorities began negotiating with the
IMF since early 2003 on a macroeconomic program to be supported through a new PRGF
agreement. However, social tensions and the Government's fragile support in Congress precluded
approval of fiscal and other reforms deemed necessary b y the IMF and other multi-lateral partners
(including IDA) for the establishment of a sustainable macroeconomic framework. As noted
earlier, agreement on t h i s new program was reached only at the end o f 2003 following the
conclusion o f the National Dialogue process and the subsequent enactment b y Congress of key
fiscal reforms.

16.     The Medium Term Macroeconomic Framework. The economic program negotiated
with the IMF and presented in the first PRSP Progress Report seeks to reverse the fiscal
deterioration in order to create the basis for faster growth and poverty reduction in line with the
PRSP and MDG targets. As shown in Table 4, i t aims to raise growth to 4.5 percent per annum b y
2006 and to reduce inflation gradually to the rates prevailing among the country's main trading
partners in 2008. Also, the authorities are seeking to implement all the reforms needed to reach the
H P C completion point by early 2005.

17.        The program contemplates a progressive decline in the overall fiscal deficit to 3.1 percent
o f GDP in 2004, 2.5 in 2005 and 1.7 percent in 2006 (Table 4). This fiscal adjustment w i l l reduce
the amount o f crowding-out in the domestic financial market, thereby permitting an expansion of
credit to the private sector. The deficit reduction i s to be effected through measures on both the
revenue and expenditure side. Revenues are scheduled to increase with the implementation o f the
2003 tax reform over a full year. Further measures include the strengthening o f customs
administration and a tax code reform designed to improve collection and enforcement. Adjustments
in public tariffs, especially in energy and telecoms, are contemplated in the program to improve the
operating surpluses o f the public enterprises, while greater discipline in setting public sector wages
w i l l help bring down current expenditures. Additional reforms in the area o f human resources are
contemplated to reduce labor costs further and increase labor productivity in the public sector. The

                                    Box A. Financial System Reform
  In response to the findings o f the 2003 FSAP, the authorities have embarked on a comprehensive
  financial system reform aimed at: (i) reducing vulnerabilities and improving institutional soundness in
  the financial sector, (ii) strengthening the regulatory framework and ongoing supervision, (iii)
  enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness o f the financial safety net, and (iv) strengthening the
  financial system infrastructure including mechanisms to prevent money laundering and financing of
  terrorism. Critical elements are being implemented, with support from the IDA-financed Financial
  Sector Technical Assistance Credit (3800-HO) which was approved b y the Bank's Board in June 2003.
  Additional policy and institutional reforms in the sector w i l l be supported b y a proposed Financial
  Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC), which i s currently under preparation.

  Strengthening of Honduran financial institutions. The CNBS, the Central Bank and the Ministry
  o f Finance have developed with Bank assistance a financial sector consolidation strategy to (i)
  facilitate a smooth exit o f institutions operating with a multi-year track record o f persistent weakness,
  low profitability and inadequate levels o f capitalization, and (ii)     provide technical assistance and
  adequate incentives to strengthen the remaining banks in the system. The implementation o f this
  consolidation strategy has already been initiated.

  Prudential regulation and supervision. The planned reform should provide the National Banking
  and Insurance Commission (CNBS) with the instruments to maintain a sound financial system. This
  includes:

  a. Legal and regulatory changes to introduce consolidated reporting and supervision. B y the end o f
  2006, consolidated statements should be available for each financial holding company.
  b. Regulatory changes to improve loan classification and loan loss provisioning. B y the first review
  the authorities w i l l agree with the Fund on a timetable for each bank to be fully provisioned and
  recapitalized b y the end o f 2006. Provisioning requirements w i l l also apply to the banks' investments
  in FONAPROVI bonds that resulted from the debt relief to agricultural producers.
  E. Bringing all banks into compliance with all prudential rules and regulations (mainly regarding
  related lending and bank investments in nonfinancial firms).
  d. Introducing new regulations to improve the banks' risk management practices and governance
  structures.

  Financial safety net. The plan calls for a reform o f the financial safety net to make i t more effective
  and efficient and limit moral hazard. The following measures are planned under the program (in
  conjunction with the reform o f the central bank's lender o f last resort facility):

  a. An improved bank resolution framework w i l l put more emphasis on early detection, least resolution
  cost principles, and preservation o f debt discipline. Resolution w i l l henceforth be the CNBS' mandate
  (instead of FOSEDE's).
  b. FOSEDE w i l l be recapitalized and i t s mandate limited to managing the deposit insurance scheme.

  Anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing. Along with the modernization o f t e         h
  payment system and the improvement o f the corporate sector oversight and restructuring framework
  the CNBS also plans to improve multilateral and bilateral cooperation to combat money laundering
  Regulations on confiscation, freezing and seizure w i l l be upgraded and an onsite verification o f tht
  supervised entitites' policies regarding customer acceptance w i l l start. The government w i l l alsc
  introduce amendments to the penal code to make financial crimes, including fraud and mone!
  laundering, punishable, allowing judicial action. This measure w i l l meet a main concern o f the public
  that financial wrongdoing leading to bank failures can go unpunished.

management, in addition to the fiscal adjustments described earlier. T o this end, the authorities
w i l l capitalize the central bank to compensate for past operating losses, and implement measures,
with technical assistance from the IMF, to improve the central bank's ability to conduct open
market operations, improve the signaling effects of interest rates and strengthen the central bank's
lender of last resort functions. In parallel, the government has embarked on a comprehensive
reform program to improve the soundness of the financial system. That program builds on the
findings o f a Financial Sector Assessment Paper prepared jointly b y IDA and LMF staff in 2003
and includes actions to: (i)      improve the prudential regulatory framework and supervision, (ii)
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the financial safety net` and (iii)            strengthen
mechanisms to prevent money laundering. See Box A for more details on the financial sector and
IDA'Srole in supporting this area. I t should also be noted that the government i s fully aware of the
financial and governance implications of previous bail-outs, while recognizing that the support of
depositors in failed banks pre-empts the use o f scarce public resources for poverty reducing
purposes. Accordingly, the authorities have decided to abstain from conducting such bail-outs in
the future, or to incorporate the financial costs of any bail-outs that are deemed unavoidable fully
into the budget.6

 19.    While the macroeconomic situation i s clearly very fragile and entails considerable risks,
the framework agreed with the IMF was designed with those risks in mind. Vulnerability i s
greatest in three areas: fiscal slippages, especially in view o f the upcoming presidential elections in
November 2005, a potential appreciation of the real exchange rate and unexpected fiscal costs
associated with financial sector workouts. With respect to the fiscal adjustment, most o f the
measures requiring legislative approval or other political support (e.g., passage o f the public
salaries law, tax reforms, public utility tariff adjustments and road fund increases) have already
been approved and begun to yield effects. In case these effects turn out to be weaker than
projected, the government i s prepared to follow up with some administrative measures that do not
require legislative action. The real exchange rate has been falling over the last two years, albeit
very gradually, and that pattern i s expected to continue. The main source of vulnerability here i s
the possibility o f a sudden and unexpectedly high influx o f foreign aid or a substantial increase in
foreign remittances, both o f which are unlikely at this time in light of strict donor budgets and the
cautious economic outlook in the U.S. In any case, the agreement with the Fund contains
provisions for contingent actions. The risks emanating from the financial sector involve the largest
element o f uncertainty. T o address this risk, the macroeconomic framework includes a modest
cushion to accommodate unforeseen fiscal expenditures to restructure or close failing banks. At
the same time, the authorities are working hard, with IMF, IDB and IDA support, to strengthen the
financial safety net system and improve prudential norms and regulations.




 These measures are especially important, given that the current universal deposit guarantee system i s scheduled
    to expire in October 2004.
 Support of the government's financial sector reform program i s being supported b y an IDA technical assistance
   credit and b y the IMF through the PRGF arrangement, Further IDA assistance i s contemplated in the
   Country Assistance Strategy through a separate Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, but not through the
   PRSC.

PRSP Policies and Programs

20.      Medium-term Priorities. Within the overall framework o f the PRSP's six pillars (para l),
the Government has prioritized the following areas for accelerating PRSP implementation in the
short- to medium-term:

    0   Restoring economic dynamism and employment creation, through: firm commitment to
        the maintenance o f a stable macroeconomic framework; a revival o f private investment in
        key service sectors that are opening to the private sector (e.g., electricity generation and
        telecommunications) and in high-growth sectors such as tourism textiles and maquila;
        complementary public investments in infrastructure, property rights and regulatory and
        other reforms included in the National Competitiveness Plan; successful conclusion of
        CAFTA; an ambitious program o f financial sector strengthening; and reforms in
        governance and transparency designed to improve the investment climate (see below).

        Development of human capital, with a focus on improving the efficiency and quality of
        education, health, nutrition and water and sanitation services, through a strategy o f
        increased municipal and community involvement in the design, management, and
        monitoring o f the delivery and quality o f key services and efficiency o f resource use.

        Strengthening governance, with an emphasis on: political and judicial reform, including
        steps to reduce the length o f the campaign cycle, improve the accountability o f elected
        officials, and build on measures to strengthen the independence and probity o f the courts
        b y eliminating immunities o f public officials and the legislature and strengthening civil
        and penal codes; enhanced personal security, through continued measures to combat crime
        and violence via strengthened policing and programs targeted to youth at risk o f becoming
        involved with criminal gangs; and, transparent and accountable public sector management,
        via introduction of l i m i t s to political appointment in the c i v i l service and accelerated
        implementation of systems aimed at budget transparency, competitive public procurement,
        enhanced tax administration and internal and external controls.

The above priorities systematically incorporate cross-cutting emphasis on environmental
sustainability and risk prevention, gender equity, and decentralization. In addition, the medium-
term strategy highlights the need to strengthen management of national forests and other protected
areas, as a key element o f maintaining the country's rich environmental assets, while promoting
their effective economic use in an environmentally sustainable manner.

21.      Institutional Arrangements. The process o f prioritization, led b y the authorities, has
been enriched b y the consultations coordinated b y the PRS Consultative Council, with participation
of government, civil society and donors, organized in sectoral working groups known as Mesas
Sectoriales. Importantly, Government has already initiated a process o f operationalizing PRSP
intermediate targets into specific indicators and measurable outputs with detailed timelines and
funding allocation commitments. As part of this process, the PRSP-PR adopts an expanded
definition o f poverty-reducing spending to help establish a more accurate link between expenditure
items and poverty outcomes. I t proposes some adjustments to goals to better specify outcomes in
key areas and indicates that studies are being carried out to quantify the costs o f meeting each goal.
I t also details enhanced operational and institutional arrangements to ensure better PRS
implementation supported b y the Social Cabinet, the Presidential Technical Support Unit (UNAT),
the PRS Consultative Council, the PRS Fund and the Inter-Institutional Technical Group (GTI). In
addition to these institutional mechanisms designed to enhance coordination across diverse sectors
and governmental agencies, the report also emphasizes continued systematic participatory


                                                  11
monitoring and evaluation o f PRSP implementation through the PRS Consultative Council,
consultations with different stakeholders and the introduction o f social monitoring mechanisms.
This process would build on the consultations already undertaken in setting the priorities in the
PRSP-PR.

22.        Donor Coordination. Going forward, the PRSP-PR establishes the urgent need to
enhance donor coordination, including working with donors to realign assistance toward
achievement o f the development objectives contained in the PRS. Specifically, i t proposes that
sectoral approaches or SWAPS be implemented in five key areas: education, health, citizen
security, water and sanitation and agro-forestry. The aim i s to develop a common, vision, strategy
and action plan through the coordinated action of Government, relevant civil society organizations
and donors as a means o f coordinating support for public spending programs and improving the
efficient and effective use o f resources. In the short-term, the Government hopes that different
donors interested in a sector could come together to adopt common strategies and management and
reporting procedures, thereby reducing pressure on scarce implementation capacity in sectoral
ministries and government as a whole. In the medium-term, the aim i s to sufficiently strengthen
the Government's fiduciary environment to enable use of regular national budgetary and
procurement processes in the channeling o f most, if not all, external resources. Over the past
several months, important steps have been taken toward actualization o f these sector-wide
approaches in each o f the five identified areas, the most advanced being nutrition and education
where coordination has been possible around the Government's National Nutrition Policy and Plan
and i t s Education for All -Fast Track Initiative strategy.

23.      In sum, although Honduras has made only limited progress to date in the implementation
o f the PRSP, there has clearly been a serious effort b y Government and i t s domestic and external
partners to analyze and begin to address the causes o f past setbacks. The PRSP-PR articulates a
sound and coherent set o f policies and institutional changes for accelerating PRS implementation in
the medium-term and the Government i s firmly committed to pursuing the consensus-building,
participatory approaches which have proved crucial to progress in Honduras' fractured political
environment. In this context, the PRS remains a credible framework for continued external
assistance, as affirmed b y the Boards o f IDA and the IMF in their discussions o f the PRSP-PR in
February 2004. The Government o f Honduras has requested IDA'Sassistance in the form of both
technical advice and quick-disbursing budgetary assistance to help ensure that i t s plans for
accelerating PRS implementation can proceed smoothly and with adequate funding to avert
interruptions o f i t s program (see Annex 1, Letter o f Development Policy). The PRSC operation
described below was prepared in response to this request.


                               1 1 WORLD B A N K ASSISTANCE
                                1.

                   A. The PRSC and Honduras Country Assistance Strategy

24.      The Bank Group's country assistance strategy (CAS) for Honduras (Report No. 25873-
HO) was discussed b y the Board in June, 2003. The CAS, which i s fully aligned with the six
pillars of Honduras' PRSP (para l), primary emphasis on addressing long-standing structural
                                        puts
barriers to inclusive growth (including trade enhancement, competition policy, financial sector
reform, property rights, urban and rural employment and governance improvements). I t also
continues and builds o n efforts begun under the previous CAS to support human development
programs and strengthen environmental management. The IDA resource envelope for the CAS
period, FYs03-06, amounts to SDR211 million or approximately US$296 million in the base case.
O f this total, about 75 percent i s allocated for specific investments (including traditional projects


                                                  12
and programmatic approaches such as SWAPS), with the remainder intended for quick-disbursing
operations, including a first PRSC and an FSAC.

25,     PRSC Ii s envisaged as the first in a series of quick-disbursing operations which together
would support a medium-term program o f policy and institutional reforms aimed at accelerating
implementation of the Government's PRS. The second operation in the series, P R S C I1 (about
US$60 million equivalent), i s foreseen for mid-2005 under the high-case scenario o f the CAS,
provided that the corresponding high-case triggers are met. Future support for the PRSP's
medium-term program will be considered under the next CAS for Honduras, covering FY07-09.
However, assuming that program implementation remains on track, it i s expected that the PRSC 1 1      1
operation would b e prepared for Board presentation in about mid-2006 (Le., early FY07), thereby
allowing for regular budgetary assistance in support of progress in implementing the PRSP. I t
should be noted that the notional amount foreseen in the CAS for the first PRSC was about $45
million. This amount was increased to $58.8 million equivalent at Government's request to cover
additional expenses associated with severance payments in the public sector, efficiency
improvements at Puerto Cortes and environmental activities. O f the additional amount, $1 1 m i l l i o n
would be accommodated within the IDA country ceiling for the base case in part through the
reallocation o f savings from other operations and in part through availability o f additional dollar
funds within the original CAS envelope due to the depreciation o f the dollar against the S D R since
the CAS was presented to the Board. The additional $2.8 million equivalent i s provided under the
IDA Fifth Dimension Program, which i s financed by reflows to offset interest payments to the
IBRD.

26.      Although the IDA allocation to the PRSCs i s relatively modest vis-&vis total IDA support
for Honduras, the CAS emphasizes the importance of the PRSC series as a means o f increasing
emphasis on outcomes and improving alignment with Government's own implementation
processes and procedures. This in turn, would help reduce pressure on scarce implementation
capacity for project implementation within central and line agencies o f the Honduran government.
It also highlights the importance o f PRSCs as vehicles for furthering Honduras' and donors' aid
coordination objectives. Indeed, as discussed further below, a number o f major donors have been
closely involved in the design and preparation o f this first PRSC and i t s accompanying PRS
Technical Assistance Credit (PRSTAC) and are coordinating their assistance with these operations,
either through co-financing or parallel-financing arrangements.


                            B. Analytical Underpinnings of the PRSC

27.     While the PRSP and PRSP-PR provide the overall framework and priority action areas for
Bank assistance to Honduras, the Bank has also undertaken a number o f studies to help guide
policy directions and the design o f lending operations, including the PRSC. These include a
poverty Assessment (Report No. 20531-HO), a Public Expenditure Review (Report No. 22070-
HO) an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and a Development Policy Review (Report No.
28222-HO). The latter two reports were prepared in parallel with the PRSC and are currently
available in advanced drafts. Both the I C A and the D P R will be formally presented to Government
in the coming weeks, but given the close collaboration with Government throughout their
preparation, their conclusions have already largely been taken into account in the setting of
Government's medium-term priorities, and consequently, in the design o f the PRSC.

28.    Two pieces of fiduciary work have also been undertaken as joint efforts between IDA and
IDB, namely a Countty Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA- Report N o 28418-HO),
which was delivered to Government in June 2003 and a Country Procurement Assessment Report


                                                  13
(CPAR), which i s now nearing completion and w i l l shortly be forwarded to Government for
comment. Both the C F A A and CPAR have had a strong influence on the PRSC as well as i t s
accompanying TA credit and on parallel activities being supported by the IDB. I t should be noted
that although the C F A A and the draft CPAR suggest areas for improvement in Honduras' public
sector fiduciary environment, they consider that sufficient advances have been made to enable the
provision o f budgetary support. Moreover, they indicate that policy-based lending, accompanied
b y targeted TA activities, i s the most appropriate vehicle to further the fiduciary agenda in
Honduras.

29.     Box B on the following page summarizes the main findings from each o f the five analytical
studies discussed above and lays out their links to the PRSC policy matrix (see Annex 2).

30.       In addition to the above core diagnostic work, Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs)
have been completed or are under preparation in three areas. A PSIA on Tax Reform was
concluded in early 2004, which found that tax measures undertaken b y Government within the
PRSP framework have been progressive overall, both on vertical and horizontal equity ground^.^
Specifically i t found that the largest redistributive impact of the Law of Fiscal Equity and the Law
o f Financial Equilibrium and Social Protection would come once they are fully implemented and
complemented b y progressive public spending' Thus, improvements in tax administration to
reduce tax evasion and increase revenue collection w i l l be key to materialize the distributive gains
o f the reform. Two other PSIAs are under preparation, the first o f which i s an incidence analysis of
public expenditure that complements the tax study to provide a complete picture o f the poverty
impact of Government's fiscal policy. The second PSIA would focus on analyzing the
decentralization of social services.

3 1.     Several sector-specific studies also underpin the strategies/actions included in the PRSC.
These include a major study o f infrastructure in Honduras, a study o f the country's community
nutrition program, analyses of the education sector to inform Honduras' Education For All strategy,
and a number of more informal studies undertaken in the context o f the preparation of investment
projects. Finally, regional studies on topics of common interest to the five countries in the Central
America sub-region have also informed the design o f the PRSC. In particular, a set o f studies on
the implications o f the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) for the region and their
policy recommendations concerning means o f optimizing the Agreement's potential economic and
social benefits have influenced the design o f the competitiveness actions included in the PRSC
policy matrix. Similarly, the findings o f an ongoing analysis o f the drivers o f rural growth and
region-wide work on health, nutrition and education policy have also helped in the determination o f
PRSC priorities and benchmarks.




 Vertical equity implies that those with greater ability to pay taxes should contribute a larger proportion of their
   income or wealth in taxes. Horizontal equity implies those with equal ability to pay taxes should pay the same
   proportion in taxes.
* Extreme poverty could potentially decline by five percentage points if the revenue proceeds of the reform are
    spent as progressively as current spending patterns.

                                       A. Objectives of the PRSC

    32.      In line with the pillars o f Honduras' PRSP and, in particular, the medium-term priorities
    identified in the PRSP-PR (para 20), the proposed PRSC aims to support Government's efforts to:
        0    accelerate pro-poor growth, via support for reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness
             and maximizing the potential for new investment and employment-creation for men and




                                                    16
         women in both urban and rural areas in the wake o f new regional and international
         agreements, in particular, the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA);
    0    increase the impact and efficiency o f resources devoted to human development and social
         protection, with a focus on deconcentration of responsibilities for service provision and
         increased empowerment o f beneficiaries o f key services; and
    0    increase the medium- and long-term sustainability of poverty reduction initiatives through
         policy and institutional reforms geared to strengthening governance and public sector
         management and improving management o f the environment, particularly in Honduras'
         extensive protected areas.

In addition, the PRSC w i l l support the Government's initiatives to systematize consultation
processes around the poverty reduction strategy and strengthen monitoring and evaluation at
national and community levels.

33.     The Government's letter o f development policy and the matrix of policy and institutional
reforms (Annexes 1 and 2), which accompany this operation, lay out key benchmarks and other
                                              1,
actions for PRSC I well as PRSCs I1and 1 1 which together would lead to the results/outcomes
                     as
specified for the medium-term program being supported b y the series of credits. The matrix was
developed via a process of intensive consultation within the Honduran Government, between
Honduran officials and the Bank and with other key external partners in Honduras -- notably the
IDB, the IMF, CIDA, DFID, the German Government and SIDA. The broader donor community
represented in Honduras, known as the G-15 (currently chaired b y Spain) was also regularly
consulted and kept apprised o f developments. In addition, a number o f meetings were held with
representatives o f key civil society organizations and the private sector, to solicit their feedback
with respect to important areas being supported under the PRSC program.

34.     In line with the objectives set forth above, the PRSC matrix o f policy and institutional
benchmarks contains four main thematic areas, which are described in the remainder o f this
section. I t should be noted that there i s very strong ownership o f the matrix within Government,
which has developed it as a key tool in operationalizing i t s PRSP and in promoting enhanced donor
coordination. The main sections o f the matrix are as follows:

     0    Pro-Poor Growth-Increasing Investment and Employment, which responds to the first
                                                                              ,
          medium-term priority identified in the PRSP-PR and to PRSP pillars II1and I11
     0    Human Capital and Social Protection, which i s based on the PRSP-PR's second medium-
          term objective and on PRSP pillars I V and V.
     0    Sustainability-Public      Sector Management,      Governance     and Environmental
          Sustainability, which i s linked to the PRSP-PR's third set o f priorities and to PRSP
          pillar VI.
     0    Monitoring and Evaluation o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), which aims to
          strengthen ongoing efforts to measure PRSP outcomes using both quantitative and
          participatory techniques.

         PRSC Section I:Pro-Poor Growth        - Increasing Investment and Employment
35.      Historically, Honduras has been characterized by extremely l o w rates o f economic growth,
despite low inflation and output volatility compared to other countries in the region. Over the four
decades from 1960 to 2000, i t grew at an average annual rate o f 0.8 percent in per capita terms, less
than half the Latin American average (1.7 %) and considerably slower than the 1.2 percent
averaged by all developing countries worldwide. Since the early 1990s, Honduras began a process
o f economic reforms aimed at increasing growth rates through the reversal o f past inward-looking


                                                  17
policies. This reform process included a reduction in trade barriers, more flexible exchange rate
arrangements, financial market liberalization, liberalization o f agricultural trade, adjustments to
public utility tariffs and the development of a legal framework to strengthen property rights. The
impact o f these important reforms on growth was blunted however, b y intermittent slippages in
macroeconomic management (especially weak fiscal discipline during run-ups to presidential
elections) and an unsatisfactory investment climate characterized b y weaknesses in infrastructure,
high levels o f red tape and poor governance. Against this background, the core o f Honduras' PRS
comprises an effort to accelerate and sustain economic growth as the primary means of redressing
the country's persistent problems o f slow growth, low productivity and high poverty incidence.

IA. Macroeconomic Framework

36.      Within the growth strategy contained in Honduras' PRSP and PRSP-PR, a main emphasis
concerns the maintenance o f a stable macroeconomic framework, focusing on sustained fiscal
discipline. The key issues affecting macroeconomic performance in Honduras, and the
Government's medium-term strategy and program for addressing them, were detailed above in
paras 11-20 and w i l l not be repeated here. However, i t should be noted that maintenance of a
stable macroeconomic framework i s an indispensable element o f the successful implementation of
the PRS and i s therefore included as a benchmark of the PRSC Iand subsequent PRSC operations.

IE. Investment Climate and Competitiveness

37.      In addition to maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, the Government has
prioritized the improvement o f the national investment climate and competitiveness as a principal
means o f breaking the cycle of l o w growth and high poverty in Honduras. In recent years,
Honduran government efforts have focused on regulatory, institutional and structural factors that
constrain private sector development and investment productivity, specifically: complex and
burdensome regulations for new business registrations; low quality and inadequate coverage of
infrastructure and public services in key areas such as transport, telecommunications and energy;
and, the weak public sector capacity for regulation, policy making and sector planning. The
Government i s also committed to increasing the availability o f key infrastructure in rural areas, as
part o f i t s ongoing effort to increase employment and income-earning opportunities T o date,
important achievements in moving forward the competitiveness agenda include:

    0   The passage of kev legislation and sector framework laws, including: the energy sector law
        (1994), the telecommunications sector law (1995), the law on concessions (1998), and the
        administrative simplification law (2002).

    0   The creation of regulatory bureaus and commissions for public services, energy,
        telecommunications and concessions and licenses.

    0   Increased private sector participation in the provision o f infrastructure and services. In the
        transport sector, private participation has been present for some time: road and highway
        maintenance has been carried out through private contracting since the early 1990s and the
        country's four international airports were concessioned in 2000.

38.      The challenge ahead for the government i s to continue the process o f reforms by:
implementing legislation and sector policies; deepening private sector participation; achieving
results in quality, coverage and efficiency o f infrastructure and service provision; and, ultimately,
registering improvements in competitiveness and investment climate indicators. The need for these
reforms i s even more pressing with the recently accorded free trade agreement with the United


                                                  18
States (CAFTA), which presents significant opportunities for Honduran firms, given the
appropriate regulatory and policy environment. Successful completion of the government' s reform
program in the aforementioned sectors w i l l strategically position Honduran firms and agricultural
producers to take advantage o f the expanded markets provided b y CAFI`A and attract more foreign
direct investment, levels of which in Honduras are among the lowest in the region. At the same
time, Government i s committed to expanding key infrastructure in rural areas as part o f an ongoing
campaign to increase rural living standards and economic opportunities. The key issues in
continuing this reform process are further detailed below in the policy objectives and proposed
actions for each sector.

39.      The regulations and administrative procedures for business start-ups and registration
constitute an important determinant of private sector productivity. Cumbersome and costly red
tape may deter would-be entrepreneurs, prompting them to relocate their start-up abroad or to the
informal sector. Similarly, such procedures act as a disincentive to foreign direct investment. The
Investment Climate Assessment found that approximately 70% of respondents believed the
country's business registration regulations to be a moderate or major obstacle to growth. At the
time of the survey (2002), registering a firm took up to 146 days-about twice as long as in
Guatemala and three times as long as in Nicaragua-and entailed taxes and legal fees equivalent to
3% o f the firm's equity. As a first step toward improving the business environment, the Congress
passed an administrative simplification law in 2002. Since i t s passage, the time taken to register a
typical business has already been reduced to 62 days b y streamlining permitting processes. Over
the next two years, the government plans to continue to implement this legislation, focusing on
additional ways to reduce the time and costs required for business registration b y further
streamlining processes (for business licenses and municipal, environmental, sanitary and migration
permits), harmonizing municipal and national procedures and rationalizing the required taxes and
fees. I t also expects to pass a Competition Law aimed at leveling the playing field for all
businesses, reducing scope for collusion, and facilitating the entry and exit o f firms.

40.      To effect improvements in the transport sector, the government's planned program
comprises: increasing the efficiency, quality and security o f services o f the country's airports and
ports system (focusing on the most important port, Puerto Cortes), improving the maintenance of
the road network, strengthening sector regulation and improving sectoral resource allocation in line
with a transport sector master plan. The country's international airports were awarded in a 20-year
concession to a US-based private consortium in 2000. The recent DPR found the operational
efficiency o f the international airports to be relatively good, meeting acceptable international
standards for labor productivity and aircraft charges. However, problems persist in terms of poor
service quality and inadequate airport infrastructure. In response to these issues, the Congress held
consultations with the private sector and negotiations with the concessionaire to review the airport
concession contract. Congress approved the concession contract amendment in 2004 and a public-
private monitoring committee was appointed to follow up on i t s implementation and ensure the
improved service quality and competitiveness o f the Honduran airports. Ports are also critically
important to the country's competitiveness, as the sectors in which Honduras has high comparative
advantages depend on efficient and high-quality port services: agricultural products (especially
fresh fruit), the maquila textiles industry, forestry and tourism. However, productivity indicators
for Puerto Cortes are low compared to international standards: it has long waiting times, low
productivity in transferring cargo and extremely low tonnage per meter of dock. Moreover, to date
the port does not meet newly-established security standards necessary to ship export items to the
United States, Honduras' main trading partner, and other participating countries. To address the
latter issue, the Government has already begun implementation of plans to raise security standards
at Puerto Cortes with the aim o f obtaining security certification within the established deadline. To
establish the necessary regulatory and sector framework for addressing efficiency problems at



                                                  19
ports, the government has submitted to Congress a port law (Ley General de Puertos), which:
defines institutional responsibilities for policy and regulatory functions, enables private sector
participation in port management, and establishes the necessary parameters to manage ports in
accordance with international security standards. Following the timely passage o f this law
(expected b y M a y 2005) and the preparation of a plan, the government expects to increase private
sector participation in the operation and/or management of the Port b y the end o f 2005.

41.      Another key objective i s to develop and pass through Congress a new framework law for
the regulation of the transport sector and formulate a transport master plan with an inter-modal
vision to guide resource allocation in the medium-term. In Honduras, the various transport sub-
sectors (roads, ports, airports and rail) are managed independently and inefficiently. The Ministry
for Public Works, Transport and Housing (SOPTRAVI) i s formally charged with management of
the transport sector, but i t s regulatory capacity i s fragmented and weak. This new framework law
would allow for the more efficient regulation o f investment, operation and maintenance of services
and infrastructure in the transport sector. In a related policy measure, over the next two years the
government w i l l significantly increase i t s budget allocation for maintenance of the national road
network. There are plans to increase the number of microenterprises providing road maintenance,
especially for secondary and tertiary (rural) roads, which has shown to be a successful road
maintenance and employment-generating activity in a road reconstruction and improvement project
in Honduras.

42.      Poor service quality, inadequate coverage, high tariffs and institutional irregularities (red
tape and corruption) point to the need for liberalization in the telecommunications sector, which
constitutes a key obstacle to increased private sector productivity in Honduras. Honduran firms
often wait six months to a year to establish a telephone connection and, afterward, experience
frequent service interruptions that lead to lost revenues (losses o f 3.1% o f total revenues for firms
that experienced service interruptions in 2002). Tariffs for international and cellular calls in
Honduras are expensive and much higher than elsewhere in the region. Service coverage for fixed-
line telephones i s severely inadequate and non-existent in most rural areas; indeed, the current
waiting list for telephone connections has over 300,000 applicants. Progress toward effective
private participation has been slow in the telecom sector, which until recently was monopolized b y
the state telecom company (HONDUTEL) in fixed-line telephone service and a sole mobile
telephone service provider (CELTEL). In recent months, the Government opened up the market
for fixed-line local and national telephone service under the "Telephony for All" program and
competition in the mobile telephone sector was enhanced b y the award o f a second concession to
the private operator MEGATEL. These steps are expected to improve services and lower tariffs, as
i s already being observed in the mobile sector. Full private sector participation in the country's
telecom sector i s scheduled for December 2005. To facilitate movement towards this goal, key
actions in the sector w i l l include: creating a telecom cabinet for sector policymaking, implementing
a universal access policy to significantly increase service coverage (especially in rural areas),
strengthening the sector regulatory agency and repositioning the state telecom company
(HONDUTEL) to compete with private operators in the national and international call markets.

43.     Strengthening o the energy sector in Honduras i s critical to competitiveness given
                            f
existing inefficiency in electricity distribution, high generation costs, inadequate capacity, and
irrational tariffs and subsidies. Honduran firms experience frequent service interruptions (an
average of 127 hours o f power outage in 2002) that lead to lost revenues (losses o f 5.1% o f total
revenues for firms that experienced service interruptions in 2002). The state electrical company
(ENEE) has insufficient capacity for generation, transmission and distribution and consistently
operates at a loss: i t s net losses for 2003 were approximately $34 million. In light o f ENEE's
capacity constraints and operational inefficiencies and the growing demand for electricity (at an


                                                  20
annual increase o f 7%), the Government has taken steps to increase private participation in the
sector. Private investments for the 2004-2006 period amount to $460 million and private
participation in the generation segment of the state electricity company (ENEE) i s expected to
increase from the current market level of 42% to 80% by the end o f 2005. Over the next 2-3 years
the government w i l l continue i t s program for sector reforms, o f which an important policy measure
i s the structural reorganization of ENEE. As a first step, ENEE w i l l separate i t s accounts for
generation, transmission, dispatch and distribution, which w i l l increase operational transparency,
enable benchmarking exercises, and facilitate private sector participation in the energy sector. The
government w i l l also adjust electricity tariffs and subsidy targeting to reflect actual costs and
distribute them rationally among households and firms. Key policy measures also include: creating
an energy cabinet for sector policymaking, implementing a universal access policy (especially
involving off-grid solutions) to significantly increase service coverage in rural areas, and
strengthening the sector regulatory agency.

44.     PRSC Actions. In support of Government's initiatives to enhance competitiveness and
the investment climate, the PRSC Iincludes the following benchmarks to monitor progress in
implementing the PRS:

    Satisfactory implementation o f the Administration Simplification Law (2002), evidenced by:
    (i) reduction in the estimated time needed to reguster a typical business (defined as a
         the
    corporation located in Tegucigalpa) from 129 days in 2002 to 62 days in the first quarter of
    2004; and (ii) creation o f an Administrative Simplification Committee to coordinate all
                     the
    initiatives for administrative simplification.

    Congressional approval of an amendment to the airport concession contract for the Honduran
    airports to improve their efficiency, quality and regional competitiveness.

    Executive submission to Congress of the "Ley General de Puertos" which defines institutional
    responsibilities for policy and regulatory functions, enables private sector participation in the
    management o f ports and establishes parameters and regulations to manage ports in line with
    international security standards.

    Government approval o f a TA agreement to develop a plan to improve efficiency and quality
    o f services in Puerto Cortes through increased private sector participation, establishing and
    disseminating baseline information for measuring the efficiency and quality o f services at
    Puerto Cortes.

    Satisfactory preparation o f a plan to obtain the certification o f Puerto Cortes as a secure port, in
    accordance with international standards.

    Creation o f National Commission on Port Protection and reform o f security services at Puerto
    Cortes.

    Provision for budgetary funding sufficient to maintain at least 50 percent of the total road
    network (about 6,802 km).

    Establishment and functioning o f at least 50 road maintenance microenterprises.

    Improvement in telecommunications services through the awarding o f (i) 27
    commercialization contracts and 4 interconnection contracts for private operators to provide



                                                   21
    market-priced, national and local call services and (ii)license to a second cellular telephone
                                                           a
    operator.

    Creation o f a Telecommunications Cabinet as the sole entity responsible for sector policy
    formulation, supported b y a Technical Secretariat;

    Issue o f a consultancy contract for the design o f a Universal Access Telecommunications Fund
    to expand services to the rural areas.

    Award o f power purchase contracts at competitive prices to independent private producers.

    Electricity tariffs set in line with the revised formula for automatic fuel cost adjustment.

    Initiation o f a competitive bidding process for a technical assistance contract to assist ENEE in
    separating i t s accounts into generation, transmission, dispatch and distribution business units.

    Government designation o f a technical secretariat to support the Energy Cabinet and
    communicate sector policies; and initiation of an evaluation of alternatives for expansion of
    coverage in rural areas.


IC. Land Rights and Access

45.      The insecurity of land tenure, both urban and rural, constitutes one o f the most critical
constraints to increased investment and sustainable poverty reduction in Honduras. I t i s also a
source of social instability, a disincentive to sustainable land use, contributes to deforestation, and
enables corruption in land transactions. Insecurity from overlapping titles, violent disputes, illegal
occupation o f lands, and the absence of efficient and equitable land markets arises largely as a
result o f poorly enforced land rights through weak and uncoordinated land administration
institutions and an unclear and fragmented land policy. Even titled lands suffer from irregularities,
such as overlapping claims. Only about 30 percent of the estimated 2.6 million land parcels in the
country are registered in the property registry. A recent study estimated the total value o f these
extra-legal assets to be about US$12 billion. Failure to use even a fraction o f these assets to
mobilize credit i s a key source o f stagnation and inequality. The historical land claims o f
indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities further complicate the land rights issue, and s t i l l need
to be adequately addressed. While there are many land-related policies and laws, they are highly
fragmented, at times contradictory, and as a result, contribute to the above mentioned problems,
and are unresponsive to a pro-poor growth strategy.

46.     Given these issues, the Government, in recent years, has been giving high priority to
addressing the issue of land tenure security in urban and rural areas as a key element o f i t s strategy
to accelerate productivity improvements, enhanced investment and inclusive growth in Honduras.
The Government, with support from various donors including the Bank, has over the past several
years made considerable progress in land titling and capacity building in the national and
municipal-level cadastres. Specifically, under the Land Administration Program, the Bank i s
supporting Government in i t s efforts to establish an integrated and decentralized land
administration system and carry out area-based land regularization activities. T o complement this
program, the PRSC w i l l support the policy and institutional aspects o f this process through: (i)  the
passage and subsequent implementation o f a property law which aims to consolidate, rationalize
and systematize the legal and institutional framework for land regularization and (ii)                 the
development and implementation o f a comprehensive plan for surveying, regularizing, titling and


                                                   22
registering the land rights o f populations on national lands (including in national forests), and of
indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups. In each of these areas, clear benchmarks and targets have
been established to monitor satisfactory implementation.

47.      While the property rights effort w i l l benefit both rural and urban areas, additional efforts
are foreseen to boost rural productivity b y addressing a major structural cause o f rural poverty:
namely, the lack o f access to land and technical services b y as many as 250,000 rural poor
families. Despite past attempts to transfer significant areas of underutilized private and public land
with agricultural potential to minifundistas (families with plots less than 1 ha.) and rural landless
families, Honduras continues to have a large, poor rural population and a highly skewed land
distribution. Currently, 70 percent o f landholdings account for about 10 percent o f land in farms;
and a little over 1 percent o f farmers own about 25 percent of the land. Most landholders with less
than 5 ha. are not titled, nor are most o f them eligible for titling because they work rented or
borrowed land under informal, short-term arrangements, or because they occupy plots within
public forest lands ineligible for titling.

48.      Recognizing that land access issues are an important constraint to raising rural productivity
and household incomes, the Government has begun a participatory process for the development
and implementation of a comprehensive land policy, including the establishment of an Interagency
Technical Commission on Lands (CTIT), with the mandate to complete an integrated and
comprehensive national land policy in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA.
Following approval of the policy, Government would prepare and implement an operational plan
for broadening a set o f market-based instruments to facilitate access to land and supporting services
b y the rural poor. Government would also formulate and implement a plan for the scaling-up to a
national level promising initiatives for promoting land access, taking into account institutional
needs and sustainable financing considerations.

PRSC Actions. The key benchmarks included in PRSC I the area o f land rights and access are
                                                   in
the following:

e       Congressional approval o f a property law, which establishes a unified property registry and
        strengthens and consolidates the laws and institutional arrangements for land regularization.

0       Launching o f a comprehensive program for surveying, regularizing, titling and registering the
        land rights of populations on national lands (including in national forests), and o f indigenous
        and Afro-Honduran groups.

0       Establishment o f an Interagency Technical Commission on Lands (CTIT) to support the
    '   processes o f analysis and consultation in the formulation o f a national land policy.

Expected Results

49.      Specific results expected from each set of activities described above are detailed in the
PRSC policy matrix. Taken together, implementation o f the actions included in this section o f the
PRSC matrix can be expected to provide an important boost to growth in Honduras. In addition to
achieving and maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework, the reforms proposed b y
Government and supported b y the PRSC can be expected to substantially improve the investment
climate by significantly reducing red tape for business start-up and operation, increasing the
efficiency and coverage and lowering costs of key infrastructure services (transport,
telecommunications, power) and strengthening property rights. While most o f the actions
supported in this section o f the PRSC are expected to yield benefits at a national or economy-wide


                                                    23
level, a number o f reforms and actions have been specifically targeted to help stimulate growth in
the relatively poorer rural areas including initiatives to extend coverage of telecommunications and
electricity services, improve maintenance of rural roads via the use o f maintenance micro-
enterprises and improve land rights and access.

I1 A. Education

50.      Despite steady improvement in primary school enrollment-about             85-90 percent of
children aged 7-12 years attend school-the education system in Honduras continues to exhibit a
number o f important shortcomings relating to education coverage and efficiency. These are (i)   low
internal efficiency at the primary level, which translates into high drop-out/low completion rates,
(ii) coverage o f secondary education, at both the lower and upper levels, and (iii)
     low                                                                                   substantial
inequities across the urbardrural divide. In turn, these problems point to the need for improvements
in two, interrelated, areas: pedagogy and management. Both types o f improvements are at the core
o f Honduras' recently-launched Education For All Fast-Track Initiative, which i s being supported
b y a number o f donors, including the Bank. On the pedagogical side, the EFA-FTIpromotes the
adoption o f compulsory pre-basic education and specific interventions to decrease repetition,
institutes a school calendar o f 200 teaching days per year, and implements curriculum reform and
standardized testing to assess educational achievement. On the management side, improvements in
teacher management and a rationalization o f the supply o f primary education, in particular through
the promotion o f networks between small rural schools (to reduce the number o f single teacher,
multi-grade schools), are at the core o f the EFA-FTI.

51.     However, to ensure effective implementation o f the EFA-FTI strategy and move beyond
primary education objectives to reach secondary education coverage targets, complementary
reforms are needed in three interrelated areas: school decentralization, teacher management and
resource management. At present, overly centralized management o f the education system has led
to poor accountability at all levels of the system, high teacher absenteeism and an inadequate
teaching and learning process in schools. To help address t h i s problem, Government i s seeking to
expand a model begun 4-5 years ago in rural areas to foster the development o f Local Associations
for Education Development (ADELs) tasked with participation in the management o f schools.
Evaluations o f this model (and o f an analogous, albeit more radical, model o f school autonomy
(PROHECO) implemented in isolated rural areas) have shown that increased community/parental
involvement in school management has increased student and teacher attendance and improved
parental support for, and accountability of, rural schools. I t has also improved utilization of
centrally-provided education resources and contributed to an increase in community resources
targeted to education. Given this experience, a key element o f Government's strategy for
improving the quality o f primary and lower secondary education involves promoting the expansion
of legally-constituted ADELs, and, in parallel, increasing their responsibilities for school
management-including the management o f schooling plans, school maintenance, administration
of teaching/learning materials and, over time, teacher monitoring and hiring.

52.      While enhanced community (ADEL) involvement in teacher management can be expected
to partially address issues o f teacher absenteeism at both primary and secondary levels, a number
o f other actions are needed to rationalize teacher management and ensure efficiency improvements
at all education levels. Znter alia, weak accounting and monitoring o f teachers and contracts,
unreasonable salary allowances and lack o f performance-based incentives are contributing to
considerable waste o f public funds, misallocation o f teachers across schools and geographic


                                                 24
regions and poor teacher performance. In this context, Government intends to emphasize teacher
accounting, allocation and monitoring as key elements of i t s overall education reform. I t s planned
reform comprises three main phases. A diagnostic phase aimed at establishing the precise extent of
"ghost" teachers and contracts and the discrepancy between: (a) nominal and effective teaching
hours; (b) nominal and effective teacher responsibilities; and (c) formal and effective teacher work
site. The second phase i s aimed at introducing the necessary corrective actions: elimination of
"ghost" teachers and contracts from the payroll, enforcement of nominal teaching hours,
reconciliation o f formal and effective work site, etc. And, finally, a sustainability phase i s planned,
aimed at maintaining an effective teacher accounting and monitoring system in real time. Steps
have already been taken to initiate the first phase, through implementation o f a detailed school
mapping exercise and establishment of an Integrated Human Resource Information System
(SIARHD), which allows for the efficient administration of the teacher payroll. The second,
corrective, phase has also been initiated with a first cleaning-up of the payroll and the approval of a
regulation to decentralize teacher management in all departments, which would provide greater
access to M O E offices for ADELs and other community stakeholders to report on teacher
attendance and school operation.

Finally, the education sector i s not yet programming actions to meet PRSP coverage targets in
primary and secondary education. I t needs a coherent framework for expenditure management
and physical planning to identify the resources and efficiency improvements to meet PRSP goals.
Government intends to establish a more explicit link between the education budget and PRSP goals
b y ensuring a decrease in the share o f salary and administration expenditures at both the primary
and secondary levels and a gradual increase in spending on secondary education, as a key means o f
expanding coverage. These increases would be made possible b y efficiency improvements in the
delivery o f primary education and lower and upper secondary education, and by efforts to curtail
costs at the tertiary level.

53.     PRSC Actions. The PRSC series supports continued progress in implementing
Government's strategy of improving primary school quality and the efficiency and coverage of
both primary and secondary education through improved school management and organization and
better teacher and resource management. Specific benchmarks included for PRSC Iare the
following:

    Local Education Development Associations (ADELs) have been legally established (with
    personeria juridica granted or in process) in at least 2,700 rural schools.
    A methodology for the organization of rural school networks to reduce the numbers o f single-
    teacher multi-grade schools has been established within the EFA program; and 2 rural school
    networks have been created.
    The M O E has approved the Reglamento de las Direcciones Departamentales de Educacidn,
    which assigns key responsibilities for planning, resource management and technical/pedagogial
    supervision to the department level.
    The educational statistics database from the 2003 school census, including the analysis o f
    teacher and student distributions, and the teachers payroll b y department from SIARHD, are
    published on the MOE website and have been submitted to the National Institute for Statistics.
    The M O E has prepared an action plan and terms o f reference for a teacher post review
    (auditoria de puestos) in the departments o f Francisco Morazan and Cortes.
    The M O E has adopted a policy o f incorporating all major donor resources in the education
    budget and of linking the budget to the PRSP goals.

I I B . Health

54.        Despite overall improvements in health conditions and indicators in Honduras over the past
decade-including an 18 percent expansion in health infrastructure in the late 1990s+onsiderable
challenges remain which the Government i s committed to addressing as part o f i t s effort to achieve
PRSP goals and MDG targets. A significant number o f the poor (about 15 percent o f the total
population)-especially those in harder-to-reach rural areas and residents of the northwestern part
o f the country-remain outside the effective coverage o the health system and suffer health
                                                              f
outcomes that are substantially below those of the population at large. Inadequate planning for,
and financing of, the increasing recurrent costs of the growing infrastructure and human resource
management problems have contributed to an average of 60 health posts (6 percent o f all health
posts) being closed at any given moment, thereby thwarting the impact o f the expansion strategy.
To help address these coverage issues, the Government has introduced several new models of care
in i t s efforts to improve access, including the identification of a basic package o f health services
(including child health interventions and maternal and reproductive health care) and the contracting
o f qualified NGOs to provide care in isolated rural areas. These programs currently cover 225,000
persons. The Ministry i s currently in the process o f developing a permanent and on-going
monitoring and evaluation system to oversee and refine this program.

 55.       In addition to coverage problems in isolated rural areas, the Government recognizes that
 the quality o the health care system as a whole remains low, with a large number o f facilities
               f
 failing to meet minimum licensing standards due to shortages of personnel, basic materials and
 equipment. T o address this issue, Government has adopted a plan for improving the structure and
 process o f care in MOH facilities so as to bring them up to acceptable standards, in a phased
 manner over a ten-year period. I t also recognizes that, given fiscal constraints, covering the costs
. o f the quality improvement program w i l l require the redeployment o f savings generated from
 initiatives to increase system efficiency, particularly through improved management of human
 resources. In the late 1990s, personnel expenditures in health grew rapidly, from 38 percent of total
 annual recurrent expenditures in 1996, to 63 percent in 2000 (see para 14), thus forcing a reduction
 in the relative share o f all other inputs, including medicines, with obvious implications for the
 quality o f care. Moreover, personnel are not well managed: staff information systems are poor,
 control over staff attendance i s weak, and the migration o f posts towards urban areas i s a serious
 problem. Many primary care facilities and area hospitals are under-staffed, resulting in limited
 hours o f operation, restricted access to care, underutilization o f resources, and lower M O H
 productivity and efficiency. T o address this situation, Government has adopted a two-pronged
 approach. First, i t intends to establish strong personnel information systems. Second, i t w i l l
 address rigidities in the management o f human resources that constitute an obstacle to improving
 the efficiency o f health workers. In this regard, a key element o f Government's strategy i s to revise
 the manual of job posts and salaries (Manual de Puestos y Salaries) and implement a new human
 resource management system so that positions and their associated budget can be assigned not to
 individuals (and move when the individual moves) but to health units in accordance with
 established staffing norms.

56.     PRSC Actions. The PRSC series includes a number o f specific benchmarks to measure
progress in the implementation o f the health sector priorities identified b y Government. For PRSC
 ,
Ithese include the following:

0   A basic package o f primary health services suitable for delivery under contract through NGOs
    has been designed and the M O H has signed at least 15 contracts with qualified NGOs to
    deliver the health services package to an estimated population o f 225,000 beneficiaries.




                                                   26
   The health ministry has completed a diagnostic study o f all facilities to determine their
   resource needs to meet licensing requirements and has estimated the cost to bring all facilities
   up to licensing standards over a ten year period.

   The human resource staff registries have been internally audited and adjusted to show the
   functional assignment o f each staff member (where the person really works) for 30% of M O H
   personnel. M O H budgetary allocations to pay the salaries o f this 30% of M O H staff have been
   made to the work sites in'a manner consistent with the registry.

   The M O H has issued a resolution stating that personnel transfers w i l l not be permitted without
   the authorization o f departmental directors and, if applicable, hospital directors.


I1 C. Nutrition and Social Protection

57.     Chronic malnutrition in children less under five declined from 44 percent in 1987 to 34
percent in 2001. Despite this improvement, Honduras remains among the countries in the region
with the highest levels o f child malnutrition. At present, Honduras lacks a coherent institutional
framework for nutrition. Four different ministries (Health, Education, Agriculture and the
Presidency) and other autonomous government entities currently implement programs with widely
varying criteria and approaches, and with little or no coordination. Government i s committed to
streamlining i t s many duplicative, overlapping and ultimately ineffective programs b y focusing
attention and resources on two priority programs which have been shown to be effective "safety
net" interventions. These are: (i) AIN-C, a comprehensive community-based health and
                                      the
nutrition program for children aged 0-5 years and (ii)school lunch program for older children,
                                                        a
which has been shown to be an effective means o f both encouraging school attendance and
transferring resources to households in poor communities.

58.    AIN-C i s a program that has been developed in Honduras and i s recognized world-wide as
a highly effective, yet relatively inexpensive preventive health and nutrition program. The
Government has targeted the expansion o f the program to the 80 poorest municipalities, all of
which have chronic malnutrition rates in excess o f 52 percent, well above the national average.
The other major nutrition related activity w i l l be the continued expansion o f the school lunch
program (Meriendu Escolar), a cost-effective model supported b y the WFP. These programs
provide an important incentive to attend school, represent a significant supplement to the family
economy o f beneficiaries-thereby      freeing resources to feed younger siblings and lactating
mothers-and improve learning outcomes by providing a nutritional stimulus early in the day.
Such programs w i l l be expanded to cover all priority rural poor areas.

59.    PRSC Actions. The key benchmarks included in PRSC I to monitor progress in
implementing nutrition and social protection policies and programs are given below. Continued
refinement/expansion o f the programs w i l l be supported under future PRSCs.

    Inventory of all nutrition programs, with emphasis on those serving children under five years
    of age, and cost estimate for expansion o f AIN-C to 1,000 communities in the 80
    municipalities prioritized in the PRSP.

    Expansion of the school lunch program (Meriendu Escolar) to 725,000 children (representing a
    25% increase).




                                                 27
I1D. Water and Sanitation

60.      Over the past several years, Honduras has significantly increased access to water and
sanitation services: according to a 2002 government household survey, 83% o f households have
access to water and 81% have access to sanitation. However, problems persist in terms o f
disparities in level of access between poor and wealthy households, irregular service delivery
resulting in an average o f 6 hours of water service per day; and poor quality control that leads to
increased incidence of water-borne illnesses and affects infant mortality and morbidity. Also,
while water and sanitation indicators in urban areas have recovered from the reversals suffered
from hurricane Mitch, they have continued to deteriorate in rural areas. Resolving these problems
and strengthening water and sanitation services i s critical to the achievement o f government's
PRSP targets, the MDGs for reducing child mortality and for ensuring environmental
sustainability. Efforts to improve the quality o f services have been hampered b y weaknesses in the
legal, regulatory and institutional framework o f the sector. Until recently, the sector was loosely
governed b y multiple and overlapping legal frameworks in which several agencies-including the
health ministry, the ministry for natural resources, the national commission on public services, the
public water utility (SANAA), and municipalities-were tasked with roles in policymaking,
regulation and service delivery.

61.        A major step towards sectoral reform was accomplished in October 2003, with the passage
o f a new sector framework law which unifies regulatory functions under a single agency (called the
Ente Regulador), creates a sole policymaking and planning commission (CONASA) and officially
decentralizes responsibilities for service delivery to municipal governments. I t i s important to note
that this last provision attempts to regularize the ad hoc development o f service delivery modes that
has characterized the water and sanitation sector in Honduras-with SANAA centrally managing
systems in the largest cities and municipal governments, community-based organizations, NGOs
and private operators providing services in the rest o f the country. The new law requires the
transfer o f permanent and non-transferable ownership o f systems currently operated b y SANAA to
the respective municipalities over a 5-year period. Under the new sector arrangements, SANAA
w i l l provide technical assistance to municipalities and assume the role o f technical secretariat in
CONASA. Both CONASA and the regulatory agency are already operational with provisional
funding b y the government. The government has recently secured technical assistance for
CONASA from the Bank and for the regulatory agency from the IDB to build technical capacity in
these institutions.

62.      Currently, the government's primary policy objective i s to implement the sector framework
law, first ensuring that CONASA and the regulatory agency are operational and have the
institutional capacity to govern the sector. Over the next year, the regulatory agency w i l l issue
guidelines for tariff setting, establish performance benchmarks, develop monitoring systems and
develop a mechanism to encourage the expansion o f water and sanitation services to marginal
urban and rural areas. T o assist in the transfer of service delivery to municipalities, CONASA w i l l
prepare an analysis o f SANAA operations and an inventory o f assets, followed b y development o f
a plan for restructuring SANAA, transferring i t s assets to the municipalities and providing
technical assistance to municipalities and local water boards. B y 2006, this technical assistance
program should be operating with at least 10 municipalities and 150 local water boards. With some
technical assistance from the Bank, the government w i l l start work on a national water and
sanitation plan, which should begin implementation b y 2006.

63.    PRSC Actions. The previous paragraph lays out the main directions o f the Government's
program in water and sanitation which w i l l be supported b y the PRSC series. The first benchmark,
                   ,
included in PRSC Ii s as follows:


                                                  28
    0   The Ente Regulador has core funding to pay for key staff salaries and minimum operating
        costs.

Expected Results

64.     The key outcome o f the policy actions included in the PRSC in the human development
and social protection area i s accelerated progress toward the targets specified for these areas in the
PRSP and the corresponding MDGs for Honduras. Specific results, identified in the policy matrix,
concern reduction o f inequities along the urbadrural divide, systematic progress toward greater
local and community control of key social and basic services, improved management of resources,
especially human resources in the health and education sectors, and steady improvements in the
quality and coverage o f services


          PRSC Section 1 1 Sustainability - Public Sector Management, Governance
                        1:
                                  and the Environment

65.     The Government recognizes that the sustainability o f i t s poverty reduction strategy
depends in an essential way on a state where transparency, justice, personal security and efficient
public management prevail, on the active participation o f i t s citizenry (especially at the local level)
in the design and implementation of i t s strategy, and on reducing the country's high ecological
vulnerability. The emphasis on good governance i s strongly supported b y various empirical studies
sponsored by the World Bank Institute, which have identified i t as an important determinant of
economic development. Based on those studies, the recent DPR finds that Honduras's performance
on governance indicators i s mixed. I t achieves s i m i l a r or better scores than other countries with
comparable levels of development in some dimensions of governance: voice and accountability,
political stability and regulatory quality. However, i t scores significantly below the comparator
group in other dimensions, namely government effectiveness, rule o f law and control o f corruption.
This finding suggests that governance problems in Honduras are not primarily related to a faulty
political system or inadequate laws and regulations, but more to faulty public sector management,
an incompetent c i v i l service and a weak judiciary. The proposed PRSC supports measures that
aim to correct key deficiencies in these areas.

66.      Among the many factors contributing to Honduras's high environmental vulnerability,
deforestation i s the most critical.' The principal causes o f deforestation are the conversion of
forestlands for agriculture and livestock, unmanaged exploitation for domestic uses (e.g.,
fuelwood), fires, and wasteful and illegal logging activity. The problem i s magnified b y the limited
effectiveness o f the State Forestry Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR), which i s currently being
restructured and reformed. At the same time, the sustainable use o f forest resources deserves priority
attention on account o f i t s potential contribution to economic growth, employment generation and
reduction of poverty, especially in rural areas. The PRSP identifies forestry as one o f the four
sectors with the highest productive potential, capable o f a sustainable production capacity that i s


'More than 80% o f Honduras' total land area i s legally classified as forestland, with the majority o f this being
public forest land. About 42% o f the country's forestlands have been deforested and forest degradation
processes affect a very significant percentage o f the remaining forest areas. Forest resources are being lost at
a rate estimated to be greater than 800 km2per year. The bulk o f the remaining forests are concentrated in
Honduras' central and eastern zones where 44,750 km2o f forest, representing about 80% o f the country's
existing forest resources, are found. These two regions also contain 60% o f the country's deforested lands.
Percentage-wise, the western and southern regions o f the country are the most deforested.


                                                       29
much higher than current production. The proposed PRSC supports measures to reform the legal,
regulatory and institutional arrangements in the forestry sector in ways that w i l l strengthen the
capacity to protect forests and manage them in economically rational ways.

I11 A. Public Resource Management

ZZZ A I . Poverty Targeting and Medium Term Program Budgeting

67.      The Honduran authorities have made significant progress in developing the budget as an
expenditure management tool over the last year. There s t i l l remain many systemic deficiencies,
however, including: (i) omission of significant amounts o f donor assistance and other public
                          the
resources from the budget, which makes i t difficult to gauge the full extent o f public efforts in
certain areas and coordinate public activities, (ii) determination o f budget allocations on the
                                                      the
basis o f incremental allocations (often with little input from ministries and without reconciliation
with annual operating plans) which has weakened the usefulness o f sector operative plans and
resulted in low budget credibility, (iii) weak planning capacity at the sector level, which adds to
                                         a
the overall weakness in budget preparation and contributes to the need for repeated budget
amendments, and (iv) an inappropriate budget format, which i s presented on the basis o f
expenditure objects, rather than a programmatic classification. This impedes the use of the budget
for public efforts in monitoring and evaluation in relation to agreed priorities in promoting
economic growth and reducing poverty.

68.      The Government i s currently engaged in efforts to shift donor assistance toward a
programmatic basis, with the aim o f improving donor coordination and program execution. In light
o f those efforts, the budget format i s being expanded to include economic, functional and
programmatic classifications to improve the recording o f transactions. This transformation i s
already taking place for some sectors, such as education. These changes entail a modernization of
the Chart o f Accounts to improve the quality o f financial information recorded in SIAFI. The new
programmatic budget i s being developed on the basis o f the Government spending priorities
articulated in the PRSPERP, while the annual operating plans (POAs) w i l l follow clearly
established guidelines for programmatic budgeting. These budgeting reforms w i l l enable the
government to implement a medium-term expenditure framework and facilitate the management o f
sector wide approaches (SWAPS)," which would be coordinated b y sector working groups (Mesas
Sectoriales).

ZZZ A2. Financial Accountability and Transparency
                                e

69.      The implementation of an integrated financial management system (SIAFI) has improved
the Government's ability to control and manage expenditures. SIAFI's usefulness has been
limited, however, b y rigidities in i t s format, a lack o f comprehensive access to the system by all
sectors that results in delays in recording transactions, and a failure to integrate SIAFI with various
other government information systems. This has led to a proliferation o f information systems in
other agencies, without a common platform o f operating and technical standards, resulting in a
duplication of databases and efforts, and an overall incompatibility of the flow o f information
within the government.


loThe Education, Health and Water and Sanitation sectors currently provide the best opportunities for
piloting SWAPS, which hold the promise o f generating significant improvements in sector coordination and
policy effectiveness.




                                                   30
70.     As a first step toward improving financial accountability and transparency, the
Government has submitted to Congress a SIAFI law, which mandates the use o f SIAFI in all
central government agencies, and includes provisions for multi-annual budgeting, public sector
accounting standards, and internal controls. Additionally, the Government has linked SIAFI with
the public investment system (SISPU) to enhance the management o f government public
expenditure information. In parallel, the Central Government accounting function i s gradually
evolving from a process o f merely recording transactions toward including analyses that add
meaning to Government financial statements, in a manner consistent with international practice.
The quality o f budget reporting also i s being improved through the production o f interim reports,
and through the inclusion o f information about executed budget in state-owned enterprises and
decentralized agencies. Quarterly budget reports w i l l be produced and published, along
programmatic lines, once the shift in budget classification i s completed. These reports w i l l enable
a much broader participation in budget monitoring and evaluation, and w i l l also enable more
effective tracking of poverty reduction efforts.

ZIZ A3. Expenditure Controls

7 1.     Fiscal management responsibilities are dispersed among several public entities, rather than
being concentrated in the Treasury (TGR), which exhibits significant institutional weaknesses. The
dispersion o f fiscal responsibilities has resulted in functional voids that directly affect the security
and control o f management o f public funds. Adding to this void i s the TGR's practice o f issuing
negotiable checks, which prevents the verification of the final recipient o f government payments.
Procedures governing tax collections also are deficient and unclear. There i s no proper
reconciliation between the funds paid b y the taxpayers with the funds declared b y the banks as
collected; and there i s no reconciliation between the funds received by the banks and the funds
transferred to the treasury accounts. There i s little security with respect to the funds collected b y
the banks, whose solvency i s not previously certified.

72.      The government i s planning to gradually shift responsibilities for revenue and cash
management from the Budget Office (DGP) and the Central Bank to the Treasury. The reform to
redistribute responsibilities, however, must first address the lack o f capacity, knowledge and
experience in the TGR, which w i l l require technical assistance to develop the rules, regulations and
procedures to govern i t s fiscal operations. An efficient and effective management o f the TGR w i l l
also depend on a timely transfer o f funds and related information from the spending agencies.
Toward this end, the Ministry o f Finance (MOF) i s preparing plans to first reconcile the revenue
accounts from different agencies, including the state revenue agency (DEI), the Central Bank
(BCH) and TGR, and then proceed to gradually reconcile all internal and external resources
channeled through the public sector through a single treasury account ("Cuenta Unica"). The tax
collection system, which also needs to be upgraded and subjected to a strong and effective
regulatory system, i s being reformed with technical assistance from the IMF and IDB. These
reform efforts include measures to improve the timeliness o f revenue reporting, as well as
procedures to ensure that revenue projections and collections are included in periodic budget
reports.

ZZZ A4. Internal and External Audits

73.      Internal controls are widely dispersed and uncoordinated. Furthermore, the Office o f the
Budget (DGP) exerts a centralized ex-ante control that does not allow for efficient budget
execution. At the same time, internal audit functions are not well defined and continue to be
controlled b y the supreme audit institution ("Tribunal Superior de Cuentas", TSC), blurring the
lines between internal and external audits. External audit functions are s t i l l evolving in the wake of


                                                   31
reforms that led to the creation of the TSC. The effectiveness o f the TSC i s currently limited by a
lack o f qualified personnel, insufficient financial resources to fully discharge i t s responsibilities
and a lack o f operational guidelines and regulations.

74.       The TSC has prepared a strategic human resource plan that aims to develop a qualified
staff, fully capable o f carrying out the financial audit of the public accounts o f the Government,
with sufficient knowledge o f internationally accepted standards and audit methodologies. It has
also prepared and formally approved a new set o f regulations to govern i t s operations and i s
catching up on finalizing the backlog o f overdue annual reports, beginning with fiscal year 2003, as
i t has recently submitted the 2002 annual report to Congress. Further measures contemplated in the
reform program include the implementation o f the regulations o f the TSC Organic Law, the
approval o f a new financial audit manual and regulations, and the conduct o f annual ex-post review
audits on government procurement processes and contracts. B y 2006, the TSC should be
producing semi-annual reports on the reconciled fiscal accounts, and should have implemented the
new internal audit regulations in all public sector agencies.

ZZZ A5. Public Procurement

75.     Honduras does not have an adequate system for government procurement. In spite of an
improved legal framework enacted in 2001, the system remains ineffective because o f (i) weak
                                                                                            a
implementation o f the procurement rules and procedures, (ii) lack o f dissemination of the new
                                                               the
system in the public and private sectors, (iii)absence of a procurement regulatory office ("OJicinu
Normutivu de Contrutucion y Adquisiciones", ONCAE), (iv) lack o f capacity among working level
staff and members o f the tender committees and approving authorities, and (v) an absence of
project managers and procurement practitioners, and of a career stream in project and procurement
management. These deficiencies have seriously undermined trust in local procurement legislation
and systems, with the result`that the Government has had to rely on UNDP as i t s primary
procurement agent to handle aid resources. Originally contemplated as a temporary measure, the
use of foreign systems and procurement agents has gradually become a permanent practice in
Honduras. A set o f specific recommendations in this area are being developed in the context of a
CPAR Action Plan, which w i l l be finalized by mid-2004.

76.      The government i s implementing an action plan developed within the donor-supported
Program o f Efficiency and Transparency in Government Procurement and has issued the
implementing regulations needed for the procurement law "Ley de Contrutuciones," and for
establishing the procurement regulatory office (ONCAE) and i t s consultative committee. The
government's program to strengthen public procurement contemplates the development o f an
electronic public information system for procurement and an electronic system for procurement
transactions to be administered b y ONCAE, culminating in the establishment o f a more efficient e-
government and contract management system. Furthermore, ONCAE i s expected to prepare plans
for the systematic public dissemination of new regulations and procedural manuals, with the aim o f
ensuring their application in all central government agencies. O N C A E w i l l also be responsible for
the development and implementation of standard bidding documents in all public sector agencies
and municipalities. T o address weaknesses at the municipal level, the Government i s planning to
develop and implement a strategy for strengthening the procurement systems o f municipal
governments.

77.    PRSC Actions. The Government strategies described in the preceding paragraphs would
be supported over a medium-term time frame via the proposed series o f PRSCs. Specific
benchmarks included for PRSC I the following:
                              are




                                                   32
       The Government has redefined poverty reduction expenditures to improve linkage between
       poverty spending and PRS targets.

       M O F has expanded the budget classification (economic, functional and programmatic) to
       improve the recording of transactions and prepared a plan for modernizing the Chart of
       Accounts to improve the quality o f financial information recorded in SIAFI.

       UNAT and M O F have have issued and officially presented to all government ministries,
       c i v i l society and donors, a set of new operational guidelines for the Mesas Sectoriales,
       developed in consultation with the CCERP.

        Congress has passed a SIAFI law that mandates the use of SUFI in all central government
        agencies and includes provisions for multi-annual budgeting, public sector accounting
        standards and internal controls.

       S I A F I and SISPU have been linked to enhance the management o f government public
       expenditure information.

       M O F has prepared a work program for reconciling revenue accounts, including the
       participation of DEI, B C H and Treasury.

       M O F has set up a public website detailing the concessionary, non-concessionary and grant
       financing received from external donors.

        TSC has: (i)implemented at least 50% o f i t s strategic human resource and staffing plan;
        (ii)
           presented to Congress the 2002 annual report on reconciling the fiscal accounts; and
         i iapproved new Internal Audit regulations for public sector agencies.
        (i)

        The government has continued to implement the the Program for Efficient and Transparent
        State Procurement, as evidenced by: (i)   completion o f 1,500 procurement audits; (ii)
                                                                                              the
        hiring o f two firms to provide technical assistance for procurement systems, control and
        auditing mechanisms and staff training; and (iii) design of an electronic public
                                                           the
        information system for procurement.

        The government has issued implementing regulations to the "Ley de Contrutuciones " for
        the operation of ONCAE and i t s consultative committee.


        Civil Service Reform

           Honduras's civil service and human resource administration i s currently governed by the
C i v i l Service L a w (Decree N o 126) of 1968. Although i t appears to constitute- comprehensive
legislation on all matters related to public personnel management, this law has not been binding
over the last two decades. Instead, b y the mid 199Os, many separate employment regimes have
been created which provide extraordinary benefits to particular sectors o f the public labor force,
such as teachers and health workers. These special regimes have led to an uncontrolled increase in
the public wage bill, imposing an unsustainable fiscal burden on society, and they have created
enormous disparities across public servants, in terms o f both benefits and administrative
procedures.




                                                33
79.      At the same time, human resource administration in the central government and in the rest
o f the public sector has evolved in ways that completely undermine the existing civil service law
and that i s not conducive to an effective and transparent administration o f public personnel. The
hiring process, performance evaluation and dismissal procedures have become very politicized,
reducing the capacity o f public institutions to attract qualified personnel and to deliver public
services efficiently. The absence o f transparent rules for personnel management have undermined
the morale o f c i v i l servants, and promoted inefficiency and corruption. The overall level of public
employment in Honduras i s not excessive in comparison to other Central American and HIPC
countries. However, there are serious staff imbalances across sectors, due to years o f weak
personnel management policies and a lack o f clarity on the role and purpose o f different public
sector entities. The consequence has been that many entities are clearly overstaffed in certain
unnecessary functions, and understaffed in other areas, which limit their capacity to deliver
adequate services.

80.      The most important issues to be addressed in connection to the administration o f public
employment refer to: (i) need to restore executive control over salary and wage policies, in
                           the
                                                                                                 i)
order to achieve a sustainable fiscal situation and a more equitable distribution of benefits, ( ithe
need to review the macro-structure o f the public sector, clarifying the roles, functions and service
delivery responsibilities o f different public entities, and to realign these entities (including their
                                                                                         i ithe
employment composition) in accordance with these functions and responsibilities, ( i ) need to
establish a new normative and institutional framework to govern public employment, which l i m i t s
political influence over the civil service, and (iv) the need to follow through with the
implementation o f the new c i v i l service framework once i t has been approved.

81.      T o address these needs, the authorities have been working o n a two-fold strategy that
focuses on both short-term and medium-term objectives. T o begin, the government submitted to
Congress a Public Salary L a w ("Ley de Reordenamiento del Sistema Retributivo del Gobierno
Central"), which was approved in December 2003. This law restores executive control over the
wage bill and wage administration. It eliminates the special wage regimes, folds various wage
bonuses ("colaterales") into the base salary, broadens the scope o f wage policy to cover all
government employees and reserves for the government (as opposed to Congress) the role of
formulating wage policy in line with anticipated inflation. To reestablish more equity in the wage
structure, government salaries have been capped, and certain salaries (e.g., doctors' salaries) have
been temporarily frozen, while others are permitted to adjust in line with projected inflation." The
law was prepared in consultation with all the affected sectors, and presented in the context of a
fiscal responsibility agreement between the government and civil society.

82.     The authorities also have prepared and presented to Congress new legislation that: (i)
provides the basis for a professional civil service, including merit-based recruitment and
promotion, (ii) places l i m i t s on the number o f political appointments in the c i v i l service, and (iii)
creates a supervisory authority to regulate central government human resources management.
Upon passage o f this law, and issuance of the corresponding regulations, the government plans to
appoint a civil service superintendent and proceed with the implementation o f the civil service
reform. In parallel, the government has completed studies to define the functional mandates o f
public entities, issued contracts for the reengineering o f key ministries (Education, Health,
Agriculture) and completed a human resource gap analysis ("auditoria de puestos") for those

  Teachers (which account for 60 percent of total public employment) are subject to a transitional arrangement,
   whereby they will become fully incorporated into the new wage policy framework b y the end of 2006.
   Meanwhile, their base salaries are targeted to increase by slightly less than expected inflation during 2004-06,
   and their special wage payments related to seniority and education attainment have been capped.

ministries. I t i s planning to reengineer these ministries during 2004, and expects to have f i l l e d at
least h a l f o f all new appointments to administrative career positions in these ministries through
competitive processes by 2005. Similar studies, reengineering exercises and human gap analyses
are contemplated for the remaining ministries in a sequential manner.

83.                                                                           .

I11C. Environmental Sustainability - Forestry and Protected Areas Development

Forestry

84.      To date, most Government efforts at poverty reduction in forestlands have s h o w n little
result. Among the principal reasons for this have been: (i) uncertain and conflictive n a t u r e o f
                                                               the
land tenure in public forest lands preventing effective public and private investment and -forest
                i)
management; ( il o w priority given to the systematic provision o f support for production systems,
such as infrastructure, technical assistance, irrigation, training and access to markets, and c r e d i t ;
  i i an
( i ) overly rigid, top-down command and control forest regulatory framework that, w h i l e
seeking to ensure appropriate management, has had the opposite effect by creating disincentives
and encouraging illegal behavior; (iv) undue discretionality and lack o f transparency i n the
management o f public forest, leading to serious forest governance problems and limiting p r i v a t e
investment; (v) a diffuse and confusing policy and legal framework, which i s a major o b s t a c l e to
private investment and community-driven approaches to sharing the potential benefits o f the
forestry subsector; and (vi) public policies which have implicitly directed the State Forest A g e n c y ' s
(AFE-COHDEFOR) attention toward generating income from timber extraction sales, r a t h e r than
towards promoting needed forest and environmental management, regulation, and c o m m u n a l
forestry-based poverty alleviation programs.

85.      A m i x o f major legislative reforms i s being sought by the current administration r e g a r d i n g
national territorial planning (approved b y Congress in October 2003), a property rights law
(recently approved by Congress),            and a forestry l a w (recently submitted to Congress).
Institutional reforms in the State Forestry Agency (AFE-COHDEFOR) have already begun.
Following an extensive process of public consultation w i t h different stakeholder g r o u p s , a
consensus version o f a comprehensive framework law i s currently being discussed by C o n g r e s s .
The law provides for several social accountability mechanisms, including: the establishment o f a
Junta de Transparencia Forestal, the provision for majority non-governmental representation in
the AFE Board, an open records provision process and priority for local communities in p u b l i c
forest management. The essence o f these policy and institutional reforms i s to r e c o g n i z e the


                                                    35
traditional rights of populations in national forest lands. Currently the law i s in i t s second reading
and has been favorably assessed by the relevant Congressional committee, suggesting likelihood of
i t s passage in the near future.

86.      As noted earlier, progress has also been achieved in reforming AFE-COHDEFOR. Among
the achievements to date are: (i) development and approval b y AFE-COHDEFOR's Board of a
                                  the
new organizational structure, (ii) refocusing o f the agency on the technical aspects of i t s
                                      a
normative and regulatory role, including a substantial downsizing in agency staff to adjust the ratio
o f technical to administrative staff and field staff to headquarters staff; and (iii)      ongoing
development o f next generation reforms, including the reassessment o f the state's role in
administering and managing public forest lands and development o f incentives frameworks to
reduce the state's land administration burden in favor o f appropriate involvement o f community,
private, and municipal entities. Also, to deal with corruption and illegal logging, a high level
commission to audit the application o f forest management plans has been formed in the
Department o f Olancho (a center of illegal logging). The Commission i s headed b y the Minister o f
SAG and includes representatives o f the Attorney General's environmental enforcement unit, the
Catholic Church, the police and local environmental organizations. The World Bank and the Inter-
American Development Bank have been working with G O H and AFE-COHDEFOR on the
reforms.

Protected Areas

87.      The 100 protected areas (PAS)that currently compose the National System o f Protected
Areas o f Honduras (SINAPH)12 are linked to other sectors o f the economy (especially forestry,
agriculture, tourism, hydrology and river basins) as important sources o f drinking water, carbon,
and genetic plants materials. B y that token, they have a strategic role to play in reducing rural
poverty and environmental vulnerability. However, the system o f protected areas i s currently in
crisis due to a weak Government presence in managing the SINAPH. O f the 100 PAS,about 75
PASdo not have any presence o f the Government and the remaining 25 PAShave only a limited
Government presence. As a result, the majority o f the PASare being degraded and bio-diverse
genetic material i s being lost due to poor management o f the natural resources, forest fires,
migratoryhlash and burn agricultural practices, extensive grazing, and land i n ~ e c u r i t y . Also, the
                                                                                                  '~
country i s not taking advantage o f potential opportunities for expanding income-earning activities
from eco-tourism and other environmental services o f PAS.

88.     In response to the above pressing issues Government has developed a plan for
strengthening i t s management o f the protected areas and i s establishing a trust fund (fideicomiso)
governed b y a public-private body with representation from government and c i v i l society. The
body would also include representatives o f key donor agencies. The governing body would be
mandated to develop and implement a plan for managing the 40 prioritized PASthrough financial
support to, and supervision of, private firms and NGOs. The Government w i l l commit an initial
endowment o f $3.5 million equivalent to the trust fund in 2004 to act as seed capital to generate
additional support from donor agencies and the private sector. In future years, the Government w i l l
provide additional financing to the PA trust fund from i t s annual budget to help meet the costs of


l2SINAPH was    legally established in 1993 (Environmental General Law, Decree 104-93). The protected areas
   that form SINAPH cover about 2.7 million hectares, which i s about 25% o f the total national temtory.
l3Because o f these factors, the Rio Platan0 Biosphere Reserve could lose i t s special international status
accorded b y UNESCO.




                                                       36
efficiently supporting the management o f the priority PAS. Government has also approved a
strategic framework and action plan for policy, financial, legal, and institutional reforms to sustain
the priority SINAPH PASover the long term, the implementation o f which would be supported b y
future PRSCs.

89.        PRSC Actions. The following reform measures are included as benchmarks under PRSC I:

      0    The Government has: (i)     submitted to Congress a forestry sub-sector legal reform package
           to rationalize the institutional and regulatory frameworks, which includes plans for
           establishing a "Junta de Transparencia Forestal"; (ii)   implemented the first phase of the
           restructuring o f AFE-COHDEFOR, including the preparation o f a financing plan for 2004
           to continue the critical reforms.

      0    SERNA has submitted to CONAP a strategic framework and action plan for the SINAPH
           PAS,as well as a long-term financing strategy.

      0    The Executive has prepared a draft agreement for the creation of a protected areas trust
           fund (fideicomiso) to finance the protection and management expenditures in priority
           SINAPH PASfrom government and non-government agencies.

Expected Results

90.     The measures taken and contemplated in the future to strengthen public sector management
are expected to yield a better linkage between the targets established in Honduras's poverty
reduction strategy and public resource allocation decisions. They w i l l have: created a stronger
legal framework to support public sector financial management, improved public information
management systems, introduced stronger controls on public financial and resource management,
and increased transparency in public financial management and procurement decisions.

91.      The policy actions to reform the civil service w i l l permit the government to: (i)restore
executive control over wage administration and thereby eliminate one o f the most important threats
to fiscal sustainability, (ii)
                             establish a new normative and institutional framework to implement a
comprehensive civil service reform, introducing a result-oriented incentive environment for public
servants, and (iii)initiate the implementation of the civil service law in a number o f restructured
entities and quickly incorporate a critical mass of public servants into the new regime, which w i l l
serve to underwrite its credibility.

92.     The expected outcomes o f the actions to strengthen forestry management include:
increased private investment in forest management, conservation and reforestations; increased
participation o f the poor in public and private forestry activities; and, increased stakeholder
confidence and satisfaction in AFE-COHDEFOR's performance. The actions to strengthen the
PASare expected to reduce the incidence of illegal logging.


          PRSC Section IV: Monitoring and Evaluation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy

93.      The Government o f Honduras has been working with civil society over the last three years
to establish the operational framework for the PRSP. As a result, there i s now a well-defined
institutional framework in place. This institutional framework, outlined in the amended Poverty
Reduction Fund L a w (Ley de Fondo para la Reduccio'n de la Pobreza), contains clearly defined
and properly coordinated functions for implementing, monitoring and evaluating the PRSP and


                                                   37
establishes a satisfactory mechanism for the tracking o f H P C resources. Some important aspects
of this framework are the definition o f the functions o f the Social Cabinet, the establishment of the
PRSP Consultative Council and the Inter-Institutional Technical Support Group, and the creation of
the Poverty Reduction Fund.

94.     Progress also has been made in designing systems to monitor and evaluate the policy
measures, projects, and indicators contemplated in the PRSP. However, these systems are not yet
fully operational and therefore unable to measure achievements against the targets outlined in the
PRSPs. There i s a general recognition that PRSP M&E indicators need to be improved both in
relation to implementation, as well as results and impact. Also, mechanisms for measuring PRSP
progress at the regional and local levels are generally absent.

95.     The delivery o f basic services needs to incorporate social accountability.              The
participatory mechanisms at all levels need to be strengthened to include more stakeholder
involvement in the strategy's implementation and monitoring. In the context o f improving the
impact o f provision o f basic services (such as health and education), the customers w i l l be
regularly consulted on the quality o f those services. This process w i l l help providers to identify
deficiencies that need correction and also allow the customers (particularly in poorer and isolated
regions) to know what services and standards they are entitled to.

96.      In spite o f efforts to make the PRSP a more participatory process, there remains a pressing
need to further involve all stakeholders in the Strategy's development and monitoring through
participatory mechanisms at the national, sectoral, and local levels. This shift would entail
systematizing the PRSP participatory process through consultations with communities to identify
priorities, complemented b y the involvement of stakeholders in designing and implementing the
strategy's programs. As part of this effort, consultative processes should be more continuous, in
order to have a real impact on guiding and implementing the PRSP.

97.     T o strengthen the Govemment's capacity for M&E and consultation o f the poverty
reduction strategy, several studies have been undertaken. In this context, the Government has
begun an intensive effort to link the design of sector programs with the PRSP goals, to introduce
modern and transparent reporting systems o f information related to the PRSP, to decentralize the
PRSP's implementation, and to strengthen stakeholder participation in its development and
implementation. This process i s receiving technical support principally from the World Bank and
IDB.

I V A. Monitoring and Evaluation.

98.      The Government of Honduras has completed the first PRSP Progress Report (PRSP-PR),
presented to the Boards o f the Bank and IMF in February 2004. The document was reviewed and
approved b y the PRSP Consultative Council and b y the Social Cabinet of the Government of
Honduras. The PRSP-PR maintains the same fundamental vision o f the PRSP and adequately
prioritizes three main policy areas for PRSP implementation, namely, restoring economic
dynamism and employment generation, development o f human capital, and justice and personal
security.    In parallel, it outlines an implementation strategy based on clearly identified
commitments to define concrete results on poverty reduction during the 2003-05 period. These
commitments include developing a programmatic sector-wide approach to implementation, and
targeting criteria on the most vulnerable sectors o f society. In order to strengthen this PRSP
reporting process, Congress has ratified an amended version o f the "Ley de Fondo para la
Reduccidn de la Pobreza". The law helps to institutionalize a system o f M&E while also
promoting stakeholder participation. The Government plans to complete a second PRSP-PR b y

early 2005, to include data on the 2004 total executed public expenditure and PRSP spending b y
program, source, and economic classification. In addition, the Government w i l l submit quarterly
tables (at least 2 for 2005) showing total public expenditure and PRSP spending to the Bank and
other stakeholders. For future years, the government plans to produce PRSP progress reports on an
annual basis, in addition to quarterly tables reporting total public expenditure and PRSP spending.

99.     The Presidential Secretariat's Technical Support Unit (UNAT), in i t s role as Technical
Secretariat of the Social Cabinet, i s responsible for the PRSP's M&E process. However, the
success o f this process depends on the following institutions maintaining their roles and
coordinating their efforts: (i) National Statistics Bureau (INE), which w i l l be responsible for
                                the
providing information on social indicators; (ii) Central Bank o Honduras (BCH), which w i l l be
                                                the                 f
                                                                         i ithe
responsible for providing information on macroeconomic indicators; ( i ) Ministry o Finance
                                                                                          f
(MOF), which w i l l be responsible for providing information on the physical and financial progress
of PRSP programs and projects through SIAFI; and (iv) the rest o the public sector (including
                                                                      f
municipalities) which w i l l be the main sources of information on intermediate indicators and the
progress o f programs and projects at the national and local level.

100.       T o make the PRSP M&E processes operational, an integrated indicator system for the
poverty reduction strategy (SIERP) i s being developed to ensure that social programs share
common objectives and technical instruments. SIERP w i l l help to guarantee transparent and high
quality actions, as well as evaluation o f their impact on living conditions in the context of the PRSP
goals. Complementing SIERP w i l l be the Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIA), which
study the social impact o f Government policies, programs, and projects. T o date, a satisfactory
plan for implementation of the SIERP has been achieved that includes the definition of impact
indicator and intermediate indicator tables; the design o f a monitoring plan for indicators; and the
design o f a mechanism for sharing and getting feedback on the results. By 2005, SIERP i s
expected to be fully functional at the national level and provide disaggregated information for
municipalities in at least five departments. In addition, the first comprehensive household survey
w i l l be conducted, with the results used to achieve two PSIAs. In 2006, SIERP w i l l include
disaggregated information for municipalities in the remaining departments and at least four PSIAs
in total w i l l be carried out.

101.     The Government, in close collaboration with civil society, has designed a plan for
community monitoring o f the quality and impact of the provision of basic services. A system of
"citizen report cards" w i l l be instrumental in carrying out this exercise in social accountability. T o
date, the plan for community monitoring o f quality and impact o f the provision education and
health services has been approved and initiated with the hiring o f consultants to begin survey
instrument development and pilot design. For 2005, the first phase o f the community monitoring
program w i l l be evaluated and plans for scaling-up finalized, including the design o f redress
mechanisms. The government plans to have the community-monitoring program o f basic services
institutionalized and implemented in all strategic sectors by 2006.


I V B. Consultation and Public Information

102.    Consultations on the Government's PRSP-PR with civil society organizations and the
international donor community were held between March and M a y 2003, with the objective of
obtaining feedback on the implementation of the PRSP. The Government previously had agreed
with the Consultative Council (Consejo Consultivo) and the sector coordination groups ("Mesas
Sectoriales ") on a consultation strategy to facilitate description, reflection, analysis and
documentation of the process. The results o f the consultations are recorded in a report titled:



                                                   39
Informe de Resultados de la Consulta del Informe del Primer AHo de Avance y Actualizacidn de la
Estrategia para la Reduccidn de la Pobreza14 that can be found on the web site o f the Presidential
Secretariat. This web site also includes a description of the consultative process. The final version
o f the PRSP-PR incorporates many o f the suggestions made during the consultations, such as a
revised macroeconomic framework, strengthened sections on statistics and PRSP result and impact
indicators, and the recalibration o f some of the PRSP's original goals. During 2005-06, the
Consultative Council and the sector coordination groups w i l l hold regular meetings and continue to
improve the consultation strategy. Changes made to the consultative strategy w i l l be recorded in
the PRSP-PRs. In addition, the Government i s planning to submit in 2005 a new law to Congress
on the disclosure o f public information, which promotes stakeholder participation in monitoring o f
public policies b y providing citizens with the right to information.

103.     In order to heighten public awareness on the PRSP process, the reports, minutes of the
consultations, and other relevant material w i l l be posted on UNAT's web site. The Government i s
planning to begin an information campaign to disseminate the PRS goals and targets in 2005, and
as o f 2006, include versions o f the PRSP reports for mass distribution via print, radio, and other
media.

Triggers for PRSC I1

107. The Bank's decision to proceed with subsequent PRSC operations would be based on the
completion of triggers proposed in each operation for i t s successor. The proposed triggers for
PRSC I1 build on reforms identified in the CAS for movement to the high case, under which the
PRSC I1i s foreseen:

   Maintained an adequate macroeconomic framework.

                         C. Implementation and Monitoring Arrangements

109.     Overall responsibility for the implementation o f the PRSC w i l l rest with the Office o f the
Presidency, under the general oversight of the Minister o f the Presidency supported b y the
Presidential Technical Support Unit (UNAT). A task force comprising senior officials of the
different government ministries and agencies championing the reforms included in the PRSC
would meet regularly to monitor progress. In addition, the Government would prepare annual
PRSP progress reports including, inter alia: (i) overall assessment o f the macroeconomic
                                                      an
situation and poverty reduction; (ii) explanation of the status of compliance with prior actions
                                       an
                                      i iinformation on progress in achieving the intermediate targets
and triggers in the current PRSC; ( i )
and results indicators contained in the policy matrix; and (iv) a review o f public expenditures
providing information and analysis on the major expenditure aggregates, with emphasis on the
relationship between poverty reduction and budget allocations and execution. Finally, the Bank,
working closely with the IMF, IDB and other major external partners, would meet at least quarterly
with the Ministry o f the Presidency and the Government Task Force to review progress and assist
as needed in addressing emerging issues.

110.     In addition to coordination and monitoring arrangements, the Government and the Bank
have agreed on the use of several lending instruments to help carry out the reform actions indicated
in the policy matrix. In the first instance, the Bank's portfolio of ongoing operations contains
several investment projects pertaining to virtually all o f the key action areas included in the PRSC
(see Box C). In each instance, project coordinators on the Government side and Bank task team
leaders are full members o f the PRSC teams and have agreed to use project funds to finance
necessary technical assistance or other necessary support to accomplish agreed actions.
Supervision b y the Bank of the PRSC's sectoral aspects w i l l be carried out in conjunction with the
supervision o f the associated investment operations. Secondly, a number o f donor operations,
notably IDB operations in the areas of fiscal management, decentralization, forestry and energy are
providing support for the achievement o f key PRSC benchmarks. Lastly, the PRSTAC i s being
prepared in parallel with this operation and w i l l provide appropriate support with respect to the
public sector management, governance and participation aspects o f the PRSC matrix. While the
PRSC TAC becomes effective, support for PRSC Iactions has been provided from the ongoing
E M F T A C in many of these areas, while sector specific actions have been supported b y ongoing
Bank- and other donor-assisted projects.

111. Section N in the Policy Matrix, Monitoring and Evaluation o f the Poverty Reduction
Strategy, focuses on impacts on the ground, particularly related to basic service delivery. As noted
above, agreement has been reached between GOH and IDA to integrate participatory processes
focusing on social accountability, with direct involvement o f communities. Existing indicators and
monitoring processes for the PRSP provide a basis for monitoring poverty and social aspects
disaggregated b y appropriate categories such as gender, ethnicity, urban / rural, and other criteria.
The annual monitoring and reporting of the PRSP w i l l incorporate findings from these initiatives,
and be discussed with IDA and reflected in the PRSC supervision reports.

                                     D. Credit Administration

112. The borrower would be the Republic of Honduras. The credit would be for an amount of
US$58.8 million equivalent, on standard IDA terms to be disbursed in a single tranche. The
closing date for the Credit would be June 2005. A subsequent PRSC for an amount o f about
US$60 million equivalent would be prepared for Board presentation in mid-2005, provided triggers
for the high case lending scenario are met.

113. With respect to thefiduciary aspects of the credit, the recently concluded C F A A and draft
CPAR have identified a number of strengths and weaknesses o f Honduras' financial management
and procurement systems. These reports provide sufficient comfort to proceed with the proposed
operation. Further, the PRSC itself would be the main vehicle for the Bank to support the CFAA
and CPAR policy recommendations for improving public financial management and public
procurement in Honduras, while the PRSC T A C would provide financial and technical assistance
to implement the actions agreed on with Government.

114. The Credit w i l l follow IDA'S simplified disbursement procedures for adjustment
operations. Disbursement w i l l not be linked to any specific purchases and no procurement
requirements would be needed. Once the Credit i s approved b y the Board, the Borrower would
open and maintain a dedicated deposit account in U S Dollars for the Borrower's use. IDA w i l l
disburse the proceeds o f the credit into the deposit account. If the proceeds of the Credit or any
part thereof are used for ineligible purposes, as defined in the Development Credit Agreement, IDA
w i l l require the Borrower to either return the amount to the deposit account for use for eligible
purposes or refund the amount directly to IDA. The deposit account in U S dollars would be
maintained in the Central Bank and i t s transactions and balances fully incorporated into the
Government's accounting records and financial statements, via the integrated financial
management system (SUFI).

                       E. Environmental and Social Development Aspects

115. The proposed PRSC program has been accorded a Category "C" environmental rating.
Nonetheless, an analysis of environmental and social issues has been prepared that links existing
country project safeguard processes to the PRSC (see Annex 7). The safeguard assessment found
that active Bank projects have strengthened the country's environmental regulatory and
management capacity, which w i l l support implementation o f the PRSP.            Additionally, the
safeguard assessment indicates that the structure for public consultation and information developed
during the preparation o f the government's PRSP w i l l support the social development aspects of
PRSC implementation.

 116. The policies and measures supported under the PRSC directly address issues of poverty,
inequality and social exclusion in Honduras. The social protection components are targeted at l o w
income families; more transparent financial accountability and transparency i s expected to
particularly benefit the poor whose access to basic services and other opportunities has been
constrained in the past; and the focus on land rights and access w i l l address the insecurity o f tenure
the poor have suffered, in particular for indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups. Identification of
these measures has been based on lessons learned from existing operations, recently-completed
formal and informal ESW, and through consultations with various stakeholders including primary
beneficiaries.

117. The program i s not expected to produce adverse impacts on poor or vulnerable groups. On
the contrary, the measures supported are designed to provide more effective and equitable benefits


                                                   46
for the poor. While there may be a real or perceived adverse impact on more powerful groups who
have captured a disproportionate share of benefits in the past, this i s being addressed as part of the
risk mitigation efforts (see section below on risks).

118.    Gender aspects have been considered and discussed, and although the policies and
measures in the PRSC do not contain activities specifically targeted at women, the programs are
designed to ensure that poor and vulnerable groups, including women, benefit fully. Particular
focus on gender concerns i s included in the area o f property rights, where Government i s
committed to promoting joint titling in cases where property i s occupied by a man and a woman.
In addition, the basic health package contains interventions aimed at promoting maternal health,
including reproductive health services. Finally, the community nutrition program (AIN-C) i s
targeted to children and women in the poorest municipalities. Monitoring o f these and other
aspects o f the PRSC w i l l be done with disaggregated data designed to identify outcomes and
impacts for different groups, including gender differences.

       F. Coordination and Consultations with External Partners and Other Stakeholders

119. Preparation of the PRSC has been closely coordinated with other external partners active in
Honduras. Numerous consultations have taken place with the IMF on the amount, timing, and
content o f the operation and a joint review was undertaken o f the PRSP-PR, on which t h i s
operation i s based. There has also been an extremely close working relationship with the IDB on
the design o f the PRSC's policy benchmarks and in the design of investment operations pertaining
to the areas covered by the matrix. As noted earlier, analysis of Honduras' fiduciary environment
was undertaken jointly b y the Bank and IDB and each institution i s providing support for the
implementation of recommendations through closely coordinated, parallel TA operations.           A
number o f bilateral donors including DFID, SIDA, CIDA, and the German Financial Cooperation
Agency have also been participating closely with the Government and the Bank in the design o f
selected aspects of the PRSC and i t s accompanying PRSTAC. Two of these agencies, DFID and
SIDA, are co-financing the PRSTAC. In addition, the German Financial Cooperation Agency and
SIDA participated in the appraisal o f PRSC I  and while their funding cycles did not permit co- or
parallel financing of this operation, they have indicated strong interest in supporting PRSC I1 and
other future PRSC operations. More broadly, Government has made presentations o f the PRSC
policy matrix to the full G-15 donor group in Honduras and requested the support o f i t s members
for the PRSPPRSC process.

120. Discussions have also been held with various c i v i l society groups. International NGOs as
well as local civil society organizations have been consulted on the approach. Their views have
been reflected particularly in the sections on monitoring and evaluation, and consultation and
public information. It has been agreed that civil society involvement w i l l be strengthened during
the implementation o f the PRSC, with improved disclosure o f information and continued
participation b y key stakeholder groups, particularly at the community level, in implementation.

                                               G. Risks

121. While the strategies underlying the actions contained in the PRSC matrix are generally
well-designed and promise to accelerate progress toward achievement of PRSP targets and MDGs,
the program remains a risky one in a number of respects.

122. The principal risk relates to the fragile political environment in Honduras. In particular,
with presidential elections approaching in late 2005, there i s considerable risk that the Government
could face escalating pressures from the political opposition andor public sector unions for non-


                                                  47
poverty reducing expenditures, which could prevent fiscal targets from being met and derail the
Government's macroeconomic program. T o address this risk, the authorities w i l l need to sustain
the momentum generated for economic reform through the national dialogue via continuous
consensus-building with key stake-holders and implementation o f i t s communication strategy with
the broader public. The Government w i l l also need to develop fiscal contingency plans
incorporating scenkios with lower-than-envisaged concessional financing and the potential fiscal
costs o f the financial sector reforms currently underway. The IMF, Bank and IDB w i l l jointly
provide close monitoring o f the fiscal situation, identify early warning signs and assist the
authorities in implementing fiscal contingency measures as appropriate.

 123. The fragilities o f the financial system could also pose significant risks to achievement of
the PRSP (and, hence, PRSC) goals. The government w i l l need to implement as planned i t s
financial system reform to adequately address the vulnerabilities identified in the 2003 FSAP.
Thus far, the Government appears to be staying the course, assisted b y support from the IMF under
i t s PRGF and b y the Bank, through i t s Financial Sector TA Credit and ongoing preparations of a
proposed FSAC.

124. While growth projections appear attainable in light of the economic and structural policies
laid out b y Government, slippages in program implementation as well as worse-than-expected
external conditions and natural disasters could result in lower growth and slower poverty reduction.

125. From a political perspective, there may be a risk in the form o f active or passive resistance
from groups who see their privileges reduced, such as unions or individuals who have benefited
from unequal distribution or capture of benefits in the past. This risk, which i s considered
moderate at present, could increase over the next year as the country moves towards the next
Presidential election. Distributional impacts of the reform processes, and different stakeholders'
likely reactions, w i l l be addressed through the ongoing PSIAs and through further consultations
with key stakeholder groups, with the aim of discussing alternatives and designing mitigation
strategies if required. In parallel, consistent implementation b y Government o f i t s ongoing
communications strategy would help broaden understanding o f i t s development agenda and
contribute to building public support for the reforms.

126. Finally, institutional risks to program implementation are posed b y weaknesses in
government financial management, weak audit functions and constrained capacity in line
ministries. As indicated earlier, these r i s k s are being addressed b y the provision o f significant
technical assistance and other support b y the Bank and IDB under ongoing and proposed
operations, including the PRSTAC.

Mr. James D.Wolfensohn
President
International Development Association
1818, H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433

Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
Iam writing to request, on behalf o f the Government o f the Republic o f Honduras, a Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) o f US$58.73 million equivalent in support o f our poverty
reduction strategy, which i s described in the paper titled Honduras Poverty Reduction Strategy
(HPRS) which was submitted to the Boards o f the International Development Association (IDA)
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April, 2001.
This letter describes the principal actions that the Government plans to undertake in the period
2004-2006 to implement the strategy. I t i s based on the Honduras Poverty Reduction Strategy
Implementation Plan, 2004-2006, which has been widely consulted with c i v i l society and donors
and w i l l be presented to the Consultative Group meeting scheduled for June 2004 in Tegucigalpa.
In addition, Irefer to the "PSRC Policy matrix" which was prepared in collaboration with the
IDA team and other donors and which sets out in summary fashion part o f the actions to be taken
during 2004-2006. The actions and outputs shown in bold type in the matrix are the most
important o f these and we therefore suggest that they be used as benchmarks for the PRSC.
Background and recent developments
Honduras committed itself in 2001 to an ambitious program to reduce poverty, including a
commitment to reach the Millennium Development Goals b y 2015. The Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS) was widely consulted and achieved broad consensus support from c i v i l society
and donors. When our Government took office in 2002, it took the firm decision to adopt the PRS
as the center-pin o f the administration's program.
Progress on the implementation of the PRS was delayed by the failure to meet the goals o f the
IMF program in 2001. This, coupled with the long process o f negotiation to reach a new
agreement with the IMF, has reduced the amount o f external support available to Honduras and
led to a delay in reaching HIPC completion point. The fiscal imbalance also led to a reduction in
the availability o f internal resources for the PRS. These factors led to disappointing outcomes on
several PRS outcomes in 2002, which were documented in the PRS Progress Report presented to
the Board of the IMF and the IDA in February 2004.
During 2003, the government worked with civil society and donors to develop a Poverty
Reduction Strategy Implementation Plan for 2004-2006, which w i l l be presented to the
Consultative Group, which meets in Tegucigalpa in June 2004. The Plan presents a national
transformation program that includes decisive actions in the fields o f governance, equitable
economic growth and increased investment directed towards improving living conditions and
opportunities for poor families.
An essential tenet o f the Implementation Plan i s to strengthen the rule o f law and our democracy,
including measures to fight delinquency and corruption. We aim to increase the GDP growth rate
based on strengthening governance, a healthy macroeconomic policy, reforms to the financial



                                                                                                     1
system, conclusion o f trade negotiations to improve our access to other markets and actions to
strengthen our competitiveness.
Within this framework, the programming o f national resources and donor support w i l l be
strengthened to ensure that Honduras w i l l attain the goals o f the PRS. Actions w i l l be intensified
to implement assistance programs for poor families in the rural and urban areas o f the country, to
improve their access to means of production, especially land and credit; to increase their human
capital through actions in education and health; and strengthen the social protection o f the most
vulnerable groups. We w i l l also implement reforms to assure the sustainability o f the strategy.
The PRS ImplementationPlan
The Implementation Plan contemplates actions in each o f the six Pillars identified as critical in
the PRS: growth with equity; rural poverty reduction; urban poverty reduction; human capital;
support to vulnerable groups and measures to ensure the sustainability o f the strategy. The
following paragraphs outline the main tenets o f the plan.

        -
Pillar 1 Economic growth with equity
The f i r s t pillar o f the PRS proposes to raise economic growth to levels consistent with a rapid and
substantive reduction in poverty, o f at least 4.5% annual increase in GDP (2% in per capita
terms), and to achieve a stronger linkage from growth to poverty reduction.
The performance o f the Honduran GDP was disappointing in 200 1-2002, due to the unfavorable
changes in the terms o f trade (low coffee and high petroleum prices) and due to the deterioration
o f the macro-fiscal area. The insufficiency of economic growth was widely commented on by
those consulted during 2003 about the progress o f the PRS, and the Government has decided to
give a high priority to this pillar o f the strategy in the 2004-2006 Implementation Plan.
Despite the persistence o f unfavorable terms o f trade, the situation improved in 2003, thanks to
adjustments in macroeconomic policies, together with structural reforms in international trade,
competitiveness and in the financial sector, and a strong upsurge in the maquila, tourism and
agriculture sectors. These factors allowed growth to recover to 3.2% in 2003 and i t i s expected to
reach between 3.5% and 4.0% in 2004.
The focus o f the economic growth pillar w i l l change somewhat during 2004-2006. Previously,
emphasis was given to macroeconomic policy and the structural reforms o f laws and policies to
improve the investment climate. Without underestimating the importance o f these components,
the 2004-2006 PRS plan o f action envisions giving a higher priority to investments in
infrastructure to correct the large deficit in quality and coverage o f services. These investments
are fundamental to accelerating GDP growth, to preparing Honduras to compete effectively in the
C A F T A environment and to creating more economic opportunities for the poor.
Thus, the main policies in the field o f growth are centered on the macroeconomic program agreed
with the IMF; the government's competitiveness program (including actions for administrative
simplification, a new competitiveness law, financial sector reforms and reforms to the property
register); and investments in the infrastructure sectors to take advantage o f the market
opportunities opened up b y the CAFTA agreement between Central America and the USA.

Macroeconomic program
The fulfillment o f the macroeconomic program included in the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility supported by the IMF, including the goal o f increased expenditure for fighting poverty,
w i l l allow the HIPC process to reach completion point in the first quarter o f 2005 and w i l l
provide a stable and favorable macroeconomic framework for private investment.




                                                                                                       2
Growth targets
I t i s expected that GDP growth w i l l recover to at least 3.5% in 2004, 4% in 2005 and 4.5% in
2006. Per-capita growth w i l l reach an annual 2.2% in 2006 - which, if the redistributive and
equitable focus o f fiscal programs i s maintained, should allow a substantial reduction in poverty
and extreme poverty, in line with the planned goals, reaching 57% and 38.5%, respectively, for
2006.

Fiscal targets
The Central Government deficit w i l l go down from 5.5% o f the GDP in 2003, to 3.5% in 2004,
3% in 2005 and 2.5% in 2006, and the consolidated deficit (including the Central Government
and public companies), w i l l decrease to 1.7% of the GDP in this same year. Spending on poverty
reduction i s programmed to grow from 7.5% o f GDP in 2003 to 8.1% in 2004, 8.7% in 2005 and
9.3% in 2006.

State re-engineering and tax administration
In addition to tax and salary adjustments that have already been implemented to improve income,
reduce consumption spending and control the growth o f the government wage bill, we have
begun a State re-engineering process, which w i l l produce savings worth 0.2% o f GDP in 2005
and 0.4% in 2006 by rationalizing the Ministries o f Education, Health and Agriculture. In the
field o f tax administration, a project to reform the Tax Code w i l l shortly be sent to the National
Congress, establishing mechanisms that w i l l facilitate tax payments and establish more severe
sanctions for fraud and evasion, together with a complementary project to create tax tribunals.
The national registry o f tax payers w i l l be renovated and internal customs w i l l be eliminated,
concentrating supervision on the customs offices at the principal entry points to the country.
These measures w i l l allow an increase in tax revenues from 16.6% o f GDP in 2003 up to 17.5%
in 2004.

Monetary and exchange policy
The monetary and exchange policy o f the Central Bank o f Honduras (BCH) seeks to reduce
inflation from 6.7% in 2004 to 5% in the 2006. The exchange rate w i l l continue to be managed as
a band that w i l l be adjusted to reflect the difference between national and international inflation.
The level o f international reserves o f the BCH w i l l remain above four months o f imports. This
monetary program - coupled with a reduced fiscal deficit - i s consistent with an increase in real
terms o f credit to the private sector, to motivate private investment. The principal tool o f
monetary policy w i l l continue to be the weekly auctions o f the Monetary Absorption Certificates
(CAM) o f the BCH. The dollarization o f the financial system w i l l continue to be discouraged b y
maintaining the reserve and compulsory deposit requirements related to foreign currency deposits
at their present levels.
The B C H w i l l be recapitalized, and a plan o f action w i l l be developed to gradually incorporate
into the national budget the quasi-fiscal losses that arise from the operating costs o f open market
operations. The BCH's operation as the lender o f last resort w i l l be reformed to assure that
liquidity support to the financial system i s provided through short term loans with the highest
interest rate in the system. The payment system w i l l be improved to separate those o f high and
low value and to modernize the payment infrastructure. In order to improve the transparency o f
monetary policy the full audited financial statements o f the B C H w i l l be published.

Competitiveness and the investment climate
The Government believes that a sound macroeconomic framework must be complemented b y
actions to improve our competitiveness in order to trigger rapid and inclusive growth. The
National Competitiveness Program w i l l strengthen the investment climate to foster private


                                                                                                     3
investment in sectors with high potential such as tourism, agro-forestry industries, commercial
agriculture and maquila.

Administrative simplijkation
A central theme in this effort w i l l be to continue with the simplification and reduction in the costs
o f the administrative processes associated with business operations. We have reduced the time
needed to set up a limited liability company in Tegucigalpa from 129 days in 2002 to 62 days in
the first half o f 2004. We plan to achieve an additional reduction o f 15% in the time required to
set up a business in 2005 and again in 2006. Additionally, in 2004 Action Plans w i l l be developed
to simplify the administration in three Central Government Institutions and in three
municipalities; these plans w i l l be implemented in 2005. This pilot program w i l l be increased to
include more institutions and municipalities in 2006.

Competition law
The legal framework for competition also needs to be strengthened to ensure fair opportunities for
all businesses and to protect consumers. In 2004, a Competition L a w w i l l be sent to the National
Congress, to regulate anti-competitive and monopolistic practices. At the same time, the
strengthening o f labor training systems w i l l continue; and improvements in the administration of
justice w i l l be promoted through reforms to the Civil Procedural Code, which w i l l promote oral,
public hearings.

Financial system
T o strengthen the financial system, we have asked the National Congress to approve reforms to
strengthen prudential norms and bank supervision, including consolidated supervision. The fight
against financial crime w i l l continue, including money laundering and the financing o f terrorism.
Regarding effective regulation, the reserve for loan losses w i l l be strengthened and capitalization
ratios in line with the Base1 norms w i l l be established for 2006. The levels o f related lending w i l l
be gradually improved. Transparency rules w i l l be applied to improve the accountability of bank
boards o f directors. The National Banking and Insurance Commission (CNBS) w i l l promote a
legal reform to consolidate i t s autonomy and to assume the remaining supervision functions that
are s t i l l under the BCH. The CNBS' capacity for imposing sanctions to financial entities that do
not comply with the norms w i l l be strengthened and a special framework w i l l be established for
supervision o f banks in difficulty.
In order to assure the security o f the financial network while at the same time limiting "moral
hazard" the Government w i l l re-capitalize the Deposit Insurance Fund (FOSEDE) with funds
recovered from Government loans made previously to banks in trouble. The process for insolvent
bank liquidation or fusion w i l l be strengthened, placing greater emphasis on early detection of
their problems; and multilateral and bilateral cooperation to fight financial crime w i l l also be
strengthened. T o this end, the following laws w i l l be sent to the National Congress: a new
Financial Institutions Law, and reforms to the laws o f Deposits Insurance Fund, o f the CNBS, of
the BCH and o f the Penal Code.

Property Registry
Land tenure insecurity - both urban and rural - continues to be an important obstacle to private
investment in Honduras. I t i s estimated that only 30% o f the 2.6 million lots in the country have
been registered in the Property Registry. The great majority o f land occupied by the poor i s not
registered. I t has been estimated that incorporating these lots into the Registry could increase by
more than US$12 billion the amount o f real estate values available to guarantee financial
operations, thereby spurring economic development, especially for the poor.



                                                                                                         4
T o this end i t i s urgent to reform the registry within a spatial framework (real register) that would
exclude overlapping and double registry, by combining in a single institution the functions o f
registry and cadastre. This new institution w i l l be part o f the Executive branch, allowing the
Judiciary to concentrate on i t s essential function o f administering justice.
These changes w i l l be achieved through the approval o f the Property L a w which i s being debated
b y Congress at this moment. When i t has been approved, a program w i l l begin for titling the
property rights o f the poor, o f the population settled on national lands (including forests) and o f
indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups.

Infrastructure
A central component o f the PRS in 2004-2006 i s the promotion o f public and private investments
in economic infrastructure (ports, highways, telecommunications, and electricity) to improve
coverage and quality o f services. Additionally, steps w i l l be taken to improve the regulation o f
these services.

Ports
The high cost and long delays in Puerto CortCs reduce the country's competitiveness. The
inefficiency o f the port i s an obstacle to meeting the growing demand, and the lack o f compliance
to international security norms threatens to hamper the export o f products from Honduras,
Nicaragua and El Salvador to the U.S. market. In the coming weeks, Puerto Cortes w i l l be
certified to comply with international port security requirements. A new General Ports Law w i l l
shortly be approved and an action plan w i l l be initiated to improve the port efficiency, using as
far as possible, private capital in an efficient regulatory framework.

Highways
In the context of CAFTA, the Honduran highway network i s a vital link between national
production centers and regional and global markets. Improving road communication links w i l l be
the key to the successful insertion of the less developed sectors o f the country in this process. The
Government proposes an ambitious plan to strengthen both rural roads and the primary and
secondary network, to improve access from the west, center, east and south o f the country to the
north coast outlets to the Mexican and North American markets, and to facilitate agricultural
exports towards the Salvadoran and regional market. The sustainability o f the sector w i l l be
assured through an amplified maintenance program including the use where necessary o f tolls.
The sustainability o f the rural roads sub-sector w i l l be supported with the establishment o f an
institutionalized mechanism for the maintenance o f roads b y the municipalities. The
improvements w i l l be supported b y a rural infrastructure program, based on municipal
development plans and with municipal administration o f the project cycle.
In the primary and secondary network, in 2004-2006 an investment program estimated in US$
460 million w i l l be implemented, including: the construction o f the San Antonio-Goascaran link
(called the "dry canal"), the link from Puerto Cortes to the Guatemala border; and improvements
in the sections between Villanueva, Tegucigalpa, Choluteca and the borders o f El Salvador and
Nicaragua.
In order to strengthen the sustainability o the oflcial network, the Government w i l l increase
                                              f
financing for maintenance through the Highway Fund, with a goal o f providing for 60% coverage
o f the network in 2004; 70% in 2005 and 75% in 2006. In order to strengthen the incomes o f poor
rural families, the number o f micro enterprises in road maintenance w i l l be increased from 55 in
2004 to 60 in 2005 and 70 in 2006.




                                                                                                      5
    Telecommunications
    Telecommunications are a key element in the country's competitiveness. Delays in the
    development o f this sector have had very negative impacts. Honduras s t i l l has a "tele-density"
    that i s among the lowest in the region (5.8 lines per 100 inhabitants in 2003), with more than
    300,000 wait- listed. The costs o f international calls are very high.
'
    In 2003 the Government began the liberalization o f this sector, which w i l l be completed b y
    December o f 2005. I t has made major investments in the national fiber optic network linking the
    Atlantic and Pacific coasts; a second mobile phone concession has been let though a competitive
    international bidding process, and it has authorized the liberalization o f the national and local
    calls market through the "Telephones for All" program (delivered through private operators
    without exclusivity and charging freely determined tariffs). It i s expected that the number o f fixed
    lines in the country w i l l be duplicated in the next two years, including a large increase in lines in
    low-income communities..
    T o strengthen planning and policy development in the sector and to assure the inclusion o f poor
    communities, a Telecommunications Cabinet has been created with the support o f a Technical
    Secretariat. A universal access policy i s being developed with the goal for 2006 to establish
    telephone services in at least 1,000 o f the 3,000 communities o f 500 or more inhabitants that
    presently lack this service. This initiative w i l l be financed with part o f the income from the canon
    for use o f the radio-electric spectrum. The internal restructuring o f HONDUTEL w i l l continue to
    prepare i t to compete in a liberalized market beginning in December 2005, including
    improvements in internal efficiency and the gradual alignment o f the tariffs with efficient costs in
    all the segments o f the market.

    Electrical energy
    Another source o f economic inefficiency and poverty in Honduras has been the inefficiency and
    low coverage o f electrical energy. Power cuts and brown-outs have inflicted heavy losses on
    private enterprises. The government has acted to correct this situation, increasing installed
    generation capacity to meet the growth o f demand (7% annually). The cost o f service has also
    been high, due to contracting small generating plants with costs per kilowatt-hour (kwh) o f up to
    US$O. 15/kwh and due also to high technical and commercial losses in transmission and
    distribution (above 20%.)
    Although the existing laws provide for tariffs to reflect costs, these inefficiencies have not been
    fully transferred to the tariff, resulting in heavy losses for ENEE, contributing to the fiscal deficit
    and crowding out spending on poverty reduction programs. Although service coverage has
    improved considerably, reaching 66% in 2003, 34% o f households s t i l l do not enjoy this service
    and the great majority o f these are poor. At the same time, the marginal costs o f expanding rural
    coverage are becoming greater and a sustainable model i s needed.
    The Government's strategy for 2004-2006 i s centered on expanding the generation capacity b y
    420 MW b y contracts to the private generators - who w i l l invest US$460 million in the sector - at
    very competitive prices (around US$0.05 per kwh, depending on o i l prices). This w i l l reduce
    dependence on the inefficient small plants that have increased the cost o f the service.
    Adjustments w i l l continue to be implemented in the tariff to compensate ENEE for fluctuations in
    o i l prices; and in 2004 work w i l l begin to separate the ENEE businesses ( at present vertically
    integrated) into strategic business units (generation, transmission and distribution, including
    regional separation), opening up options for future sector restructuring to increase efficiency.
    A technical unit has been created to support the Energy Cabinet, tasked with designing a plan to
    expand service access (including support to off-grid solutions where appropriate). Coverage goals
    o f 67% in 2004, 69% in 2005 and 71% in 2006 have been established; this implies creating
    25,000 new connections per year with an annual cost o f approximately US$15 million. On the


                                                                                                          6
regulatory front, the independence and technical capacity of the National Energy Commission
w i l l be strengthened with i t s transfer from the Ministry o f Natural Resources and Environment
(SERNA) to the Ministry o f Industry and Trade (SIC).

        -
Pillar 2 Rural poverty reduction
Sustainable rural poverty reduction w i l l depend on the development o f productive activities- both
in agricultural as in non-agricultural fields - to generate greater income for the rural population o f
the country. The successful conclusion o f the C A F T A negotiation between Central America and
the U.S.A. at the beginning o f 2004 has given renewed urgency to the strengthening o f the
competitive sectors of the rural economy. Even though a strong asymmetry was negotiated,
Honduras must immediately initiate a transformation o f the rural economy, moving i t s resources
(land, capital and people) towards more competitive crops with higher added-value to take
advantage of the market opportunities that w i l l be opened up by CAFTA.
T o facilitate the process, as coordination bodies, the Mesa Agricola and more recently the Mesa
Agro-Forestal have been set up. As part o f the process a national plan w i l l be developed to
support hillside farmers and communities situated in forest areas to maximize the effectiveness o f
the support. In this context, the main PRS measures for 2004-2006 in support of the rural
economy are the following.

Productive infrastructure and support to the competitive sector
The government w i l l foster investments in irrigation and support the development o f crops and
technologies that would transform the productive potential o f the land. Between 2004 and 2006,
irrigation systems w i l l be established in 13,500 hectares at a cost o f US$59 million. This
represents an increase o f 600% compared to what has achieved in 2002-2003 and an even greater
increase compared with the period before 2002.

Support to hillside farmers
Through the programs o f the National Sustainable Development Program (PRONADERS),
support w i l l be provided for sustainable land management and strategies to strengthen income
and livelihoods o f the poor rural families farming on degraded soils and high gradients. An
updated national plan for extension and support services for these farmers w i l l be developed, for
implementation in 2005-2006. The strengthening o f the Nontraditional Rural Financing System
(Cajas Rurales) w i l l increase the financing opportunities for farmers.

Land policy and technical assistance
In order to support the 250 thousand poor rural families that have no access to land, a Land Policy
w i l l be developed, using market-based tools to facilitate access to land and providing technical
support services o f to the beneficiaries. In this context a Technical Inter-Agency Land
Commission w i l l be created (CTIT) charged with the responsibility o f preparing a land policy.

Forest sector
The forest sector has a high competitive potential, but i t s development has been hindered b y the
lack o f clearly defined tenure rights and by an inadequate legal framework. The sector i s
characterized by illegal logging, and i t s output, employment and exports continue to be far below
i t s potential.
To address this situation, the Government has presented for the approval o f the National Congress
a new Forestry L a w to improve sector regulation, to establish clear rules regarding the roles in the
administration and management o f forests o f the Central Government; the private sector;
community entities and municipal organizations. The law w i l l also define the benefits to be


                                                                                                      7
received b y municipalities and communities from the rational and sustainable use o f the forest.
This reform, together with the law on Territorial Order (approved in 2003) and the Property Law
(being approved at present), w i l l provide a suitable legal base for the development o f the sector.
Parallel to the legal reform, the restructuring o f AFE-COHDEFOR w i l l continue, including: a
new structure for i t s Board of Directors; concentration on i t s technical, normative and regulatory
functions; the reduction o f staff in the central office; and contracting o f environmental NGOs to
support the supervision process.

        -
Pillar 3 Urban poverty reduction
Even though urban rates of poverty and extreme poverty are considerably lower than those in
rural areas, a large proportion o f Hondurans in extreme poverty live in the marginal districts o f
the main cities. The Government w i l l continue with i t s programs to address urban poverty
through initiatives directed towards eliminating marginality and to fostering an ordered, socially
and environmentally sustainable pattern o f urban growth.
The main efforts to be undertaken to fight urban poverty in 2004-2006 include: the expansion o f
low-income housing programs (FUNDEVI and the Housing for People program); intensified
support to the small and medium enterprises (PYMES) sector, including the creation o f a
guarantee fund to stimulate private banks to enter this market; the large-scale registration o f
properties in marginal districts in the framework o f the new Property Law; strengthening security
b y intensifying the Safer Communities program; support to urban youth through bonds and
training to give them an alternative to joining street gangs; a street improvement program o f using
manual labor; a program to establish water services in marginal neighborhoods; and the
                                                                                  n
expansion o f the school lunch program to urban marginal districts. I addition, urban
infrastructure projects w i l l be supported, with financing from the World Bank.

        -
Pillar 4 Human capital

Education
In the medium and long term, poverty reduction w i l l depend on the capacity o f the population to
enter an ever more globalized labor market on favorable terms. For that reason, Honduras places
high priority on the education sector within the PRS framework. The public education system
faces problems o f gaps in coverage, low quality and inefficiency.

Primary coverage
In primary schooling, even though there are sufficient places available in principle to meet the
demand, many are wasted due to grade repetition and the distribution o f available places does not
fit with that o f the population. Although 90% o f children between 7 and 12 years attend school,
only 70% o f the population graduates from sixth grade. National strategy in pre-school and
primary levels (grades 0 to 6) i s centered on the Education For All (EFA) - Fast Track Initiative.
The EFA Initiative contemplates activities to achieve a net enrollment and graduation rates o f
100%.

Secondary coverage
Honduras has a great deficit in the secondary level (grades 7 to 12), that must be corrected in
order to improve the quality o f the labor force. Presently the public sector provides places in
secondary education for 23% o f the population in the relevant cohort for the third cycle (children
aged between 13 and 15 years old) and just 13% o f the population for diversified cycle (children
between 16 and 18 years o f age). Even including private participation, the present net enrollment
in the third cycle i s only 31%, and in fourth cycle, 19%. The PRS goals for 2015 are to raise net
coverage to 70% in third cycle (grades 7 to 9) and that 50% o f the population should graduate


                                                                                                     8
                                         n
from the fourth cycle (grades 10 to 12). I order to achieve these goals i t i s necessary to program
a major expansion o f publicly financed secondary education places.

Quality and eficiency
T o improve pedagogical quality, curricular reform w i l l be implemented; networks w i l l be
established to connect small rural schools and begin the process o f eliminating the phenomenon
o f single-techer schools. Mechanisms o f pedagogical supervision w i l l be reinforced; teacher
training w i l l be reformed; and promotion o f computer science education w i l l be intensified. These
reforms w i l l allow efficiency to improve by reducing the repetition rate, freeing resources to
expand coverage at the secondary level. Our goals in 2004 include establishing the 200 day
school calendar and designing a methodology for multi-center networks between small rural
schools; in 2005 we w i l l have established 33 rural networks in three departments; by 2006: 50
networks w i l l be established in 5 departments.

Donor Coordination and expenditure tracking
T o improve the rationality o f resource allocation in the sector, wherever possible all donor
resources w i l l be reflected in the budget. The donor coordination effort established through the
EFA-FTI for the primary level w i l l continue and coordination mechanisms w i l l be established at
secondary level. From 2005 on, expenditures in the sector w i l l be reported b y educational level,
geographic area and economic classification (salaries, materials, investments) and the spending
programmed in the budget w i l l be consistent with the PRS goals. Special emphasis w i l l be given,
in this context, to programs supporting efficiency and quality; budgetary support programs to help
Honduras address the revenue costs o f providing teachers and support materials needed to attain
the PRS goals; and the financing o f investment programs to upgrade the education sector's
infrastructure, especially regarding access to basic water, sanitation and electricity services.

Community education
Parental participation in the education process w i l l increase with the creation o f the ADEL's to
guarantee the correct usage o f the transfers for the purchase o f educational materials and to
improve the local supervision o f teacher performance. To date, 2,700 ADEL's have been
constituted; in 2005, there w i l l be 4,000 ADEL's and the majority o f the ADEL's w i l l be
handling transfers o f resources to fund their school improvement plans (PECs) and an action plan
w i l l have been designed to improve teacher management in community schools. In 2006, there
w i l l be 5,000 ADEL's, all o f which w i l l be managing resources related their PEC; and the action
plan w i l l have been implemented.

Human resources
The management o f human resources w i l l be strengthened to assure an optimal distribution o f
teachers in relation to the distribution of students, and their salaries w i l l be more effectively
linked to their performance. The education secretariat has published on the Intemet the results o f
the school mapping exercise carried out in 2003 and a complete l i s t b y department o f teachers on
the payroll, according to the Administration System for Human Resources in Teaching
(SIARDH). B y 2005 SIARDH w i l l indicate the education center where each teacher i s really
assigned. B y 2006 the SIARDH input data w i l l be processed directly at Department level.

Health
The rhythm of improvements in primary health outcomes has decreased in recent years. Even
though a vaccination rate o f close to 100% has been maintained, the prenatal consultation rate has
stagnated at 85% and the peri-natal mortality rate has remained stable at 19 per thousand live
births. T o correct this situation, there i s a need to identify mechanisms for reaching remote


                                                                                                       9
communities and to improve the quality o f primary health care services. This w i l l be done as
follows.

Coverage Expansion
A basic health care service package has been designed, for delivery either at health centers or, in
remote areas that do not have health centers, through peripatetic teams organized by qualified
NGO's. The basic package centers on mother and child health and to date, fifteen NGO's have
been qualified to deliver the basic package, benefiting 200,000 people. By 2005, twenty NGO's
w i l l be qualified, 350,000 people w i l l be covered and the supervision and evaluation system for
delivery o f the package w i l l have been established. B y 2006 500,000 people w i l l be covered and
the system w i l l have been adjusted based on the findings o f the first evaluation.

Human resources for health
The personnel management at the Ministry o f Health i s weak. There i s no reliable database
showing where the staff really work; working hours are restricted and there i s a tendency o f
"migration o f posts" to the urban areas. As a result many staff work in places different from the
place where their post i s registered. T o correct these problems a program to improve personnel
management i s being implemented. A staff audit has been completed for 30% o f the personnel to
show where they are really assigned and a ministerial directive has been issued banning
unauthorized transfers o f personnel. In 2005, auditing w i l l be completed o f 100% o f the personnel
and a program for the re-assignment o f personnel in line with the needs o f the system w i l l be
defined; in 2006: the staff reassignment program w i l l be underway and a budget assignment
system w i l l be in place linking salary assignments to workplaces.

         f
Quality o services
A program w i l l be implemented during 2004-2006 to align the primary network ambulatory
facilities with quality and efficiency parameters stipulated b y the SSP in i t s role as the licensing
authority o f the sector. A study o f the Heath Producing Units (UPS) o f the Ministry o f Public
Health (SSP) has revealed serious deficiencies in the quality o f services delivered, due to staffing
shortages and deficient supplies o f medicines, equipment and buildings. The recent agreements to
control salary increases in the sector, combined with actions underway to improve personnel
management, provide a framework within which it i s now possible to address this challenge. In
2004 a staff reassignment plan w i l l be developed to address the most urgent needs, and to
determine the staff increase needed for the system to comply w i t h the norms. In subsequent years
a systematic plan to bring facilities up to scratch w i l l be implemented. In 2005, 40 CESAR's, 10
CESAMO's and 2 hospitals improved to the level stipulated in the norms; by 2006: 100
CESAR's, 50 CESAMO's and 5 hospitals w i l l have been improved.

Nutrition
The degree o f malnourishment has decreased in the past decade. In 2001, 33% o f children
between 1 and 5 years registered deficiency in their height for age ("stunting"), compared to
37.8% in 1996. Nevertheless, this level i s s t i l l very high and i s a high priority goal o f the PRS to
decrease the rate to 18% in 2015. This implies reaching a rate o f 30% in 2004; 28.5% in 2005 and
27% in 2006. The Government policy to address the nutrition problem has two axes: the
implementation of an Integrated Child Care Program (AIN) and the universal coverage o f the
school breakfast program in the rural and urban-marginal sector.

Community-basedIntegrated Childcare Program
AIN establishes systematic follow-up o f the growth and development o f each child and stresses
the early identification of individuals whose growth trend shows signs o f deterioration, in order to


                                                                                                        10
apply timely corrective measures. The government has established a standardized AIN model and
in 2004 w i l l expand institutional capacity sufficiently to widen program coverage to 1,000
communities in the 80 poorest municipalities; for 2005: AIN w i l l be implemented in 500
communities, and all the nutrition programs w i l l have adopted standard indicators; for 2006: AIN
w i l l be implemented in 1,000 communities.

Schoolfeeding program
The school breakfast program i s an effective form o f economic support for poor families. I t i s
also a good incentive for attending school and - when consumed at the beginning o f the day - i t
provides children with energy to learn, improving their educational performance. W i t h support
from the World Food Program an effective model has been developed, using traditional meals
prepared by the mothers o f the community. In 2003, 650,000 children were covered b y the
program. In 2004, this has increased to 850,000. In 2005 there w i l l be a pilot project for the
community implementation o f the school lunch program. In 2006, if the pilot results are
satisfactory, the community model w i l l be generalized and the program w i l l be expand to cover
one million children.

Water and sanitation
The PRS sets a goal of 95% o f water and sanitation coverage b y 2015, compared to the present
81% level for water and 67% for sanitation. The great majority o f homes without services are in
the rural or urban-marginal areas. With the approval in 2003 o f the Water and Sanitation
Framework Law, the National Water Council and Sanitation Council (CONASA) was created as
a sector policy and planning entity, charged with developing plans for reaching the goals. I t has
also been decided that the municipalities w i l l be the entities in charge o f supplying this service,
and a regulatory entity (ERSAP) has been created to monitor and supervise tariffs and service
quality.
A Mesa Sectorul (coordinating body) for water and sanitation led by CONASA has been
established to develop concrete plans to meet the ERP goals in 2004-2006, including: the location
o f the investments; the identification o f agencies in charge o f developing the systems; the
organization o f community water and sanitation committees in rural and urban-marginal areas;
the identification o f financial resources; and the defining o f cost recovery mechanisms and
technical assistance. CONASA estimates that Honduras w i l l need to create 17,500 new rural
connections and 24,500 new urban connections every year between 2004 and 2006 to keep on
track to meet the PRS goals in this sector. In sanitation, 20,000 rural and 29,000 urban solutions
are needed annually. According to CONASA's preliminary estimates the annual cost o f these
investments i s US$28 million for the water connections and US$17 million for sanitation.
The Regulating Entity ERSAP w i l l determine adequate tariffs to finance the services in a
sustainable manner. T o this end, the investment costs and the efficient operating costs o f the
services w i l l be recovered b y the tariffs paid by the user. The assignment o f subsidies w i l l be
limited to a part o f the capital costs in communities with high levels o f poverty.
In 2004-2006, the transfer process o f the S A N A A systems to the municipalities w i l l accelerate.
For municipalities that decide to provide services indirectly through independent agencies,
support w i l l be given to help them define contracts that offer the best possible prices and promote
efficiency, coverage and quality services.

Pillar 5 Strengthening Protection to Specific Groups
A National Plan for Community Assistance for Groups o f Extreme Vulnerability w i l l be
developed, focusing especially on children, adolescents, women that suffer violence, disabled
people, senior citizens, and people living with HIV/AIDS and indigenous or ethnic and groups.



                                                                                                    11
A central element o f this strategy w i l l be the increase o f conditional cash transfers linked to
participation in health, education or training programs. In 2004 the number o f beneficiaries of
such programs w i l l increase b y 41%, reaching 302,000, with an investment o f L.192 million, 35%
more than in 2003. These bonds provide income support to the poorest Hondurans, and give
incentives for children and their mothers to attend school and health centers. A new cash transfer
program w i l l encourage women to give birth at health centers or hospitals and help reduce
maternal and infant mortality. Support w i l l be given to 4,000 women in 2004.
Community assistance models w i l l be promoted for orphans, and children in extreme risk o f
social exclusion. Honduras has received strong support from the Global fund to combat HIV-
AIDs, malaria and tuberculosis, but s t i l l lacks sufficient resources to support AIDs orphans; this
need w i l l be presented to the Global Fund.
Education and labor opportunities w i l l be created for youth exposed to recruitment by youth
gangs (maras). Rehabilitation and reinsertion actions for mara members w i l l take place through
supporting NGOs. In this framework, the coverage o f the youth bond w i l l increase to 6,000
adolescents in risk o f becoming involved in illegal activities, and w i l l be linked to training to give
them a socially productive alternative.
The PRS implementation plan also includes actions directed towards the indigenous communities.
In 2004-2006, the main measures focused on this issue w i l l include the following:
         Under the Property Law, communal properties o f indigenous and afro-Honduran groups
         w i l l be registered in their name.
         Education coverage and bilingual education w i l l continue to expand in indigenous and
         afro-Honduran communities.
         The Ministry of Tourism w i l l support Garifuna and indigenous communities through the
         Sustainable Coastal Tourism project, the Copan Valley Development project and the
         Lenca Route project.
         Support for indigenous economic development w i l l continue through the Our Roots and
         PAPTN programs.

Pillar 6 - The sustainability of the Strategy
The goals o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy w i l l only achieved if at the same time we manage to
transform our country. For this reason the PRS highlights actions in four fields related to
sustainability: governance, public administration, environmental sustainability and the monitoring
and evaluation o f the poverty reduction strategy itself.
In relation to governance, we propose to deepen our democracy through measures such as
individual and direct voting for Congress deputies through the modernization o f the
administration o f justice including the adoption o f a new c i v i l process code to establish public
oral hearings along the same lines already established in the reformed penal process code.
Progress w i l l be made in the decentralization to foster a participative and pluralistic culture; and
through strengthening o f human rights and o f the security o f citizens and their assets.
The second dimension o f PRS work on sustainability for 2004-2006 i s the program o f
modernization o public administration to assure the effectiveness and transparency in the use of
                   f
resources. The plan includes actions to strengthen the programming and coordination o f national
and external resources. The new S I A F I law, which w i l l shortly be passed by the Congress, w i l l
strengthen the control o f spending and allow us to report more transparently o n budget execution
and to improve the administration o f State purchases. The audit o f public entities w i l l be
strengthened to reduce corruption. The modernization o f the administration also includes the
reform o f the civil service, to provide career stability to c i v i l servants. W e w i l l also modernize the
Tax Code and create tax tribunals to facilitate tax collection.


                                                                                                           12
A third dimension o f PRS sustainability i s environmental sustainability. The degradation o f the
fragile environment o f the country threatens to undermine i t s economic potential and impede the
creation o f an appropriate environment for a decent quality o f human life. Actions are proposed to
strengthen environmental management through a reform o f the mandate of the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Environment, promoting a watershed-based approach in environmental
management and an important change in the institutions for Protected Areas management through
the creation o f a Trust Fund for this purpose.
The fourth dimension o f PRS sustainability i s the strengthening o f mechanisms o f the follow-up
and evaluation of the Strategy itself. The PRS Information system (SIERP) has been put in
place, and w i l l be further developed to provide updated information on the cost of programs and
indicators o f the intermediate results and the development impacts o f the Strategy. Additionally
the Law o f the Poverty Reduction Fund w i l l be reformed to include the tracking o f expenses
financed with national funds and to increase citizen participation in the PRS Consultative
Council. Finally, actions are proposed to strengthen the participative implementation approach o f
the strategy including development of regional PRSs and o f social audit mechanisms.
The following paragraphs provide greater detail on the actions proposed in each o f these areas.

Strengthening Govemance

Reform o the Electoral Law and the Political Organizations
        f
The relationship between the electors and Congress deputies, and the accountability o f the latter,
depends on the clear identification o f the candidates and o f the link from the votes cast to the
results o f the election. In 2004 the Electoral Law reform w i l l be completed to allow voters to vote
directly for each deputy, and to vote for deputies from more than one party. This reform w i l l be
fully implemented in time for the internal and general elections o f 2005. I addition, the Supreme
                                                                              n
Court o f Elections and the National Registry o f People have been separated, top reduce the risk of
politization o f the registration process.

National Anticorruption Council (CNA)
The National Anticorruption Council (CNA) w i l l be transformed in order better to fulfill i t s
functions. This process i s being carried out in constant consultation with donors and civil society.

Administration o justice
                f
Recently a contract was issued for the services o f an intemational audit firm to evaluate the staff
o f the judiciary to ensure that people are qualified for their posts. The adoption o f the new penal
process code and the imminent adoption o f a new civil process code w i l l allow us to reduce the
judicial backlog o f cases to internationally acceptable levels b y the end o f 2006.
Our 24 penal centers house over 10,000 interns. The resulting overcrowding has led to tragic
events such as the fire at the San Pedro Sula penitentiary in M a y 2004. However, during recent
years there has been considerable progress in decreasing the numbers o f prisoners without
sentence. At present 52 % o f prisoners are sentenced and 48% are held in preventive detention.
The goal i s to reach international standards that allow for 15% preventive custody. The
transparency in the administration o f civil cases w i l l be increased through oral and public
hearings through the adoption o f the new c i v i l process code.

Human rights and citizen security
Improving citizen security and the respect for human rights are not only priority objectives in and
o f themselves, but also contribute to create a more favorable climate for private investment, and
therefore for economic growth and poverty reduction.



                                                                                                    13
The program "Safer Communities" has had a strong initial impact in the pilot communities,
reducing the incidence o f crime b y 69%. B y 2006 we w i l l have in place 2,500 community police,
duly trained and equipped, working with organized citizen security committees. Another priority
area o f attention i s the violation o f human rights o f young people, which has produced an
unacceptable level o f violent deaths. The Ministry o f Security has established a special unit for
investigation o f the deaths o f minors, which acts under supervision o f the Permanent Commission
for Protection o f Physical and Moral Integrity o f Children (with inter-institutional representation
o f the State and Civil Society). The unit i s presently investigating 370 cases. O f these 72 have
been referred to the Public Prosecutor's Office; the cases referred concem 107 victims. 36 people
linked to these crimes have been detained, including police and prison guards. The goal for 2006
i s to solve 1,050 cases, and the Unit w i l l be strengthened with equipment and training.

Decentralization
The government has deepened the process o f decentralization through the National Program of
Decentralization and Local Development (PRODDEL).
Regarding the decentralization o public services, a strategy w i l l be prepared for integrated local
                                    f
management o f education and health services, through Associations for the Development o f
Local Education (ADEL's), and mentioned above. In order to strengthen local capacities, in 2004
technical assistance w i l l be provided to 54 small municipalities. The creation o f inter-municipal
associations, known as "mancomunidades" w i l l be encouraged. The municipal tax framework
w i l l be simplified and a manual w i l l be designed for municipal financial administration; and
support w i l l be given to municipalities in the preparation o f their cadasters.
Regardingfinancial and fiscal decentralization, the government w i l l continue advancing towards
the goal o f achieving the transfer o f 5% o f tax income to local governments. The transfer has
increased from 1.9% in 2002 (already an unprecedented achievement) to 3.2% in 2004. Other
goals include improving the coordination o f public investment at local level, based on strategic
development plans developed with ample civil society participation.

Public resource management
Honduras has maintained, historically, a relatively high public spending level compared to i t s
GDP, without this resulting in acceptable development outcomes. The low productivity o f public
investment and the low quality o f public services are the result o f a public administration lacking
in transparency and lacking modern instruments for good resource management.
For this reason, the PRS has placed emphasis in modernizing public management, including the
creation o f a multi-annual framework o f budget programming that w i l l allow expenses related to
the fight against poverty to be identified and relate them to the physical goals set; improvements
in accountability and transparency; strengthen internal and external audit; and improvement in the
purchasing system. This improvement program i s guided b y the findings o f the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment prepared in 2003.

                                                          f
Coordinating poverty reduction spending in the framework o multi annual budget
In the 2004, all the national and external resources w i l l be consolidated into a single budget
framework and expenditure tracking system. Presently a significant proportion o f donor resources
are not properly tracked. T o this end, the capacity o f the Presidency to strategically direct the PRS
to the planning process of national development w i l l be strengthened. At the same time, SEFIN
w i l l be given responsibility for tracking all types o f expenses on poverty reduction, whether from
national sources, loans or donations. SEFIN w i l l prepare pluri-annual programmatic budgets
linked to PRS goals, and the sector planning entities (Planning and Managerial Evaluation Units
UPEG's) o f the line ministries w i l l be strengthened.



                                                                                                    14
Expenditure control, and auditing.
S I A F I has been put in place to improve expenditure control and management. In M a y 2004 the
S I A F I L a w w i l l be approved by the National Congress and SEFIN w i l l work to improve the
catalogue o f accounts and the capacity o f the information system. S W I w i l l be integrated with
other relevant systems in a common platform and users w i l l have access to real-time data. The
goal i s to generate quarterly information on budget execution, including the identification o f the
spending on poverty reduction programs. The control o f the General Treasury o f the Republic
over expenditure w i l l be strengthened, and the transparency o f the collection o f taxes w i l l be
improved through the reconciliation of the funds collected by private banks and funds transferred
to the Treasury.
In 2004, the program to rationalize the staffing o f the Superior Court o f Accounts (TSC), w i l l be
implemented and the ex- post audit o f public acquisitions w i l l be strengthened. The goal for 2006
i s to have biannual reports from the TSC on the fiscal accounts and to have implemented auditing
regulations in all the institutions o f the public sector.
Likewise, the system o f public purchases w i l l be strengthened through the program for Efficiency
and Transparency Program o f in State Purchases financed b y the IADB and other donors. The
regulations o f the L a w o f State Contracting have been approved and the Normative Bureau of
Purchases and State Acquisitions (ONCAE) has been established. This office w i l l operate an
electronic information system for purchases, create standardized documents for bids and
broadcast information on pertinent regulations.

Civil service reform
T o assure continuity o f the PRS i t i s necessary to reform the c i v i l service. In 2004, the
Government took an important step to rationalize the public employee's remuneration regime,
with the approval o f the Law for an Equitable Salary System Central Government. A Law o f the
Public Function w i l l shortly be presented for the approval o f the National Congress, to create a
professional civil service with promotion and recruitment based on merits, limit the number of
positions subject to political appointment by the Executive, and create an entity with sufficient
independence to supervise the civil service.

Gender equity
In 2004-2005, in the framework o f the National Policy for Gender Equity, programs w i l l be
promoted for women micro-enterprise owners. Self-help groups for community support w i l l be
promoted to support women victims o f domestic violence. A gender equity approach w i l l be
implemented in the Ministry o f Education, Ministry o f Health and other state entities. In addition
the municipal offices for women w i l l be strengthened, opening 22 new offices in 2005.

Environmental sustainability
I t i s necessary to continue advancing with the establishment o f a modern, efficient and
transparent framework for environmental licensing and auditing. For 2004-2006 actions are
planned to strengthen environmental control (licensing and audit); Protected Areas and
biodiversity; and Environmental Education.
The transparency of the environmental licensing process w i l l be improved in coordination with
the Competitiveness Program. I t w i l l be developed in close cooperation with the local
Governments or mancomunidades.
The coverage o f management plans for protected areas (AA.PP.) has improved, but there are s t i l l
almost three quarters o f all the AA.PP. and 40% o f the total surface o f the prioritized AA.PP
lacking a management plan. Even in the areas with management plans, the control i s not always
effective and degradation continues, with the loss o f biodiversity and genetic resources. Honduras


                                                                                                   15
has progressed slowly in taking advantage o f opportunities o f joint implementation contracts for
carbon absorption under the Kyoto Protocol. I 2004, the administration o f the AA.PP. w i l l be
                                                   n
strengthened through the establishment o f a trust fund with a seed capital seed o f US$ 3.5 million
to finance o f this activity and preparation o f a strategic plan legal and institutional reforms
including management by local communities and environmental ONG's to assure the
sustainability the protected areas. Based on these activities good quality management plan
coverage w i l l be increased to 100% o f the prioritized AA.PP. by 2006.

Risk management
The catastrophic damage o f hurricane Mitch left a bitter lesson on the consequences o f not having
                                                             n
a mitigation plan for this type o f natural disasters. I 1999-2003 there were important
achievements in the reconstruction o f the country and in this context, risk management
mechanisms were strengthened, through the Permanent Commission o f Contingencies
(COPECO).
In 2004 the new National Risk Management Policy w i l l be established, and COPECO w i l l
become a National System for Civil Protection, extending i t s operational range to include
disasters caused by natural phenomena and those caused b y man. The L a w o f National
Contingencies w i l l be modernized, and the National Risk Management System w i l l be
strengthened to define the role of all relevant actors and a master plan w i l l be prepared for the
Prevention o f Emergencies and Mitigation o f Natural Disasters o f Tegucigalpa.

PRS monitoring and follow-up
Honduras has passed the L a w o f the Poverty Reduction Fund, which created the Consultative
Council o f the PRS with ample participation o f civil society as a consultative entity o f the Social
Cabinet for PRS development; and created an inter-institutional technical committee to prepare
                       n
implementation plans. I 2001 and 2003 extensive consultation processes regarding PRS were
               n
carried out. I 2004-2006, participative and decentralized PRS implementation w i l l be
strengthened and there w i l l be improvement in follow-up and monitoring o f the Strategy through
the following actions:

PRS participatory approach
T o reinforce the PRS participatory approach i t i s necessary to expand the representation of the
PRS Consultative Council. To this end the Law o f the Poverty Reduction Fund has been reformed
to increase the participation o f the civil society in the Consultative Council, incorporating
representatives from the labor unions, farmers unions, women organizations, youth and children
organizations, senior citizen organizations, the National Association o f Industrialists (ANDI), the
Federation o f Chambers o f Commerce and Industry (FEDECAMARA), the micro and small
businesses, the social sector o f the economy, people with disabilities, the federations o f grass root
district community organizations, ethnic organizations and non governmental organizations
(NGO's).
Sectorial bodies called Mesas have been created for consultation in education, health, water and
sanitation and agriculture and forest industries, with the mandate to analyze ways to meet the
goals o f the strategy in their respective areas. The preliminary results o f their deliberations were
presented to the international cooperation agencies in a seminar in March 2004, and have been
incorporated into this document. During 2004-2006 the mesas w i l l continue as a permanent
consultative and validating entity for developing the strategy. The responsibility o f each mesa
includes vigilance for their sector regarding the six transversal themes o f the PRS: gender,
environment, transparency, human rights, decentralization and macroeconomics.




                                                                                                    16
Regional PRS strategies
W i t h the support of the non-governmental organizations, work w i l l continue on the development
o f regional consultation and monitoring structures and with the development o f regional strategies
in the fight against poverty. Five regions are in the process preparing their strategies: The West,
the Valley o f Sula, the Center, the Aguan, and the South. Around 2,000 grass-roots organizations
are participating in this process, representing different sectors: women, children and youth,
farmers, workers, ethnic groups, community organizations, the social sector of the economy,
small and mediumenterprises, local ONGs, churches, teachers, and local authorities.

Tracking poverty reduction spending
In the framework o f the PRGF, the Government has committed itself to increase spending on the
fight against poverty by 0.6% o f the GDP annually between 2004-2006, reaching a 9.3% o f the
GDP in 2006. In order track this commitment, all the programs related to poverty reduction w i l l
be identified b y the S I A F I creating a "virtual fund" that w i l l allow the total spending to be
registered and to assure that the resources received from HIPC result in a concomitant increase in
the total expenditure on poverty reduction programs. The May 2004 reform o f the Poverty
Reduction Fund Law expands the definition o f poverty reduction spending to incorporate all the
relevant programs - including those financed with national resources. The financing sources w i l l
be identified and the type of expense (current or capital) o f each PRS expense component w i l l be
identified. B y the end o f 2004 there w i l l be quarterly reports on PRS execution.

SIERP
In the first quarter o f 2004, the PRS Indicators System has been set up (www.sierp.hn), with a
design approved in 2003 b y the PRS Consultative Council and Social Cabinet. This system
provides the most recent available information on PRS spending and on the goals and impact
indicators. I t publishes many documents related to the Strategy and provides links to related sites.
During 2004, UNAT w i l l work with Ministry of Finance (SEFIN) and the National Institute of
Statistics (INE) and with the line ministries, to assure the quality o f the data and to improve the
operation o f the site and to provide data broken down at the local and regional level, for the
spending as well as for the impact indicators. The SIERP Web page also serves as a means to
share the minutes o f the PRS Consultative Council, documents from the Sector mesas and other
organizations related to the PRS.
The evaluation o f the PRS also requires rigorous studies o f key issues related to PRS design and
implementation. In 2003 a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) took place on the
distributive impact of tax reforms, which demonstrates a positive impact. The study concluded
that the tax increases had a greater impact on wealthier families, whereas the resulting increases
in public expenses were concentrated mainly on the poorest families. Consequently, increasing
the taxes and public expenses at the same time has a favorable distributive impact. Relevant
studies w i l l continue in 2004, including a study to analyze the relationship between poverty and
water coverage in Tegucigalpa and to determine the payment capacity for improving the water
services in city; and a study of CAFTA's impact. Also, a national survey o f Measuring L i v i n g
Standards (MECOVI), w i l l be carried out in 2004 that w i l l allow a deeper look at the
determinants o f poverty.

Social audit
T o reinforce the PRS monitoring and the participative approach to i t s implementation at local
level, community follow-up mechanisms w i l l be developed for the PRS programs. In 2004 a pilot
exercise has been carried on the transfer o f funds to primary schools for the purchase o f teaching
materials and school supplies. Communal entities such as ADEL's and Parental Associations
were in charge o f assigning these funds and details o f the transferred amount and i t s usage were


                                                                                                  17
placed publicly in the beneficiary schools. In order to strengthen this approach in 2004-2006,
consultations w i l l take place with the users on the quality of basic services on quality of basic
services in health and education.

In conclusion, the Government i s confident that the Honduras PRS has been considerably
strengthened by the consultative process and technical work done over the last year to better
define goals and quantify the costs of meeting them. W e also believe that the ambitious program
o f policy reforms outlined in this letter w i l l establish the basis for greater effectiveness of the
increased poverty-reduction spending to be undertaken in 2004-2006 and for the sustainable
implementation o f the strategy in the years to come.
We are grateful to the IDA for i t s continued support with the financing o f the strategy and also for
the technical work done by IDA staff to support our effort to define and implement the reform
program. We are confident that together we can meet the goals of the PRS in 2004-2006.

             ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES

Summary of PRSC Activities

The proposed Honduras PRSC w i l l support a selection o f actions that Government has prioritized
for PRSP implementation in the short- to medium-term, namely: (i)            accelerating pro-poor
growth, (ii) increasing the impact and efficiency o f resources devoted to human development
and social protection; and (iii)  increasing the medium- and long-term sustainability of poverty
reduction initiatives through policy and institutional reforms geared to strengthening governance
and public sector management. The above priorities also incorporate cross-cutting emphasis on
environmental sustainability and risk prevention, gender equity, and decentralization. In
addition, an M&E processes for the poverty reduction strategy i s being developed. A summary of
the key PRSC activities are presented below.

1. Pro-Poor Growth

Macroeconomic Framework and Investment Climate and Competitiveness.The growth strategy
contained in the Honduras PRSP focuses on sustained fiscal discipline to maintain a stable
macroeconomic framework,. The reform process includes a reduction in trade barriers, more
flexible exchange rate arrangements, financial market liberalization, liberalization o f agricultural
trade, adjustments to public utility tariffs and the development o f a legal framework to strengthen
property rights. In addition, the Government has prioritized the improvement o f the national
investment climate and competitiveness. The Government also desires to increase key
infrastructure in rural areas, as part o f i t s ongoing effort to increase employment and income-
earning opportunities. Overall, government i s committed to continue the process o f reforms by:
implementing legislation and sector policies; deepening private sector participation; and
achieving results in quality, coverage and efficiency of infrastructure and service provision.
Land Rights and Access. The PRSC w i l l support: (i) passage and subsequent implementation
                                                          the
o f the Property Institute Law which aims to consolidate, rationalize and systematize the legal and
institutional framework for land regularization; (ii) strengthening and expansion o f the
                                                            the
National System for Property Administration (SINAP) at central and municipal levels; and ( i )      ii
the development and implementation of a comprehensive plan for surveying, regularizing, titling
and registering the land rights o f populations on national lands (including in national forests), and
of indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups.

ZZ. Human Capital and Social Protection

Education. The PRSC series supports continued progress in implementing the Government's
strategy o f improving primary school quality and the efficiency and coverage o f both primary and
secondary education through improved school management and organization and better teacher
and resource management.
Health. Government has introduced several new models o f care in i t s efforts to improve access,
including the identification o f a basic package o f health services (including child health
interventions and maternal and reproductive health care) and contracting o f qualified NGOs to
provide care in isolated rural areas. Government has also adopted a plan for improving the
structure and process o f care in M O H facilities so as to bring them up to acceptable standards, in
a phased manner over a ten-year period. Government i s committed to streamlining i t s many
duplicative and overlapping nutrition programs b y focusing on two priority programs; (i)        the
AIN-C, a comprehensive community-based health and nutrition program for children aged 0-5
years and (ii)school meals program for older children,
               a
Water and Sanitation. Government's primary policy objective i s to implement the sector
framework law, first ensuring that CONASA and the regulatory agency are operational and have
the institutional capacity to govern the sector. In addition, the regulatory agency w i l l issue
guidelines for tariff setting, establish performance benchmarks, develop monitoring systems and a
mechanism to expand water and sanitation services to marginal urban and rural areas.

                   -
III. Sustainability Public Sector Management, Governance and the Environment

A. Public Resource Management
Poverty Targeting and Medium Term Program Budgeting. The budget format i s being changed
to one based on programmatic classifications, and made more comprehensive b y including all
external assistance. These changes entail a modernization o f the Chart o f Accounts in SIAFI, as
well as a need for training and capacity building among the sector planning and evaluation groups
throughout the Government. The new programmatic budget i s being developed on the basis o f the
Government spending priorities articulated in the PRSPERP, while the annual operating plans
w i l l follow clearly established guidelines for programmatic budgeting. These budgeting reforms
w i l l enable the government to implement a medium-term expenditure framework and facilitate
the management o f sector wide approaches (SWAPS).
Financial Accountability and Transparency. Government w i l l expand S I A F I to the entire public
sector. In parallel, the Central Government accounting function i s gradually evolving towards
producing financial statements in a manner consistent with international practice.
Expenditure Controls. Government i s planning to gradually shift responsibilities for revenue and
cash management from the Budget Office and the Central Bank to the Treasury. Toward this end,
the Finance Secretariat i s preparing plans to first reconcile the revenue accounts from different
agencies, including DGP, B C H and TGR, and then proceed to gradually reconcile all internal and
external resources channeled through the public sector through a since treasury account ("Cuenta
Unica").
Internal and External Audits. The Tribunal Superior de Cuentas, has prepared a strategic human
resource to develop qualified staff, fully capable o f carrying out the financial audit o f the public
accounts of the Government, with sufficient knowledge o f internationally accepted standards and
audit methodologies. I t also prepared and formally approved a new set o f regulations to govern i t s
operations and i s finalizing the backlog o f overdue annual reports. Further measures
contemplated in the reform program include the implementation o f the regulations of the Ley
Organica del TSC, the approval o f a new financial audit manual and regulations, and the conduct
o f annual ex-post review audits o n government procurement processes and contracts.
Public Procurement. The government i s implementing an action plan developed within the
donor-supported Program o f Efficiency and Transparency in Government Procurement and has
issued the implementing regulations needed for the "Ley de Contrataciones", and for establishing
the procurement regulatory office (ONCAE) and i t s consultative committee. The government's
program to strengthen public procurement includes the development o f an electronic public
information system for procurement and an electronic system for procurement transactions to be
administered b y ONCAE, culminating in the establishment o f a more efficient e-government and
contract management system.

B. Civil Service Reform. The government submitted to Congress a Public Salary L a w ("Ley de
Reordenamiento del Sistema Retributivo del Gobierno Central"), which was approved in
December 2003, that restores government control over the wage bill and wage administration. I t
eliminates the special wage regimes, folds various wage bonuses ("colaterales") into the base
salary, broadens the scope o f wage policy to cover all government employees and allows reserves


                                                                                                    2
for the government (as opposed to Congress) the role o f formulating wage policy in line with
anticipated inflation. The authorities also have prepared and presented to Congress legislation
that (i)provides the basis for a professional civil service, including merit-based recruitment and
promotion, (ii) places l i m i t s on the number of political appointments in the civil service, and (iii)
creates and independent body with authority to regulate the implementation o f the civil service
reform.

C. Environmental Sustainability
Forestry. A m i x o f major legislative reforms are being sought b y the current administration
regarding national territorial planning (approved by the National Congress in October, 2003), a
property rights law (currently being debated in National Congress), and a forestry law (recently
submitted to the National Congress). Institutional reforms o f the State Forest Agency (AFE-
COHDEFOR) continue and GOH i s reforming the Forest L a w and the state forest agency. Also,
to deal with corruption and illegal logging, a high level Commission to audit the application o f
forest management plans has been formed in the Department o f Olancho (a center o f illegal
logging).
Protected Areas. Government has agreed to a plan for strengthening management o f the protected
areas - SINAPH - and developing a sustainable source of financing for their upkeep. I t has also
approved a strategic framework and action plan for policy, financial, legal, and institutional
reforms to sustain the priority SINAPH PAS over the long term, to be supported b y future
PRSCs.

ZV: Monitoring and Evaluation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy

Monitoring and Evaluation. T o make the PRSP M&E processes operational, an integrated
system for the poverty reduction strategy (SIERP) i s being developed to ensure that social
programs share common objectives and technical instruments. Complementing SIERP w i l l be
the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) which provides analysis o f the social impact of
Government policies, programs, and projects. In addition, the first comprehensive household
survey w i l l be conducted, with the results used to achieve two PSIAs.

Environmental and Social Issues

The appropriate treatment o f environmental and social issues in PRSCs depends on their coverage
and focus as outlined in the World Bank Operational Policy and Country Services Interim
Guidelines for Poverty Reduction Support Credits, May 3 1, 2001. The PRSC has been classified
as a SECAC b y the PRSC working group, and therefore i s subject to the requirements o f the
Bank's Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 4.01). Based on the scope and nature o f the
PRSC's reform program the regional safeguard unit (QAT) recommend a Category "C"
environmental rating.

In addition, Bank policy guidance suggest staff review environmental policies and practices in the
country, take account of any relevant findings and recommendations o f such reviews and identify
positive and negative linkages between the various reforms proposed and the environment. If
there are negative linkages, staff devise specific measures as appropriate to counteract the
possible negative effects, or explain how mitigation i s otherwise being achieved. Accordingly,
this annex provides further insight into ongoing and planned World Bank activities in the country
that w i l l satisfy the QAT'S project enhancement recommendations for environmental
management, transport, energy, land rights and access, health, water and sanitation, forestry and
several social issues.



                                                                                                       3
This analysis links existing country project safeguard processes to the PRSC. The premise o f this
exercise i s that environment and poverty are linked in two major ways; (i)    poverty reduction
programs should not damage the environment of the poor, which would undermine outcomes in
one area with losses in another and that (ii)    improving environmental conditions can help to
reduce poverty and promote sustainable growth. Consequently the PRSC and country team w i l l
work with stakeholders to define a better framework to address the key environmental and social
issues.

Summary of Country Portfolio and Safeguard Measures

In accordance with the Interim Guidelines (for PRSCs) and OD 8.60 and OP 4.01, the PRSC team
assessed the safeguard process for each o f the Bank's portfolio sector activities.

The PRSC safeguard assessment found that although Bank projects have well designed provisions
at preparation (evidence from ISDS and EA annexes), i t was unclear how well each implementing
agency i s undertaking these provisions. In specific projects, environmental assessment has been
incorporated into the regular subproject cycle and there i s regular screening and follow up
monitoring and audits (e.g., FISE).

Numerous investment projects in the country portfolio defined explicit provisions for
incorporating World Bank safeguards into the respective projects. These are listed and
highlighted in table 1, and discussed below.

         Environment and Natural Resources. The Bank has been supporting several integrated
natural resource and environmental management and protection projects over the past decade
through several instruments. The Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project, under GEF, supports
the Honduran section o f the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) through better
conservation o f biodiversity in core areas and more sustainable use o f biodiversity in the corridor
buffer zones. The project strengthens the capacity for protected area management, improves
natural resource management in buffer zones; and conducts biological monitoring.

integrated and sustainable management o f natural resources at the farm, community and
municipality levels; (ii) expanding community participation in efforts to achieve efficient and
sustainable management and conservation o f national, municipal and communal forest areas;
(iii)supporting strategic policy and institutional reforms in the forest subsector; and (iv)
assisting to decentralize the management of natural resources by strengthening the capacity
of local governments and communities in natural resource management and vulnerability
reduction to natural disasters.

The Sustainable Coastal Tourism Project i s supporting the development and management of
sustainable coastal tourism along the North Coast mainland, and the offshore Bay Islands o f
Honduras, through a participatory learning process. Activities include: strengthening local and
municipal capacity to manage and benefit from coastal tourism; the formulation and promotion of
a participatory approach to policy dialogue, with public, and private stakeholders at the national,
regional, and local levels; develop the capacity o f coastal municipalities, which includes the
private sector, and community based organizations, for environmental management, tourism
management, and entrepreneurship. In addition, a cultural tourism site w i l l be restored at the
historic center o f Trujillo. A parallel regional project, Conservation and Sustainable Use of the
Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, involving Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras as
riparian stakeholders, aims to preserve the integrity and ecological values o f the barrier reef
system while promoting opportunities and approaches for sustainable use. This includes marine
tourism and introduction o f user fees for ecosystem goods and services associated with improved
marine protected area management.

           Rural Infrastructure and Regional Development. The Rural Infrastructure Project w i l l
provide rural communities with adequate access to improved infrastructure services on a
sustainable basis. In the process, the project w i l l enhance the capacity o f the institutions, both
local (mancomunidades, municipalities, water boards, etc) and central, to manage rural
infrastructure. The project development objective w i l l be pursued in a limited number o f
mancomunidades, chosen according to eligibility criteria that include poverty status, development
potential, and institutional capacity, with an investment menu limited to roads, waterhanitation,
and electricity. All subprojects w i l l follow regular environmental screening procedures and these
w i l l be documented in the project EA.

Government i s pursuing a robust tourism development strategy that capitalizes on i t s many
exceptional natural and cultural resources. The Project includes integrating development of
archeological parks and sites to create an Archeological Tourism Circuit and income generation
opportunities. The planning process includes specific environmental screening provisions for all
project site plans and includes social and indigenous safeguards.

        Natural Disasters. The Natural Disaster Mitigation Project improves the capacity of
government to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters at the municipal level. Studies are
supported to understand the changes in fluvial geomorphology caused b y Hurricane M i t c h to
determine the volume o f sediment deposited, identify r i s k s from flooding and associated
landslides, erosion, sediment transport and deposit; and monitor the long-term geomorphic
recovery o f the river basin. Also, the project focuses on the poor and their environment by
strengthening the project management capability o f the natural resources and environment
ministry.

        Land Tenure. The Land Administration Project includes an integrated, and
decentralized land administration system (comprising public and private entities) to provide users
accurate information on urban, and rural land parcels, and effective land administration services.
The system w i l l increase land tenure security, facilitate land market transactions, develop national
and municipal territorial plans, and develop management plans for protected areas, forests, and
indigenous peoples lands. A key activity i s the establishment o f a National Property
Administration System (SINAP), through strengthened legal, regulatory, and institutional
frameworks. S I N A P w i l l include a National Territorial Information System (SINIT), a Registry of
Norms (RENOT), and the Unified Registries System (SURE), which w i l l be operated b y public
and private entities. The project i s financing pre-field work, such as aerial photography, field
surveying o f macro boundaries, parcel-level surveying and validation, conflict resolution, titling,
and mass registration into SINAP.

        Health Sector. Improvement o f health care coverage, and quality b y implementing the
country's health reform strategy i s the purpose o f the Health System Reform Project. The
project develops strategies, programs, and systems to achieve health service delivery. Monitoring
and evaluation w i l l assess the impact o f project activities overall, and target indigenous
populations as well. In addition, assistance to strengthen HIV/AIDS/STI surveillance systems,
and improvements in blood banks i s provided with implementation o f investments and innovative
management changes. Extended coverage i s provided for the Honduran Social Security Institute
and the Ministry o f Health, focusing on the expansion of integrated care models. Concerns
include construction activities as well as overall health care waste (HCW) management. The EA
addressed the handling, storage and disposal o f health care waste (HCW) at all levels o f the
health care delivery systems.

        Water and Sanitation Sector. The Bank continues to provide technical support to the
water and sanitation sector through the WSP. One issue o f concern i s the sustainability o f rural
water supply systems, with GOH and communities remaining in disagreement over O & M
responsibility. A post project sustainability study i s planned to provide further insight into these
matters, which w i l l include assessing water quality and water sustainability issues. Such
information w i l l provide important results to ensure that MDG Goal 7: Ensuring Environmental
Sustainability, specifically to reduce the proportion o f people without sustainable access to safe
drinking water can be met in a practical fashion.

         Energy. The Rural Infrastructure Project w i l l support the provision of traditional
electricity services via decentralized rural electrification, grid extension and associated off-grid   J

social and economic benefits such as solar home heating. With GEF support, i t goes beyond
providing traditional fossil fuel supplies, providing incentives for rural renewable energy
provisions, including mini-hydropower, and improved use of woodfuel. E S M A P , through the
Global Village Energy Funds (GVEF-LAC) w i l l support G O H in finalizing the national Energy-
Poverty Reduction Action Plan. This w i l l provide support to SERNA, ENEE and several other
N G O organizations in improving energy efficiency through policy development, financing
opportunities, institutional coordination and capacity building.

         Transportation. The Road Reconstruction and Improvement Project, restores those
roads damaged b y Hurricane Mitch, improves trade corridors, and establishes financial and
institutional frameworks for the road sub-sector. Activities include: road reconstruction,
rehabilitation, and improvement, covering sections of the main Central America corridor, roads
connecting neighboring countries, and roads located in the southwestern region o f the country,
known as the natural corridor ". In addition, the Santa Rita-Yoro road, the most severely
                'I


damaged road b y Hurricane Mitch, i s being reconstructed, including replacement o f four bridges,
retaining walls, and river channels. Environmental mitigation addresses the majority of these
works i s addressed through the environmental assessment. It identifies and evaluates potential
adverse environmental and reviews the legal framework for environmental compliance.

        Social and Zndigenous Issues. The Fifth Social Investment Fund Project w i l l continue
the successful FHIS program aimed at increasing access among the poor to small-scale social,
and economic infrastructure, developing social assistance programs, and contributing to
sustainable investments. I t focuses mostly, towards reconstruction efforts following Hurricane
Mitch. Financing w i l l enable the continued FHIS support for the expansiodimprovement of basic
social and economic infrastructure including training in operations and maintenance. Special
programs develop local institutional strengthening to involve communities and local
governments. Rural water supply and sanitation services are being strengthened. The FHIS has
operated with an Environmental Unit for a number o f years and undertakes environmental
screening for all subprojects.

         The Nuestras Raices Project ensures that indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups have
increased participation in the integrated development processes o f their communities and their
nation. This objective w i l l be achieved b y strengthening the communities local capacity to build
sustainable organizations, development projects and cultural identity as well as promote
interaction between the ethnic communities, local governments and central government agencies
and programs. Environmental provisions are also promoted in this project, including the
application of impact assessment and mitigation.

Cross Cutting Issue - Environmental Sustainability

The Bank supported environmental management and regulation in Honduras in the early 90's
through the Environmental Development Project. The Bank strengthened the capacity o f
government agencies in environmental and natural resource planning; policy, legal and regulatory
framework development; interagency coordination; environmental monitoring; and enforcement
of environmental laws and regulations. At that time, the Ministry o f the Environment and relevant
sector agencies were strengthened and a national system o f environmental impact assessment was
developed.




                                                                                                   8
These efforts been followed up with numerous World Bank, IF1 and bilateral donor technical
assistance covering most sectors and measures to improve the environmental regulatory and
management framework in the country.

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA) i s responsible for the
formulation, coordination, execution and evaluation o f policies related with water resources,
energy and the environment. This includes actions related to watershed management, national
system o f protected areas, protection and sustainable use of the biodiversity. SERNA oversees
control of environmental pollution, management o f the national system for evaluation of
environmental impact, issuance o f technical norms, and enforcement of environmental
regulations.

The General Directorate for Environmental Assessment and Control (DECA), the General
Directorate for Environmental Management (DGA) and , The Center for Contamination Studies
and Control (CESCCO) are the respective agencies for environmental control. DECA i s
responsible for the National System o f Environmental Impact Assessment (SINEIA), as well as
the issue and control o f environment permits and the environment audit practices; D E C A ensure
that the plans, policies, programs and projects, industrial installations and any activity susceptible
o f contaminating or degrading the environment, submit environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
permits.

The importance of environmental sustainability on poverty reduction efforts i s expressed via the
MDGs. The cross-sectoral nature o f the environment and i t s direct and indirect linkages to the
MDGs provide an opportunity to address i t s critical role in Hondura's economic growth and
poverty reduction agenda through the PRSC process. Mainstreaming o f the environment in the
poverty reduction agenda i s a specific target within the MDGs, expressed through Goal 7:
Ensuring Environmental Sustainability. Mainstreaming o f the environment into the PRSC process
i s expected to be a continuous dialogue process between the Bank, the donor community and
numerous stakeholder groups.

Although specific emphasis i s given in the PRSCl to forestry and protected areas, there are other
key multisectoral environmental sustainability issues addressed b y G O H and civil society.
Several o f these have been highlighted in the above discussions and w i l l be continued through the
PRSC and PRSC TAC process as well as other sector specific activities (e.g., energy, tourism
development, rural infrastructure).

Public Consultation and Public Information.

 The preparation of the PRSP-Progress Report (PR) involved intensive consultations within the
government, with c i v i l society organizations, stakeholders, and the international donor
community. The Government previously had agreed with the Consultative Council (Consejo
Consultivo) and the Sector Coordination Groups ("Mesas Sectoriales") on a consultation strategy
to facilitate description, reflection, analysis and documentation o f the process. The results o f the
consultations are recorded in a report titled: Informe de Resultados de la Consulta del Informe del
Primer AAo de Avance y Actualizacidn de la Estrategia para la Reduccidn de la Pobreza that can
be found on the web site of the Presidential Secretariat. This web site also includes a description
of the consultative process. The final version o f the PRSP-PR incorporates many of the
suggestions made during the consultations, such as a revised macroeconomic framework,
strengthened sections on statistics and PRSP result and impact indicators, and the recalibration o f
some of the PRSP's original goals. During 2005-06, the Consultative Council and the Sector
Coordination Groups w i I l hold regular meetings and continue to improve the consultation

     IMF Approves In Principle Three-Year US$107.6 Million Poverty
  Reduction and Growth Facility Arrangement for Honduras and Grants
                           Additional Interim Assistance
                       Under the Enhanced HlPC Initiative

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved in
principle a three-year, SDR 71.2 million (about US$107.6 million) Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement for Honduras to support the government's
economic program. The decision will become effective upon a further decision following
the World Bank's Executive Board review o f Honduras' Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP), which i s scheduled for February 26, 2004. At that time, Honduras will be
entitled to the release o f SDR 10.17 million (about US$15.4 million). In addition, the
Executive Board today approved SDR 4.3 million (about US$6.5 million) for Honduras
in additional interim assistance under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Initiative.
The PRGF i s the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a
participatory process involving c i v i l society and development partners and articulated in
a PRSP. This i s intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster
growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate o f 0.5 percent and
are repayable over 10 years with a 5 '/-year grace period on principal payments.
Following the Executive Board's discussion o n Honduras, Agustin Carstens, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chairman, said:
"Honduras' new three-year PRGF-supported economic program has been developed
through a process o f social consultation and collaboration, in recognition that broad
public support for the program i s crucial to i t s success. In line with the PRSP, the
overriding objectives o f the program are to alleviate poverty and move the economy to a
path o f higher economic growth and lower inflation.
"To achieve these objectives, the authorities are committed to pursuing prudent
macroeconomic policies and stepping up the implementation o f structural reforms.
Measures crucial to achieve the fiscal objectives o f the program have already been taken.
The program i s based on private sector-led growth, with the public sector playing a
supportive role by reallocating resources toward infrastructure and the social sectors and
developing more transparent institutions. It envisages, among other things, a
strengthening o f the public finances, a far-reaching financial system reform, and
improvements in governance. Particularly important will be the reform o f the public
sector wage policy framework, which is essential to control the wage bill, and other
measures to ensure that the fiscal targets for 2004 are achieved.
"Notwithstanding i t s strengths, Honduras' program faces important challenges-in
particular, the approaching presidential elections, the limited implementation capacity,
the vulnerability to external shocks, and the fragility o f the financial system. The
medium-term program addresses these challenges by establishing a clear framework for
the sustained implementation o f prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms.
I t will be important for the success o f the program to deepen the broad political and social
consensus that has underpinned the poverty reduction strategy. This i s most likely to be
achieved by further strengthening transparency and governance in public sector
operations and by extending the national consultation process," Mr. Carstens stated.
Background
During the period 1998-2002, Honduras' macroeconomic performance was particularly
affected by adverse external shocks, and social conditions remained depressed. In 2003,
despite some improvement in macroeconomic indicators, economic and financial
conditions remained difficult. Growth picked up moderately to slightly more than 3
percent, led by construction, tourism, and the re-export industry. Inflation slowed slightly
to 6% percent, despite higher world o i l prices. The external position weakened further.
The current account deficit widened to an estimated 5% percent o f GDP, reflecting higher
o i l prices and buoyant imports related to investment in the leading sectors. The debt
burden remained heavy, with total public debt amounting to 72 percent o f GDP at the end
o f 2003, and the combined public sector deficit widened to 4% percent o f GDP in 2003.
Program summary
The main objectives of Honduras' 2004-2006 economic program are to reduce poverty by
reactivating the poverty-reduction strategy, and to strengthen growth by reversing the
financial deterioration, implementing important structural reforms, supporting
investment, and fostering trade liberalization.
Under the program, annual growth i s expected to raise gradually from an estimated 3.2
percent in 2003 to 4% percent in 2006-2008. The main pillars o f the authorities' growth
strategy are: a revival o f private investment as key sectors are opened to private
participation; complementary public investment in infrastructure; participation in regional
free trade agreements, notably CAFTA; regulatory and other reforms to meet the goals o f
the National Competitiveness Plan; and governance, judicial, and political reforms.
Fiscal adjustment under the program i s designed to lower the deficit to a level that can
be financed by projected concessional external support and, with HIPC debt relief, i s
expected to achieve medium-term fiscal sustainability. The combined public sector
deficit i s targeted to decline from an estimated 4% percent o f GDP in 2003 to 1% percent
o f GDP in 2006.
Spending will be reoriented to achieve a recovery o f public investment. The PRSP
envisages an increase o f 0.6 percent o f GDP in anti-poverty spending in 2004, and
equivalent increases in 2005 and 2006.
Monetary and exchange rate policies will aim at gradually reducing inflation to the
level o f Honduras' main trading partners, within the context o f the existing crawling band
exchange rate arrangement.
O n the structural reform agenda, the authorities see the financial reform as urgent to
address the fragilities o f the banking system, and see governance reforms as a vital
element in responding to current social concerns and uncertainties about the future. In the
financial sector, the government has begun a comprehensive reform program, designed to
strengthen central bank functions, prudential regulations and supervision; improve the
financial safety net; and fight financial crime. O n governance, the government has
already begun political and judicial reforms and i s working to enhance fiscal
transparency.
Honduras i s an original member o f the IMF. I t s quota i s SDR 129.5 million (about
US$195.8 million), and its outstanding use o f IMF credit currently totals SDR 114.40
m i l l i o n (about US$172.9 million).
