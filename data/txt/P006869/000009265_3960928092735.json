The basic objectives are as\n            follows : a) improve the cost effectiveness of the Colombian\n            Institute of Family Welfare ( ICBF ) operations; b) support\n            the institutional development of ICBF; and c) evaluate,\n            improve and maintain the quality of home based child care (\n            HBI ). The project will finance the main investment costs of\n            the HBI expansion during 1990/95. It will consist of the\n            following components : 1) policy development - i) enhancing\n            the effectiveness of ICBF resource use by establishing\n            revised financing arrangements for the CAIPs and reducing\n            the ICBF's budget contribution to the program and ii)\n            improving the production efficiency of Bienestarina ( an\n            important food supplement ); 2) management development -\n            strengthening the management capacity of ICBF in a number of\n            areas, including implementing monitoring and impact\n            evaluation systems for the HBIs on a national scale; and 3)\n            service support - through assistance in consolidating gains\n            of the HBI program; improving quality through introduction\n            of systematic training for community mothers and other HBI\n            participants; and by providing access to home improvement\n            credits to community mothers."}, "docdt": "1990-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
