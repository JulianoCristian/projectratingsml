implementing recommendations in the country\n            environmental strategy paper (CESP) concerning more\n            efficient management of natural resources; and (c)\n            coordinating

(PDIAIM) now in process. To break the poverty cycle, the\n            project will improve the basic ecological functions (water\n            and mineral cycles, ecological succession) through resource\n            management, thus bringing about sustainable yield increases\n            in crops and livestock and increased incomes for\n            participating communities. The project's three\n            components are: (1) financing investments in 250 villages\n            chosen from representative agro-ecological zones in the\n            country s rainfed area; (2) strengthening government\n            services to support community organization, improve the\n            legal framework for local empowerment, and finance\n            government's technical support to beneficiaries; and\n            (3) enhancing skills, including developing required\n            technologies (research, short- and medium-term technical\n            assistance), and disseminating those technologies through\n            extension and training."}, "docdt": "1997-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
