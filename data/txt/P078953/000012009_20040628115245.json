 results-oriented, and participatory planning, including\n            monitoring and evaluation, emphasizing on decentralized\n            social programs at the Ministry for Women and Social\n            Development - MIMDES. The first component will improve the\n            quality of social policies and programs, taking into account\n            the issue of decentralization, whether already\n            decentralized, or subject to future decentralization;\n            whereas the second component will implement Performance\n            Agreements and Accreditation of social sectors, by ensuring\n            adequate decentralization of the social programs, through\n            the design, and implementation of the instruments for the\n            accreditation process, particularly for social programs;\n            implementing performance, and/or management agreements\n            (PAS); and, by monitoring and evaluating budget transfers to\n            sub-national governments. The third component aims at\n            improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in the Social\n            Sectors. The purpose of this component is to build M&E\n            capacity by strengthening existing monitoring instruments,\n            and establishing new ones as necessary, and strengthening\n            analytical capacity among the different actors engaged in\n            the implementation process."}, "docdt": "2004-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
