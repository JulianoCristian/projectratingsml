      satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included: 1) The design of water supply plants needs to be\n            developed based on a combination of cost-effective technical\n            specifications, appropriate and well-defined design\n            standards and accurate forecasting of future demand for\n            water consumption; 2) Positive hygiene behavior change is a\n            long-term process that requires targeted, effective and\n            sustained hygiene promotion messages; 3) In order to\n            maximize the benefits of the projects, it is important that\n            sufficient attention be given to sanitation and hygiene\n            promotion and these should be well integrated and\n            coordinated with water supply investments and activities; 4)\n            Ensuring community participation in the design, planning,\n            implementation and post-construction management of the\n            project is challenging if insufficient project budget is\n            allocated at the project design stage for these activities\n            and there are insufficient capacity and mechanisms to\n            support such participation; 5) The principle of user\n            financing has worked effectively in China and is an example\n            for global dissemination; 6) Clarity on the issues of water\n            supply plant ownership and ways to expedite the hand-over\n            process for completed plants would strengthen\n            post-construction management arrangements, leading to\n            greater sustainability and better service; 7) Households\n            need to be offered a choice of affordable sanitation options\n            as well as adequate information in order to make an informed\n            decision; 8) Better coordination amongst the many line\n            departments with responsibilities for the sector would help\n            to improve the efficiency of the project and the skill\n            available for implementation; 9) The potential impact of\n            natural disasters, such as typhoons and droughts, needs to\n            be considered when assessing the availability of water\n            resources and emergency preparedness; 10) Consideration\n            needs to be given to the increased wastewater produced by\n            increased water consumption, particularly in densely\n            populated areas; and 11) Any covenant which is set to ensure\n            the sustainability for the water supply schemes, should be\n            developed taking into account the actual requirements for\n            rural water supply schemes and the affordability of beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "2007-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
