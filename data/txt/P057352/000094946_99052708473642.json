Sanitation Project aims to provide people in poor rural\n            areas clean, safe water supply, while improving related\n            sanitation and health behaviors through education and pilot\n            investments. There are three project components: 1) Water\n            supply component will give villagers in all 27 counties the\n            opportunity to invest in improved water supplies. Households\n            can choose whether to invest in individual household\n            connections or to rely on community standposts. 2)\n            Sanitation and health education component will help to\n            reduce incidences of waterborne disease by a) making\n            available information on improved latrine designs, their\n            investment costs, and economic and health benefits through\n            sponsoring village information sessions about water supply,\n            improved latrines, and related hygiene practices; b)\n            financing improved latrine facilities on a demonstration\n            basis in project village schools and in selected households\n            in each project village; and c) identifying specific types\n            of behavioral change that will improve health conditions. 3)\n            Project management component will be in charge of the\n            county, province, and national project offices; provide\n            technical assistance and training; finance project\n            management and supervision activities; and carry out\n            baseline surveys."}, "docdt": "1999-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
