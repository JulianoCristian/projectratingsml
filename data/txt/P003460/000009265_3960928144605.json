           improving the utilization and management of water resources\n            and urban transport services in Liaoning Province, an\n            important industrial base in China.  The specific objectives\n            are to: (a) improve water supply conditions; (b) improve\n            traffic and public transport conditions; and (c) improve\n            measures for water pollution abatement. The water supply\n            component will develop physical works, including\n            transmission and distribution pipelines, water intake works,\n            pumping stations, and water treatment works.  It includes a\n            study of water resource and water supply pricing.  A water\n            pollution control component will provide technical\n            assistance for a study of industrial wastewater treatment\n            and environmental regulations.  In addition, equipment will\n            be acquired for environmental monitoring.  The urban\n            transport component, will improve about 44 km of arterial\n            road corridors, and provide equipment, technical assistance\n            and training to support management of public transport\n            operations, in particular, road and public vehicle\n            maintenance, road safety measures, and operations\n            management.  Technical assistance will be included in the\n            project to assist in planning and design of a second phase\n            of the investment program, focusing on water pollution abatement."}, "docdt": "1991-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
