PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In July, 1969 the Government of Iran requested a loan to assist in
financing the foreign exchange cost of the project which would provide for
the expansion of the telephone and telex/gentex services. The proposed loan
would be the Bank's first loan for public telecommunications in Iran.
3.        Identification and pre-appraisal missions visited Iran in Auigust/
September, 1969 and in Februiary, 1970 and an appraisal mission was in Iran
in May, 1970.  Negotiation of the proposed loan was completed on October 7,
1970. The Iranian delegation consisted of: Mr. H. Ansari, Managing Director,
Telephone Company of Iran; Mr. H. Nikain and Mr. F. Afrouz of the Plan Organi-

5.        As stated in report (P-866) dated October 14, 1970 on the Tehran
Power Distribution Loan, disbursements on some of the loans have been slow.
Disbursements on the two highway loans (410-IRJ and 411-IRN) fell behind
because payments to contractors had been allowed to fall into arrears.
However, the Iranian authorities have brought payments up-to-date anid arranged
to keep payments current with work performed.   Following the recent visit
of a Bank supervision mission, measures to improve the pace of implementation
of the Ghazvin Agricultural Project (517-IRN) will be reviewed with the
Borrower. Disbursements on the Dez Irrigation Project (594-IRN) have only
recently commenced, but about a third of the loan has already been committed.
In the case of the IMDBI loans the rate of commitment is faster than scheduled.
6.        The IFC has invested $4.2 million in the Ahwaz Steel Products Company
and the Kahkashan Company manufacturing ceramic tiles. A number of new
proposals are being considered by the IFC.

PART III - TIHE PROJECT
8.        A report entitled "Appraisal of Telecommunications Project Iran"
(PU-53a) dated October 23, 1970 is attached.
9.        The development of telecommunications in Iran has not kept pace with
progress in other sectors. In the capital city of Tehran, where growth in
trade and commerce has been especially rapid, the telephone system is quite
inadequate. Despite a heavy subscriber's deposit (payable partly on applying
for service) there is a waiting list of over 50,000 applicants in Tehran and
more than 30,000 in other centers. The average waiting time for telephones
exceeds two years and the existing network is overloaded; there is often more
than a day's delay in completing business calls between major cities. The
social and economic costs resulting from this situation are considerable and
activities in Government, trade and commerce are severely impeded. An improve-
ment in telecommunications services is an important requirement if the high
rate of growth planned is to be achieved.
10.       Local telephone services are presently operated by the Telephone
Company of Iran (TCI), a wholly government owned joint stock company.  Other
telephone, telex and telegraph services are operated by a department of the
Ministry of Posts, Telegraph and Telephones (PTT), which is also responsible
for regulatory and licensing functions. TCI is organized along commercial
lines, employs competent staff, and its accounting system meets commercial
standards. PTT is, however, deficient in these respects.
11.       The present division of responsibilities between TCI and PTT is an
impediment to the rational development of telecommunications and results in
inefficient operation, increased costs and other problems.  The Government
has decided, therefore, to establish a single commercial entity, the Iran
Telecommunications Company (ITC). Legisla'tio,i is required, and its passage
is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.  It would then be
necessary for the authorities to take a number of important steps to establish
the new company effectively. To direct the work essential to the setting up
and initial phases of operation of ITC, a steering committee composed of senior
officials of TCI, PTT and Plar, Organization has been established. IManagement
consultants, to be financed under the proposed loan, wlould advise and assist
in setting up the new organization.  The main problems are concerned with the
valuation of assets and capitalization of the new company, the early extension
of TCI's internal accounting system to embrace former PTT activities and
arrangements for the transfer and appointment of staff to the new company.
In view of the importance of establishing the new company satisfactorily,
the post of Managing Director is a key position. A suitable nominee has been
selected by the Government.
12.       The project is designed to rehabilitate and develop telephone and
telex services. It consists of TCI's ongoing program for the growth of local



telephone services during the period March 1970 - March 1974, together with
two small items from the PTT program. It will provide:
(a) telephone exchange equipment, subscriber distribution plant,
inter-office cables, sites and buildings for the connection
of about 300,000 additional subscriber lines;
(b)  cables linking local networks with the new trunk dialing exchanges;
(c) telex/gentex switching equipment in Tehran and ten provincial centers
to allow for the connection of an additional 2,0C0 telex subscribers,
and 290 gentex services; and
(d) management consultants and engineering services.
13.       The project is estimated to cost $149.2 million with a foreign
exchange component of $,91.7 million. The proposed loan of $36 million would
cover about 75 percent of the total foreign exchange cost of telephone cables,
the major project item, and the full foreign exchange cost of the telex
switching equipment and the consultants.  Foreign exchange costs not covered
by the proposed loan are to be met by suppliers' credits.
14.        The existing levels of telephone tariffs are inadequate to ensure
the financial viability of the new company. The Borrower has undertaken to
introduce from March, 1971 suitably increased local and long distance tariffs
and not to vary them during the project period without consulting the Bank.
Furthermore, to secure the continuing financial viability of ITC, the Borrower
has undertaken that from March 21, 1974 ITC will maintain its tariffs at a level
sufficient to achieve a financial rate of return after taxes of at least 9
percent on its net fixed assets.
15.       The proceeds of the proposed loan are to be passed on to TCI (later
ITC) by the Plan Organization, the government agency through which all foreign
borrowings for the public sector are channelled, as debt on the same terms
as the Bank loan under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement.  The Borrower has under-
taken to take such action as shall be necessary to ensure that after March 21,
1973 (i.e. from the commencement of the Fifth Plan) the company's debt to
equity ratio would not exceed 50:50, and to ensure that no debt will be
incurred by the company unless its annual revenue is more than twice its
maximum debt service requirements.
16.       All imported equipment and cables for the project will be procured
through international competitive bidding except for that part of the telephone
exchange equipment and subscriber apparatus that is being provided under
suppliers' credit. The rest of the telephone exchange equipment and subscriber
apparatus is being supplied by the local manufacturer, the Iran Telephone
Manufacturing Company, and is not being financed under the Bank loan. Procure-
ment of some items such as locally manufactured cable-ducts will be by local
bidding. These are included in local currency costs and are not being financed
under the Bank loan. To ensure that exchange facilities now available or

under construction are brought into service as soon as possible, the Bank has
agreed to TCI's calling for bids on about $12 million worth of equipment and
cables pending approv.l of the proposed loan. NTo orders have yet been placed.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.        The Draft Loan Agreement between the Government of Iran and the
Bank, the Draft Project Agreement between the Bank and TCI, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
18.       The loan documents follow the general pattern of otlher recent
agreements for telecommunications projects. The following provisions of
the Draft Loan Agreement are of particular interest:
(a) Section 4.04 provides that the charter of ITC shall be in form
and substance satisfactory to the Bank and that the Borrower
will within three months from the date of effectiveness of the
Loan transfer to ITC the assets, liabilities, properties and
facilities of TCI and the assets, liabilities, properties and
facilities relating to the telecommunications operations of
the Teleconmmunications Department of the Ministry of PTT.
(b)  Section 4.08 provides (i) that the Borrower undertakes to
cause ITC to carry out TCI's obligations under the Project
Agreement and the subsidiary loan agreement between the Borrower
and TCI; and (ii) that the Borrower shall provide the Bank, by
a date not later than four months from the date of effectiveness
of the Loan, with evidence satisfactory to the Bank that the
obligations of TCI under the Project Agreement and subsidiary
loan agreement have been validly assumed by ITC.
PART V - THE ECONO01Y
19.        An economic report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects of
Iran" (SA-8a) dated December 31, 1969, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on January 7, 1970 (R70-2). A basic data sheet dated October 28,
1970 is annexed.
20.        Comments on the economy were given in my report ;No. P-866 dated
October 14, 1970 on a loan to Iran for the Tehran Power Distribution Project.
