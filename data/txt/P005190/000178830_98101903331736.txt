DIPERIAL GOVEERi4ENT OF IRAN -- TS.ECOI4I4UNICATIONS PROJECT
SUV1NMARY AND CONCUJSIONS
i.        The Imperial Government of Iran has applied for a Bank loan
to help finance a program of rehabilitation and expansion of telecom-
munications services forming part of the Fourth National Development
Plan and to be executed daring the period 1970-1974.
ii.       Iran's shortage of telecommunications is a serious impediment
to its commerce and trade- Eith 254,000 telephone services connected, there
is a recorded waiting list of over 80,000 applicants, of whom some 50,000
are in the capital city of Teheran. Under-provision of facilities is even
worse in the long-distance network, and many trunk calls between major cities
are not completed on the day of placeinent.
iii.      Local telephone services are operated by the Telephone Company
of Iran (TCI), a Government-owned company. The international and long-
distance telephone service and telex and telegraph services are operated
by a department of the iMinistry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (PTT).
TCI is well managed and the local network, although overloaded, is well
maintained. TCI's financial results over the past few years have not been
satisfactory because of low telephone tariffs, but a rate increase (to
takce effect from March 1971) will put operations on a profitable basis.
iv.       PTTts organization and operation are not efficient and there
is evidence of overstaffing and inadequate maintenance. PTT has no
commercial accounting system or assets register, and financial controls
are confined to the requirements of overall Government budgeting.
v.        The Government proposes to establish by December 1970 a new
commercial entity, the Iran Telecommunications Company (ITC), by the merger
of TOI and the telecommunications services of PTT. Draft legislation
has been prepared for establishment of the new company, which should bring
about increased overall efficiency and improved coordination. It is
planned to employ management consultants to advise and help set up the
company. To assist in the transitional arrangements, a high-level Joint
Steering Committee composed of representatives of TCI, PTT and Plan
Organization has been formed.
vi.       The project identified for Ban'< financing covers the period
March 1970 - March 1974 and consists of the provision of 300,000 local
telephone services, linIing of the local and trunk networ!cs, provision
of a new Telex/Gentex network, and employment of management consultants
to assist in the merger. The total project cost is US$149.2 million,
with a foreign exchange component of US$91.7 million of which the proposed
Bank loan would finance US$36 million.



- ii -
vii.      The Bank loan would be to the Government of Iran, represented by
the Plan Organization.  The Beneficiary would be TCI (and its successor,
ITC), which would be responsible for project execution.
viii.     All project items except telephone switching equipment and items
and services provided in Iran, will be purchased through international
competitive bidding. Telephone switching equipment, which is not proposed
for Bank financing, is obtained from local manufacturers and German suppliers.
ix.       Because of the urgent need to connect waiting applicants, TCI is,
with Bank approval, inviting bids for cables and Telex equipment (total
estimated cost US$12 million) but no orders have yet been placed.
x.        The notional accounts of the proposed new company, ITC, indicate
that by 1974 its rate of return, after taxes, will be 9.0%. The internal
financial return on the project is assessed at 23%.
xi.       The project is suitable for a loan of US$36 million for a term of
20 years, including a 5-year grace period. The Loan will be relent by the
Borrower to the Beneficiary on similar terms and conditions.



IMPERIAL GOVERNMEM1T OF MRAN -- TELBCOM4UNICATIONS PROJECT
1.  INTRODU5TITON
1.01      In July 1969, the Imperial Government of Iran applied to the
Bank for a first loan for public telecommunications development. Identifica-
tion and pre-appraisal visits were made in August/September 1969 and in
February 1970. An appraisal mission composed of Messrs. C.R. Dickenson,
H. Hillebrenner and I.A. Newstead was in Iran in Miay 1970. Mr. 1). Suratgar
joined the mission for discussions concerning the legal aspects of sector
organization and loan arrangements.
1.02      The project identified for Bank financing provides for the
expansion of telephone service by 300,000 lines and Telex/Gentex by
2,300 lines during the period March 1970 - March 1974. It includes pro-
vision of cables between the local and long-distance telephone networks
and the employment of management consultants. The project cost is estimated
at Us$149.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$91.7 million.
The proposed loan of   US$36 million would help finance the growth of
telecommunications under the Fourth National Development Plan (March 1968-
March 1973), in which the telecommunications program was recently rephased
to March 1974.
1.03      The proposed loan would cover about 75% of the foreign exchange
cost of telephone cables (the major project item) and the full foreign
exchange costs of two other items, telex switching equipment and the
hire of consultants.  The remaining foreign exchange would be provided
by supplier credits and other foreign loans. Local costs would be
financed by earnings and by Government grants made through the Plan
Organization.
1.04      The telecommunications sector will be greatly strengthened
by the establishment in December 1970 of the Iran Telecommunications
Company (ITC) through a merger of the present Telephone Company of Iran
(TCI) and the telecommunications services of the Ministry of Posts and
Telegraphs. Hence the conditions and implementation of this merger are
of central importance.

2.   THE SECTO RAND THE BORRfWfER
A.   The Economic Setting
2.01      Iran, with frontiers adjoining Iraq, Turkey  the USSR,
Afghanistan and Pakistan, has an area of 1,648,000  m--equivalent in size
to approxi.mately the whole Earopean Economic Community. The country is
largely a semiarid plateau; there are high mountains and much barren
desert, with the most cultivable land extending along the fertile Caspian
littoral.  Iran's population, estimated at 28 million, is growing at a
rate of 3 per year. Despite the Government's decentralization policy,
there is still considerable migration to the main urban centers, particu-
larly the capital city of Teheran, whose population has increased seven-
fold since l;brld War II.
2.02      Agriculture contributes about 24h  of GNP, but this is expected
to decline because of the emphasis being given during the Fourth Develop-
ment Plan (1968-1972) to-the expansion of the petroleum, mining and
manufacturing industries. The petroleum industry represents about 18%
of GNP; it provides 80% of foreign exchange earnings and about half of
Government revenues. Mining and manufacturing together contribute about
12% of G(P.
2.03      Development of the country has been very rapid and CUP grew
at an annual rate of 8.6% in real terms during the Third Plan period
1963-1967. The Fourth Plan calls for an overall increase in GNP of
around 24 per year, with growth rates set for the various sectors ranging
from 4  per year for agriculture to 17% for petroleum and mining.
2.04      Ihe per capita income in 1967 was US$287 and is projected to
increase to US$390 by the end of the Fourth Plan. Prices have been
stable; the cost of living index has averaged an annual increase of
only about 1.5$,- since 1962.
Importance of Telecommunications Sector
2.05      To achieve the planned high rate of economic growth requires
the support of a well-developed infrastructure, of which telecommuni-
cations is an important part. Concentration of the population in the
northern and central cities, with oil development and ports located
in the south and agriculture centered in the north, also places special
emphasis on telecommunications to bridge the long distances between
virtual "oases" of development.



- 3 -
2.06      Iran has a severe deficiency of telecommunications, with a
waiting list for telephones of over 50,000 applicants in Teheran and
a further 30,000 recorded in other centers. Tne average delay in
providing service exceeds two years. The shortage of telephones is
causing excessive usage of the existing facilities, with consequent
overloading of the network traffic capacity and degradation of service
standards.  The situation is similar in the long-distance network;
even between major cities, business cal.ls often cannot be completed
on the day of placement.
2.07      Government, trade and commerce are all handicapped by the
inadequacy of telecommunications. The Teheran Chamber of Commerce
reports that it constantly receives complaints from its members about
the deficiencies of the teleconmunications systems.
B.   Organization, Iianagement and Operation of Telecommunications
Present Position
2.08      There are two telecommunications operating entities and one
manufacturing entity in Iran. Local telephone services are operated by
the Telephone Company of Iran (TCI), a wholly Government-owmed company.
Long-distance and international telephone services, telex and telegraph
services, as well as the postal services, are operated by departments
of the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (PTT), which also
has the telecommunications regulatory and licensing functions. Telecom-
munications switching eouipment is manufactured by the Iran Telephone
Manufacturing Company (ITMC).
(i) Telephone Company of Iran
2.09      TCI was formed in 1934 to take over the assets and franchise of
a former private company that had been operating since 1903.  It has a
four-member Board of Directors including the Managing Director, who is
the chief executive of the company. TCI is organized along commercial
lines and operates with a high degree of autonomy except in relation to
raising of capital, wihich can be obtained only through the Government's
Plan Organization.
2.10      There is an adeauate accounting system in operation, both at
headquarters and in the regions, which meets commercial standards and
provides effective financial controls. A stores accounting system based
on punched cards is operating satisfactorily, and telephone revenue
accounting is being converted to computer operation. Commencing in 1969,
the accounts of TCI wfere subject to an annual independent audit in accordance
with normal commercial practice.



- 4 -
2.U1      An organization chart for TCI is shown in Annex 1, page 1.
Due to the rapid expansion of telephone networks throughout the country,
TCI is reviewing its organization with a view to greater decentralization
of works to the regions, the merging of some maintenance and installation
activities, and the creation of an internal auditing department.
2.12      Senior management staff are considered competent, forward-
looking and commercially minded. In one respect some criticism can be
levied in that procurement of local exchange and cable requirements has
not been so coordinated as to ensure the earliest and maximum utilization
of available resources. In the light of their experience, management
can be expected to show a better performance in coordination of planning
in the future.
2.13      Total TCI staff is about 4,500, which is reasonable for the
present scale of operations. At the operating level, the staff are
technically competent; morale is high and installations are well
maintained.
2.14      TCI has a small training school, and other on-the-job and
overseas training is carried out in collaboration with equipment suppliers.
The training facilities are efficiently utilized but need expanding.
After 1971, new PTT training facilities that are being set up with UNDP
assistance will be available (see paragraph 2.18).
(ii)  MiXnistry of Postjs Telegraphs and Telephones
2.15      An organization chart for the PTT Ministry is shown in
Annex 1, page 2. The departments are under the ciontrol of four Deputy
Ministers: one is responsible for postal matters; two are responsible
for telecommunications planning and operations, respectively; and the
fourth handles Parlimentary matters and general administration.  PTT's
financial operation follows traditional governmental lines, with income
paid into a consolidated revenue account and capital and operating funds
coming from the Government Budget (through Plan Organization).
2.16      The organization and operations of PTT are not efficient.  PIT
does not have an adequate accounting system, assets register or audit.
Maintenance and operating expenses for new installations are often charged
aginst capital for considerable periods. There is a marked lack of
commercial outlook among management personnel; costly plant comitments,
such as the new microwave (JIlTS) system, appear to have been made without
complete study of the full financial implications.
2.17      PTT's telecommunications staff of over 4,OO0 is high in relation
to the volume of communications services, and there was evidence of over-
staffing at the PTT installations inspected. The managerial and technical
caliber of staff needs to be improved, along with the general standards of
maintenance of installations.



-5-
2.18       PTT has a small technicians training school and is establishing,
with UI{DP assistance, a telecommunications institute for engineers and
technicians that is planned to commence operation in 1971. The output
of trained technical staff will reach 300 per annum after three years
and, together with other training programs contracted with the principal
telecommunication equipment suppliers, should be adequate for the needs
of the sector over the next five years.
(iii) Plan Organization
2.19       As the centralized governmental body responsible for national
planning decisions and the allocation of Government funds, the Plan Organiza-
tion approves and finances PTT's entire development and that part of TCI's
development not financed by internal cash generation and subscriber deposits.
Plan Organization has a telecommunications section headed by a capable
engineer, and has a good appreciation of the problems of Iran's telecom-
munications sector.
(iv) Iran Telephone Manufacturing Company (ITMC)
2.20       Owned jointly by the Iranian Government and Siemens (Germany),
this company was established in 1968 with the assistance of a Bank Loan
(495-IRN) to the Industrial Mining and Development Bank of Iran (IMBDI).
Present annual capacity is 30,000 lines of switching equipment and 45,000
telephone sets; an extension of the factory is in hand to raise the
capacity to 45,000 exchange lines and 60,000 telephones by 1972. The
factory is an efficient production unit. Details concerning ITMC are given
in Annex 2.
Proposed Sector Organization
2.21       The present division of responsibilities for long-distance and
local telephone services between PTT and TCI is a stumbling block to the
rational development of facilities and results in additional investment,
inefficient use of staff, and customer service problems that include dual
subscriber accounts. The PTT activity needs considerable reorganization
and improvement to function along commercial lines.
2.22       The Minister of PTT has therefore recommended and the Governmenit
has agreed to the merger of TCI and the telecommunications services of PVT
(excluding governmental regulatory functions) into a single commercial
entity to be called the Iran Telecommunications Company (ITC). It is
expected that the necessary legislation creating the new company will be
passed before the end of 1970. Draft legislation for the legal establish-
ment of ITC has been agreed with the Bank, and the enactment of legislation
substantially in accordance with this draft will be a condition of effecti.e-
ness of the loan. The Bank has advised'Government that the post of manag-
ing director of the new Company is of special-importance to the sucessful
establish.-,ent of the new organization and should be fil:led by a suitable
and competent person, especially during the formative period.



2.23       The new entity will take over the telecommunications assets,
liabilities and responsibilities of TCI and PIT. The organizational
pattern of ITC and its internal accounting and management systems will
be a logical development of the arrangements existing in TCI. The
merger will bring about economies and service improvement through the
technical integration of all public communications under unified commercial
management.
Trans itonal Arrangements
2.24       Following the legal establishment of ITC, a number of important
steps must be taken to ensure the new company's effective establishment.
These steps and a preliminary timetable, set out in Annex 3, were agreed
during negotiations. The major problems to be resolved are (1) the valuatio.
of assets and capitalization of the new company, (2) the extension of TCI's
internal accounting system to embrace former PTT activities, and (3) arrange-
ments for the transfer and appointment of staff to ITC.
2.25       Concerning the valuation of PTT assets, a nationwide microwave
system (INTS network) is being installed in accordance with an urgent
timetable because of the large defense communications component, and this
has resulted in a high PTT program cost. To avoid penalizing the new
company financially, it has been agreed that valuation of this network
upon transfer to ITC should be on a realistic basis and that the extra
costs resulting from the urgency of the requirements, estimated at about
US$61 million, will be excluded from the transferred assets. Also, ITC
will be paid appropriate annual rentals for the defense circuits and for
special facilities provided for television relay (paragraphs 2.51 and 5.01).
2.26       Interim accounting procedures, based on existing TCI practice,
need to be specified and introduced by March 1971 in order that trans-
actions during fiscal year 1971/72 can be compiled consistently for ITC
as a whole. This will be an initial task of the management consultants
(see paragraph 2.29).
2.27       Concerning staff requirements, a considerable overlap of
responsibilities and duties exists between TCI and PTT departments.
Staff surpluses are largely in the latter, whose personnel also is less
qualified to operate successfully in a business environment. However,
the Minister expects that any redundant PTT staff can be absorbed into
the postal services and other Government departments. With ITCts creation,
TCI will legally cease to exist and its staff will be provisionally trans-
ferred to the new company, while the PTT staff initially will be seconded
to the company as needed. Staff appointments to the company would be made
progressively, with the consent of the Minister of PTT, as the new
organization needs and staff qualifications are established. The Bank
was assured during negotiations that the Government intends to transfer
staff to ITC in accordance with these principles.



- 7 -
2.28      To direct the work essential to the setting up and initial phases
of operation of ITC, a Joint Telecommunications Steering Committee has been
established. This is a high-level committee of TCI, PTT and Plan Organiza-
tion. The terms of reference were agreed with the Bank and are given in
Annex 4.
2.29      Also, management consultants, to be financed under the loan
(paragraph 3.07), will be brought in as early as possible to advise and
assist in setting up the integrated organization. They will report to the
Joint Steering Committee and do their work in accordance with the timetable
in Annex 3. Attached as Annex 5 is an outline of the scope of the consul-
tants' work. The employment of consultants and their general terms of ref-
erence were confirmed during negotiations.
C. Lending Arrangements
2.30      Neither TCI nor its successor ITC is empowered to contract foreign
loans. Hence the proposed Bank loan would be to the Government of Iran on
whose behalf the Plan Organization in turn would make the funds available
to the beneficiary TCI (later ITC) on the same terms i.e. for 20 years
including a 5-year grace period and an assumed interest rate of V4- . The
Beneficiary will be responsible for all aspects of project execution, includ-
ing items that are now PTT's responsibility, under the terms of a separate
project agreement.
D. Existing Facilities
2.31      TCI has 42 automatic exchanges in operation; 16 are in Teheran
and 26 in the provinces, where there are also 165 small manual exchanges.
The installed exchange capacity is 316,000 lines of equipment (270,000
automatic and 46,ooo manual), with 254,000 connected exchange lines. Further
connections are dependent on installation of new subscriber cables, for which
initial orders have been placed. Existing and proposed exchanges and the
planned equipment installation under the project are shown in the Map, after
the annexes.
2.32      The existing long-distance facilities, operated by PTT, include
only two large capacity radio systems--the 600 channel CENTO system that
spans Iran diagonally from its border with Turkey to Pakistan and carries
national as well as international traffic, and the 300-channel Shiraz-1sfahan
spur. Other trunk routes are mainly open-wire construction, with 3- and 12-
channel carrier systems. The circuits are quite inadequate for the traffic
volume; consequently it has not been possible to utilize the semi-automatic
switchboards installed in Teheran and all trunk calls are handled manually.
A vast expansion of the trunk network is underway, as part of the development
program discussed in Section 3.

2.33        In Teheran there is an 800-line automatic telex/gentex exchange
with some 260 working telex services that generate largely international
traffic. There is also a small manual telex exchange at Khorramshahr-
Abadan. The telegraph network has some 500 offices, 228 of which have
teleprinters and the remainder Morse instruments. The telegraph traffic
is carried mainly over manually operated point-to-point links, but some
offices have access through the telex exchanges.
2.3h       There is a recently completed satellite earth-station at Arsabah
that carries traffic to Europe and the United States over 19 circuits
operating through the Atlantic satellite. Other international traffic
flows via the CENTO links to Turkey and West Pakistan, and over low capacity
HF radio systems that provide satellite back-up as well as circuits to
other countries not served by the Atlantic satellite. A 10-position
international telephone exchange is installed in Teheran.
E. Financial Aspects
2.35       TCI is an efficiently run organization with reasonable operating
expenses but is at the moment not profitable due to the low tariffs. PTT
suffers from poor financial management, operating expenses are higher than
they should be and long-distance tariffs are low compared to other countries,
all these factors contribute to an unsatisfactory financial position.
2.36       Following the introduction of a new tariff structure in March
1971 and with the improved efficiency of operation resulting from the merger
of TOI and PTT, the new organization ITC is expected to attain a satisfactory
financial position (paragraph 5.07).
TCI
2.37       TCI's balance sheets for the financial years 1967/68, 1968/69
and 1969/70 are shown in Annex 6. Notes on these statements are in Annex 9.
Following is a summary of TCI's balance sheet as of March 20, 1970:

Subscriber deposits                             4,927          65.7
Long-term debt                                    106          1.4
Total liabilities                         6 686         89.1
Net plant in service represents 79% of total assets.  Gross plant is stated
at original cost and accounted for in detailed plant registers. A large
part of these assets have been installed within the last decade and the
prices have been reasonably stable during this period. The book values
are therefore realistic. The provisions for depreciation are computed
for each class of plant on a straight line basis. The resulting composite
rate is 4.5h and the depreciation reserve as of March 20, 1970, amounted
to 30% of total assets. Both of these are satisfactory.
2.38       Current assets amounted to Rials 1,665 million and current
liabilities to Rials 818 million, a ratio of 2 to 1. This ratio is
satisfactory.
2.39       Accounts receivables amounted to Rials 284 million, which is
about 3 months' billings. This situation is acceptable.



- 10 -
2.40       TCI's equity as of March 20, 1970, amounted to 25% of total
capitalization. Apart from reserves, retained earnings and share capital
held by Government, the major part of TCI's equity consists of Plan
Organization funds which represent past contributions to TCI's capital
budget.
2.41       Subscriber deposits represented almost 71% of TCI's capitalization.
Because these deposits are repayable only if subscribers give up service--
and if they do, others will replace them--deposits do not constitute a
long-term debt. On this basis, TCI's debt/equity ratio was 6/94 on March
20, 1970. TCI has no foreign debts because the Plan Organization has
hitherto arranged all foreign supplier credits on TCI's behalf and made the
repayments. Consequently, TCI is responsible for minor local debt only,
which totalled Rials 106 million (about US$1.4 million) on March 20, 1970.
2.42       Income statements for 1968, 1969, and 1970 are shown in Annex 7.
The summarized operating results are given below:
1968          1969           1970
(in millions of RialsT)
Total Revenues                   1,003          1,117          1,326
Total Expenses                     978          1,130          1,332
Net Operating Income
before Interest and Tax           25            (13)            (6)
Net Profit (Loss)                   15            (17)           (10)
Rate of Return                     0.6%           neg.           neg.
Operating ratio                     98%           101%          100%
The above results are unsatisfactory. While TCI's operating expenses were
reasonable, low tariffs did not allow profitable operation. Cash available
to TCI from 1968, 1969 and 1970 operations has little more than covered its
cash operating expenses, and construction works have had to be financed
almost entirely by Plan Organization funds.

PTT
2.43      Since PTT does not maintain its accounts on a commercial basis,
pro forma commercial presentations of the past three years including
balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements (Annexes 10,
11 and 12) have been prepared by the Bank. Notes and assumptions as to
these statements are given in Annex 13. Following is a summary of the
pro forma balance sheet of PTT as of March 20, 1970:
Rials      US$
Million   Million
Assets
Net fixed assets                                  4,079       54.4
Net current assets                                   393       5.2
Total assets                                                  6 77
Liabilities
Equity                                             3,983      53.1
Long-term debt                                       489       6.5
Total liabilities                                 72        395
2.44      Due to the absence of any asset registers, the valuation of
PTT's gross plant in service has been based on Plan Organization data of
funds appropriated to PTT's capital budget during 1956-1969 and on
assumptions listed in Amnex 13. This valuation is necessarily tentative,
and during negotiations agreement was cbtained that PTT'w usets
will be revalued by consultants and formally established.
2.45      All construction works of PTT are financed by funds from Plan
Organization and appropriated annually to PTT's capital budget. Any long-
term debt incurred by Government on PTT's behalf is serviced by Plan Organi-
zation. However, to allow for a commercial presentation of PTT s financial
position it has been assumed that Plan Organization funds are appropriated
in the form of equity contributions and long-term debt would be serviced
by PTT on original terms. Under these assumptions, PTT's debt/equity
ratio would be 11/89 as of Mlarch 20, 1970. Long-term debt incurred on
PTT's behalf is show6n in Annex 23.
2.46      Pro forma commercial statements of income for the financial
years 1968, 1969 and 1970 are shown in Annex 11. Revenues and expenses
other than depreciation were estimated from data obtained from PTT's
budgetary accounts.



-12-
Notes and assumptions used in preparing these notional figures are given
in Annex 13. The condensed operating results are presented below.
1968.      1969     1970
(in millions of Rials)
Total revenues                        769         912     l,lOL
Total expenses                         713        883     1,255
Net operating income before interest   56          29      (151)
Net profit (loss)                       56         29      (304)
Rate of return                        4.2%       1.7%       neg.
Operating ratio                       93%         97%       114
During the period 1968-1970, revenues iniereased at an annual rate of about
20%, but expenses increased at over 30% per year, due mainly to poor
financial management and the absence of an adequate tariff policy. The
rate of return, already very low in 1968 and 1969, turned negative in 1970
and the operating ratio deteriorated to a figure of 114 in 1970. The
earning position is very unsatisfactory.
Tariffs
2.47      The current level of telephone tariffs is inadequate to secure
satisfactory revenues. Details of existing tariffs are given in Annex 14.
The existing telephone tariffs have some special features, discussed below.
2.48      One special feature is that nea subscribers for telephone service
pay Rials 12,000 (US$160) upon applying for service and a further Rials
10,000 (US$133) when connection is made. These amounts are deposits,
refundable only upon termination of service. As they constitute an
important source of financing for the expansion program (paragraph 5.03),
the amounts should not be reduced during the construction period. However,
in order to properly allocate the costs of installation, which average
approximately 3,750 Rials (US$50) per line, the total amount of Rials
22,000 should, as from the date of the next tariff change, be treated
as part installation fee (Rials 3,750) and part deposit (Rials 18,250).
Even though the initial charge is high, many other countries likewise
faced with high rates of growth in demand have adopted similar measures
to help finance their expansion programs and ration the provision of
telephone services.
2.49      Local telephone calls are now free for the first 150 calls; they
are charged at 1 Rial per call for the next 150 calls and thereafter at
2 Rials per call. This increase in charge with usage is an unusual
arrangement in view of the fact that the cost of a call to the Administration
diminishes as the number of calls made by the subscriber increases.
Such an arrangement tends to penalize the heavy user, discourages maximum
effective use of the facilities available, and creates service problems.
The tariff structure also encourages non-revenue producing traffic from
light users who seek to exploit their quota of free calls.



- 13 -
2.50      At present, increases in principal tariffs require the approval
of Parliament (Majlis). However, in the draft legislation for establishing
ITC this authority is being delegated to the Council of Shareholders of the
Company, which will comprise the Ministers of PTT and Finance and the Manag-
ing Director of the Plan Organization. The Minister of PTT has proposed new
tariffs for both local and long-distance services to be effective from March
21, 1971. During negotiations, the Bank was assured that the loan would not
be used before these tariff increases are approved and that the new tariffs
will not be changed during the Project period to March 1974 without consul-
tation with the Bank.
2.51      Details of the existing and proposed tariffs are included in Annex
14. Under the proposed new tariff structure, the charges for all local calls
will be at a uniform rate of 2 Rials (US¢2.7) per call. The telephone rental
will be reduced from Rials 200 (US$2.66) per month to Rials 100 (US$1.33)
together with abolition of the present free call allowance. Charges for
long-distance calls will, on the average, be increased 50%. Furthermore,
application of the trunk tariffs will be rationalized and simplified. The
proposed new telephone rates are adequate to secure ITC's financial viability
and are still reasonable and in line with those of other developing countries.
The total increase in the average subscriber's bill will be about 50%. During
negotiations the Bank received an assurance that defense and TV authorities
will be charged rates based on commercial principles for leased circuits and
other special services,

3. THE PROGRAi AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Program
3.01      Both TCI and PTT are involved in ambitious five-year expansion
programs designed to neet the existing demand for service and, in part,
the projected groiwth in subscribers and traffic during the Fourth Develop-
ment Plan (March 1968-March 1973).  There will still be considerable out-
standing demand for telephone services after completion of the program
(see paragraph 4.03).
3.02      TCIls program provides for installation of 34 new automatic
exchanges and extension of existing exchanges, together with associated
sites, buildings, ducts and cables.  The program provides for an additional
340,000 subscribers and is estimated to cost Rials 13.4 billion (US$178
million). The program has been revised recently and spread over an
additional year, to M,iarch 1974; it nowf reflects feasible achievement levels
with regard to both the necessary staff build-up and training in the early
years, as well as the need to avoid redundancy in the post-project years
when the expansion rate stabilizes as outstanding demand is overtaken.
3.03      PTT's program is estimated to cost Rials 23 billion (US$3o6
million) and covers the provision of--
(a)  A nationwide, high-capacity microwTave network for telephone,
telegraph and television, wiTrth associated m-lultiplexing
equipment.  It will provide nearly 4,000 trunk telephone
channels by 1974, as well as TV relay and extensive defense
communications requirements.
(b)  Automatic trunk switching exchanges at 29 centers, permitting
nationmide introduction of subscriber trunk dialling (STD).
(c) Expansion of automatic Telex/Gentex exchanges to a network
capacity of 3,100 lines, serving Teheran and ten other
cities.
Itemized progran costs, including local and foreign currency components,
are given in Annex 15, pages 1 and 2. T1Jo main items, not forming part
of the project, are those relating to the INTS microwiave-network   -
(US$212 million) and the trunk swvitching exchanges (US$8.6 million).
3.04      The INTS microwave network, which is being installed by a
consortium under a turnkey contract, will provide nationwide trunk-
line and television relay facilities. The network will also provide
extensive defense communications, the urgency of which has been decisive



- 15 -
in determining the network completion timetable and which has made it
logical and economical to advance the much needed relief of the long-
distance telephone service. The consultants (Melpar) estimate the
additional cost due to the urgency factor to be about US$61 million,
which amount will be excluded from ITC assets (paragraph 2.25). The
cost of defense facilities, for which adequate rentals will be paid
(paragraphs 2.51 and 5.01) represents about 25% of the total investment.
The trunk switching exchanges will be supplied by one of the traditional
German suppliers under a contract at present being negotiated, to a time-
table keyed to the completion dates of the major microwave routes. The
switching equipment will be of the EMD type, similar to that used in local
telephone networks.
3.05       When the costs due to the urgency and scale of the defense needs
are taken into consideration, the remaining costs are reasonable. Because
of the contract arrangements applying to the major PTT items, the program
should be capable of completion on schedule. It will provide substantial
rehabilitation of the present network along with capacity for future growth.
Other aspects are discussed under Project Execution (paragraphs 3.16 and 3.17).
3.06       The development programs of PTT and TCI, summarized in Annex 15,
page 2, have been approved by the Plan Organization and will together
constitute the program of  ITC.   It was agreed during negotiations that
extension of this program during the project period by the addition of any
scheme or project with a total expenditure of more than US$10 million will
be made only with the concurrence of the Bank.
B. The Project
3.07       The project for Bank financing consists essentially of TCI's
ongoing program for the growth of local telephone services during the
period March 1970-March 1974, together with two small items from the
PTT program (paragraph 3.08), and provides the following facilities:
(a)  Telephone exchange equipment, subscriber distribution plant,
inter-office cables, sites and buildings for the connection
of about 300,000 additional subscriber lines;
(b) Cables linking local networks with the new trunk dialling
(STD) exchanges;
(c) Telex/Gentex switching equipment at Teheran and ten pro-
vincial centers to allow for the connection of an additional
2,000 Telex subscribers and 290 Gentex services.
(d) Management consultants to assist in the establishment of
ITC (See paragraph 2.29). Their work, outlined in Annex 5,
includes advice on business, engineering and financial
management, extending through the initial operational phases
of ITC.

3.09      Annual capital expenditure and subscriber achievement targets
are shown in Annex 15, page 3. The size and location of telephone exchange
development are shown on the Map. Overall, the project is realistic and
designed to meet established priorities for the extension and improvement
of telephone and telex service, including the introduction of STD. A
schematic diagram, illustrating the relationship between the program and
the project is given in Annex 15, page 4. The estimated costs for the
various provisions of the project are considered reasonable and result
in a cost of approximately US$470 per line for local telephone service,
which is near the mid-point of the range of US$300-700 typically encountered
in developing countries.



-17-
Contingencies
3.10      A total contingency provision of US$4.5 million is included in
the project costs shown in paragraph 3.08, of which US$1.8 million is
contained in the Bank loan figure. Details of the contingency allowances
are as follows:--
Telephone exchange and subscriber equipment. Equipment prices
have been negotiated with the local manufacturer (ITMIC) and the
two German suppliers.  Prices of the imported equipment, which
accounts for 60% of the project requirements, are fixed.  For
the rest of the equipment, to be supplied by ITIMC, the contract
permits price variations due to changes in the cost of imported
materials; with production economies resulting from the current
increase in factory output (see paragraph 2.20), however, no
overall price increase is expected during the project period.
Therefore, no special contingency provision is considered necessary
for equipment costs, but a 10% price contingency is included
in local installation labor costs.
Telephone cables and wires. A 5% physical contingency is included
in local and foreign   rencies to cover variations in cable
quantity estimates. The price of cable is not expected to rise
over the next five years, due to an expected trend toward lower
copper prices from the 1969 average level of US066.6 per lb;
recent studies in the Bank forecast an average price of US050
during 1972-1976. Over the past ten years, improvements in
cable design and production techniques have largely offset
increases in material and labor costs and this trend is expected
to continue.
Sites and buildings.  Many of the buildings have already been
contracted. The estimates are based on recent experience
and include reasonable contingencies.
Telex/Gentex exchange equipment. A 10% contingency has been
included in the foreign currency component to cover price
variations and possible design changes in this new network.
Procurement
3.11      All imported eauipment and cables required for the project will
be procured through international competitive bidding with the exception
of the telephone exchange equipment and subscriber apparatus under item
(a)(i) of the table at paragraph 3.08 above. The table gives the items
gaxid value of goods included for Bank financing. The telephone equipment
and subscriber apparatus at item (a)(i) is being iupplied partly from the
local manufacturer, ITNC, (see paragraph 2.20), and partly under supplier's
credit from two German suppliers at 1962 Bundespost prices, less discounts
of from 16% to 25%.



- 18 -
3.12      Procurement of certain goods such as locally manufactured cable-
ducts will be by local bidding. These are included in local currency costs
and are outside Bank financing. Most of the STD cables and some of the
larger subscriber cables will be installed by contract (after international
tendering), and the remainder under local force account. Duct installation
and building construction works will be executed through contractors after
inviting bids locally.
3.13      To ensure that exchange facilities now available and under
construction are brought into service as soon as possible to meet the
large waiting demand for telephones and Telex, TCI has with Bank approval
invited bids for cables, and will shortly be issuing tenders for Telex/
Gentex switching equipment (total estimated cost US$12 million). No
contracts have yet been placed for any purchases to be financed under the
loan.
Disbursement
3.14      The proposed loan would be disbursed against CIF costs of imported
equipment and material, and the foreign currency costs for installation of
STD cables and the consultants' services. Annual capital expenditure for
the total development program is given in Annex 15, page 2, and for the
project and loan on page 3. Estimated quarterly disbursements and the
underlying assumptions made are shown in Annex 16.
3.15      The size of the current expansion program is limited partly by the
resources available and will not meet all the forecast demand for services
(see paragraph 4.03).  Therefore, any unused loan balance could be applied,
after consultation with the Bank, to the purchase of additional goods
similar to those procured under the loan, provided that local physical
resources are adequate to ensure their effective use.
Project Execution
3.16      Considerable use has been made of consultants, both for long-
range planning studies and for preparation of specifications, design
and supervision of projects. Two firms deal separately with the microwave
and switching system programs, while a resident German team of six experts
from the BundesPost helps the local ataff in implementation planning.
The collective technical expertise is therefore adequate for design and
supervision of the project.



- 19 -
3.17      Most exchange equipment is installed under contract by the
suppliers, while local contractors are employed for duct laying and other
civil engineering works. Apart from certain contract cable installation
(paragraph 3.12), local staff, augmented by the output of current training
programs, will be adequate to carry out the remainder of the project instal-
lation. Likewise, the combined training programs of TCI and PTT (paragraphs
2.14 and 2.18), together with the arrangements for initial maintenance and
for training by contractors, should ensure a sufficient supply of skilled
manpower for future maintenance of project installations.



4.  JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
A.  Mlarket Demand
Local Telephone Service
4.01      Provision of-local telephone service constitutes over 95% of
the project investment. Present conditions make it extremely difficult
to forecast telephone demand through 1970-1974. A projection of past
grotLh of subscriber connections, which has averaged 8-1/2,1 per annum
over the past 10 years, wfould grossly underestimate future needs because
of the inability in the past to meet demand and the resulting present
waiting list of 80,000 applicants. 'De actual unfulfilled demand almost
certainly exceeds this figure, but the latent-demand  11 only be kno,wn
when the capacity to provide service improves.
4.02      3espite these conditions, new applications are being received
at a rate of nearly 4,000 a month, which corresponds to about 14;6 per annum
of the present ikown total demand of 334,000 (254,000 connected, 80,000
waiting). Lack of records of past application rates precludes a more
reliable estimation of this parameter. Application of a 14% growth rate
results in a demand forecast of 565,000 connections in 1974, which wTill be
conservative because of the suppressed demand. Accordingly, taking a
more realistic view of development, ITC has estimated that demand at
Warch 1974 will be about 650,000.  This range of 565,ooo-650,ooo con-
nections by 1974 is consistent with a long-term forecast by the French
consultants, S0ERECOIi, which estimates 850,000 telephone-subscribers by
1978 and an average growth rate to 1993 of 12% per annum.
4.03      The project provides for a growth to 550,000 lines connected
by March 1974, whRich is 15,000 below the minamum figure in the above
forecast range of 565,000-650,000. The unsatisfied demand in 1974 will
therefore be at least 15,000 and could be as high as 100,000. At project
completion, the telephone density (telephones per hundred population)
will have increased from 0.92k to 1.85o,, a level more attuned to Iranas
needs at its present stage of economic development. For comparison purposes,
AXnex 17 gives statistics-of telephone density and GNP per capita for a
number of Asian countries.
Telex/Gentex Services
4e04      The telex/gentex services in the project form about 1.6% of its
total cost. The project provides for the expansion of telex capacity in
Teheran and ten other cities by 2,000 lines, with provision for an additional
290 Gentex lines for public telegraph offices. SOFRECOI4 has based telex
expansion on demand that is forecast to build up rapidly from the present
i.evel of 280 subscribers to about 1,400 by i;Iarch 1974, vith further growth
.r-til 1978 at about 25,o per year.  In 1974 there wirll be one telex subscrDer
for every 360 telephone subscribers. This forecast is reasonable and is
c^'nfirmed by telex experience in other developing countries.



-, 21 - 
4.05      The development of telex will greatly benefit Iran's business
sector. Besides the Latin script machines, teleprinters with Farsi characters
will be available.
B.   Least-Cost S9lution
4.06      Selecting the least-cost design to meet the forecast requirements
involves (a) making the correct technological choices wJhen the systents basic
structure is being laid dow,n in the early years, and (b) following an
"optimizjng" path with respect to the design-and timing of the derivative
subsequent investments as the system expands.  The fundamental exchange area
planning, wYhich determines the future pattern of network development, has been
based on extensive studies previously carried out by SOFRECOM. The imple-
mentation planning, which includes the choice of size and timing of investment,
is executed by local staff under the guidance of a competent technical
assistance teara from the German Bundespost.
C.   Internal Financial Rate of Return and Economic Benefits
4.07      The improved communications service resulting from the project
will confer benefits on all sectors of economic activity and help achieve
the Government's objective of decentralization of Iranian industry. The
improved service will facilitate business information flow, greatly reduce
the present high and unproductive waiting time on long-distance calls, and
help eliminate the telephone black market.
4.08      The internal financial rate of return for the project is estimated
at 23j (Annex 22) at current prices and, in view of the large backlog of
unsatisfied demand at present prices, gives a mainimum measure of the project's
substantial economic benefits.

5.  FUTURE FINANCES
A.  Backrground
5.01      The project would be executed during the period 1970/71 to
1973/74. Until the merger of TCI and PTT becomes effective (March 1971),
TCI would be responsible for project execution.  After the merger, ITC
would carry on construction of the project.  Consequently, the financing
plan is based on both the notional forecast of TCI's and PTT's integrated
sources and applications of funds for 1970/1971 and the forecast cash flow
of ITC during 1971/1972 through 1973/1974. Details of these torecaste are
shown in Annex 20. The basic assumptions are listed in Annex 21. Further-
more, it wias assumed that:
(a) the tariffs have been increased as described in
paragraphs 2.50 and 2.51,
(b)  costs not attributable to PTTts public communications
network to the amount of Rials 4,575 million (US$61 million)
would be written off on March 20, 1971 (paragraph 2.25).
5.02      Funds for TCI and PTTts capital works have been and will continue
to be provided by the Plan Organization from local resources and foreign
borrowings.  These funds have been treated in the accounts of TCI and PTT
as shown in Section 2-E (Financial Aspects). The Bank loan will be treated
in ITC accounts as debt and subject to servicing and repayrient by ITC
through the Plan Organization on the original terms and conditions. Likeiise,
all other funds borrowed and made available to the company through the Plan
Organization will be on terms and conditions no more favourable than those
on which they were obtained, except when the operating companyts debt/eqaity
ratio exceeds 50:50.
B.  FLnancing Plan.
5.03      The financing plan for the four project years can be sumarized
as follows:

,j _      M=9
Despite the notional nature of PTT's financial data which would form part
of the financial structure of the new company (ITC) as from March 21, 1971,
the above financing plan is reasonable. Given the fact that subscribers'
deposits form part of ITC's cash resources, internal cash would contribute
29% of total requirements. This is acceptable in view of the large capital
expansion during the period.
5.04      Borrowings would amount to 40% of total requirements. Details
are as follows:
(i) Foreign exchange loans in the form of supplier credits
total Rials 10,448 million (US$139.3 million) and have
been secured by Plan Organization. Of the total, Rials
8,750 million (US$116.7 million) is for the INTS microwave
project under construction by an international consortium.
A schedule of these loans and their terms is given in
Annex 23.
(ii) The proposed Bank loan of US$36.0 million (Rials 2,700
million) is assumed to be made for a term of 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period. Interest is assumed at
714% for the purposes of this report.



- 24 -
5.05      The remaining finances to be provided for the project are local
funds amounting to Rials 10,413 million (US$138.9 million), which have been
committed by Plan Organization for the expansion of telecommunications under
the Fourth National Development Plan (1968-1973) and will be made available
to ITC in the form of equity contributions. Total funds from Plan Organiza-
tion would represent 31% of total sources.
5.06      Agreement was reached during negotiations that Plan Organization
will
(a) make the Bank loan available to TCI and ITC on the same
terms as those applied by the Bank (paragraph 2.30);
(b) make available the loans contracted on behalf of TCI and
PTT on the basis set out in paragraph 5.02;
(c) provide the funds required from local sources in the
financing plan shown in paragraph 5.03 on the basis set
out in paragraph 5.02;
C. Future Operating Results
5.07      Forecast operating results for the project period 1971-1974 and
for 1975 are shown in Annex 19, using assumptions listed in Annex 21.  A
summary of the results is given below.
1970/71 1971/72 1972/73 1973/74 1974/75
Tin millions of Rials)
Revenues          2,801    5,134    7,211    8,541    9,940
Expenses          2,951    3,742    4,761    5,114    5,704
Net income         (150)   1,392    2,450    3,427    4,236
Rate of return      neg.    6.7d      7.7%       9%   lOol%
Operating ratio    105        73        66       60        57
5.o8      These results reflect the effects of the new tariff structure and
the expectation of more efficient operations.  The large revenue increase
during 1971/1972 is due to the increase in local and trunk tariffs and the
introduction of installation fees (see paragraph 2.48) as well as to the
increase in subscribers. In addition, rentals from leased military and TV
circuits are assumed to commence accruing from that year, and thereafter
would annually amount to about 12% of total forecast revenues. With the
provision for the first time of an adequate long-distance service, trunk-
line traffic which is heavily suppressed can be expected to triple during
the three years, 1970-1973. Contributing to this growth will be the addi-
tional traffic stimulus due to STD, as experienced in all countries where
it has been introduced. Despite the magnitude of the trunk revenue increase,
it represents a conservative estimate being approximately 25% below revenue
estimates in a feasibility study made by independent consultants. After
1973, total revenues would increase annually at an average rate of 17% and
total expenses by about 10% per annum.



- 25 -
5.09      The forecasts indicate that the rate of return on average net
plant in service would be between 6.7% and 9.0% during 1971/72 - 1973/74
and then further rise to 10.1% in 1974/75, the first year following
completion of the project. The operating ratio would decline from 105
in 1971 to-57 in 1975, consistent with the growing effectiveness of ITCOs
operations. Consequently, ITC would be able to continue the former TCI
obligation to pay taxes on net income. The forecast of ITC's finances
assumes the payment of such taxes at a rate of 30%, which is about the-
rate paid by TCI in those years in which the Company has made a profit.
5.10      The forecast operating results as outlined above are satisfactory.
However, they depend on the substantial increase in the existing tariffs
and the assumed accrual of rentals from leased circuits. During negotiation
the Bank was assured that the proposed tariffs will be introduced no later
than March 21, 1971, and will not be varied prior to -arch 20, 1974 without
consultation and agreement with the Bank. Furthermore, to secure the future
viability of the new company it was agreed that commencing from March 21,
1974, ITC will maintain its tariffs at a level sufficient to achieve a
financial rate of return on ITCOs net fixed assets of at least 9% after
income and other taxes.
D.  Future Financial Position
5.11      Estimated balance sheets (Annex 18) as of March 20, 1971 through
1975, show that the value of net plant in service is expected to increase
almost threefold. The debt/equity ratio would rise from 39/61 in 1971 to
51/49 in 1973 and thereafter decline to 47/53 in 1975, when considerable
amounts of debt would have been repaid. The foregoing ratios, however, do
not include subscriber deposits because they do not constitute long-term
debt (see paragraph 2.41).
5.12      Coverage of interest by net income wiould range between 1.9 and
3.5 times during the forecast period. Debt service coverage by internal
cash generation would be 2.4 times in 1972 and 2.8 times in 1975. These
ratios are satisfactory and would not change substantially over subsequent
years.
5.13      To help ensure ITCOs future viability, it has been agreed during
negotiations that the company will not incur long-term debt without the
Bank's approval, unless the preceeding 12 monthst net revenues would cover
maximum future annual debt service at least 2 times.
5.14      Commencing with the accounts for 1971/1972, auditors satisfactory
to the Bank will carry out an annual audit of TCIts accounts. The auditorst
report together with the audited statements will be transmitted to the Bank
no later than six months after the close of each fiscal year. This was
agreed during negotiations.

6. AGREEI4NTS, ASSUPIUXCES AID RECOYRND&TI0N
6.01       During negotiations, agreements was reached on the following
principal points, which are embodied in the draft Loan agreement:
(a) For the effective establishment of ITC,
(i) the valuation and transfer of assets to ITC and
its future capitalization will be satisfactory
to the Bank (paragraphs 2.24, 2.25 and 2.44);
(ii) management consultants will be employed under agreed
terms of reference to advise on the organization and
assist in setting up ITC (paragraph 2.29);
(b) There will be no major expansion of the current
telecommunication program without the concurrence
of the Bank (paragraph 3.06);
(c) No debt will be incurred unless annual revenue is more
than twice maximum debt service requirements (paragraph 5.13)-
(d)  Commencing from March 21, 1974, ITC will maintain its
tariffs at a level sufficient to achieve a financial rate
of return on ITC's net fixed assets of at least 9% after
income and other taxes (paragraph 5.10).
6.02       In addition, the Bank received assurances that:
(a) The new telephone tariffs, to be introduced in March 1971,
will not be varied during the project period without consult-
ing the Bank (paragraph 2.50);
(b) All users of leased telecommunication services will pay
commercial rates for such services (paragraph 2.51);
(c) Provided that the debt:equity ratio of ITC does not
exceed 50:50, all funds borrowed and made available to
ITC through Plan Organization will be on terms and
conditions no more favourable than those on which
they were obtained (paragraph 5.02).
6.03       In addition to the customary conditions, it has been agreed as
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan that legislation establish-
ing ITC shall have been enacted substantially in accordance with the draft
legislation provided to the Bank (paragraph 2.22).



- 27 -
6.o4      The Borrower has also informed the Bank that it does not intend
to complete the steps required on its part to make the loan effective until
the new telephone tariffs have been approved.
6.05      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$36 million for a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace
period.

IRAN
Telecommunications Expansion
The Iran Telecommunications Manufacturing Company (ITmC)
1.        The company's equity capital is Rls 189 million (US$2.5 million)
divided as follows: 40h, Siermiens; 30%, Government of Iran; and 30%
Industrial ivining and Development Bank of Iran. The factory is producing
EaD automatic exchange switching equipment and subscriber telephone sets
under agreement with Siemens (Germany). TCI is its sole purchaser.
Present annual capacity is 30,000 line units of switching equipment and
45,000 telephones. An extension of the factory is underway to increase
annual production capacity to 45,000 line units and 60,000 telephone sets
by 1972.
2.        The present investment in machine tools, testing and manufacturing
equipment is about Rls 110 million (US$1.5 million).  Provision of this
equipment has been restricted to units for which a reasonable production
run can be maintained. Complex parts such as die castings, selector
motors, gears, etc., are imported as components or piece parts. It is
fully appreciated by management that it is undesirable to expand into
too many production lines (such as production of 4-wire switches,
STD registers, etc., as suggested by PTT as a possibility), particularly
since the factory's present and expanded capacity will in any case be
needed for local exchange network expansion.
3.        The present staff consists of a German factory manager, 14
German production engineers and foremen, and 700 Iranians (including
trainees). Staff are employed on a two-shift, semi-piece work basis.
Consequently, operative efficiency is high and, with the relatively low
wages, labor costs per unit of production are comparable with those in
Germany. Pilfering is negligible and the safety record is good.
4.        There are adequate accounting and cost accounting systems based
on German practice. Present indications are that for the first full year's
production the cost for switching equipment will be about Rls 312 million
which
less cost of telephone instruments,              Rls 55 million
gives a net cost of                                  27 7
less duty (about)                                     26   "

plus power equipment and cable
(imported separately)                              90
Rls 32 



ANNTEX 2
Page 2 of 2 pages
This is equivalent to US$4.3 million per annum which corresponds to
$143 per exchange line unit at 30,000 lines output per year. *With
increased production, this price can be expected to drop by up to 10%.
Imported and locally produced parts, materials and finished items of
equipment (power plant and cable) amount to about US$73 per line (pricing
investigated in 1969 and confirmed by Coopers Lybrand), so the value
added is about 50%. If power equipment and cable (US$40) is excluded,
the value added is 70%. The relatively low production cost has been obtained
in part by excluding depreciation on certain production plant during the
first year. However, it is considered that with the increased efficiency
in the second year of operation and after allowing for adequate depreciation
provisions, the cost of production should be maintained or even improved.
5.        The factory faces certain problems in that the lead time for
some materials and piece parts is up to 17 months, due in part to extended
delivery periods, including long periods involved in shipment and clearance.
6.        All in all, the factory is an efficient production unit doing
extremely well at this early stage of operation.
7.        Under the agreement, Nlessrs. Siemens have undertaken to start
production of a semi-electronic (ERK) system in Iran by 1971/72 at prices
not exceeding those for EMD equipment. The present and extended manufacturing
capacity of EivID equipment will, it is estimated, continue to be required
for a number of years for extension of the existing EMlD exchanges.

IRANi
Management Consultants:  Scope of the Work
Background
To ensure the rational development and efficient operation
of telecommunicationz, the Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones
has recommended, and it is expected that a suitable law will be passed
by about December 1970, merging the international and long-distance
telephone services and the telex and telegraph services of the Ministry
of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (PTT) with the local telephone services
of the Telephone Company of Iran (TCI) into a single entity to be called
the Iran Telecommunications Company (ITC).
To facilitate tne merger and the subsequent reorganization and
also to improve the new entity's efficiency, it has been decided to engage
management consultants in an advisory capacity.
The consultants should be appointed as soon as possible and
in any case before the merger of the telecommunications services of PTT
and TCI into the new entity; this is necessary to facilitate the new
arrangements and avoid delay in implementation.
The scope of the consultants' work is outlined as follows, and
the tasks have been assembled in two phases of priority to match the needs
of the timetable for the merger and implementation of ITC, shown in Annex 3.
Phase I (By I2iarch 1971)
Financial Structure
Assets
Prepare an inventory and a valuation of assets to be transferred
to the new company. This should include the setting up of a plant register
of assets for the merged entity, using modern practice: showing the
appropriate depreciation assumed to have accumulated at the date of the
merger and proper annual depreciation rates to be applied in the future
based on the lifetimes of the various assets. Costs of the PTT microwave
(INTS) network not attributable to public communications will be determined
and excluded from the new conipany's assets.
Capitalization
Recommend the capital structure best suited to enable the new
entity to be run as a ccmmercial organization, and its financial relations
with Government within the legislative framework.  The arrangements should
provide information required to review and assess the financial performance
of the new company.



ANNEX 5

Organization and Staffing
Organization
Assist in designing the organizational structure of the new
company, both at headquarters and in the regions, to include defining
internal responsibilities, lines of delegation of authority, allocation
of duties, and responsibilities and authority of each department.
Staffing
Recommend initial arrangements for provisional transfer of staff
from TCI and secondement from PTT.
Phase 2 (Recommendations should be prepared by December 1971, and
consultants would assist with implementation through 1972)
Financial Areas
Accounting
Recommend accounting procedures for all areas including billing,
collections, accounts receivable and payable, purchasing, inventory
control, and assets registers.
Advise on the extension of TCI's cost accounting and budgetary
control procedures in a form that will enable management to (1) properly
project income, expenses and investment, (2) control costs, and (3)
promote efficiency of the combined entity.
Internal Audit
Advise on establishing modern internal audit routines and intro-
ducing internal management reports.
Tariffs

from TCIrs accounts. Thereafter they are assumed to be about 50% of
current assets.
6.        Plan Organization grants are assumed to be part of equity.
7.        Sabscriber deposits during 1968 through 1970 have been taken from
TCI's accounts. Thereafter they have been projected on the basis of new
demand and of stations added per annum.
8.        It was assumed that pension fund liabilities, previous subscriber
loans and the Ninistry of Finance loan would be aaortized well in advance.
9.        The amount of Rials 638 million shoTn under "proposed IBRD loann
represents the portion probably to be disbursed in 1971.
B.  Income Statements (Annex 7)
1.        Revenues during 1968 through 1970 have been taken from TCIts
accounts.
2.        During 1970-1971 revenues from local calls have been assumed to
increase at a rate of 11%, which is the average growth rate of the foregoing
years. Revenues from leased lines are assumed to increase by 18/% during

1971, which rate is based on the number of prospective applicants.
3.        Operating expenses during 1968 through 1970 have been taken from
TCI's accounts. Thereafter the following assumptions have been made:
(a)  Total administrative salaries and wages would increase by
3% per annum;
(b)  Operating salaries and wages would increase 113 less than
the growth of stations;
(c)  Other expenses have been assessed to increase according to
the total growth of stations; and
(d)  Depreciations have been assumed at a composite rate of
4.5,; on the annual average of gross plant.
Tax payable on net operating income during 1968 through 1970 has
been taken from TCI's accounts. Tax for 1971 has been estimated at 30% of
TCVTs annual net operating income.

Notes and Assumptions on pro forma Financial Statements
A. Pro Forma Balance Sheets (Annexes 10 and 18)
1.        PTT does not maintain an assets register and does not know
the value of its fixed assets. PTTts telecommunications development
projects azd their respective capital cost have been entirely financed
by Plan Organization funds during the First, Second and Third Development
Plans. Plan Organization maintains a fairly accurate register of such
funds appropriated to PTT. By using this register, the mission made a
valuation of PTT's assets under the following assunptions: Plant constructed
during the First Plan (1948-1955) has been omitted for its insignificance
and because most of this plant would have been fully depreciated up to
now. Depreciation has been calculated at a composite rate of 5% on average
gross plant. It has further been asstmed that the amount of plant under
construction each year would have been 40% of the sum of the capital
construction of the current year plus plant under construction in the
previous year. Under these assumptions, the value of PTT's gross plant
in service as of March 20, 1968, has been calculated at Rials 1,892 million
(US$25.2 million). The calculated depreciation reserve of Rials 402
million (US$5. million)--about 21% of gross plant in service--is realistic.
This valuation, however, is tentative.  Consultants should review the
valuation of PTT's fixed assets and formally establish their actual value.
2.        Costs not attributable to PTT's public communications networ'
to the amount of Rials 4,575 million (US$61 million) have been assumed to
be written off on March 20, 1971, and charged against Plan Organization
investment under equity.
3.        It has been assumed that w^ork in progress wyould equal 40'
of the total works carried forward plus the capital works for the years.
4.        Cash is assumed to be about 1 1/2 months cash operating
expenses.
5.        Accounts receivables are assumed to equal about two months
revenues.
6.        It is assumed that inventories would have equalled 4% of
PTT's gross plart in service as of Mvlarch 20, 1968. Thereafter they u'ould
increase in accordance wTith the growth of assets.
7.        Current liabilities have been assumed to equal 15% of current
assets during 1967 through 1969. Thereafter they were assessed at 20% in
1970 and at 25/O during 1971.



ANINEX 13
Page 2 of 3 pages
8.        In establishlirig PTT's capitalization as of March 20, 1968,
Plan Organization funds made available to PTT have been considered as
equity contributions and shown under "Plan Organization Investments"
which serves also as the balancing figure between the amount of total
assets, net of current liabilities and the sum of long-term debt and
surplus.
9.        During 1969 through 1971, long-term debt consists of supplier
credits in foreign exchange from Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan and USA
at various terms (see Annex 23). The amount of Rials 83 million represents
the portion of the proposed IBRD Loan probably disbursed during 1971 when
PTT is still operating as a separate entity.
B. Pro Forma Income Statements (Annexes 11 and 19)
1.    Revenues during 1967 through 1969 have been taken frcn PTT's
adjusted accounts.
2.    Revenues as from 1970 have been projected under the following
assumptions:
a)  Trunk and STD calls:  revenues from these calls would increase
by 22% in 1970 and 27% in 1971l
b) International calls: revenues fram these calls would increase
by about 25% per annum;
c)  Telegraph revenues are assumed to increase annually by 3%.
d) Telex revenues would increase by 25% in 1970 and by 30%
in 1971.
e) Rented lines - private: rent from these lines is assumed
to yield Rials 79 million in 1970. According to prospective
applications, about Rials 120 million would accrue in 1971.
3. Expenses
a)  Salaries and wages during 1967 through 1970 have been taken
from PTT's adjusted accounts. Thereafter they have been
assumed to increase by 15, per annum.
b)  Maintenance, training and operational costs during 1967
through 1970 have been taken from PTT's adjusted accounts.
Thereafter these expenses have been assessed in accordance
with the growth of assets.



A IiEX 13
Page 3 of 3 pages
c)  Space segment costs have been taken from PTT's adjusted accounts
for 1969 and 1970. Thereafter they have been assessed in accordanTce
with independent consultants.
d)  Depreciation has been assumed at a composite rate of 5% on the
annual average of gross assets.

Quarterly Disbursements - Assumptions
1.         The disbursement schedule is based on the TCI and PTT programs
with some adjustment where it was considered that the program timetable
was unrealistic. Factors considered include appropriate time periods, as
necessary, for preparation of specifications, tendering procedures,
evaluation of tenders, manufacture, delivery and commissioning.
2.         Disbursements for subscribers cable (which accounts for about
80% of Bank loan) would commence in the quarter ending March 1971, and
total US$15 million by December 1971. Subscriber cable is at present
lagging equipment installation and the report recommends approval for
advance ordering, prior to loan approval (see paragraph 343), .Cable
purchases would thereafter decline and total US$11 million during 1972,
with the balance of US$2.4 million in 1973. STD cable disbursements would
be made from March to December 1971 and installation would match the
timetable for commissioning of the new trunk microwave network.
3.         Telex disbursements would commence in the quarter ending June
1971, and be completed in Plarch 1973.
4.         Consultants are to be e,nployed by November 1970 and provision
has been made for a payment of US$100,000 before the end of 1970. There-
after, payments will be made progressively as the work proceeds at the
rate of US$100,000 a quarter.

Notes and Assumptions on pro forma Financial Statements
A.  Pro forma Balance Sheets (Annex 18)
1.        Plant in service has been transferred from PTT and TCI to ITC at-
its depreciated value as of March 20, 1971, the date of the assumed merger.
Because of the different structure of PTT's and TCIOs assets w]hich resulted
in different composite rates of depreciation, net fixed plant in operation
during 1972 through 1975 has been calculated by depreciating assets result-
ing from PTT's construction program at a rate of 5s and assets from TCOts
program at 4.5%.
2.        Work in progress has been calculated by adding PTT's and TCI's
works in progress during 1971. Thereafter ITC's works in progress were
assumed to equal 40.% of the total works carried forward plus the total
capital works for the year.
3.        Cash in the opening balance sheet of ITO has been calculated by
adding cash of PTT and TCI as of M4arch 20, 1971.  Thereafter cash has been
taken from ITTC's staterments of sources and applications of funds as shown
there under cash at end of period.
4.        In the opening balance sheet, accounts receivables and prepayments
have been calculated by adding the respective amounts of PTT and TCI as
of March 20, 1971.  Thereafter it has been assumed that:
(a)  Accounts receivables in 1971/72 would equal about 3 months
revenues due to initial difficulties in the collection and
accounting works during the first year aftuer the merger.
Thereafter accounts receivables would equal 2-1/2 mont-hs
revenues in 1972/73 and 2 monthis revenues in 1973/74 and
1974/75.
(b)  Prepayments wvould not exceed Rials 500 million per annum
during 1971_1975.
5.        Current liabilities for ITC's opening balance sheet as of 14arch
21, 1971, have been calculated by adding the respective amounts in PTT's
and TCI's balance sheets.  Therea'ter they have been assumed to be about
557t of current assets.



MLNEX 21
Page 2 of p pages
6.        Inventories as of 14arch 20, 1971, represent the added totals of
TCI's and PTTts inventories at that date. Thereafter the added results
from projections separately rmiade for PTT and TCI under assuraptions listed
in Annex 9 and 13 have been transferred to ITC1s balance sheets.
7.        The follow-ing assumptions have been used on establishing ITC's
pro forma equity- Plan Organization grants made to TCI and PTT prior to
the merger would be considered as equity grants and transferred to ITC
accordingly; TCI's share capital and its legal and general reserves would
also be transferred to ITCts equity; and loss from TCIts and PTT's opera-
tions during 1970/71 would be debited to ITC by charging against equity.
Based on these assumptions, the first step towards establishling ITCts
pro forma equity would turn out as follows:
Rials
Miillion
TCIts share capital                        500
TCI's legal reserve                         15
TCI1s general reserve                       13
Total Plan Organization grants           6,753
Loss from TCIts and PTT1s operations       (445)
Total equity                    6,836
On the understanding that TCI's share capital together with
total Plan Organization grants after charging losses from previous
operations would form the new entityts capital stock, the pro forma
equity structure as of March 21, 1971, was filnally assumed as follows:
Rials
Kiillion
Capital                                  7,000
Legal reserve                                70
Surplus and reserves                      (234)
Total equity                    6,836



ANNEX 21
Page 3 of 4 pages
From 1971 onwards, ITC's capital stock and legal reserve would gradually
increase by the transfer of excess funds from "surplus and reserves".
8.        Long-term debt of ITC as of March 21, 1971, consists of debt
incurred by PTT and TCI up to that date. Thereafter this debt and any
other debt would be serviced by IT[ on the original terms and conditions.
B.   Pro forma Income Statements (Annex 19)
1.        ITC's revenues and expenses as of March 20, 1971, result from
the addition of TCIls and PTTts various categories of revenues and expen-
ses during 1970/71.
2.        Revenues as from March 21, 1971, the assumed date when the new
tariff coaes into effect, are projected under the following assumptions:
(i) Installation fees would accrue on the basis of new denand
and stations added;
(ii) Rentals would increase according to the annual growth of
stations in operation;
(iii) Revenues from local calls would increase at an annual
rate of 40% in 1972, 24.54 in 1973 and 12.9% in 1974;
these rates are based on the following assumptions:
A charge of 2 Rials per local call will be introduced
as from March 21, 1971;
Due to the connection of new subscribers, the average
number of local calls per subscriber will decline from
the present figure of 3,200 calls per year to 2,600
calls per year by 1973, and new subscribers would gene-
rate on average half the annual number of local calls
in their first year of connection.
(iv) Revenues from trunk and STD calls would increase at an
annual rate of about 70Yj in 1971/72, 95  in 1972/73,
28% in 1973/74 and 25S in 1974/75.  These growth rates
are based on the following assumptions:
The upward adjustment of rates for trunk and STD
calls would come into effect on Iarch 21, 1971;



iANgEX 21
Page 4 of 4 pages
STD will be available otn ;850 trunk circuits at Jamuary
1972 and 2,280 circuits at Septeinber 1972.
Average trunk revenue per STD call is 60 Rials.
On the above assumptions the annual average trunk revenue
per subscriber is:
Year   1970/71    1971/72    1972/73    1973/74    197V/75
Rials    1,838      2,513       3,900      14,200      3,975
These estimates are conservative and- about 25% less than
estimated by indeDendent consultants.
(v) Revenues from international calls would annually increase
by 25;'.
(vi) Telegraph revenues would increase by 3, per annum.
(vii) Telex revenues are assumed to increase at a rate of 30,C
per annum.
(viii) Revenues from the lease of lines to private parties have
been projected on the basis of conservative forecasts of
future demand.
(ix) TV revenues from the lease of TV circuits are assumed to
yield Rials 150 million per annum on the basis of comer-
cial rates -when all possible circuits wil1 be established
and leased on March 21, 197h.  On the basis of the annual
completion and lease of the circuits, '5",' of the circuits
will be leased during 1972 and 84bL during 1973. Accord-
ingly, revenues from the lease of TV circuits will yield
Rials 83 million in 1972; 126 million in 1973, and 150
million in 1974 and 1975.
(x) Revenues from circuits leased to the armed forces have
been assessed at 40hQ  below comnercial rates in view of
tlie e.tent of the sopeci,-l defense network, anti conse-
quently to yiald Rials 900 million per amnnw as from 1974; -
5; of these revenues are assumnei to accrue in 1972 and 84% in 1973.
3.        Expenses represent the added results of year-wise projections made
separately for TCI and PTT by using assumptions listed in Annexes 9 and 13.
4.        On the assumiption that ITC wJould resurLe the foiner TCI obligation
to pay taxes on net income, a rate of 3C0/ has been applied.

Internal Financial Rate of Return of the 1970/71-1973/74 Project
(in million of Rials)
1.        The analysis assumes that the assets under the project would have
a uselul lifetime of 20 years including the construction period 1970/71-
1973/74.  Capital costs have been taken from Annex 15, Page 3, including the
provisions for contingencies but excluding those for consultants. The table

2.        The net cash flow in the above table in each year results from
additional revenues produced by the project less the capital cost and
attributable operatLng expenses, exclusive depreciation. The calculation
based on that net cash flow showed that the project would yield an internal
rate of return of about 23% at current prices.
