      Management Project, is part of the assistance strategy for\n            supporting improvements in the public expenditure management\n            process in Uganda, and the project will improve the\n            efficiency of Government planning/budgeting, financial\n            management, and monitoring/evaluation processes. The\n            components will: 1) support strengthening of central, and\n            local government planning, and budgeting processes, through\n            improved transparency, and accountability of budget, and\n            public expenditure practices. Fiscal decentralization will\n            be expanded, and effective linkages between national, and\n            local government planning will be strengthened, as will\n            recurrent, and development budget integration; 2) improve\n            financial and accounting practices, through human resources\n            capacity building, to improve financial management systems,\n            and information, and enhance external auditing functions; 3)\n            support capacity building to monitor the performance, and\n            delivery service of public expenditure on living standards\n            among various groups. This will include improved capacity of\n            the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, and implementation of the\n            National Service Delivery Survey; 4) test the effectiveness\n            of distance learning, through the construction of a learning\n            center, equipment supply, and operational technical\n            assistance. Co-financing from international agencies will\n            complement the project."}, "docdt": "1999-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
