Re:
Credit 2411- CHA
(Sichuan Agricultural Development Project)
Amendment
Dear Minister Liu:
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement between the People's Republic of 
China (the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the Association) 
for the Sichuan Agricultural Development Project, dated July 22, 1992. We wish to 
inform you that the first repayment date for the Credit provided in Section 2.07 (a) 
should read "January 1, 2003" instead of "January 2, 2003" which appears in the signed 
original due to a typographical error. The Association hereby agrees to amend Section 
2.07 (a) accordingly.
Please confirm the agreement on behalf of the Borrower to this amendment by 
signing and dating the form of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter and 
returning it to us for our files. The amendment will take effect after 
countersignature and upon effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement.
Very truly yours,
By /s/ Shahid Jav Burki
