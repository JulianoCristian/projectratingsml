technical\n            assistance; (c) reduce soil and water losses to prevent\n            long-term siltation problems and maintain soil fertility;\n            (d) expand agroprocessing activities to utilize locally\n            available raw materials; and (e) increase incomes in poor\n            and remote areas where farmers earn less than 50 percent of\n            the national average, with particular emphasis on helping\n            poor women.  The project provides funds for: improvement and\n            expansion of irrigation; establishment of two soil\n            conservation demonstration areas and economic forestry;\n            expansion of mulberry and cocoon production with expansion\n            of supporting services; rehabilitation of tea gardens and\n            establishement of livestock production bases combined with\n            planting pastures; and rehabilitation and expansion of two\n            paper mills and facilities for rabbit hair spinning,\n            gallnut, goat and geese processing."}, "docdt": "1992-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
