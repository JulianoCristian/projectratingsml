                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has faced challenges to achievement of the PDO due to payment delays to beneficiaries (comprising eligible women and participating health centers) under the
                         conditional cash transfer (CCT) component of the Project. The Project has engaged in the implementation of a corrective action plan as of November 2012, focusing on resolving the
                         backlog of payments to beneficiaries for January-June 2012 and for July-December 2012. As of January 2013, the Project has made good progress on implementing the corrective
                         action plan.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The team continues to work closely with the implementing agency on the time-bound action plan to solve the problems identified under the CCT component. Continued adherence to
                         time-bound triggers as well as close monitoring of the implementation of the corrective action plan in the coming months will be key to ensuring a satisfactory resolution to the CCT
                         payment backlog problem and in attaining project development objectives, as the Project closes September 2013.
