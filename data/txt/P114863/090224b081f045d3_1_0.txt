                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of all components under the pilot Project is now complete.

                         New enrollments in the conditional cash transfer (CCT) component ended by April 30, 2013 across all 62 health centers (HCs) that participated in the pilot. The Project enrolled a total
                         of24,617 eligible women in the pilot over a duration of ~18 months. Provisional estimates indicate that 85% of all eligible women in the catchment areas of the 62 HCs enrolled in the

                         Supervision by the Lao Women's Union (LWU) of the community-based nutrition (CBN) messaging component also ended on July 31, although the village-level meetings are
                         expected to be sustained as they do not require operational costs from the Project.

                         Provisional estimates from the end-line household survey conducted in July 2013 indicate that the Project has met or exceeded targets for five of the six Project Development
                         Objective (PDO)-level indicators. In some cases, increases in utilization have been dramatic: for example, the utilization of well-baby check-ups has increased from 10% to 67%, and
                         institutional deliveries have increased from 22% to 30%. However, although DPT3 coverage rates have almost doubled from 23% to 44%, this still fell short of the target of 50%.

                         Key elements of the CCT component of the Project will be sustained via the on-going Health Services Improvement Project (HSIP) which is providing a comparable package of
                         benefits in five of the seven Project provinces (Savannakhet, Salavane, Sekong, Champassak, and Attapeu). The government and other donors are financing similar benefits in the
                         remaining two CNP provinces (Bolikhamxai and Khammouane). Materials from the CBN component are currently being reviewed for inclusion in an Early Childhood Education
                         project, which is planning a similar community-level messaging intervention which will also include a focus on child stimulation, hygiene, and feeding practices.

                         CNP, with its associated baseline and end-line surveys as well as operational implementation experience, offers a rich opportunity in assessing results-based financing and
                         community-based messaging interventions, especially in terms of how such interventions might be implemented and sustained in a relatively low-capacity environment.
