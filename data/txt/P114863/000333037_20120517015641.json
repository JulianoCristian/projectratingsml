CNP is not expected to cause negative social\n            impacts. However, there may be issues associated with\n            ensuring equitable access to project benefits and there are\n            concerns that some villages will benefit more than others\n            due to proximity and ease of accessibility to intervention\n            health centres. A number of constraints in accessing health\n            care services were identified by local populations,\n            especially challenges related to physical access, the high\n            cost of services, and the cost of transportation.\n            Furthermore, the opportunity cost of abandoning crops in\n            order to seek maternal and child care services are\n            especially high for ethnic groups living in remote villages.\n            To ensure equitable access to project activities, the Ethnic\n            Group Development Plan (EGDP) provides an action plan that\n            addresses the challenges faced by ethnic groups and ensures\n            they benefit in a culturally appropriate way."}, "docdt": "2012-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
