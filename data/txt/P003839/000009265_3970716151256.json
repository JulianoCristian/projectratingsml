for expanding this program to similar\n            areas of critical lands in Indonesia. The project includes:\n            (a) a pilot project to promote sustainable upland farming\n            systems covering 23,000 ha in eight districts of the\n            Jratunseluna River Basin in Central Java and the Brantas\n            River Basin in East Java. It involves; (b) farming systems\n            research for areas of critically eroded lands, the results\n            of which will be tested on 72 demonstration plots; and (c)\n            about 475 km of access roads. Further, the project provides\n            for; (d) human resource development, under which training\n            will be provided to farmers and community leaders,\n            agricultural extension agents, and to planning, management\n            and administrative staff at the provincial and district\n            levels. Finally, the project includes; (e) institutional\n            development, under which long-term specialists will be\n            recruited to provide support and training at various levels;\n            and (f) a US$500,000 project innovation fund, which will\n            finance proposals from nongovernment institutions and\n            special government-funded activities that address issues of\n            upland productivity and/or resource conservation."}, "docdt": "1984-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
