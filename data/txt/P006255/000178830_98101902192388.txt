INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECO1IENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUELIC OF BRAZIL
FOR AN INTERIM SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
i.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$26
million to help finance a project for livestock development. The loan
would have a term of 17 years, including five years of grace, with
interest at 7¼ percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An 'economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Brazil" (WH-210a), dated November 30, 1971, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 2, 1971. A country data sheet is
attached as Annex I. A new economic report is now being prepared, based
on the three Bank economic missions which were sent to Brazil this year
to review, respectively, the Government's programs for developing the
Northeast and Amazon regions, prospects for development of agricultural
and industrial activity elsewhere in Brazil, and Brazil's macro-economic
performance.
3.        After having grown by about 9 percent annually during 1968-70,
Brazil's national product increased by an estimated 11 percent in 1971.
Indications are that growth will be even greater in 1972. Industrial
production during the first six months of 1972 was almost 15 percent
greater in real terms than during the equivalent period in 1971 which, in
turn, was 11 percent larger than during the first semester of 1970. Output
of Brazil's principal crops excluding coffee is expected to increase by
about 10 percent in 1972 compared to about 2 percent in 1971. Simultaneously,
the Government appears to be succeeding in its effort to reduce the annual
rate of inflation from 20 to 15 percent. Reflecting good weather and sharp
increases in crop yields, food supplies have been abundant and food prices
have risen by only 10 percent over the first eight months of the year compared
to 21 percent last year.
4.        Export growth and diversification continues to be strong.  After
-slowing down from 19 percent in 1970 to 5 percent in 1971 on account of a
drop in coffee prices, export growth is expected to amount to 27 percent in
1972.  Manufactured exports are increasing this year at a 46 percent pace
compared to 34 percent last year. However, rapid economic development
continues to provoke massive import increases; imports are up by about 27
percent in 1972, and a current account deficit in the balance of payments



- 2 -
of some US$1.5 billion appears to be in prospect fcr the year. The
Government, is taking several importent measures designed to reduce the
external gap in the future. Besides continuing its system of incentives
for manufactured exports, the Government is implementing an "exportu
corridors" program designed to increase non-traditior.al agricultural
exports such as corn. soya and beef, and is moving to expand production
capacity in areas such as ferrous and -non-ferrous imetals and petrochemicals
where substitutes for imports may be produced economically in Brazil.
5.        However, as inLdicated in the last economic report, the external
constraint clearly remains the dominant one on Brazilian growth, so that
substantial capital inflows continued to be required to sustain rapid devel-
opment. The private international financial oomx4=ity *ees Brazil   i an
attractive outlet for international financial investment. Nore than US$h
billion in gross loan capital is expected to flow into Brazil in 1972, of
whlich at least US$3 billion in the form of financial credits. By the end
of 1572 Brazil's total external debt is likely to amount to about US$9
billion of which about US$5 billion would be in financial credits, In order
to prevent this accumulation of debt from causing eventual liquidity problema
Brazil has been inplementing two important policies:  first, comprehensive
controls on debt maturities which have pushed out the average term of new
financial credits from about 2 years in 1971 to about 4 years this year;
and second, management of aggregate demand in such a way that about ti4o-
thirds of the financial credit buildup has been offset by accunulatior of
net foreign reserves. Thus, even though its oretall debt service ratio,
amounts to about 5% percent this year, the UI$3.5 billion in resetves which
Brazil has accumulated would give it a substantial margin of time for balance
of payments adjustment in the event that its presently favurable international
payments position were to deteriorate. This debt service ratio refers to both
public and private debt including all financial credits, information on which
is not usually available for member countries. IWhile the ratio of service of
the public debt is not available in Brazil, it wouad be very luch less than
the preceding figure. Service on total debt excluding financial credits (the
bulk of which is owed by private borrowers) is arouand 15 percent in 1972.
6.        The need to offset the bulk of financial ctedit with reserve accu-
mlation means that mobilization of official long-term loar capital still is
crucially important for Brazil despite the ready availability of fifancial
credit. The Government's sound policies with respect to the zianageiment of
overall demand and of external lebt augurs well for BrazilTs creditworthiness
for large scale official lending. While the official loan capital needed to
support Brazilts economic growth targets is substantial, the direct import
needs of most public investment projects are relatively low, reflecting --
inter alia -- the ability of Brasil's highly developed capital goods industry
to compete successfully under international competitive bidding. Rence3 an
appreciable part of official external financing mast continue to be available
to cover domestic expenditures.
PART IT - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BRAIL
7.        By October 31, 1972, Brazil had received 4i loans from the Bank
amaournting to US$1,520.3 million. Annex II gives a sumary statement of loans
as of October 313 1972. Of the loans declared effective, 25 have not been



3
fully disbursed, and of those, disbursement of 12 was behind schedule at
the end of 1971. However, the pace of disbursements has accelerated.
During FY65 to FY69 disbursements averaged only US$10 million per year,
increasing to US$66 million in FY70, US$75 million in FY71, and US$137
million in FY72. IDisbursements should continue to increase during the
next few years. Comments on the implementation of individual projects
are contained in Annex II.
8.        IFC has conmitted more financial resources to Brazil than to
any other country. Since 1957, IFO has made 20 commitments in Brazil,
totalling Us$96.4 million, of which US$5.7 million has been repaid and
US$35.7 million sold. Of the balance of US$55.0 million, US$37.8 million
represents loans and US$17.2 )million equity. A summary of IFC's invest-
ments is also given in Annex II.
9.        Bank lending to Brazil was very active in FY72, and seven loans
totalling US$437 million were approved. So far, in FY73 three loans amount-
ing to US$87.7 million have been approved covering an agricultural settlement
project in Northeast Brazil, the Fourth Highway Construction project, and a
Grain Storage project. Now in the process of appraisal, is the investment
program of Light, S.A., the principal distributor of electric power in Rio
de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, with a view to a loan that would assist the company
to raise additional finance in the external capital market. We are also
holding discussicns with the Brazilians on the Itumbiara Hydroelectric
project of Farnas S.A., a program of investment in processing facilities
for agricultural exports, an investment program in the port of Recife, and
a water supply program in the state of Bahia, and hope to present these
projects to the Ececutive Directors in the next nine months or so.
10.       In lending to Brazil, the Bank is responding to Brazilts demon-
strated ability to use increasing amounts of external capital to sustain
a high rate of economic growth. In selecting sectors and projects for
lending, the Bank seeks to fill important development needs. In the
first place, the Bank can help Brazil to increase its total foreign capital
inflow by providing loans either to sectors where bilateral financing is
not available or to projects where the Bank's participation will help Brazil
obtain additional bilateral financing. The proposed livestock loan -- which
has a low import content (see paragraph 32), spread over several hundred
investment proposals, and is therefore unlikely to attract support from
foreign bilateral financing agencies -- is an example of the former, while
the Bank's recent and projected lending for steel and electric energy are
examples of the latter. In the second place, the Bank is hoping to direct
its lending towards areas in which it can support the Government's efforts
to strengthen institutions and pursue sound economic policies. Such is the
case with regard to investment planning and finance in the power, water sup-
ply and transport sectors. It is also the case in the proposed livestock
loan which makes an extension of the use of real positive interest rates for



-4-
agricultural lending in Brazil. Third, the Bank is stressing the
selection of projects which will help Brazil overcome the most critical
constraint on economic growth, namely, the balance of payments. This
means support of export-oriented investments, such as the MBR iron ore
project and the proposed livestock projects, or of import substituting
industry where, as in the case of steel, Brazil has a significant
comparative advantage. Fourth, in selecting projects for financing, a
concerted effort is being made to identify projects that will foster the
growth of the less developed parts of Brazil, particularly the Northeast,
and reduce regional and other income disparities.  The Alto Turi Land
Settlement project, approved earlier in the year, is an example of this.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
11.       The proposed livestock development loan would be the Bank's
fourth for the agricultural sector in Brazil. Previous loans include the
first livestock development project (Loan 516-BR) in 1967, the Alto Turi
Land Settlement project (Loan 853-BR) and the Grain Storage project (Loan
857-BR) approved eaJlier this year. The agriculture sector was recently
reviewed in the Report and Recommendation of the President (P-1115, dated
August 22, 1972) for the recently approved Grain Storage project; relevant
extracts with updated information, are attached in Annex I following the
Country Data Sheet.
Livestock Development
12.       Despite Brazil's great;natural advantages for cattle raising the
growth of the beef cattle sector has been barely sufficient to keep pace
with rising domestic demand. Until recently the sector was making little
contribution to export earnings. Between 1966 and 1971, beef output
increased at an annual rate of slightly below 2 percent, insufficient to
match the increase in demand resulting from the growth of population and
per capita incomes.  Nevertheless, beef exports expanded impressively from
30,000 metric tons in 1966 to 123,000 in 1971 (in value US$20 million and
US$1$0 million respectively). In 1972 the exports have been running 33
percent higher than 1971. In order. to continue beef export growth without
sacrificing domestic consumption, and at the same time provide stock for the
exploitation of vast unused land resources, major increases in the productivity
of existing livestock resources will be essential. The national herd will have
to produce breeding stock well in excess of its own replacement needs through
increased weaning rates and decreased mortality rates.
13.       Tne US$40 million Bank loan made for the first livestock project
(Loan 516-BR) iY now approaching full commitment.  Based on experience
gained during the first project, the Government is now preparing a more
comprehensive livestock program, but it will not be ready for Bank considera-
tion until the middle of 1974.  The Government has, therefore, proposed to
carry out now an interim second project of limited scope to avoid an
interruption of lending for commercial cattle development in the project
areas, to talce advantage of the technical services assembled during the
first project and to complete some of the unfinished important features



of that project. The proposed interim second project would cover the
forecast gap of about 18 months between full commitment of the first
livestock project and possible Bank consideration of a loan for the
larger livestock program now being prepared.
PART IV - THE FIRST LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
14.       The Bank's first livestock project in Brazil (Loan 516-BR of
August 1967) was directed at the improvement of herd productivity.   The
Bank loan of US$40 million is helping finance a US$80 million program
of on-farm investments accompanied by technical assistance. At full
development, a total of US$74.6 million, including US$59.7 million in
project subloans, will have been invested in land clearing, pasture
improvement, fencing, watering and handling facilities, farm building
and machinery and breeding cattle. About US$5.4 million will have been
utilized in technical services. The project has been conducted in three
regions with promising potential for productive livestock operations:
(a) the state of Rio Grande do Sul and ecologically similar parts of
the neighboring state of Santa Catarina; (b) the states of Mato Grosso,
Sao Paulo and the adjacent northern part of the state of Parana; and
(c) the states of Goias and Minas Gerais.
15.       The first livestock project had a slow start caused mainly by
organizational problems and an unattractive interest rate policy. The
latter was modified in 1970 and since then the project has progressed
rapidly and project lending funds by now have been almost fully committed.
Ranch development normally takes several years and it will be some five
years from now before the physical and economic impact of ranch investment
under the first project will be known precisely. However, some of the
indirect benefits of livestock investment in Brazil are already visible.
As already noted, meat exports have increased substantially and after a
serious shortage for domestic consumption (in 1970 imports had to be
arranged on an emergency basis for meeting the requirements of Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Paulo cities) the domestic supply position is now relatively
easy. There are strong indications that in participating ranches the
productivity targets of the first project, namely, increasing weaning rates
(from 50 percent to 67 percent) and decreasing mortality rates (by about
50 percent), are in the course of attainment.
16.       About 30 percent of the project funds were invested in breeding
cattle and this practice caused other fixed investments in pasture establish-
ment and related facilities to become productive earlier than would have
been the case if incremental stocking would have been achieved completely
through the slower method of cattle retention. This policy would be
continued in the Interim Second Livestock project.
17.       The Borrower's submission of appropriate audited financial state-
ments under the first project have not been satisfactory. It has been
agreed with the Borrower that in the future the Bank will receive such
statements in a timely manner.
Subloan Terms
18.       When the first livestock loan was made in 1967, some difficult
problems existed with respect to agricultural credit. On the one hand,



- 6 -
there were banks and private lenders who lent for a very short period at
exorbitant rates. On the other, the meager medium- and long-term funds
provided through government institutions were lent at highly subsidized
rates. The relending terms of the first livestock project were designed
to help meet these problems. The livestock producers received loans up
to 80 percent of his investment with a term up to 12 years including a
grace period of up to 4 years, at interest at the rate of 14 percent.
l'he loans were indexed in order to protect the principal (and interest)
from erosion by inflation.
19.       Agricultural lending in Brazil is usually without monetary
correction at rates, which with inflation of 20 percent or more, show
an unpredictable and negative real rate of interest. The livestock proj-
ect of 1967 was the first experiment with ex post monetary correction.
During the course of project implementation several modifications in the
indexing system were made with a view to make the system more simple
operationally and more acceptable to the farmers. The original arrange-
ments and the subsequent changes, culminating in the presen-t arrangements
on which agreement was reached in July 1972, are described in Annex III.
The original arrangements involved adjustment of the principal of subloans
on the basis of a producer.price index compiled every June, with up to 10
points of deductions for every year of grace; interest was charged at 14
percent on unadjusted principal during the grace period and on adjusted
amounts during the amortization period. In addition to the problems of
loan administration, with the declining rate of inflation in Brazil (28.4
percent a year in 1967; 20.4 percent a year in 1971) the project loans
became relatively unattractive compared to other agricultural loans. The
system now in effect, which would also apply to subloans made under the
proposed interim second project, involve the annual correction of the
principal of the subloans in proportion to the changes in the US dollar
selling rate for Brazilian cruzeiros. Participating banks would charge
interest on subloans at 71 percent, the same as the Bank's current lending
rate.  They would continue to retain 3 percenc to cover their loan process-
ing expenses and pass 4'-4 percent to the Central Bank. The latter would
make the full 7; percent interest payment to the Bank, thereby providing
a subsidy to the project. Since it is the Government's policy to revalue
the cruzeiro frequently in accordance with domestic price increases (less
price increases in Brazil's main international trading partners) the index-
ing system should result at all times in real positive interest rates to
ranchers. That rate will, however, be less than 7;4 percent to the extent
of price increases outside Brazil. While an indexing system based solely
on domestic price movements might be preferable, the Government does not
at this time wish to apply such a system on programs financed with external
resources.  In order to prevent a situation in which a change in the
Government's foreign exchange rate policy could lead to negative real rates
of interest, it has been agreed with the Brazilians that the indexing system
will be revised if the difference between price changes and changes in the
exchange rate exceeds 7]4 percentage points. While this arrangement is not
ideal and still implies lending to ranchers at subsidized rates,, it repre-
sents progress towards a system which would protect principal and interest
from erosion by inflation.



-7-
Beneficiaries
20.       Although originally intended to reach 1,800 ranchers the project
will have provided financing to about 800 ranchers, with subloans averaging
about US$80,000 against the projected US$33,000. It is estimated that about
40 percent of the cost overruns are due to price increases. In addition,
ranchers have tended to develop their entire ranch rather than only parts of
it, as envisaged when the loan was made. Because many eligible ranches in
Goias and Mato Grosso are new "frontier" operations - contrary to traditional
ranching in South Brazil - they are virtually undeveloped and require consid-
erable investment for complete development. Fall on-ranch development has
also been encouraged by the improved market outlook and the availability of
long-term project financing on reasonable terms.
21.       In addition to the Bank assisted project, livestock development
funds are availeble in Brazil under projects financed by the Inter-American
Development Bank and from Brazilian resources.  The Government has in prac-
tice channelled applications from larger farmers to the Bank-financed project,
while financing smaller farmers from the other programs, whose lending terms
were softer.
22.       Bank staff members have discussed with the Government the importance
of assisting the smaller livestock farmers. At present the Government intends
to continue to rely on highly subsidized credit for meeting their requirements.
However, the possibilities of Bank assistance to smaller farmers will be dis-
cussed with the Brazilians during the preparation of the proposed expanded
livestock development project (see paragraph 13). In the meantime, under the
Second (Interim) Project, the trend established for the first project would
continue.
Meat Marketing
23.       Wihen the first livestock loan was made attention of the Government
was drawn to two problems in the marketing system: (i) deficiencies in the
marketing infrastructure including inadequate cattle transport facilities,
and outmoded processing plents and slaughter houses, and (ii) disincentives
to investment in beef production caused by Government policies that favored
the urban consumer at the expense of the producers and the exporters.
24.       Marketing infrastructure has improved significantly in recent years.
Some 40,000 km of roads and 16 modern abattoirs were constructed between 1966
and 1972; standard meat inspection norms have been introduced; and carcass
grading established. In addition the agricultural export industries program
which the Bank is now examining (paragraph 9) would include substantial invest-
ments for modernization of abattoirs, improvement of meat processing and
construction of export facilities.
25.       The Superintendencia Nacional do Abastecimiento (SUNAB), the
Government supply agency, used to keep meat prices artificially low by oper-
ating a complex system of quotas for cattle slaughter and by itself operating



- 8 -
a number of strategically located slaughter houses. The Government under-
mro-te the losses incurred by SUNAB as a result of supplying meat to the
principal urban centers at artificially low prices. Early in 1970, the
Government withdrew SUNAB from the cattle business, thus permitting price
incentives to operate for the expansion of livestock production.
26.       However, this measure came at a time when there was a world
shortage of meat and beef prices were rising rapidly on the wiorld market.
The Government had the dilemma of offering incentive to producers and
increasing export earning on the one hand and of keeping inflation under
check (meat prices account for 5.2 percentage points in the Guanabara cost
of living index) on the other. At the end of 1970, Government therefore
took measures to limit price increases by: (a) suspending tax incentives
for beef exports, and (b) prescribing export quotas from the main exporting
regions. At that time, the Government assured the Bank that the export
controls would be temporary and relaxed as the situation permitted. The
quota system was made more flexible in 1972, and additional quotas offerec
to exporters setting aside meat for storage during the high killing January-
June season (1.5 tons and 5 tons of additional quota to exporters in Central
and South Brazil respectively for every ton stored). Since the export cuotas
were applied in terms of tonnage one of the results of the quotas has beer to
give a strong impetus to exports of high value processed forms of meat, and
therefore to investment in processing facilities. The average unit price of
meat exports has gone up from US$666 a ton in 1966 to US$1,219 a ton in 1971.
In general, market conditions and facilities have substantially improved
since 1967 and there is general optimism that no market constraint would
affect the progress of the interim project. At the same time, the export
controls have limited the increase in domestic meat prices which affects
the protein intake of middle and low income urban families.
PART V - THE INTERIM SECOND PROJECT
27.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Interim Second Livestock
Development Project, Brazilt" dated November 28, 1972, is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is
presented in Annex III.
28.       The project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Brazil
in March-April 1972.  Negotiations took place on lNovember 16 and 17, 1972.
The Borrower, the Federative Republic of Brazil was represented by a team
headed by Dr. Paulo Yokota, Director of the Central Bank.
29.       The proposed interim second livestock development project is in-
tended to provide for a continuation of the credit and technical assistance
programs established under the first project (Loan 516-BR) already discussed
in Part IV and the project will cover the forecast gap of about 18 months
between full commitment of Loan 516-BR and possible Bank consideration of
a loan for the larger livestock program now being prepared (see paragraph 13).



-9-
30.       As did the first project, the interim project would consist
primarily of a credit program, complemented with technical assistance,
under which long-term loans would be extended to commercial livestock
operations to finance on-farm investments such as land clearing, pasture
improvement, fencing, watering and handling facilities, farm buildings and
machinery and breeding cattle, which, together with superior animal hus-
bandry techniques, would result in better herd productivity and stock ex-
pansion. Livestock would be grass fed, generally on ranches developed from
grasslands unsuitable for crop production. About 700 ranches are expected
to be financed under the interim project on ranches or mixed farms ranging
in size from about 500 to about 8,500 hectares, depending on the region.
The interim loan would therefore be channelled to almost the same number
of ranches as in the case of the much larger first loan, with a concomitant
reduction in the average size of the subloans.
31.       The Bank loan would be repayable in 17 years, including five
years grace. This should be sufficient to cover the estimated four-year
disbursement period, the maximum 12-year term of subloans, and one extra
year for delays. The proposed 17-year term is less than the 20-year term
of the first livestock loan (because of the greatly reduced need to provide
for delays).
32.       Project costs -- the financial resources necessary to continue
lending and technical assistance during the 18 months between full commit-
ment of the first project loan and the expected date of Bank consideration
of a third loan -- would total US$52 million. The foreign exchange component
is comparable to the first project, about 14 percent; consequently, about 75
percent of the Bank loan (some US$19 million) would finance local currency
expenditures, which is justified on country grounds (see paragraph 6). The
project cost would be shared among the Bank, Government and ranchers in the
ratio of 50, 31 and 19.
Procurement and Disbursements
33.       The Bank's loan would be disbursed against long-term subloans for
eligible on-farm development refinanced by the Central Bank, and against
technical service costs. Investment proposals exceeding US$200,000 each
would require prior approval of the Bank. Complementary short-term financing
would be provided by participating commercial banks.
34.       Procurement from the proceeds of the Bank loan would be made through
normal commercial channels. Bulk procurement and international competitive
bidding would not be practicable in view of the varying requirements of the
approximately 700 individual farmers expected to participate in the project
and also in view of the need to procure machinery which can be serviced and
repaired locally. Most of the equipment required is manufactured in
Brazil and sold at competitive prices. About US$7.3 million or 14 percent
of total project costs is expected to represent either imported equipment
or the import component of locally manufactured equipment.

Financial and Economic Benefits
35.       To test the financial viability of proposed investments in live-
stock development, seven models, which were prepared during the appraisal
of the first project, were reviewed-on the basis of actual operations ex-
perience gained during the execution of the first project. The financial
rates of return for these models vary between 12 and 29 percent.
36.       The project would result in improved livestock productivity rates,
decrea'sed mortality, increased percentages of herds and flocks slaughtered
annually, and intensified pasture use.  This, in turn, would result in in-
creases in prbdudtion of heifers and steers, resulting in an estimated
ecohomic rate bf returni of about 23 percent for the project.  The economic
rate 6f retuirn calcuTlation does not take into account the substantial, but
not easily quantifiable, benefits such as the demonstrati6n eiffet of modern
production techniques on project f&rms and the training of Brazilian person-
nel in livestock development.
PART VI - LEAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
37.  '    The draft L6an Agreement between the Federative Republic of Brazil
and the Bank, the draft Project Agieemnent betiieen Binco GCeitral do Brazil
and th' Banik, the Rep6ot bf the Coriidttee provided f6r in Article III, Sec-
tion 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the draft Resolution approving
th  proposed loan, are being distributed to tbhe Executive Directors separate-
ly. The major features of these agreements have already been described in.
this ireport.
38;       I am satisfied that the pr6posed loan will comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMIUENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN ERAZIL
1.        The agriculture sector has been receiving much attention from
the Government in recent years and the Bank organized a sector survey in
1969-70 (Report PA-52a of August 19, 1970). Review of the agriculture
sector has been an integral part of the Bank's annual country economic
reviews and this sector -- including the rural agricultural economy of
the Northeast -- is being specially studied in the current year.
2.        Agriculture is a mainstay of the Brazilian economy, despite
the country's recent rapid industrial growth. In 1971 agriculture
accounted for 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product, employed 44 percent
of the labor force and farm products made up about 70 percent of total
exports. Over the past decade, growth of agricultural output averaged
4.5 percent a year and the Government in its plan for 1972-74 expects
growth to accelerate to 7 percent.
3.        Brazil is attempting to recover from the unusually low coffee
crop of 1970-71 (11 million bags) to an annual production of 26-28 mil-
lion bags. The mid-1960's coffee diversification program reduced too
much Brazil's coffee production capacity. Frost and rust brought the
coffee crop to dangerously low levels. Brazil has now embarked upon a
wide ranging program to promote planting of new trees and provide addi-
tional fertilization and coffee rust and broca treatment.
4.        There is intense activity aimed at accelerating growth in
Brazil's agricultural sector. Besides coffee, the greatest gains in
agricultural output are expected in grain, soybean and beef production
in the South and Center, both for domestic consumption and for export.
In support of this objective, the Government is operating a general
agricultural minimum price support program which covers grains other
than wheat and assures minimum support prices, near world market levels,
announced in advance of grain cultivation seasons. It has provided a
strong incentive to production. The Government also operates a wheat
price support program which was initially designed to promote import
substitution and producer prices were substantially subsidized for this
purpose. As domestic production responded strongly (production increased
from below one million tons in 1968, to around 2.25 million tons in 1972)
the subsidy paid to producers was reduced by one-third and the support
price is now at the level of 140 percent of the CIF price of import and
at 110 percent of production cost.
5.        Intensive efforts are also underway to promote livestock pro-
duction -- through investment credits, introduction of improved technology,
pricing policy and marketing improvements. Finally, the Government is
attempting through its "export corridor" program to increase several fold
earnings from exports of coarse grains, animal feeds, meat and frozen
juices; the program consists of improvement of production, storage, mar-
keting and transportation of these goods.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
As of December 1, 1972 there were 25 effective Bank loans under
disbursement:
Loan No.
h03/47L     3streito Hydroelectric Project:   US$57 and US$39 million loans of
February 26, 1965 and December 19, 1966. The project is proceeding
on schedule. Eauipment costs were substantially below estimates,
so that disbursements have been less than forecast.
404         Xavantes Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.5 million loan of February
27, 1965.  The project was completed in early 1971 (after a delay
of about eighteen months) except for the installation of equipment
for an associated transmission line. Ordering of this equipment
was delayed, and the loan is now expected to be fully disbursed by
December 31, 1973, four years after the initial closing date.
442         Jaguara Hydroelectric Project:   US$49 million loan of March 15,
196. All the four generators were commissioned during 1971 and
the project has been,completed. Disbursements will extend up to
mid-1973.
475/476/
477/478     Power Distribution Projects:   US$6.2, US$8.1, US$41, and US$6.3
million loans of December'19. 1966. These four power distribu-
tion projects had a slow s'tart but after administrative reorganiza-
tion in 1970 they gained momentum. Proc'urement'for the projects
has been completed but some equipment may not be delivered by the
December 31, 1972 closing date. Most of the overhead distribution
system has been completed; construction work'on transmission lines,
substations and underground distribution systems will extend into
1973.
516         Livestock Project:  US$ho million loan of September 23, 1967.
After initial delays due to marketing and organizational difficul-
ties, the livestock credit program has been proceeding at a
satisfactory rate. Some problems arose in early 1972 with respect
to the calculation of interest on indexed principal amounts during
the grace period but these have now been settled. About US$35
million out of the US$ho million loan has been committed and the
balance is expected to be committed by December 1972. Disburse-
ments are expected to be completed by the closing date, December
31, 1973.
565         Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.3 million loan of
October 23, 1965.  Changes in the project layout and design have
increased substantially the local cost, which will be covered by-
ELetrobras. Construction work is well advanced and the project
is likely to be completed on schedule.

Loan No.
566       Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project:  US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, 196d. The project was delayed six months by spillway
foundation difficulties and is now scheduled to be completed by
October 1974.
567       First Ilighway Construction Project:  US$26 million loan of
October 23, 1968. The First Highway Construction project is
virtually completed at a cost slightly below estimates.
656       Industry:  US$25 million loan of February 16, 1970. Disburse-
ments to Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB). The date for commit-
ment of the loan by BNB originally set for June 30, 1972, has been
postponed by one year to reflect lower than expected demand for
funds. One obstacle to more rapid utilization of the loan has
been the Bank's requirement that entrepreneurs normally put up a
minimum of 25 percent of total project cost from their own funds
in order to have access to the Bank loan. As long as subsidized
local currency resources were plentiful, entrepreneurs chose to
use them to the utmost and to finance import costs from their own
resources or through suppliers' credits. The situation changed
significantly in 1972. SUDENE has made it more difficult for pros-
pective investors to have access to subsidized resources, by re-
quiring them to increase their financial stake in projects and the
monetary authorities have extended ex post indexation to all term
industrial lending by Federal credit institutions.  Utilization of
the Bank's loan should therefore accelerate.
676       Second Highway Construction Broject:  US$100 million loan of
May 25, 1970. The Second Highway Construction project is about
70 percent completed. Although disbursements are now slightly
behind schedule, the project is expected to be completed without
delay and within cost estimates.
677       Yarimbondo Hydroelectric Project:  US$80 million loan of Pay 15,
1970. Construction work started in early 1972 as scheduled. A
proposed increase in the length of the transmission system, together
with substantially higher than estimated equipment costs, are expec-
ted to raise the project's cost by US$20 million over the original
forecast. This increase does not affect the project's economic
justification.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:  US$70 million loan of April 5,
1971. The project is proceeding according to schedule. The cost of
the civil works so far contracted is in accordance with the estimates.
755       Education Project:  US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971.   In
accordance with a revised schedule agreed upon between the Bank and
the Project unit, construction is expected to be six months behind
the initial estimate. No need to postpone the closing date is foreseen.

Loan No.
756       Santos Port Project:  US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971.  The
project is proceeding satisfactorily. Preliminary engineering
has been completed, though invitation of tenders is slightly
behind schedule. The Bank has agreed to an increase in grain
silo capacity and is reviewing several other works revisions.
757       Sao Paulo rWater Supply Project:  US$22 million loan of June 21
1971. The state Government is somewhat behind schedule in raising
resources according to the financial plan for the project. SAEC,
the Borrower, has made significant progress in reorganizing its
structure and in improving operations. The water and sewage
tariffs have been revised in fulfillment of the undertaking i-n
the loan documents.
758       Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project:  US$37 million loan of June
21, 1971. The state Government is behind schedule in raising
resources according to the financial plan for the project. The
problem is under active review with the Government.
786       Railway Project - MER: US$46 million loan of -Auapt,,25-J,1_7
A delay of about 6 months occurred in awarding the contracts fbr
constructing the new railway link for the MMBR iron ore mine due
to engineering problems encountered and inadequate project manage-
ment by the Federal Railways. Work has now commenced on site and
much of the lost time is being regained.
787       MR iron Ore Project:   US$50 million loan of August 25.,, 1971.. The
estimated cost of the project has increased due to major design
changes for the port terminal and several investment additions to
the project. A new financing plan is under discussion with the
Borrower and target completion dates at the mine and terminal
should be met. The project remains profitable despite the increase
in capital costs.
797       CS; Steel Expansion Project:  $64.5 million loan of Februaar &, 1972.
The loan became effective on August 31, 1972 and the project is pro-
ceeding according to schedule.
812       Usininas Steel Ecpansion Project:  US$63 millibn loan of April 11,
1772. The loan became effective on July 25, 1272 and the project
is proceeding according to schedule.
828       COSTIA Steel Expansion Project:  US$64.5 million loan of,June 14,
1972. The loan became effective on October 5.% 1972 and the project
is proceeding according to schedule.

Background Information on Inflation
1.        In terms of annual average differences, the rate of price
increase measured by the General Price Index / accelerated from 29.2
percent in 1960/59 to a peak level of 88.9 percent in 1964/63. In 1967
the general price level rose by 28.4 percent compared to the previous
year and.in 1971 by 20.4 percent compared to 1970.

Relending Terms Prescribed in 1967
2.        The relending formula originally agreed in 1967 had the following
features:
(a) Loan duration: nine to twelve years, including three to
four years of grace for amortization of principal;
(b) Interest rate: 14 percent over the life of the loan,
calculated on outstanding loan principal adjusted;
(c) Rediscount rate changed by Central Bank to participating
banks: 7 percent (equal to the rate of the Bank's loan).
1/ A composite index made up of the following sub-indexes: wholesale
price index (60%), Guanabara cost of living index (30%), and the
construction cost index (10%).



ANNEX III
Page 5 of 7
(d) Loan Adjustment:
(i) During grace period - interest calculated on the basis
of unadjusted loan balancel/;
(ii) During amortization period - both principal repayment
and interest calculated on the basis of adjusted loan
balance;
(iii) Principal and interest payments made annually, on the
anniversary date of loan commitmentsZ . Amounts due
would be calculated by applying the current loan adjust-
ment index to the amounts which would be due had there
been no adjustment. The loan adjustment index would be
related to the producer price index, measured from the
year each loan is made. For the base year, the producer
price index would be 100. The loan adjustment index
would equal the producer price index during the same
year, less the following amounts:
Year 1 - 10;
Year 2 - 20;
Year 3 - 30;
Year 4 and ensuing years - 40.
In no case, however, would the adjusted loan balance
be less than the unadjusted balance during the same
year. This means that the loan adjustment index could
never fall below 100; and
(iv) Amounts derived from loan adjustment accruing to the
credit of the Government, to take care of the exchange
risk arising out of the Bank loan and to help defray
the cost of technical services.
3.        The loan adjustment index would be defined and measured separately
for Central Brazil and Rio Grande do Sul. In the former region, where beef
would be the major output of Project farms, the index would be made up of fat
cattle prices. In the latter region, the index would be composite, including
prices of both beef cattle and wool. Prices would be measured each year as
an average of prices obtained during the high-supply months. The Getulio
Vargas Foundation, an autonomous economic research agency of recognized in-
tegrity and competence, would be entrusted with sampling, data collection and
1/  This implies no loan adjustment during the grace period insofar as debt
service is concerned. For prepayment purposes, loan balances would be
adjusted from year to year, both during and after the grace period.
2/ A participating farmer would normally obtain four separate loans under
the Project, one for each year of farm plan execution.   Interest would
be paid on June 30, and December 31, of every year.

publishing the index. The index would be issued annually in July. It
would be used for adjustments of amounts due in the 12-month period follov-
ing publication of the index.l/
Changes in Relending Terms Introduced in May 1970
4.        The above indexing mechanism was expected to yield a real interes,:,
rate of at least 7 percent per annum, provided inflation did not rise above
the 40-50 percent rate.  These conditions proved to be unacceptable to
ranchers, particularly in view of the success of the stabilization progrnam
in Brazil, and very few ranchers agreed to participate in the project.
5.        In view of the lack of interest of ranchers the Government and
the Bank agreed in May 1970 on new interest rate terms.   The participating
ranchers were offered a choice of either of the following subloan terms:
(a)  the same as in paragraph 2 but with a decrease in the
nominal interest rate from 14 percent to 12 percent;
(b)  nominal interest of 6 percent, the principal amount to b4
fully indexed, including during the grace period, based on
either: (i) the cattle of cattle/wool price index, or
(ii) the changes in the US dollar selling rate of the
Banco do Brasil, S.A. from the one prevailing on the date
of the loan.
Ceiling on Adjustment Index Introduced in June 1971
6.        In late 1970 and early 1971, following removal of meat price
controls, there occurred a substantial rise in cattle prices. It was
observed that if the trend continued loans subject to adjustment in accord-
ance with an index of cattle prices could be subject to extremely large
adjustments. The fact that these adjustments would be so much greater than
the widely publicized inflation rates was operating as a serious disincentive
to rancher participation in the Project.  A high percentage of farmers with-
drew their loan applications.  Consequently, in June 1971 the Bank and the
Government again agreed to modified relendin- terms for loans to be committed
from that time on. It was agreed that whatever adjustment was made in sub-
loan principal would not exceed the extent of inflation as measured by the
general price index for the period.
1/ A linear interpolation would be made after publication of the index to
determine the amounts due during each month of the preceding year.   This
would be used to adjust farmer's loan balances in case of partial or
total prepayment of a loan.

Present Relending Terms
7.        A Bank mission reviewed the Project in March-April 1972 and
noticed that owing to misunderstandings there were several shortcomings
in the application of the monetary correction formula. Specifically
they found:
(a) that while monetary correction was being applied to
principal during the four-year grace period (with the
exception of an initial gap, see (b) and (c) below),
interest during the grace period was being calculated
on the original nominal amount of the loan. Only after
the end of the grace period was such interest calculated
on the corrected amount. This had the effect of reducing
the real interest rate paid by ranchers by one-half to one
percentage points per annum over the life of the average
loan;
(b) that on loans linked to the foreign exchange rate,
monetary correction was not being charged during the
first 12-18 months of the grace period despite the fact
that the arrangements provided that it should be charged
from the beginning. This had the effect of reducing the
real interest rate paid over the life of the loan by
about 1.5 percentage points on the average;
(c) that on loans linked to the cattle price index, the
correction was equally not applied in the first 12-18
months. This reduced the average real interest rate
by some 2 percentage points.
8.        With a view to avoiding such mistakes in the future, the Banco
Central do Brasil, in consultation with the Bank, simplified the relending
terms beginning on July 1, 1972. The change provided that interest on all
new subloans would be 7 1/4 percent a year and the loan amount corrected in
proportion to the changes in the US dollar selling rate for Brazilian
cruzeiros. Full adjustment of both interest and principal are to occur
both during the entire grace period and later. If at any time the increase
in the general price index should exceed the rise in the US dollar/cruzeiro
exchange rate by more than 7 1/4 percent, the Bank and the borrower will agree
on a new indexing system, and no new subloans will be committed until that new
system has been agreed.
9.        It is realized that the present system is not perfect and implies
lending to ranchers at subsidized rates of interest. However, most agricul-
tural lending in Brazil takes place at interest rates of up to about 15 per-
cent without monetary correction. The system is sustained only with strong
support of public funds. In this sector the Government made a beginning in
ex post correction with the first livestock loan and the system has now been
made workable.  It has been Government's policy to allow agricultural lending
rates to remain below industrial rates, partly as a compensation for the high
prices of agricultural inputs caused by protection to the industrial sector.
The Bank staff has a continuing dialogue with the Government about agricultural
lending policies and the Government has been gradually extending the practice
of monetary correction.
