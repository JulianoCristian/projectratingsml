through participating commercial banks in\n            the following three Regional Project Areas: the state of Rio\n            Grande do Sul and the Campos de Lajes and Curitibanos\n            regions in the state of Santa Catarina; the states of Mato\n            Grosso, Sao Paulo and Parana (northern part); the states of\n            Goias and Minas Gerais. Credit will be available to eligible\n            ranchers (about 700 are expected to participate) to finance\n            on-farm investments such as land clearing, pasture\n            improvement, fencing, watering and handling facilities, farm\n            buildings and machinery, and breeding cattle. Technical\n            assistance for livestock development will also be extended\n            and the project would result in better herd productivity and\n            stock expansion."}, "docdt": "1972-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
