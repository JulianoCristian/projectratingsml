                         The development objectives of UDP 3 phase II are: (a) to improve the provision of infrastructure and services in Conakry and secondary cities; and (b) to improve the
                         fnancial and organizational management of municipalities in support of the decentralization process.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         So far, project implementation has resulted in providing improved infrastructure services to about 100,380 people compared to the end-of-project target of 249,000 people direct
                         beneficiaries. These outcomes consist of (i) 91,000 people provided with access to all-season roads within a 500 meter through rehabilitation of 6 km of roads in Conakry; (ii) 4,100
                         people provided with temporary jobs through labor-intensive public works (70 km of drains cleaned and neighborhoods roads rehabilitated); and 5,280 people provided with access to
                         public sanitation under the project.

                         Works for all the eleven (11) schools targeted for rehabilitation in secondary cities have been completed except for one. The mission visited three schools and witnessed that the new
                         classrooms have been equipped and are used for the planned purposes. For the school under rehabilitation (about 70% of works implemented), the mission supported the PIU's
                         proposal to cancel the ongoing contract and to hire a new contractor to complete the remaining works by the end of March 2013. The remaining investments in the secondary cities

                         concern seven commercial infrastructures (three car terminals and four markets), for which bidding processes are at the stage of evaluation reports. The challenge is that some works
                         need six months for full completion, while a few local governments still have arrears in payment of their counterparts to investments funding (5% of estimates). The mission discussed
                         conditions for planned works to be completed by project closing of June 30, 2013 and agreed with the client on triggers for works launch for each specific investment. Hence, out of
                         remaining seven high value contracts under preparation, it has been assessed that two will not be fully implemented if works do not begin in early January 2013. The five other
                         contracts will have to be signed by end-December 2012 to allow implementation of related works. Any related investment that would not have a works contract signed before that
                         deadline will have to be canceled from the project. All remaining high value works planned for Conakry have been launched recently or at least corresponding contracts have been
                         signed. To date, project disbursement rate is only about 51%. With the signing of remaining high value contracts, commitments are expected to reach 85% by end of December 2012,
                         and 89% by project closing.

                         Despite a relatively successful restructuring of the project in late December 2011, and a change in project coordination leadership in early 2012, the project continue to face slow
                         implementation as a result of i) long delays in procurement for high value contracts, which also involve national administration for bids evaluation and contracts signing.
