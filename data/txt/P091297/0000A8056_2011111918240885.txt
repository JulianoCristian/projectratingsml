                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has so far resulted in the rehabilitation of about 6 Km of roads in Conakry. Moreover about eleven works sites were opened in September 2011 in five of the
                         ten project secondary cities: works are expected to be completed in early 2012. With regard to solid waste management, specific measures were agreed to strengthen the institutional
                         arrangements for operating and supervising the required activities. Progress in project implementation was hampered by the two-year suspension of the country by the Bank.
                         Construction costs increase would make the accomplishment of project results difficult, therefore a restructuring of the project is under discussion.
