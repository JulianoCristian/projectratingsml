Of the nine project\n            development objective indicators, three were dropped during\n            restructuring while the remaining indicators were achieved.\n            Of the twenty-two intermediate outcome indicators, five\n            surpassed the target, seven were achieved fully, four were\n            achieved partially, and the remaining indicators were\n            dropped during restructuring. Significant lessons learned\n            during project implementation include: 1) complex and high\n            risk projects with multi-stakeholder involvement require an\n            effective advisory body with substantive influence to\n            facilitate effective strategic support and guidance; 2) in a\n            fragile state environment, project flexibility and constant\n            and careful implementation oversight is required to ensure\n            necessary adjustments and address implementation\n            bottlenecks; 3) mitigating the effects of inflation on\n            project activities by including sufficient contingencies in\n            allocations reduces disruptions and distortions in project\n            implementation; 4) sustaining and deepening reforms at\n            national and local levels in a fragile state context\n            requires substantive and constant engagement and\n            identification of a clear reform proponent; 5) investments\n            in participatory planning and budgeting may contribute\n            effectively to strong ownership and engagement; and 6) long\n            term Bank engagements over time in fragile states can create\n            sustainable sector improvements, but require flexibility,\n            adjustment and continuous engagement."}, "docdt": "2013-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
