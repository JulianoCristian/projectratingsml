1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background
1.      Guinea remains one of the poorest countries in the world despite its abundant mineral
endowment and agricultural potential. The country experienced 2.3 percent economic growth
from 2003 to 2005 period, with 34 percent inflation in 2006, leading to depreciation of the
Guinean Franc and an increase in overall poverty rates from 49 percent to 56 percent between
2002 and 2005. Guinea has suffered from the consequences of decades of poor governance, as
evidenced by endemic corruption, weak political institutions, a lack of inclusiveness and
dialogue, poor legal and regulatory frameworks, and a reticent civil society. In April 2007, after
a period of political unrest, trade union engagement, nationwide strikes and social strife a Prime
Minister with full powers was appointed by the President from a list of three candidates
identified through a consultative process. The reformist government vowed to take immediate
measures to improve governance and ensure accountability and transparency in the management
of public finance.

Urban Sector and Decentralization Context
2.      The urban population in Guinea has grown dramatically from 31 percent of the total
population in 1990 to 45 percent in 2005. The capital city, Conakry, is the main economic hub
and port city and is host to almost half of the country’s urban population and half of all jobs,
showing great imbalance in the urban network. The rapid urbanization is creating increasing
pressure on basic urban services and challenges municipalities to improve their technical and
financial capacities to meet these needs.

3.      The decentralization process was initiated in 1986 with the establishment of a legal and
judicial framework, including delegation of powers to local governments and the creation of 336
Local Governments (LG) - 303 rural communes and 33 urban municipalities. Conakry was later
endowed with special status as a Governorate. This framework was further consolidated in 1989,
granting the status of Province to Conakry and delegating the administrative and financial
responsibilities of the City. The five municipalities of Conakry were created in lieu of three
former Prefectures and divided in sections with specific functions and revenues. Municipal
elections took place every five years and in October 2005, an association for the communes of
Guinea was created with the mandate to coordinate dialogue with the Government and other
major partners, and to provide a forum for newly-elected local officials. A Code of Local
Governments and Decentralization was adopted by the Parliament in 2006, harmonizing
regulatory measures adopted through the years with the objective of granting more responsibility
to LGs and strengthening their accountability, although its implementation was delayed.
Concomitantly, fiscal measures were adopted to clarify the revenue base of LGs. A 1990
Ordinance implemented intergovernmental transfers to benefit the City of Conakry and its five
municipalities, granting the city 100 percent of the business tax proceeds and city markets’
revenues, while the five municipalities were to receive 100 percent of the business tax (TPU),
and secondary markets’ proceeds. After an increase until 2004, Conakry’s tax proceeds were



                                                1
reduced in 2005 due to deterioration of the macroeconomic context and reorganization of the tax
departments.

Rationale for World Bank Involvement
4.      UDP3 Phase II was aligned with the overall country strategy including the strategic
orientations of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (June, 2003-2006), the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) 1 (July, 2002), and the PRSP 2 (August, 2007). It contributed to Pillars 1
and 3 of the CAS/PRSP, fostering sustainable and equitable growth by supporting the
establishment of minimum infrastructure and services required for growth (Pillar 1); CAS/PRSP
2, improving governance and institutional and human capacity building (Pillar 1) and improving
access to high quality social services (Pillar 3). All urban sector operations pursued the overall
objective of poverty reduction and improving the living conditions of the urban poor. The urban
sector operations also focused on strengthening central and local urban institutions and
managerial capacities, key to sustainable urban development and built on lessons learned from
the Bank’s previous urban involvement in the sector:

    UDP1 (US$ 15 million, 1985-1990) was designed to address the important needs in the
     urban sector, inherited from years of lack of investment. The project focused on capacity
     strengthening at the central and local levels for infrastructure programming, setting up
     financing mechanisms for basic service management through improvement of the business
     tax, and improvement of drainage and solid waste management (SWM) services.
    UDP2 (US$ 66 million, 1990-1998) continued UDP1 infrastructure efforts in Conakry and
     selected secondary cities with a focus on: infrastructure (primary roads and infrastructure
     rehabilitation, priority investment in four regional centers), assets maintenance (secondary
     roads), institutional strengthening, and local revenue mobilization by introducing new tools
     for city management and local revenue improvement.
    UDP3 Phase I (US$ 18 million, 1999-2005) capitalized on lessons learned from the
     previous two UDPs. It was conceived as a two-phase Adaptable Program Lending (APL)
     operation with a focus on service delivery, access to basic public services, and effective
     human resource development as key inputs into reaching the overarching objective of
     poverty reduction and improving living conditions of urban population.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
5.      The UDP3 Phase II development objectives were: (a) to improve the provision of
infrastructure and services in Conakry and secondary cities; and (b) to improve the financial and
organizational management of municipalities in support of the decentralization process.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators
6.     Following the December 23, 2008 coup d’état, the Bank suspended all activities in
accordance with the Bank OP 7.30, including UDP3 Phase II. The Bank reengagement in
January 2011 followed Guinea’s first democratically elected president, who assumed power in
December 2010, and the UDP3 Phase II was reactivated in February 2011. With disbursement at
only 20.1 percent at reengagement, the project was restructured in December 2011 and its
closing date extended from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013. Moreover, the project was
leveraged in May 2008 with a US$ 2.5 million grant (Additional Financing) from the Global
Food Crisis Response Program (TF092930-GUI), enabling the Emergency Urban Labor

                                                2
Intensive Works Program (EULIWP) to increase the purchasing power of the poorest in Conakry
in response to the deterioration of the economy during the military rule.

7.       The PDO remained unchanged, but targets and indicators were revised as follows: (i)
revision of PDO indicators1 (ii) revision of the target values for some indicators (due to reduction
in scope of activities as a result of increased costs); (iii) incorporation of core indicators when
relevant in accordance with the Bank’s revised monitoring and evaluation (M&E) guidelines
(e.g. direct beneficiaries (including percentage of women), roads and improved water community
points); and (iv) integration of the intermediate results of the EULIWP additional funding into
the project’s results framework. The changes responded to the urgent needs of a post-crisis
situation by strengthening the project’s goal of achieving basic infrastructure improvements,
whereas the number of institutional indicators on LG capacity was reduced given time
constraints for completion of the project (see Annexes 2 and 3). The changes to the results
framework thus aimed at reflecting the outcomes and outputs of activities to be implemented
over the remaining duration of the restructured project2.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
8.      The main beneficiaries of UDP3 Phase II were the population of the 15 municipality
stakeholders through the improvement of their living conditions and livelihoods of the urban
vulnerable poor. The Government of Guinea (GoG) including the LGs (communes, Governorate
of Conakry and municipalities) benefited from Priority Investment Programs (PIPs) for basic
infrastructure, the capacity building implemented under Municipal Adjustment Programs
(MAPs), institutional strengthening, as well as the EULIWP. After project restructuring, the
target population remained unchanged though overall project outputs were scaled down. By
project’s end, the total number of beneficiaries increased due to the EULIWP integration into the
project and project indicators (See Annex 2).

1.5 Original Components
9.       The UDP3 Phase I was one of the first Adaptable Program Loan in the Africa region, and
all the triggers for Phase I and performance indicators were met (delay in compliance with two
triggers delayed the appraisal of the UDP 3 Phase II). The UDP Phase II was initially envisaged
with a US$ 41 million IDA allocation. Due to the deteriorating country performance, IDA
allocation for Phase II was revised downward with a total cost of US$ 16 million, of which US$
15 million is from IDA and US$ 1 million from the Central and LGs of Guinea. It included three
components: (i) Municipal contract (MC) for the City of Conakry; (ii) Municipal contacts for the
secondary cities; and (iii) Institutional strengthening.

10.    Component 1: Municipal Contract for the City of Conakry (IDA: US$ 6.5 million).
The objective was to provide improved access to urban infrastructure and services to residents in
the City of Conakry and its municipalities (Kaloum, Matoto, Ratoma, Dixinn, and Matam)

  Indicators related to own source revenues were dropped as their target growth was not set in constant terms, and indicators
related to solid waste management were dropped as the subcomponent was dropped. The indicators were replaced by direct
project beneficiaries, number of beneficiaries with access to all-season roads, LG effective management systems and timely
budget report indicators;
2
  The results framework was thus substantially revised. A total of 10 indicators (including 3 PDO indicators) were dropped, 19
new indicators were introduced (including 4 new PDO indicators) and only 3 indicators from the original results framework were
retained.

                                                              3
through PIPs and MAPs. This was meant to benefit a large share of the urban population of
Guinea, concentrated in the capital city, mainly in the most deprived neighborhoods. Three
subcomponents supported: (i) the solid waste management system of Conakry set up during
Phase I aimed at capturing methane at la Minière; (ii) secondary roads improvement, as a
component of the four-year program of secondary roads rehabilitation and a substantial
maintenance program; and (iii) the prioritization of investments identified in the urban
investment plans developed as part of project preparations.

11.     Component 2: Municipal Contracts for Secondary Cities (IDA: US$ 4.5 million). The
objective was to follow-up implementation of MCs in 10 cities, which proved to be largely
successful during UDP3 Phase I, demonstrating strong commitment by municipalities and
satisfactory counterpart funding on their part. Second generation MCs were to be based on the
priority actions considered during the audits of UDP3 Phase I. A special emphasis was to be
placed on MAPs in order to continue to improve: (i) the financial sustainability of communes
through improved mobilization of local revenues; and (ii) the administrative and technical
capacity of municipal staff. The cities were to commit annually at least 3 percent of their current
revenues for assets maintenance (as part of AMPs).

12.      Component 3: Institutional Strengthening (IDA: US$ 2.8 million) included project
management support, dissemination and communication activities, audits and support to
implementation of the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The component also supported activities for city level
institutional strengthening, (e.g. street addressing, improvement of local resources through
technical support and expansion of fiscal registers and tax base, dissemination of budgetary and
accounting manuals for municipalities, support the computerization of municipal financial
statements, and update the financial ratio guidebook, for tax base identification and tax
collection).

1.6 Revised Components
13.     The three project components remained the same, though the scope of activities was
scaled down and some subcomponents were dropped to reflect changes in Government priorities,
account for increased costs for works, goods and transportation as a result of rising inflation and
focus remaining implementation period on key activities that could be successfully implemented
by project’s end. The restructuring project budget remained at US$ 16 million. Furthermore, the
EULIWP3 was formally integrated into the project during project restructuring. The extension of
the project’s closing date resulted in increased costs under Component 3 as the project continued
to finance communication and information dissemination activities, technical assistance to
project implementation, technical and financial audits, and support to safeguard implementation.

14.     Component 1: Municipal Contract for Conakry (US$ 7.35 million). The PIP retained
investments in: (i) neighborhood upgrading, but reduced the extent of road rehabilitation to be
financed under the project from 10 to 7.6 kilometers, and (ii) administrative, socio-public,
commercial, and environmental facilities. All activities related to SWM were dropped due to the
change in GoG policy (see Box 1). Hence, for the Conakry MAP, activities supporting the
establishment of a SWM system were cancelled while the remaining categories of activities were
3
    Originally designed as an Additional Financing to UDP3 Phase 2 in 2008.

                                                                4
maintained but with reduced scope and focus on activities that could be implemented before
project closure.

  Box 1: Changes and Cancellation of the SWM Subcomponent during Project Implementation
   The SWM system in Conakry was successfully developed with support from previous UDP projects and
   maintained until 2011 with: clear institutional and financial responsibilities; progressive private sector
   participation; performance monitoring; and transparency in the processes and procedures for managing the
   system. The system, which reached about 80% coverage and about 80% cost recovery by 2005, was
   divided between: collection, transfer and street sweeping (SMEs); and transfer stations to a controlled
   environment at La Minière (Solid Waste Transfer Public Unit (SPTD, Service Public de Transfert des
   déchets). Before Phase 2 of the APL became effective, however, the municipalities of Conakry and the
   SPTD intervened in collection management to complement the SMEs’ reduced collection due to the
   situation which distorted the collection market and led to unfair competition vis-à-vis SMEs. Moreover,
   GoG’s subsequent decision to cancel the SME Guarantee Fund altered the SWM system design, increasing
   the risks of insufficient cost recovery for SMEs, in case citizens refused to pay collection charges. Also, the
   Governorate of Conakry delayed the financing of operational costs of SPTD and this exacerbated the
   disruption of the system in terms of further declines in collection, illegal dumping through the city, lower
   volumes of waste transferred to landfills, and challenges with regards to the management of the discharge
   at la Minière located in Conakry. Despite this situation, all PIP and MAP activities under this
   subcomponent were prepared by the PCU and submitted to IDA for approval before the project was
   suspended in early 2009. Following the Bank re-engagement in early 2011, the Bank and GoG discussed
   different options for re-starting the financing of SWM activities based on the framework agreed in the
   PAD. However, in late 2011, Government subsequently informed the World Bank of its decision to fully
   privatize the SWM chain. Hence, the SWM subcomponent was cancelled following project restructuring in
   December 2011, since the changes to the SWM governance structure and the resulting impacts of these
   changes were not sufficiently clarified for the Bank to continue provide funds for any segment of the SWM
   system.

15.     Component 2: Municipal Contracts for Secondary Cities (US$ 4.81 million). The
scope for secondary cities’ MCs was similarly scaled down: only 20 of the planned 40 sub-
projects were retained, with each city benefiting from at least one sub-project investment, and the
MAPs were called down and refocused on activities to be completed in time before project
closure.

16.     Component 3: Institutional Strengthening (US$ 2.76 million). The component focused
on critical activities with potential impact on municipal budget management and the likelihood
of completion before project closure, including support LG budget management and reporting
through training to municipal staff, provision of information technology (IT), support to the
National Directorate of Decentralization and support to updating the Financial Ratio Guidebook.
However, the following activities were dropped: (i) street addressing activities in all communes
of Conakry except Dixinn, Kaloum and Matam; (ii) improvement of fiscal registers in all
communes of Conakry except Dixinn, Kaloum and Matam; (iii) support to the National
Directorate of Taxes by defining roles and monitoring of tax collections; (iv) all activities related
to urban planning and management; and (v) study on intergovernmental transfers and shared
taxes. Although decentralization remained a stated reform agenda for Government, the reduction
of institutional strengthening activities reduced the potential for consolidating and expanding
gains in decentralization reforms (e.g. dropping the studies of intergovernmental transfers and
shared taxes).




                                                         5
17.    Component 4: Emergency Urban Labor-Intensive Public Works Program (US$ 2.5
million). The EULIWP was started in 2008 and implemented through the UDP3 Phase II (as an
Additional Financing) and was formally included under UDP3 Phase 2 as part of restructuring.
The component focused on road maintenance and drain clearing, as well as urban works
programs aimed at providing employment and income to households in the most affected areas
of Conakry.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
a. Soundness of the Background Analysis
18.     The project built on the achievements and lessons from the earlier Urban Development
Projects and the Bank’s prior engagement in Guinea’s urban sector. The experiences and lessons
from implementation of previous UDPs were comprehensively integrated into the project design,
in close consultation with stakeholders at national and local level. Based on UDP3 Phase I
experience gained in secondary cities, Phase II introduced the Municipal Contracts approach in
Conakry and its five municipalities. This lead to the formulation of the participatory Priority
Investment Program targeting basic infrastructure and the Municipal Adjustment Program
targeting municipal services and asset management (Box 2).

                      Box 2: The UDP3 Phase II Municipal Contract Approach
   The Municipal Contracts (MCs) were agreed upon after a highly participatory process during which
   municipal audits were carried out by local consultants under the supervision of the Project Coordination
   Unit (PCU). The process of data collection and validation of conclusions involved close consultation with
   mayors, members of city councils, private operators, stakeholder groups and neighborhood leaders. Two
   concurrent audits were carried out as part of this process: (a) the urban audit gathered baseline information
   on existing assets, service level and poverty levels which led to the identification of municipalities’ Priority
   Investment Programs (PIPs); and (b) the financial and organizational audit assessed the municipalities ’
   financial health, management structure, and capacity which led to the formulation of their Municipal
   Adjustment Programs (MAPs). In turn, MAPs supported: (i) improvement of municipal services
   management (organization, training, small equipment); (ii) improvement of municipal revenue mobilization
   and budget control; and (iii) municipal assets management. The project put a strong emphasis on the
   municipalities’ financial commitments in terms of assets maintenance (Annual Maintenance Programs
   (AMP) where MCs took into account an annual budgeted commitment of 3 percent of current municipal
   revenues for maintenance for the duration of the MC, beside the 10 percent counterpart funding to the PIP.
   Key indicators of progress toward the Project Development Objectives include: (a) improved provision of
   infrastructure and services in Conakry and selected secondary cities through: (i) increased Conakry SWM
   collection and secondary roads upgrading; (ii) increased secondary cities’ services delivery; and (b)
   improved municipal finance and organizational management support of the decentralization process
   through improved fiscal revenue identification and collection; and street addressing applications.

b. Assessment of the Project Design
19.    The project design took into account key lessons from earlier projects in relation to: (i)
design and management of municipal contracts; (ii) organization of principles for counterpart
funding: and (iii) public-private partnership in the delivery of services. Furthermore, the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) enabled financing of PCU operations as well as a number of studies -
including municipal audits - that helped identify key weaknesses in the municipalities. An MC
was signed with each of the beneficiary cities on the basis of results of the municipal audits,
supplemented with citizen and stakeholder input. The MC outlined the principles for support and
the procedures for mobilization of the necessary resources and essential urban management skills
                                                          6
to carry out their functions. The project maintained focus on municipal priority needs in two
areas: (i) expanding basic services in and improving accessibility of densely populated urban
neighborhoods; and (ii) building institutional capacity and sustainability through training,
mobilization of local resources, and delivery of municipal infrastructure basic office equipment,
such as buildings, tools, and equipment. The use of the APL instrument was appropriate and
logical to scale up the approach that was effectively implemented under Phase I.

20.      The overall PDO (focusing on service delivery and institutional improvements) was
consistent with the project components and proposed activities and outputs, and aligned with the
overall sector needs and priorities of the Government. The project design was balanced in terms
of infrastructure investments and institutional strengthening activities aiming at sustaining
outcomes. The design of the project aligned the PDO with the sector needs and the policy agenda.
The first and second components related to service delivery and implementation of municipal
contracts were complementary to the institutional strengthening activities under Component 3,
institutionalizing the measures needed to enhance the implementation of MCs through the
improvement of LG ability to deliver services, provide effective management and oversight, and
gradually increase their collection of own resources. The first and second project components (on
municipal contracts) followed a proven design where the PIP and MAP were linked in a
contractual agreement (counterpart fund payments were a prerequisite for PIPs and MAPs). The
approach was thus designed to incentivize LGs to improve tax collection and allocate funds for
investment and maintenance of their assets. The implementation arrangements were clear overall,
but also highly complex with the involvement of several stakeholders from different sectors at
national and local levels. 4 The overall project design was ambitious and complex, given the
multiplicity of stakeholders involved and the multi-sectoral set of interventions. Following
project restructuring, in the context of resource constraints and difficult environment for
implementation, the project design remained relevant and focused on delivering results as
described in the PDO, despite the omission of and changes to subcomponents (elimination of the
solid waste management subcomponent and scaled-down investment projects and institutional
strengthening activities).

c. Adequacy of Government’s Commitment
21.      The quality at entry risk for Governmental commitment was rated Substantial with the
residual risk rated Modest. GoG’s commitment to the project translated into swift measures to
facilitate project implementation in terms of components, stakeholder participation and the early
promotion of SMEs – these actions helped meet the project effectiveness date (December 10,
2007).

d.     Assessment of Risks
22.    The country level risk was rated High as project preparation was undertaken in a complex
country context. The project implementation overall risk was also rated High as a number of
issues were flagged during appraisal: (i) GoG commitment to the decentralization process (rated

4
 The project was implemented under the joint responsibility of the PCU and the central and decentralized administrations
operational units to allow interaction and mutual reinforcement, and included: the Solid Waste Transfer Public Unit (SPTD);
Primary Roads Unit (CVP); Secondary Roads Unit (CVS); and National Directorate for Taxes (DNI). Adherence to
implementation arrangements was the responsibility of the PCU which was also in charge of project monitoring, reporting,
auditing, and safeguarding. The PCU, which reported to the MTPUH, was al so in charge of the management of the credit’s
principal Special Account and the Additional Funds provided for the EULIWP.

                                                            7
Substantial) proved intermittent; (ii) capacity constraints of beneficiary LGs to effectively
implement their MAPs (rated Substantial) also proved to be accurate for a number of communes
and municipalities; (iii) delays in providing counterpart funding for project implementation
(rated High) were exacerbated by the overall context; (iv) delays in processing procurement
(rated High) effectively delayed project implementation; and (v) limited SME capacity to
deliver infrastructure services (rated Substantial) also proved appropriate. However, the rating
of governance as Modest appeared to have been under-estimated in project design. All control
risks were rated Modest except internal control and financial reporting that were rated Substantial.
Risk mitigation measures put in place proved to be effective in reducing most of the project risk that
could be addressed by the project team (e.g. compliance, reporting, safeguards and fiduciary
management), but were insufficient to address the wider country risks and lack of continuous
momentum with regards to the decentralization reform agenda.

23.       Based on the observations above, the ICR rates the quality at entry as Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation
24.      Project implementation was strongly affected by substantial changes in the country
context, in particular the coup d’état in late 2008 and the subsequent suspension of Bank
activities in Guinea. The UDP3 Phase II implementation went through four phases: (i) Project
effectiveness and initial implementation, (ii) Project suspension, (iii) Bank re-engagement and
Project Re-activation, and (iv) Project restructuring and final implementation (see Box 3 below,
and refer detailed descriptions in annex 3). The disruptions in implementation resulting from the
changes in the overall country environment negatively affected project implementation at all
levels, particularly with regard to effective movement and oversight of project implementation at
city level, institutional memory and sustainability, disbursement and procurement processes and
effective project coordination.5

                    Box 3: Phases of Implementation of UDP 3 – Phase 2 – 2007-2013
      Phase 1. Project Effectiveness (December 10, 2007) until Project Suspension (December 23, 2008). All
      legal covenants were met before project effectiveness on December 10, 2007. Implementation was affected
      early on by: (i) rising prices that affected the project procurement plan and had negative effects on
      municipal planned investments; and (ii) challenges related to the implementation of the solid waste
      management subcomponent (see Box 1). Yet, the 3 percent of the municipal budgets under the MAP was
      earmarked and project management was adequate as the PCU budget was approved and the implementation
      of PIPs and MAPs was moving forward. By the end of Phase 1, the project’s PDO and IP ratings were
      Satisfactory.

      Phase 2. Project Suspension where the PCU remained active (January, 2009 until January, 2011). Despite
      suspension of Bank operations in Guinea, the Bank team sustained dialogue with the PCU as project
      implementation and supervision were monitored through regular audio/video-conferences. A detailed
      implementation action plan was developed by the PCU on the basis of available resources at the beginning
      of project suspension, and was being used to monitor project activities and cover PCU operations. This
      enabled the project to keep moving, though available resources were insufficient to honor current
      commitments. While in Suspension, the project achieved the following: (i) all municipalities signed and
      paid their full contribution to their municipal contracts, illustrating their commitment despite the
      disbursements freeze; (ii) contractors signed works contracts related to building at least 60 classrooms,
      subject to resumption of disbursements, and bidding documents for major infrastructure construction in

5
 The Advisory Committee was unable to play an active role in supporting and facilitating the project as it lacked authoritative
guidance and supervision, leaving an institutional vacuum at the central level. This contributed to delays for key PCU decisions.

                                                                8
     secondary cities; and (iii) half the grant (US$ 1.25 million) under EULIWP was disbursed. In the absence
     of replenishments, residual funds were used to manage PCU operations but staff, whose contracts had
     already elapsed, continued working without pay, while consultants/contractors outstanding arrears reached
     US$ 1.18 million. By end of Phase 2, the PDO and IP ratings were Moderately Satisfactory.

     Phase 3. Bank Reengagement (January 2011)/Project Reactivation (February, 2011) before Project
     Restructuring (November, 2011). The Bank reengagement led to the prioritization of actions to put the
     UDP 3 Phase II back on track, including resolving outstanding commitments and arrears, renewing staff
     contracts and establishing a new office for the PCU. However, project implementation did not advance as
     fast as expected, and agreements with the GoG to strengthen the SWM component operations and
     supervision were not implemented (see Box 1). Furthermore, a lack of incentives at the local level resulted
     from institutional instability, as city council mandates (including the mayors) expired in 2010 and councils
     were replaced by nominees. In addition, the PCU faced challenges in project management, insufficient
     supervision of social and environmental safeguards requirements, and lack of close supervision and
     revision of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. By the end of phase 3, the PDO and IP
     ratings were Moderately Unsatisfactory.

     Phase 4. Project Restructuring in December 31, 2011 until project closing (June 30, 2013). Project
     restructuring took almost all of 2011 and accounted for a significant amount of work that distracted the
     PCU and unit teams from implementing activities. Yet, despite a relatively successful restructuring process,
     project implementation was again affected by: (i) hiring delays of a new Project Coordinator in early 2012;
     (ii) long procurement delays for high value contracts; (iii) delays in collecting indicators to inform the
     M&E; (iv) delays in hiring a supervision firm for all works planned in Conakry; and (v) GoG delays in
     signing the revised MC. By December 2012, the Bank and GoG decided on triggers to speed up the
     implementation process and set deadlines: (i) each LG was to clear its arrears in counterpart payment, in
     compliance with the MC requirements, by December 17, 2012; (ii) all high value contracts were to be
     signed by end 2012; and (iii) duration for implementation of any infrastructure works not to exceed a 5-
     month period. These triggers were met, with few exceptions (delays in planning resulted in dropping of
     reduction of scope of investments in two municipalities). As a result, key project activities took place in the
     last 6-8 months: LG staff training, IT equipment delivery, completion and handover of infrastructure
     projects, budget report delivery from the communes, and contract signing with private operations and
     management delegation of market and bus station.

25.      In general, the project ratings were Satisfactory (S) from effectiveness to May 2009 for
almost all indicators, mostly Moderately Satisfactory (MS) from May 2009 to May 2011, Moderately
Unsatisfactory (MU) before the restructuring, and mostly Moderately Satisfactory from May 2012 to
June 2013. After being rated mostly MU following the Bank reengagement, the PDO and
implementation progress were rated MU and MS respectively by project end 6 . The majority of
procedural performance areas were rated MS after project suspension and kept this rating at project
end, except for M&E. The three original components were rated MS except for the Institutional
Strengthening. Moreover, the EULIWP component was rated Satisfactory by project end (see Annex
3 for details).

26.      The thorough efforts to speed up project implementation to ensure completion of all
activities were successful in increasing disbursement and number of completed project outputs 7.
However, despite the efforts, the total disbursement (Bank and the government counterpart fund
disbursements) at project closing was below the appraisal target resulting in 87.3 percent for the

6
  It is important to note that no data was available for two of the four PDO indicators at the time of the last ISR – this data was
only made available in October 2013 as part of preparation of the ICR. That is one of the main contributing factors to the PDO
rating of MU for the last ISR.
7
  By June 30, 2013, 87.8% of IDA project funds were committed while 99.9% of the EULIWP funds were disbursed (Table A3.3
in annex 1).

                                                                 9
entire project with 89.6 percent for the Bank (IDA grant and IDA additional funds) and 73.5
percent for GoG.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization
27.      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design: Arrangements for program M&E was the
responsibility of the PCU. These were outlined in the PCU Project Administrative, Financial and
Accounting Manual – including description of monitoring tools developed under Phase I. As part
of managing M&E, the PCU continued its coordination with: (i) The Directorate of Urban
Planning and Infrastructure (DUIUR) to carry out in-house road technical studies through
support from the project to the Primary Roads Unit (CVP); (ii) The National Directorate for
Taxes (DNI), to continue working closely on the street addressing program and the local taxation
activities; (iii) the Secondary Roads Unit (CVS) to work on the selection and rehabilitation of
secondary roads/drainage networks under the neighborhood-upgrading component; (iii) the
SPTD, until November 2011, in charge of the management of waste transfer from grouping
points and management of la Minière landfill; (iv) municipalities for their MC execution; and (v)
Environmental Focal Points appointed at the CVP, CVS, SPTD and Technical Municipal
Departments for environmental and social management.

28.     Implementation and Utilization: Overall, M&E management was moderately satisfactory.
To the extent possible in the difficult environment of reduced security and high risk, the PCU
carried out regular monitoring and evaluation throughout project implementation. The MCs were
reviewed on an annual basis, and amended after the project restructuring, while completion of the
PIP’s physical component depended on the performance of the MAP. Until the coup d’état, the GoG
provided the Bank with quarterly progress monitoring reports, quarterly financial management
reports, annual information about progress on key sector performance indicators, audited annual
financial statements and such other information as the Bank required. During project suspension,
reporting was made in the form of a table capturing the achievements in implementing the action
plan agreed upon over the suspension period. Formal reporting was reinstated after the Bank
reengagement. Despite these achievements, the M&E management function did not substantially
improve, in particular with regards to timely collection and consolidation of required data to
assess achievements in implementation of assets maintenance programs. During ICR preparation,
additional efforts were made to ensure that adequate data was made available to ensure that the
necessary documentation was available for verification of the targets achieved.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
29.     Environmental and Social Safeguards: The project was rated “B” at appraisal and
triggered OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement due to the
planned construction and rehabilitation activities. Due to the fact that the actual sites and potential
localized negative impacts of future investments could not be identified prior to appraisal, GoG
prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) to ensure that the proposed project properly addresses potential adverse
environmental and social impacts. The ESMF and RPF were discussed at consultations and
disclosed in-country and in Infoshop on December 29, 2006. Due to capacity gaps with the PCU
and Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests (MEEF), a consultant was hired to assist in
establishing RAPs to assess and implement any compensation measures, as appropriate, before
any commencement of the expected works. Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) needed to be

                                                  10
prepared on the last tranche of the 1.7 kilometer road rehabilitation to comply with Bank's
safeguards requirements. The prepared RAP was compliant with Bank safeguards policies; the
document was certified by the MEEF by end 2012, and the affected households were resettled
and compensated. However, the process of completing the involuntary resettlement in relation to
roads works substantially delayed the delivery of the delivery. Some delays were noted with
regard to land acquisition in the secondary cities, but all issues were resolved as part of
preparation of each sub project. The rating of safeguards was Satisfactory before project
suspension, Moderately Unsatisfactory during Bank reengagement, and mostly Moderately
Satisfactory after project restructuring until the end of the project.

30.    Financial Management: Overall, the project had an adequate financial management
system that generally provided, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information that
funds were being used for intended purposes. The PCU was responsible for FM for all components,
and budgets, quarterly IFRs, annual financial statements and progress reports in compliance with
Bank guidelines. The PCU also monitored disbursements during the two year suspension and
even after PCU staff contracts had elapsed. The PCU was evaluated by the Bank fiduciary team
throughout Phase II implementation and found FM arrangements to be Satisfactory before
project suspension and Moderately Satisfactory from November 2009 until the project end
(downgrading a result of country circumstances).

31.     Procurement: The PCU coordinated all project-financed procurement and ensured that
all IDA-financed works, goods and services were procured in full compliance with Bank
Procurement and Consultants Guidelines, and in conformity with approved procurement plans.
The PCU prepared the procurement documentation that was issued for works, goods and services
contracts, in close collaboration and consultation with relevant GoG technical departments.
Procurement training was provided to the project team and government staff involved in project
implementation by Bank procurement specialists. Yet, these capacity-building efforts were not
fully successful in enhancing timely management of procurement as evidenced in the delays
observed. Procurement was affected by delays in evaluation and contracting, mainly due to the
insufficient contract management (financial and technical performance) of contracted companies.
Also, cost overruns led to canceling some bids that were above the financial ceiling. Overall, the
procurement plan during project implementation involved 60 contracts with 28 works (47
percent of the budget), 11 goods (18 percent of the budget) and 21 consultants (35 percent of
budget). Procured contracts resulted in important income generating activities for the urban
economy including for local/regional SMEs and NGOs. Procurement was rated Satisfactory
before project suspension, downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory by May 2010 and rated
Moderately Satisfactory from Bank reengagement onward until project end.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
32.     Sustainability of assets is expected to be Moderately Satisfactory – despite the difficult country
context. A large share of infrastructure projects under the PIPs was only completed in the last 6-8
months of the project (see Annex 2). Operations and maintenance arrangements in all cities were
budgeted and still ongoing at project closure in mid-2013, public services were improved and
stakeholders benefited from improvements to basic infrastructure. No formal arrangements have
been put in place with regard to project post-completion operations and preparation of a new
project, but it is expected that LGs will continue to provide financing for maintenance and

                                                   11
management of infrastructure delivered and that GoG will continue to pursue the existing
decentralization agenda (see also section 4).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
33.       The relevance of project objectives, design and implementation remained substantial both before
and after the restructuring and at project completion. The project's design reflected the priorities of the
GoG and the Bank (as outlined in the CAS 2003-2006) and focused on the need to undertake more
investments in basic urban services while linking them closely to institutional development at national and
local government level. The re-activation of the project in 2011 confirmed the substantial relevance of the
project in the post-crisis environment, and the project was fully aligned with the Guinea Interim Strategy
Note for FY11-12 - in particular the focus on (i) involvement of civil society and citizens in planning and
decision making, and (ii) creation of jobs and expanding service delivery as central to rebuilding citizens’
confidence. The MCs based on PIPs and MAPs were designed on the basis of input from involved
citizens, LGs, NGOs and stakeholders in setting transparent priorities about service delivery while
involving SMEs, NGOs, and communities in implementation. The project supported the provision of
critical basic infrastructure services, employment creation and poverty reduction.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

34.      The Project Development Objective was to improve the provision of infrastructure and services
in Conakry and secondary cities and to improve the financial and organizational management of
municipalities in support of the decentralization process. Overall, achievement of the PDO is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. This overall rating is based on the split evaluation (Table A2.3 in annex 2) and
a weighted rating of the results for the two sets of PDO indicators before project restructuring in 2011
and at project end.8 Before project restructuring9, two of three PDO indicators were met with higher
targets than anticipated, while one indicator was not met, five of nine intermediate indicators were met,
and the overall rating was Moderately Unsatisfactory. At project closing, all four new PDO indicators
had been achieved, with two indicators reaching higher-than-anticipated targets10. In total, six of seven
PDO indicators were met. 9 intermediate indicators (post restructuring) were fully met (of these, 3
indicators recorded higher than expected results), and 7 indicators were partially met (Annex 2
and Table A2.3), mainly due to the change of scope in activities. It is important to note that at
the time of the last Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR), no data was available for
two of PDO indicators; these results and the corresponding data sets were consolidated and
provided to the Bank as part of the preparation of the ICR.

35.      With regard to the provision of infrastructure and services in Conakry and secondary
cities, the project was successful in achieving and even exceeding the project targets, despite the
extremely difficult implementation circumstances. The exception was the solid waste
management component which did not meet targets and was dropped. At project end, a total of
8
  Although the PDO was not revised, the PDO indicators were completely revised at restructuring – thus affecting the PDO.
9
  At project restructuring, the three original PDO indicators were dropped and replaced with 3 new indicators.
10
   Access to urban services and social services to 318,843 people (128% of target) of which 52% women (102% of target);
110,000 people having access to all-season road access (101%); 5 LGs established a management system (100%) and 8 LGs
generated reports on time (100%).

                                                             12
32 community infrastructure projects across the 15 LGS at a total value of approximately 65
billion GNF (approximately US$ 9.2m, averaging US$ 285,000 per project) and reaching
318,000 direct beneficiaries 11 (128 percent of target) and an estimated 625,000 indirect
beneficiaries. Projects included among others (i) schools and class rooms (14 projects), (ii)
secondary road infrastructure (6 projects), and (iii) commercial facilities (markets and bus
stations). The successful delivery of these projects resulted in the following key improvements in
Conakry and the ten secondary cities: (i) improved access and mobility and increased economic
activities in urban centers, including in poor neighborhoods, (ii) increased access to services
(health center, class rooms, water points and toilets in schools), (iii) strengthening of LG
operational capacity (construction and rehabilitation of three LG headquarters); (iv) creation of
temporary labor-based jobs, (v) increased land values, (vi) improved protection against flooding
and improved environmental livelihoods, and (vii) improved connectivity between secondary
cities and their hinterland and other cities. Main limitations in the achievement of targets were
related to: (i) the lack of achievement of targets related to solid waste management
improvements before restructuring, and (ii) cancellation of PIP activities for two cities due to the
failure to meet contracting process deadlines at the end of 2012, thereby reducing the investment
impact and the number of project beneficiaries (market places, water points, people with access
to water).

36.     The project was successful in improving the financial and organizational management of
municipalities in support of the decentralization process. The successful implementation was
reflected in the achievement of the key PDO indicators: (i) eight LGs generated budget reports
and submitted them on time (100 percent of target), and (ii) five LGs established effective
management systems to operate commercial infrastructure (although only three LGs have signed
agreements).12 In addition, intermediate indictors were also largely met: (i) LGs institutionalized
the principle of implementing priority maintenance programs and providing adequate resources
for routine maintenance (achieved with more than 100 percent of target in both Conakry and
secondary cities); (ii) street addressing activities were completed in Conakry; (iii) fiscal registers
were put in place and used, resulting in improved revenue management; and (iv) targets for
increased revenue collection (the original PDO indicators on institutional development were met
before restructuring). The main limitations with regard to achievement of PDO targets related to
(i) the late completion of activities for the two restructured PDO indicators, which may cause
concern about sustainability of outcomes, (ii) the unavailability of precise and specific revenue
indicators and the uncertainty about attribution of targets to the project activities13, and (ii) the
elimination of broader reform activities (e.g., studies on intergovernmental fiscal transfers) from

11
   This corresponds to approximately 11% of the population of the 15 LGs (Conakry and 10 secondary cities). The 106,000
benefiting from the EULIWP corresponds to approximately 7% of the population of Conakry. If adding the 625,000 indirect
beneficiaries, the total share of the population benefiting from EULIWP is approximately 44% of the population of Conakry
(2005 figures – most recent).
12
   However, it is important to note that due to the delays in implementation caused by the disruption in engagement and the
changes as part of restructuring, these indicators were only achieved in the last six months of the project. The training was
completed in early 2013 and reports were generated subsequently. Contracts for infrastructure management were only signed at
the beginning of 2013 and implementation started subsequently. It is therefore pertinent that these results are sustained in the
post-completion phase to secure the institutional gains made. The remaining two LGs are expected to complete their agreements
for infrastructure improvements within the next three months.
13
   At restructuring, the PDO indicators for institutional improvements at LG level (e.g. revenue collection were met), but several
of the intermediate indicators were not, and the project restructuring paper noted that the increase in revenues and tax rolls “could
not be fully attributed to project interventions (due to the project freeze). It was therefore decided to focus on another set of
institutional indicators.

                                                                 13
the project combined with the absence of clear GoG direction on implementation of the 2006 LG
Act. These limitations have somewhat diminished project impact on advancing decentralization
reforms.

37.   Based on the analysis above, the ICR rates the overall achievement of the PDO as
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
38.     An ex-post economic analysis was performed for Phase II over the lifetime of the project.
No ex-ante economic analysis was completed. It is assumed that the benefits will accrue beyond
project end and that all assets will be properly operated and maintained in the future. The
economic analysis covered the entire project as considered in the Restructuring Paper and a very
conservative stance was adopted for the analysis as some data could not be quantified without a
survey. Two types of benefits were considered where investments were effective, efficient and in
most areas equitable (at least 1/3 of the beneficiaries were poor): (i) Health-related benefits
included 5,800 people with improved access to water and 6,640 with improved access to
sanitation with possible overlap between these groups (main beneficiaries were students in
schools); and (ii) Benefits associated with improved urban mobility: All-season roads improved
urban mobility (daily vehicle counting increased in project areas) and contributed to a reduction
in commuting time, increased commercial activities, reduced vulnerability of communities to
flooding, reduced transportation costs to poor areas in Conakry’s five municipalities, and
improvement in access to services.

39.     These achievements had a direct impact on at least 216,000 beneficiaries where these
improvements were captured through two ways: (a) increased land value (hedonic pricing
method with 43 percent increase in land prices against a revealed impact that already suggested a
four-fold increase in certain areas); and (b) the increased economic and social (education, etc.)
productivity as a result of improved mobility and reduced risks of flooding; these communities
were assumed to be disrupted approximately 10 days per year on average before the project14.

40.     The project is economically viable with a net present value discounted at 10 percent over
only 6 years reaching US$ 1.5 million with a 23 percent economic rate of return and a 1.1
benefit/cost ratio (Annex 4). Based on the findings above, it is concluded that the project
achieved a positive economic result and that efficiency is Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
41.     The overall project outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The project remains
substantially relevant in the context of the overall urban development and decentralization
reforms in Guinea, and the priorities of the Government and the Bank. Project efficacy was
moderately satisfactory, and the project was completed at a satisfactory level of efficiency with a
positive economic result. The fragile and unstable country context caused major disruptions of
continuity in dialogue and project management, and substantially reduced the scope of work as a
result of increased costs and inflation. Nevertheless, the project achieved the overall PDO due to

14
  Moreover, the GoG ICR included the Faranah market economic analysis that is profitable under three scenarios: 2 nd hall and
20 private stores with an ERR of 72 percent; 2nd hall with an ERR of 46 percent; and neither additional hall nor stores with an
ERR of 41 percent (Annex 6).

                                                               14
timely and poignant interventions and an effective restructuring process, dropping activities that
were not advancing, revising the results framework and focusing on key outcomes that could be
achieved within the remaining implementation period. Two of three PDO indicators were
achieved before restructuring, and four of four were achieved after restructuring. Twelve of 21
intermediate indicators were fully met, and five were partially met. Notwithstanding the late
completion of key project activities and the incomplete disbursement of project funds, the project
was effective in achieving key results on the ground: (i) the delivery of basic urban infrastructure
services and (ii) the improvement of LG capacity.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
42.      The UDP3 Phase II achievements directly benefited about 11 percent of the total
population of the five municipalities of Conakry and the 10 secondary cities’ communes.
Improved access to urban services and social services benefited 318,343 people directly and
625,000 people indirectly (Table A3.4, annex 3). No specific assessments were completed to
assess the poverty effects of the individual project interventions. However, based on existing
national poverty data, however, at least one third of the beneficiary population in the targeted 15
LGs, (about 106,000 people) are urban poor; it is possible that an equal or even greater share of
the women beneficiaries are poor. Estimates based on fieldwork in each of the LGs indicate that
in Conakry, the construction of 7.7 kilometers of urban roads and the rehabilitation of 71
kilometers of roads and drainages in poor areas resulted in the following benefits: (i) reducing
vulnerability to flooding (2,030 people prevented from being affected by floods in certain areas);
(ii) increase in the number of local shops and street kiosks by 400 percent; (iii) contributing to an
increase in land value by 400 percent; (iv) increase in access of vehicles to trunk roads by 40
times per day; (v) enabling the establishment of public transport routes to areas with limited
access; (vi) reducing transport costs by 90 percent, and (vii) increasing general access to services
(school, health, markets, etc.) and improving security.

43.    In the 10 secondary cities’, access to water and improved sanitation indirectly benefited
the poor living in school neighborhoods. Building markets and bus stations helped to improve
urban mobility and economic activities, and the rural-urban space interface as demonstrated by
the economic analysis conducted by the borrower (Annex 6). A total of 12 school facilities, with
a capacity of about 4,050 additional students, were built or expanded and equipped for the
benefit of poor neighborhoods in secondary city communes. Moreover, the labor-intensive
program component provided temporary jobs for 6,000 poor youth.15

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
44. The project contributed to building LG capacity for financial management as well as overall
management, planning and delivery, through institutional strengthening activities (Component 3)
and the expansion and consolidation of the MC approach in all 15 LGs. This is evidenced by the
achievement of outputs and indicators related to financial reporting and in the overall
management of community infrastructure projects. The project also made contributions to

15
  Specifically, the EULIWP helped targeted poor neighborhoods use labor-based technology; involved the locally-based
workforce beneficiary areas with supervision delegated to heads of districts; and provided wok for local businesses associated
with quality monitoring tools and procedures for implementation.

                                                               15
strengthening local and national institutions involved in urban service delivery. The project
provided training to central government agencies (such as DNI), all municipalities and
communes, and stakeholders. Moreover, the PIPs built or rehabilitated a number of town halls
and MAPs provided furniture and IT equipment. Specifically, the project contributed to the
following results: (a) scaling up new knowledge, tools and methods of operation that were
subsequently appropriated and successfully put into practice by the institutional players in the
municipal sector, especially in three municipalities of Conakry (e.g. in the area of tax collection);
(b) improving the technical capacity of major institutional actors in urban management through
extensive training and provision of computers; (c) contributing to strengthening the capacity of
LGs through support in the formulation and implementation of the PIPs, MAPs and AMPs; and
(d) confirming that institutional ownership of the project and the MCs was strong among national
and LG stakeholders, as evidenced by the mobilization of counterpart funds at national and LG
levels.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
45. No detailed beneficiary survey was done for all investments, but a survey was completed for
the EULIWP at the end of project activities, involving 138 beneficiaries, selected
representatively. The findings of the survey confirmed the impact noted during supervision
missions and in Government reporting, i.e. (i) almost 35 percent were unemployed before project
intervention, and another 55 percent students or youth with part time jobs (ii) 90 percent were
men and 80 percent were working in their own neighborhood, (iii) 57 percent of respondents
have no income other than what was obtained under the program, (iv) 76 percent confirmed that
they were more capable of finding work after the completion of the project activities. The survey
also confirmed the positive response from local authorities and SMEs to the program, and
appreciation of the clear and transparent process for selection, payment, and processing. Finally,
the survey noted the positive results from the improved drainage systems, as observed in the
reduction of cases cholera, malaria, and traffic accidents, and increased economic activities and
improved security.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
Rating: High

46.      The risks to maintaining the development outcomes as well as the risks to the overall
institutional framework for decentralized service delivery are High. While the project has been
strongly supported by the Government and LGs, 16 (e.g. as evidenced in the provision of
counterpart funding), structural and financial uncertainties pose a risk to development outcomes.
The overall perspectives for continued consolidation of decentralization is uncertain (the 2006
LG Act remains largely unimplemented) and the institutional framework for enhancing urban
development is still not fully consolidated17. While several achievements have been made under
the project, uncertainty with regard to secured funding of LGs (in particular capital funding) – in

16
   The MCs were endorsed by successive LGs and the LGs have made great efforts to provide counterpart funds, and support to
routine maintenance of assets to fulfill their obligations under the project. Similarly, LGs and Government have made efforts to
complete projects on time in a very short timeframe as part of the last 12 months of implementation.
17
   For instance, the system of SWM implemented under UDP3 phase I of the project had contributed to the improvement of the
quality of life of people in Conakry. However, the SWM system faced institutional incoherence and inefficiencies as the GoG
opted for the privatization of the service. Yet, SMEs collection and SPTD were still operating in parallel by the end of the project
despite the full but still ineffective privatization of the sector.

                                                                16
the absence of new Bank project – increases the risk to development outcomes. Furthermore, it is
not clear if the MC approach will be consolidated and applied following the end of the project.
These risks are all closely related to the continuation of dialogue with the Government and could
be addressed through follow-up efforts to identify new areas of collaboration. With regard to
project-specific risks, the consolidation of capacity at the LG level has somewhat reduced risk
for deterioration in outcomes, both on service delivery and institutional side, and has resulted in
tangible and specific benefits through provision of concrete infrastructure and strengthening of
capacity. However, without clarification of the underlying structural issues with regard to
financing and coordination of decentralization and urban services, the risk to development
outcomes remains high.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry – Satisfactory
47.     The Bank started preparing UDP3 Phase II while UDP3 Phase I was still under
implementation, ensuring an effective transition to the next phase of the APL. The project design
was informed by lessons and experiences under the previous phases of UDP and benefited from
close dialogue and interaction with the Central Government and with all LGs. The PPF ensured
that key studies and urban audits were completed in time to inform the participatory PIPs and the
MAPs. Overall, the analytical foundations of the project were well prepared, strategically
relevant, and consistent with Government policies and priorities. The risks and mitigation
measures were assessed and relevant mitigation measures were identified, although it is clear that
country context risks were more significant than envisaged. The choice of APL as the preferred
instrument was logical and justified in the context of the medium- and long-term reform agenda,
although the project design did not clearly identify a phasing out strategy or a plan for
continuous commitment.

(b) Quality of Supervision – Satisfactory
48.     The Bank’s performance during supervision is rated Satisfactory. The Bank supervision
team completed ten implementation support missions and each mission included substantial field
visits and direct interface with LG officials. Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated
and the project was adequately supervised and monitored, including in the difficult period during
project suspension where the Bank team made efforts to ensure effective communication and
follow up with the PCU through effective use of telecommunication tools. Project supervision
was strengthened by systematic collaboration among the Bank, PCU and implementing agencies’
project teams. Implementation challenges included procurement (due to cost overrun), lack of
safeguards and M&E skills, but these were addressed in a timely manner, enabling project
implementation. Submission of progress reports and safeguards compliance reports ensured that
supervision provided both parties with indicators to track progress and take corrective actions
when needed. No Mid-Term Review was carried out for the project because project restructuring
replaced the MTR. After reengagement, the Bank team had flagged issues relating to the low
disbursement level and the risk of not attaining the PDO, which led to the project restructuring in
conjunction with GoG. The Bank team also followed up closely with GoG to secure mobilization

                                                17
of counterpart funds as crucial for ensuring PIP investments, as well as on adequate support and
maintenance of their assets.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance – Satisfactory
49.      Despite the mixed ratings during the course of implementation, the combination of
thorough project preparation and diligent and timely follow-up in a difficult country context
justifies a rating of Satisfactory. This is particularly relevant since the Bank team supported the
Government and the PCU through the suspension period, addressed upcoming challenges with
necessary flexibility, contributed to turning around a project that was facing several difficulties
and brought it to conclusion with substantial and tangible results.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance – Moderately Satisfactory
50.     The overall Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. While the
Government overall demonstrated its commitment to the key reforms through regular allocation
and disbursement of counterpart funding (Annex 3, Table A3.3) (even to the extent of assisting
LGs that could not provide counterpart funding) and resolution of key issues, the following
factors justifies the overall rating: (i) the overall institutional and organizational disruptions
caused by the changes associated with the coup d’état, with significant impact the project,
including on signing of MCs, procurement, and the regular payment of counterpart funds, (ii) the
reversal and change of priorities in solid waste management leading to elimination of the sub
component from the project, (iii) the delays in re-entering into substantial operational
collaboration with the Bank after the re-engagement in early 2011 (despite the strong interest
from LGs to sign revised MCs and re-start activities), thus delaying project implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance – Moderately Satisfactory

Project Coordination Unit – Satisfactory
51.     The Implementing Agency (PCU) is rated Satisfactory. Despite shortcomings and delays
with regards to procurement and M&E management contributing to bunching of activities in the
last 12 months of the project, the PCU was able to overcome substantial challenges resulting
from the overall country context (including overcoming particular challenges of staff and budget
management during the period of suspension) and effectively oversee the overall management of
the project. Within a short final implementation period, the PCU ensured that the majority of
planned activities were completed at the end of the project, including the completion of works,
participation in training activities, and active follow-up to complete key activities related to
project results and consolidation if missing M&E data. The PCU and the operational units
together secured project implementation with the help of various specific and relevant tools
including the Project Implementation Manual, Administrative, Financial and Accounting Manual,
software and financial accounting, and MCs. This was a highly commendable achievement in an
extremely difficult environment, including with a period of two years of project suspension.

Central Government Agencies – Moderately Satisfactory
52.   The MTPUH was fully committed to the project during preparation, appraisal and
implementation until project suspension at the end of 2008 although the undermining of the

                                                18
SWM subcomponent had already started: reductions of SPTD operation funding and withdraw
of the SME guarantee fund. After delays follwoing project re-activation, the MTPUH fulfilled its
obligations after project restructuring as the ministry decided to accelerate the pace of
implementation and remove institutional barriers as staffs were dispatched to supervise the
implementation of works. The MISN followed the same commitment path as MTPUH as it
delayed the endorsement of the revised MCs after project restructuring.

Agencies’ Operational Units – Moderately Satisfactory
53.      The agencies’ operational units worked with the PCU and the LGs, however, their
performance was unequal: whereas the CVP, the CVS, and DNI played an active role in
facilitating the implementation most components of the project, the SPTD performance was not
consistent and this also contributed to the cancellation of the SWM subcomponent.

Local Governments – Moderately Satisfactory
54.     Despite significant capacity gaps, LGs were overall supportive and effective in ensuring
implementation of the project, PIPs, MAPs of the MCs, including signing and implementation of
MCs, financial reporting, provision of counterpart funds, supervision of activities, and
communication with the PCU. Through the communal councils as well as financial services,
technical services at LG level and operational units (SPTD until restructuring and CVS), the 10
LGs of the secondary cities and five Conakry municipalities assumed increasing responsibilities
for implementation related to the MCs’ PIP, MAP and AMPs. In addition, municipalities have
(except in two cases) fulfilled the necessary counterpart funding to ensure investments, and
implemented the AMPs for 2012 and 2013. LGs were also effective in advancing key activities
related to institutional performance, e.g. improved budget reporting and drawing up contracts to
manage infrastructure.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance – Moderately Satisfactory
55.     In spite of the difficult situation during project implementation, the GoG, including the
agencies’ operational units, the Governorate of Conakry, municipalities, communes and PCU
remained committed to the project approach and deployed all the necessary efforts during the last
six months to bring the project to a successful close. Institutionally, all communes and
municipalities as well as agencies involved in the implementation of the project benefited from
its capacity building, construction and equipment, and reciprocated by increasing their
commitment to the project. Moreover, LGs’ efforts to increase implementation funds allocated to
the PIPs, MAPs and AMPs were instrumental in successfully ending the project.
Notwithstanding this, the combination of delays in implementation, changes in approach and
strategy in solid waste management, allocation of counterpart funds, and delays in execution of
works affected the overall achievements of the project and contributed to a very compressed
period of implementation during the last six to eight months of the project. The overall borrower
performance is therefore rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
56.    Complex and high risk projects with multi-stakeholder involvement require an effective
advisory body with substantive influence to facilitate effective strategic support and guidance.
The lack of an effective Advisory Committee resulted in insufficient coordination and strategic



                                               19
direction of the project, in particular during the most difficult phases of transition (e.g. before
and after Bank re-engagement).

57.     In a fragile state environment, project flexibility and constant and careful implementation
oversight is required to ensure necessary adjustments and address implementation bottlenecks.
The detailed project oversight and the strong efforts to speed up implementation towards the last
two years proved effective in adjusting the project, its activities and results framework and
putting implementation back on track. It also allowed the Bank to flexibly integrate the EULIWP
without major difficulties.

58.     Mitigating the effects of inflation on project activities by including sufficient
contingencies in allocations reduces disruptions and distortions in project implementation. The
Guinea Franc depreciation affected project implementation as the erosion of the Guinea Franc
purchasing parity affected both SMEs and stakeholders involved in labor-intensive works as well
as project implementation due to costs overruns in existing contracts. The exchange risk is
particularly strong in a fragile state environment and needs to be integrated as part of contract
management and implementation by use of clauses that can mitigate the impact of increases in
local prices – one way of doing this is to convert the amounts committed into $US values and
introduce a mechanism for payment to contractors in case of rapid inflation.

59.     Sustaining and deepening reforms at national and local levels in a fragile state context
requires substantive and constant engagement and identification of a clear reform proponent.
While the project aimed at deepening decentralization reforms through use of technical support
at national and local levels, the combination of the disruptions in the institutional and political
context, the substantial scaling down of activities and the lack of a clear reform target
contributed to limited progress with regards to overall national reforms for urban development
and decentralization, rendering the reform agenda largely open and unresolved at project closure.

60.     Investments (time and resources) in participatory planning and budgeting may contribute
effectively to strong ownership and engagement. The comprehensive investment in thorough
preparation of municipal audits combined with the utilization of experiences under UDP3 Phase
1 resulted in the creation of a strong cadre of leaders and citizens at municipal and neighborhood
levels that - despite the institutional disruption resulting from the national crisis – was effective
in supporting the planning, implementation and supervision of investment projects.

61.      Long term Bank engagements over time in fragile states can create sustainable sector
improvements, but require flexibility, adjustment and continuous engagement. The Bank
involvement in the urban sector in Guinea since 1985 has resulted in tangible infrastructure and
institutional improvements in cities, but the drastic changes in context over time has required a
flexible and adaptive approach to accommodate changes in the political context and to avoid
sudden setbacks in sub sectors (e.g. in SWM) and may require forging long term partnerships
with other development partners and with the private sector.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower
62.    Sustainability of program and project investments. The UDP3 Phase II brought
innovative tools and procedures to urban management, and helped to strengthen the institutional

                                                 20
capacity of stakeholders in both the public and private sectors. The SWM system implemented
under UDP Phase I improved living conditions for people in Conakry, but the combination of
changes in Government policy and competing parallel initiatives led to institutional inefficiency
and contributed to deterioration in achievements. SMEs responsible for waste collection and
SPTD are still operational despite the full privatization of the sector. The MCs were supported by
LG authorities, and LGs demonstrated strong ownership to the PIPs, AMPs and MAPs as
evidenced in the provision of counterpart funds. Similarly, citizen involvement in the municipal
audits and participatory planning leading to the PIPs was also an indication of the strong
ownership. The lack of completion of the PIPs of Mamou and Nzérékoré, while fully justified
since the agreed deadlines were not met, caused frustration at LG level, thus demonstrating the
strong degree of demand. AMPs are an effective tool for strengthening and sustaining the assets
of the communes and municipalities. In order to ensure sustainability of the PIP and AMP
approach, it will important to formalize its inclusion in the budget of the communes and

63.     Lessons for future projects. Future operations initiated in this context could capitalize
on the following lessons:
    (a) The time required for project implementation should not be determined by the level of
        funding, but rather by the conditions and institutional dynamics of implementation. In
        the case of UDP3, Phases I and II both included a participatory implementation
        framework. While this fostered ownership of project activities by stakeholders and
        beneficiaries, it took more time than initially estimated. Accordingly, any future
        operation initiated within this framework should account for these considerations.
    (b) The implementation of a multi-tier project such as UDP3 largely confirmed the need for
        an advisory and supervisory body with a clearly defined role, to ensure operational
        effectiveness and implementation, and to support and strengthen the decentralization
        process;
    (c) Large urban centers should be a priority investment sector in Guinea. The magnitude of
        the cities’ needs is substantial and must be met with significantly increased investment in
        comprehensive urban solutions. Small solutions will not suffice, as they can foster a
        climate of unrest that can lead to a rejection of investments. It would be necessary to this
        effect to create at the national level, and in consultation with development partners, the
        conditions for improving the level of investment in the urban sector, e.g., by considering
        it a priority sector.
    (d) Procurement is critical for effective project implementation. Streamlining contract tender,
        award and execution process and effective management in an inflationary economic
        environment poses a significant challenge.
    (e) As part of future operations, the PIP should include the core urban infrastructure (roads,
        solid waste management, and sanitation) as much as possible, without giving up
        improvement of basic services (schools, class rooms, water points). In addition, more
        attention must be paid to the management of environmental impacts, including further
        developing and integrating the project environmental assessment tools;
    (f) In expanding coverage and strengthening sustainability to urban service delivery, options
        for public private partnerships should be explored and further developed as per the
        examples with urban infrastructure management under this project.

         It should be noted that certain actions previously listed under PIP city contracts were not implemented. This was not due to the overestimation as was the case under Phase I, but
         because of time constraints due to the closing date of the project on June 30, 2013. These include, in Nzérékoré and Mamou central markets for an estimated cost of US$ 935,124,
         training management and municipal development for staff of 15 LGs for US$ 140,000, for a total uncommitted amount of US$ 1,075,124, equivalent to a total of GNF 7 381
         billion.
         All 15 municipalities and communes targeted by the project have signed and executed their MCs and key areas of intervention were as follows: education, health, roads, municipal
         facilities (town hall, youth and health), commercial equipment (market, bus station). A total of GNF 65,261,360,000 was spent to build 32 community infrastructure and basic
         facilities. School and secondary road infrastructure ranked first in terms of quantity (14 and 6 projects, respectively), and in terms of cost GNF 17 billion and GNF 24 billion.
         Commercial facilities (markets and bus stations) ranked second with six facilities totaling an amount of about GNF 13 billion. The five communes of Conakry including Kaloum,
         Dixinn, Matam, Matoto and Ratoma were the major beneficiaries of the project intervention with 58 percent of the cost of infrastructure construction and which was due to the
         magnitude of the works. Indeed, these municipalities of Conakry benefited from two tranches of road works during Phase II that improved the living conditions of the beneficiaries.

 Component 1: Conakry MC was signed on November 26, 2008 based on the PIP and MAP agreed in consultation with the municipalities and stakeholders
 PIP achievements               The following actions were fully performed under the PIP: (i) 7.7 km of road rehabilitation was achieved targeting
                                110,000 beneficiaries (ii) the extension and renovation of the Kaloum Town Hall; (iii) the renovation of the Dixinn
                                Town Hall; (iv) the construction of 12 classrooms in Coléah, Bonfi and Matam; (v) the construction of a Health
                                center in Kaporo and a Youth center in Koloma; (vi) the renovation and completion of Matoto Town Hall and its
                                annexes. Due to the lack of financial resources, five sub-projects were removed from the PIP, in the municipalities
                                of Dixinn (6 classrooms), Ratoma (6 classrooms in Nongo and 6 classrooms in Lambanyi) and Matoto (6
                                classrooms in Dabompa and a sport field in Yimbaya).
 Roads rehabilitated, non-rural 81.000 people living in the Matam, Matoto and Ratoma municipalities had improved road access due to                 Km       16                                7.6            7.7
                                rehabilitation of 5.6 km although the work absorbed almost all of the financial resources of the component before
                                project suspension. Under project restructuring, an additional 1.8 km of roads were rehabilitated (Dar Es Salam 1
                                and 2, Carrière, Hamdallaye 1, Matoto Khabitaya, Yimbaya and Hafia 2 areas) for a total of 7.7 km, exceeding the
                                target (110% of target). The population displaced by the road sub-projects, particularly in the municipalities of
                                Dixinn and Matoto, have been compensated and resettled.
  MAP achievements              The following actions were fully performed under the MAP: street addressing and investigation for tax purposes in
                                the municipalities of Kaloum, Dixinn and Matam; specific training programs in computer science and local finance,
                                supplies of furniture and office equipment (computers and copiers, etc.) to the Town Halls in 5 Conakry

   registers in place and in use          software were approved by the Bank; (ii) street addressing was updated and the tax records of Kaloum, Dixinn and
                                          Matam municipalities were improved. These towns now have the tools to assess potential local taxation and tax
                                          records electronically with updated addresses. Municipalities must take adequate measures for the sustainability of
                                          their operations though. In addition, through the steering committee, the National Directorate of Taxes,

                                          local finance, the Fiscal Manual prepared during project Phase I was widely distributed in the 10 communes and 5
                                          municipalities, and trainings were implemented for the benefit of their staff in April and May 2013. The database

Note: Definition of effective management systems to operate commercial infrastructure: Efficient system to manage commercial infrastructure is defined as evaluated and chosen
by the municipal council and for which the type is clearly identified: (a) specifying management “in house” but with nomination of a manager accountable to the council and with
clearly defined and contractual minimum objectives; or (b) concession of management to a private entity (e.g. association of stall holders, professional operator), with regular
payment of specified amounts, for which the intervals and procedures for revision are agreed and clearly spelled out in a contract. Such system shall in any case include a public

hygiene component regarding SWM and operation of latrines. A management system is set in place based on the following principles: (i) Inventory of assets and numbering of
market stalls and stands, and bus station parking spaces in the case of transport infrastructure; (ii) Negotiation between the council and traders/transport operators on the use of
proceeds; (iii) Estimate of the financial situation of each category of assets (tables, stalls, shops, bus station parking spaces) and growth projection over three years; and (iv)
Evaluation, negotiation and adoption of the system of management most beneficial to the municipality. All of these principles are to be respected if the system is to be considered
efficient in terms of the indicator, whether option (a) in house or (b) concession is chosen.

          A detailed calculation of indicator values is available in the project file. The comments below provide information as background to the restructured results framework.
          (1) Direct project beneficiaries includes all persons benefiting from project interventions, including those counted under access to roads, water, and sanitation in the results
          framework, plus beneficiaries benefiting from other investments in secondary cities and not separately accounted for in the results framework, such as health centers, schools, and
          market infrastructure. Direct project beneficiaries further includes the beneficiaries of the Labor Intensive Public Works Program as AF to the UDP3 Phase II.
          (2) The original PAD indicator related to SWM measured percentage of the population having access. Original baseline does not likely reflect the actual situation at appraisal, due
          to use of outdated population data. The total number of households was set at 158,198, based on the 1996 census, and 113,903 households were served, giving 72 percent, as in the
          PAD. A more realistic 2005 baseline, taking into account 4 percent population growth, is 56 percent, based on 113,903 households served out of an estimated total of 195,705
          households in 2005. Since then, access rates have fallen, due to lack of regular financing of solid waste collection, with a reversal of the negative trend in 2011.
          (3) The indicator is to be dropped. The project has reported substantial increase in municipal own revenues as well as issuance of tax rolls and collection of fiscal revenues, but
          this is not confirmed by analysis of data and also not attributed to project interventions (due to the project freeze). The remaining project period will not allow the project to
          attain measurable and attributable results regarding increase in municipal own revenues and fiscal revenues.
          (4) Efficient system to manage commercial infrastructure is defined as evaluated and chosen by the municipal council and for which the type is clearly identified: (a) specifying
          management “in house” but with nomination of a manager accountable to the council and with clearly defined and contractual minimum objectives; or (b) concession of
          management to a private entity (e.g. association of stall holders, professional operator), with regular payment of specified amounts, for which the intervals and procedures for
          revision are agreed and clearly spelled out in a contract. Such system shall in any case include a public hygiene component regarding SWM and operation of latrines. A
          management system is set in place based on the following principles: (i) Inventory of assets and numbering of market stalls and stands, and bus station parking spaces in the case
          of transport infrastructure; (ü) Negotiation between the council and traders/transport operators on the use of proceeds; (iii) Estimate of the financial situation of each category of
          assets (tables, stalls, shops, bus station parking spaces) and growth projection over three years; and (iv) Evaluation, negotiation and adoption of the system of management most
          beneficial to the commune. All of those principles are to be respected if the system is to be considered efficient in terms of the indicator, whether option (a) in house or (b)
          concession is chosen.
          (5) Issues regarding this indicator are similar to note (2). The original PAD baseline does not likely reflect the actual situation at appraisal, due to use of outdated population
          numbers. The total waste generated in 2005 was estimated at 321,200 cubic meters at appraisal, based on the on the 1996 census (population of 1.1 million) and an estimate of 0.4
          cubic meters (0.8 liters) of waste generated per person per day. This gives a collection rate of 80 percent (256,960 cubic meters collected by SMEs in 2005). A more realistic 2005
          baseline, taking into account 4 percent population growth and slightly denser population (8 persons per household, as estimated by the National Statistics Department), is 56
          percent, based on the same 256,960 cubic meters reported as collected by SMEs out of an estimated production of 457,168 cubic meters in 2005 (estimated population of 1,565,643
          times 0.8 liters per day). Since 2005, collection rates have fallen, due to lack of regular financing of solid waste collection, and the amount of solid waste collected by SMEs has
          decreased. The revised estimate (2010) is 19 percent of total waste generated collected by SMEs. This is based on 102,784 cubic meters collected out of an estimated production of
          556,214 cubic meters in 2010.
          (6) In line with other SWM indicators, the original 2005 baseline and annual performance has been revised to take into account projected population growth and related increased
          waste generation. SPTD is currently only transferring about 20 percent of the waste produced, compared to a total transfer rate of 62 percent by all transporters. This is due to a
          number of emergency operations during 2011, during which operators other than SPTD have been paid to transfer accumulated waste. In preceding years (and especially in 2009),
          solid waste transfer has also been carried out by operators other than SPTD, in the absence of regular financing for SPTD.
          (7) Original indicator commingled construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance. The project originally targeted rehabilitation of 16 kilometers of roads.
          (8) For the restructured project, it is specified that 3 percent of budgets of the City of Conakry and the five communes corresponds to GNF 728,148,651 in 2010 (3 percent of GNF
          24,271,621,725, total revenues for Conakry and the five communes in 2010). This is set as the minimum amount to be spent annually on routine maintenance by the City of
          Conakry and the five communes for the duration of the project. A definition and positive list of infrastructures for which maintenance is to be credited is to be promulgated during
          a workshop in Conakry, and further included as an annex to the revised municipal contracts.



                                                                                                   41
(9) The indicator measures the number of programs effectively prepared and implemented by the City of Conakry and the five communes, based on an inventory of assets and
analysis of maintenance needs. In order to be considered as implemented, at least 80 percent of activities contained in the PMP has to be implemented, corresponding to at least 80
percent of the budget allocated. A definition and positive list of infrastructures for which maintenance is to be credited is to be promulgated during a workshop in Conakry, and
further included as an annex to the revised municipal contracts.
(10) Original cumulative target was 40 infrastructures in secondary cities, revised down to 20 infrastructures cumulative, due to cost increase. Maintenance activities will be
accounted for separately, under the indicator on maintenance budget and maintenance programs implemented.
(11) Not a core indicator, as the “Improved Sanitation Facilities” core indicator specifically excludes public or shared facilities.
(12) For the restructured project, it is specified that 3 percent of budgets of the secondary cities corresponds to GNF 154,882,120 in 2009 (3 percent of GNF 5,162,737,335 total
revenue for the 10 municipalities in 2009, last year of fully available data). This is set as the minimum amount to be spent annually on routine maintenance by the secondary cities,
for the duration of the project. A definition and positive list of infrastructure for which maintenance is to be credited is to be promulgated during a workshop in Conakry, and
further included as an annex to the revised municipal contracts.
(13) The indicator measures the number of programs effectively prepared and implemented by the ten (10) secondary cities, based on an inventory of assets and analysis of
maintenance needs. In order to be considered as implemented, at least 80 percent of activities contained in the PIP has to be implemented, corresponding to at least 80 percent of
the budget allocated. A definition and positive list of infrastructure for which maintenance is to be credited is to be promulgated during a workshop in Conakry, and further
included as an annex to the revised municipal contracts.
(14) Street addressing was considered to be updated and operational for three municipalities of Conakry in 2005, based on the latest update in 2002. This street addressing is no
longer considered to be operational. The restructured project will restore these street addressing registers to operational status, as the basis for operational fiscal registers.

Detailed Project Phase Descriptions
The UDP3 Phase II went through four phases during its implementation.

Phase 1. Project Effectiveness (December 10, 2007) until Project Suspension (December 23, 2008). All
covenants and conditions of effectiveness were met before project effectiveness on December 10, 2007
although the PAD planned effectiveness date was October 26, 2007. All 11 actions identified under the
institutional strengthening component were underway while urban audits were implemented. The audits
helped municipalities, in conjunction with SMEs, NGOs and stakeholders, to formulate their PIPs, MAPs
and their counterpart schedule payments. This led to the signing of the MCs between July 27 and
November 26, 2008 for the 10 communes and 5 municipalities, although PIPs and MAPs provisions
needed to be re-actualized to absorb cost overrun and/or be scaled down. Specifically, implementation
suffered early on from: (i) rising prices that affected the project procurement plan and had a negative effect
on municipal planned investments; and (ii) an uneven implementation of the SWM subcomponent. Also,
three percent of the municipal budgets under the AMP was earmarked but still not institutionalized.
Conversely, project management was adequate as the PCU budget was approved, staff annual contracts
renewed at the end July 2008, training, updating manuals, and software upgrading were achieved,
environmental focal points were designated, solid waste awareness campaign had started, M&E procedures
were reviewed, and technical and financial auditors were selected. Project’s PDO and IP ratings were
Satisfactory.

Phase 2. Project Suspension, with active PCU (January, 2009 – January, 2011). Despite Bank Guinea
operations frozen under OP 7.30, the Bank team sustained dialogue with the PCU as project
implementation and supervision were monitored through regular audio-conferences and video-conferences.
A detailed implementation action plan was developed by the PCU on the basis of available resources in the
designated account (US$ 1.3 million) and was being used to monitor project activities and cover PCU
operations. This enabled the project to keep moving, though available resources were insufficient to honor
current commitments (about US$ 2.4 million), resulting in a non-accrual status by May 6, 2010. While in
Suspension, the project achieved the following: (i) all municipalities signed and paid their full contribution
to their municipal contracts, illustrating their commitment despite the disbursements freeze; (ii) contractors
signed works contracts related to building at least 60 classrooms, subject to resumption of disbursements,
and bidding documents for major infrastructure construction in secondary cities; and (iii) half the grant
(US$ 1.25 million) under EULIWP was disbursed. In the absence of replenishments, residual funds were
used to manage PCU operations but staff, whose contracts had already elapsed, continued working without
pay, while consultants/contractors outstanding arrears reached US$ 1.18 million. The mandatory quarterly
Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were regularly issued and reviewed by the Bank FM team and found
satisfactory to the Bank. The project disbursement rate was 20.1 percent by the end of this stage, against
60 percent of elapsed project lifetime. The project PDO and IP ratings were respectively maintained at
Moderately Satisfactory to reflect its actual performance status in a difficult country environment.

Phase 3. Bank Reengagement (January 2011) – Project Reactivation (February, 2011) before Project
Restructuring (November, 2011). Bank prepared a project reengagement plan in January 2011, prioritizing
actions to put the UDP3 Phase II back on track. These included: (i) renewing PCU staff contracts and lease
adequate and permanent offices to the PCU; (ii) addressing arrears, updating procedures, operations, and
procurement plans, adjusting investment program costs, and initiating project extension procedures to at
least the 1st quarter of 2012; and (iii) reactivating the EULIWP TF and its operations while ensuring
retroactive financing. PIP implementation advanced (eleven works sites opened in September 2011 in five
of ten project secondary cities), and the GoG agreed to operational and supervisory institutional
strengthening for the SWM component. However, project implementation did not advance as fast as
expected. By November 2011, the project disbursement rate reached 38 percent against a commitment rate


                                                     46
of 47 percent. An additional funding of US$ 14 million was considered during restructuring but not
realized due to constraints on the IDA allocation for Guinea. Moreover, weak and ineffective activities
resulted from parallel, uncoordinated, and competitive initiatives, (e.g., SPTD and SME collection efforts),
and the SWM subcomponent was finally dropped. Furthermore, a lack of incentives at the local level
resulted from institutional instability, as city council mandates (including the mayors) expired in 2010 and
councils were replaced by nominees. This development was a risk to both the decentralization process and
building the trust between public services and stakeholders. In addition, the PCU faced challenges in
project management, insufficient supervision of social and environmental safeguards requirements, and
lack of close supervision and revision of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework (including
establishing new baselines and targets)

Phase 4. Project Restructuring in December 31, 2011 until closing date in June 30, 2013. Project
restructuring took almost all of 2011 and created a significant distraction from implementing project
activities. Yet, despite a relatively successful restructuring process, project implementation was again
affected by: (i) delays in hiring a new Project Coordinator, in early 2012; (ii) procurement delays for high
value contracts, including oversight of bids evaluation and contracts signing; (iii) delays in collecting
indicators to inform the M&E; (iv) delays in hiring supervision firms for all works planned in Conakry;
and (v) GoG delays in signing the revised MCs: MCs were quickly signed by the communes, but were
only signed in June 2012 by the Ministry of Construction, Urban Planning and Housing as well as the
Ministry of Interior and National Security (MISN). By November 2012, the Bank decided on triggers to
speed the implementation process and set deadlines: (i) each LG was to clear its arrears in counterpart
payment, in compliance with the municipal contracts requirements, by December 17, 2012; (ii) all high
value contracts were to be signed by December 31, 2012; and (iii) duration for implementation of any
infrastructure works not to exceed a five-month period.

As a result, implementation of MCs were significantly delayed as key project activities took place in the
last 6-8 months of the project (LG staff training, IT equipment delivery, final infrastructure build handover,
commune budget reports delivered, PO contracts signed and market and bus station management delegated,
etc.) Although constituting a risk to project sustainability, the final rush ensured higher level disbursements,
as by June 30, 2013, 87.8 percent of IDA project funds were committed while 99.9 percent of the IDA
additional funds were disbursed (Table A3.3). A procedural grace period was granted from July 1 st to
October 31, 2013 to allow all payments to clear for eligible expenditures incurred by the closing date.

When looking at the Bank and the three government tier counterpart fund disbursements (Table A3.3),
the total disbursement was below appraisal target and reached 87.3 percent for the entire project with 89.6
percent for the Bank (IDA grant and IDA additional funds) and 73.5 percent for GoG. The three
government tiers provisioned about 70 percent of the initial target on an irregular basis. To avoid the
cancellation of infrastructure facility investments in some secondary cities, the state decided to bridge the
balance of US$ 0.8 million through the National Development Budget (BND) or 24 percent of the
counterpart funds owed by two municipalities and three communes by the end 2012. These funds were
provided with the condition that LGs would repay them to BND. This advance from BND enabled IDA
leveraging funds, bringing the target to 90 percent. A number of problems prevented the provisioning of
the full amount for the three government tiers including the exogenous and endogenous factors, e.g.,
inflation, restrictive budget stance, reduction of non-priority subcomponent funding by the Governorate
of Conakry (SPTD operation funding and SME guarantee fund) and insufficient revenue collection in five
communes and municipalities while the ten other communes and municipalities contributed their
counterpart funds in full.

Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

Background
Financial analysis (i.e., commercial profitability analysis) and economic analysis (i.e., national
profitability analysis) differ in several ways. The objective of commercial profitability analysis is to
assess the net financial results of a project from the investor point of view, while the national profitability
analysis aims to identify and measure the net economic benefits of the project from the society point of
view. Moreover, commercial profitability analysis is based on prevailing market prices, while national
profitability analysis is determined with the help of adjusted prices (i.e., shadow prices) that are deemed
to be an approximation of true economic prices (reflecting the social opportunity cost). Similarly, for
commercial profitability analysis, the time value of money is described by application of the private
discount rate based on the prevailing interest rate of the capital market, while in the case of national
profitability analysis, the social discount rate is applied, i.e., the rate at which Guinea can borrow money
taking into consideration the country risk.

Three to four indicators are usually considered in the economic analysis to determine the viability of the
project:
     The Net Present Value (NPV) which is the difference between the discounted total benefits and
         cost;
     The Internal Rate of Return (ERR), which is the discount rate that zeroes out the NPV or, the
         interest rate that makes the NPV of all cash flows equal to zero. In other words, the ERR
         estimates the actual return on the project, expressed as a percentage or interest rate.
     The modified Internal Rate of Return (MERR), which is the discount rate that zeroes out the NPV,
         considers that positive cash flows are reinvested at the country financing cost whereas the ERR
         assumes the project cash flows are reinvested at the rate of the ERR and therefore, the MERR
         more accurately reflects the cost and financial viability of a project; and
     The Benefit-Cost Ratio, which is the ratio of the present value (PV) of benefits over the PV of
         costs over the lifetime of the project. Sometimes the Benefit-Cost Ratio is based on undiscounted
         benefits to costs, but this is a less useful measure.

Economic Analysis Process
The major difference between the financial and economic analysis is that economic analysis consists of
eliminating all the distortions of prices on the inputs used for delivery of services. There is therefore a
need to identify and quantify price distortions that affect the operating expenditures as well as the
investments. The evaluation of these distortions makes it possible to rectify the financial prices and to
obtain the economic prices. From the corrected structure of the economic prices, the revaluation
coefficients were estimated.

By looking at the social profitability of a project, “shadow prices” or “opportunity costs” are used in an
economic analysis instead of market prices (real) that will help determine the social profitability of an
investment. Shadow prices are adjusted in the following way:
     Determination of Price Distortions. The conversion of the financial costs into economic costs is
       essential to reflect the value of the output for the stakeholders. The objective of this calculation is
       to determine the opportunity costs of both the inputs and outputs. Because taxes, duties and
       subsidies, such as for electricity, constitute internal flows in the national economy, those were not
       taken into account in the calculation of the economic costs.
     Labor. The wages applied for unqualified skills is the minimum wage without the social
       contribution. For the skilled job salaries, the conversion factor is taken equal to 1 but the social
       contributions are also not considered. Moreover, most labor needed for the whole project and
       other activities are assumed to be locally hired.
     Equipment, Goods and Infrastructure. A conversion factor ranging between 0.83 and 0.9 (10%
       for VAT and 17% for average import taxes) has been applied to calculate the economic costs of
       equipment, goods and infrastructure in order to deduct from them the included taxes
       (construction). The project investment costs are already netted from taxes and will be used in the
       analysis.

 A number of additional key assumptions were considered for the economic analysis:
     A real discount rate of 10% per annum is used for the economic analysis
     The right-of-way including the price of land and any structures upon it is accounted in the
       analysis
     Benefits are assumed to accrue over project implementation (see Table A4.3) at various periods.

 Economic Analysis Quantification
 As many of the benefits of reliable and improved water supply and improved sanitation are difficult to
 quantify, the economic analysis is limited to:
  reduced incidence of diarrheal disease;
  reduced mortality from diarrheal disease; an
  reduced mortality from infectious diseases associated with improved nutritional status in young
    children from reduced incidence of diarrhea.
  Socioeconomic benefits resulting from the improved infrastructure
  Land benefits (increase in land value)

 Some clarification of these expected disease and mortality reductions is warranted. It is considered that
 people (about 15,000 as the analysis considers water improvement and sanitation improvement targeting
 different individuals) without improved water and sanitation are those living in the 10 secondary cities. A
 60% reduction in disease and mortality is expected from having access to improve water and improved
 sanitation (Bassi et al. (2011). An important point is that the crude birth rate is very high in Guinea with a
 similarly high death rate among children under 5 years from diarrhea: 9.44 cases for a crude birth rate of
 67 per 1,000 persons. Hence, child mortality attributable to improved water and sanitation can by reduced
 by a midpoint of 60%. Similarly, the prevalence of diarrhea could also be reduced by 60%. For the
 population greater and equal to 5 years old, only serious cases that require hospitalization are considered
 (Table A4.3).

The project dataset and economic analysis for Conakry are illustrated in Table A4.4. The all-season roads
subcomponent with benefits derived from the hedonic value increases lot value around the intervention
area (150 meters on average from each side of the improved or constructed road although 500 meters was
considered in the project) and is based on the Senegal Stormwater Management and Climate Change
Adaptation Project (Report No: 66451-SN) hedonic pricing where the reduction of the price of land was
34% lower (95% confidence interval and ±3% margin of error) than similar non flood-prone land due to
the lack of all-season roads and drainage. The original price of slightly developed land in flood-prone area
amounts on average to US$ 9.7/m2 in Conakry. The net incremental price of land is US$ 5.0; and the
people (110,000 residents) who are gradually less affected by flooding areas during the last three years of
the project with a monetization in terms of gross national income per capita per day (US$ 1.26) by 10
days of forgone flooding, which is assumed to represent a share of the gained social benefits (health
provider, schools, etc.) and economic activity (Table A4.4).


Economic Analysis Results
All the costs associated with the four components are considered in the economic analysis, annualized and
assumed to be disbursed as illustrated in Table A4.5 to reflect the 2009-2010 suspension of the 2008-13
project (the project effectiveness date is in fact December 10, 2007 and 2013 is considered as a full year
as disbursements were extended until October 31, 2013). Conversely, benefits are considered as follows
in the analysis and start accruing in 2011: one third of the health benefits accrue in 2011 and half of the
benefits accrue in 2012 and 2013 respectively, as it is assumed that the full benefits will accrue in 2014;
for the economic productivity, the benefits accrue with road implementation (73% in 2011, 90% in 2012
and 100% in 2012); whereas the land hedonic pricing is annualized over the 2011-2013 periods where the
accrual land price increase is applied only once. The land price could increase with a time lag that was
discarded in this case. Additional increases could stem from land speculation in the future and should not
be captured in the analysis.

 The project is economically viable with a net present value (NPV) discounted at 10% over only 6 years
 reaching US$ 1.5 million with an economic rate of return (ERR) of 23% and a PV B/C ratio of 1.1 (Table
 A4.6). No sensitivity analysis is needed at this stage as this is an ex-post evaluation with the benefits
 considered accruing during and at the end of project implementation. Nevertheless, with proper
 operations and maintenance as targeted by the project, the benefits should keep on accruing in the future.

 Regarding the SWM component, a rapid analysis was conducted to derive the negative impact of the
 reduction in collection coverage in Conakry based on revised figures after project restructuring. However,
 the lack of improvement of La Minière dump management was not considered in the analysis. In the PAD,
 the total number of households was set at 158,198, based on the 1996 census, and 113,903 households
 were served equivalent to 72 percent (Table A2.2). At project restructuring, a more realistic 2005 baseline,
 taking into account 4% population growth, was based on 113,903 households served out of an estimated
 total of 195,705 households in 2005 equivalent to 56 percent.

 Regarding the economic analysis, when the waste is not properly collected it creates negative externalities
 in terms of health risks. As a rule of thumb, a figure of one percent of the disposable income of
 households in the areas where there is no collection is used as a guide to derive the cost. The cost of
 degradation due to poor collection was calculated for the 2008-2011 periods with total losses amounting
 to FGN 175.6 billion.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

1. Introduction
The Republic of Guinea implemented three urban projects with the Bank from 1984 until 2013. The
current evaluation reviews the performance of the 2007-2013 UDP3 Phase II. The project encountered
unforeseen difficulties that led to its suspension at the end 2008. The reengagement of the World Bank in
early 2011 was followed by the restructuring of the project by re-scoping, scaling it down and extending it
to June 30, 2013. By project end, most activities were implemented with a disbursement rate of about 90
percent. Moreover, the US$ 2.5 million EULIWP grant was integrated in the project at project
restructuring and implemented by the PCU. Building on the latter grant, the Bank introduced a Social
Safety Net along the same lines.

 2. Objectives and Project Components

The objectives of the UDP3 Phase II are similar to the PDU Phase I objectives, namely: (a) to improve the
provision of infrastructure and services in Conakry and secondary cities; and (b) to improve the financial
and organizational management of municipalities in support of the decentralization process.

3. Project Achievements

During project preparation and effectiveness, the PDU 3 Phase I encountered tremendous difficulties that
culminated with the coup d’état of December 23, 2008 which led the Bank to suspend the project. The
Bank reengagement in January 2011 was followed by the project restructuring initiated by mid- 2011,
where disbursement did not exceed 25 percent, was finalized by December 2011. The project components
were re-scoped and scaled down, and the project was extended until June 30, 2013. The most salient
changes were: the SWM subcomponent was dropped and funds were allocated towards all season roads;
the consolidation of PIP based on priorities; revision of indicators to reflect the component revisions; the
integration of the EULIWP as a component in the PDU3 Phase II; monitoring of school
building/rehabilitation; the improvement of safeguards associated with project implementation; the hiring
of a new Project Coordinator as the current Coordinator integrated the public service; and the revision of
the procurement plan. By project end, disbursement reached about 90 percent. The project realized the
achievements detailed below.

Component 1. City Contract Conakry. The signing of the Conakry Municipal Contract (MC) took place
on November 26, 2008 and implementation results are as follows:

Sub-component 1.1. Solid Waste Management (SWM). The SWM system in Conakry was relatively
unchanged until 2011. Collection areas and SME interventions were not reconsidered. However, the
municipalities and the SPTD intervened in collection activity which led to unfair competition vis-à-vis
SMEs. SPTD transfer operations were maintained with insufficient appropriations which led to the
decline of collection, the reappearance of illegal dumping through the city, lower volumes transferred to
landfills, and the erratic management of the discharge at la Minière. Project activities suffered from the
lack of concrete political will in support of the management system. Despite this situation, the tender
documents and Terms of Reference for almost all PIP and MAP activities under this subcomponent were
prepared by the PCU and were submitted for IDA approval before the project was suspended in early
2009. A letter was sent by the Government dated 22 July 2008 stating that all deficiencies will be
corrected although effectively, they were not. Subsequently, at restructuring, the GoG informed the Bank
of its decision to fully privatize the SWM chain. Hence, the SWM subcomponent was cancelled following
project restructuring in December 2011. The resulting resources were allocated to other activities within
the Conakry MCs.

Sub-component 1.2. Access to All Season Roads. The program involved the construction of 17 streets
with a length of about 16 kilometers in the five municipalities of Conakry; the work was to be executed in
successive tranches: 1 of 3 streets with a 5.9 kilometer length was completed before the suspension of the
project where nearly 81,000 people in the municipalities of Matam, Matoto and Ratoma had access to
                                                       56
transport services in their immediate vicinity. Due to inflation and increased costs, this work absorbed
almost all of the financial resources for the subcomponent (US$ 3.2 million out of US$ 3.5 million). The
project restructuring allowed the allocation of additional funding to implement 1.8 kilometers, bringing
the total achievement at 7.7 kilometers by the end of project.

Subcomponent 1.3. Municipal Equipment. The urban audit included the Annual Maintenance Programs
(AMP) and the estimated budget for the selection of works to be programmed in each of the five
municipalities of Conakry. Yet, the procurement process was reinitiated following Bank reengagement in
February 2011. The activities under the restructured Action Plan were fully realized. These include: (i)
the extension and renovation of Kaloum Town Hall; (ii) the renovation of the Dixinn Town Hall; (iii) the
construction of 12 classrooms in Coléah and Bonfi in the municipality of Matam; (iv) the construction of
a Youth Center in Koloma and a Health Center in in Kaporo in the municipality of Ratoma; and (v) the
renovation and completion of Matoto Town Hall and its annexes. All renovated structures were furnished
and equipped as appropriate with office equipment and computers.

Municipal Adjustment Program (MAP). All actions in the context of MAP were implemented. These
include the following: street addressing in the municipalities of Kaloum, Dixinn and Matam, specific
training programs in computer science (49 officers) and local finance (8 agents) provision of furniture and
equipment for the five municipalities of Conakry, the Kaporo Health Center and the Koloma Youth
Center in Ratoma; provision of computers and office equipment (25 computers, 1 copy machine and 3
motorcycles). Conakry (through its financial and technical services including CVS), and the Directorate
of Land Management and Urban Planning (DATU) also benefited from computer and office equipment
(12 computers and 1 copy machine and 3 motorcycles). These activities have helped to substantially
improve the skills and working conditions of municipal services of Conakry. Finally, five municipalities
have developed and implemented each of their APM for 2012 and 2013. In 2012, three AMP (Kaloum
Matoto and Dixinn) were implemented at more than 80 percent. The implementation of the AMP in 2013
is underway where three AMPs are already implemented at more than 80 percent in the municipalities of
Matoto, Dixinn and Matam.

Component 2 – Secondary Cities MCs. MCs for the 10 cities were developed and signed between July 27
and August 3, 2008, based on the PIP and MAP agreed in consultation with the municipalities. The
signing was accompanied by the first counterpart payments (25 percent planned). In general, this
component has been fully achieved as Action Plans were restructured and reached the target indicators.
With the exception of some equipment destined for Mamou and Nzérékoré. The following actions were
performed under PIP: 81 classrooms were equipped with boreholes and lighting systems in five cities
(Boke: 9 classrooms; Kindia: 24 classrooms; Kankan: 15 classrooms; Siguiri: 18 classrooms; and
Nzérékoré: 12 classrooms), a training center for young girls was opened in Kindia; four bus stations were
created or renovated in Kankan, Macenta, Labe and Boke for 350 bus station parking spaces, two markets
were opened in Kissidougou and Faranah with a total of 420 stands. All these structures were built after
Bank reengagement, and most were put into operations before project closure. However, the Macenta,
Labe and Kankan bus stations and the market in Faranah still need ancillary equipment. The GoG
committed funding from the BND to realize these needed works. Moreover, markets and bus stations will
be more efficiently managed thanks to public-private partnerships, as in Boke, Kissidougou and Faranah..
Difficulties encountered in project implementation, some of which have been the source of significant
delays, are as follows: late payment of counterpart payments by beneficiary communes, disputes over
titles, dealer challenging the authority of the licensor, and a lack of rigor and organization of some
companies. Under MAP, specific training programs were organized and implemented for staff in the 10
cities in IT (83 officers) and local finance (196 agents), and equipment and furniture were provided to
councils (10 solar equipments, 31 computers, furniture and office equipment, and 10 motorcycles). All
municipalities (except Nzérékoré) developed and implemented their AMPs for 2012 and 2013. In 2012,
AMPs were implemented to the tune of more than 80 percent with budget allocations for maintenance
representing 4 to 6 percent of their ordinary income, while 6 communes (Boke, Kindia, Mamou, Kankan,
Siguiri and Macenta) implemented the 2013 AMPs to the tune of more than 80 percent and three other
cities (Labe, Kissidougou and Faranah) were at an advanced stage (budgets ranging between 3 and 11
percent of current revenues) of implementing the 2013 AMP (at project closing in June 2013).



                                                      57
Component 3 – Institutional Strengthening. Following project restructuring, several planned
institutional strengthening activities were cancelled. These included a study of intergovernmental funds
transfer mechanisms, actions to improve urban planning, support to the National Directorate of Taxes
defining roles and monitoring of tax collections. Other cancelled institutional support activities addressed
communication and awareness, archiving, management, and municipal development training. By project
close, implemented activities included: (i) recruitment of technical and financial auditors, the
Administrative Procedures, Finance and Accounting Manual, the Project Implementation Manual and the
acquisition and installation of management software, as approved by the Bank; (ii) updating the
addressing and improving the tax records of Kaloum Dixinn and Matam in Conakry were conducted
concurrently as expected. These cities now have the tools to assess the potential of local taxation and tax
records in electronic form with updated addresses based on the 2003-2004 survey conducted under Phase
I. In addition, the National Directorate of Taxes, municipalities and service users (SEG water utility, EDG
electricity utility, and CVS) were closely associated with studies under the aegis of a steering committee
in their capacity as primary users of the goods; (iii) in the context of improving local finance, the budget,
finance and accounting preparation Manual of cities conducted under Phase I of the project was
disseminated in the 15 targeted communes and municipalities of the project and training have been
implemented for their staff in April and May 2013. The Financial Ratio Guidebook and processing
accounting, financial and budgetary system information of communes and municipalities have been
installed for the former at the National Directorate of Decentralization and the latter in the concerned
communes and municipalities. These tools are operational. The training helped prepare the first budget
reports of the communes for the period January to March 2013. Thereafter, the communes and
municipalities of Ratoma, Dixinn, Matam, Matoto, Mamou, Kankan and Kissidougou submitted their
budget reports for the second quarter of 2013; (iv) the Association of municipalities of Guinea has been
closely involved in this process as a member of the monitoring committee and received a copy of the
documents produced to facilitate the dissemination and the appropriation of the Financial Ratio
Guidebook by elected officials and municipal services.

Component 4. The EULIWP component was monitored by CVS in collaboration with the municipalities’
Technical Services. The component enabled implementation of 31 small work contracts on
approximately 71 kilometers of road (131 percent of target) at a cost of GNF 13.9 billion. EULIWP also
helped to create 4,328 temporary jobs (80 percent of target) and payment of GNF 6.2 billion in wages (88
percent of target). Implementation did not suffer from project suspension and had a visible impact on
access, sanitation and improving quality of life for people living in Conakry’s poor neighborhoods.
Vulnerable people expressed a sense of pride after their participation to this component.

Implementation of the CPRP, the ESMF and ESMP. Regarding safeguards, the project activities have
focused on implementation of the directives contained in the Community-based Poverty Reduction
Project (CPRP), the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Environmental and
Social Management Plan (ESMP). In this context, the PCU has implemented to the satisfaction of the
Bank, the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the secondary roads of Hafia – Mining (760 m Dixinn) and
Yimbaya – tanning (320 m Matoto) subprojects. Then the PCU provided the Project Environmental
Screening with the assistance of a national consultant hired for this purpose. Third, the PCU has
completed the documentation related to installation work sites for Phase I and Phase II. Finally, the PCU
has provided training and education to stakeholders with regards to environmental compliance of works
under Phase I.

With regard to the environmental screening, it has notably: (i) given a more operational dimension to
general measures contained in the technical specifications; (ii) monitored and highlighted potential gaps
and brought companies to take steps to address them which have helped to mitigate negative impacts,
particularly in terms of health and safety at work; and (iii) brought awareness to local authorities for the
preparation of land documents of infrastructure sites underway in which evidence of regularization has
been regularly provided to IDA.

The result of the safeguard activities were meant to: (i) mitigate the adverse impacts during construction
as provided in the bidding documents and ESMP; (ii) ensure that the construction of project works met
national and international standards and legislation on environmental and social issues; (iii) make sure
that the implementation of the RAP was effective and satisfactory to beneficiaries; and (iv) ensure that

                                                       58
security measures (wearing PPE, tagging sites, etc.) were observed on some sites which was not always
the case.

4. Financing and Management of Project Funds

The appraisal report estimated the cost of UDP3 Phase II as US$ 16 million. The cost was to be financed
by the World Bank (US$ 15 million, SDR 9.9 million equivalent, per IDA Grant H330-GUI), the GoG
(US$ 624,500 BND local contribution), the City of Conakry (US$ 75,000), the five municipalities of
Conakry (US$ 175,000) and the communes of the 10 secondary cities (US$ 202,500). In addition to
contributions under consideration, the GoG and local project beneficiaries were to provide additional
funding to implement the SWM scheme and annual maintenance of completed works program.

Disbursement of UDP 3 Phase II. The political, social and institutional instability characterized the period
of project preparation and execution. After a satisfactory start of operations in 2008 and a financial
commitment of 20 percent during the first year, the project was suspended in 2009 and 2010, following
the military coup of December 23, 2008. Disbursement rate began to rise again with the restart of the
project in the first half of 2011 and the launch of some activities, mainly school construction sites, in July
2011. Thus, the disbursement rate increased to 37 percent until project restructuring in December 2011
and to about 87.8 percent at project closure. Forty-two withdrawal applications were issued during the
project, and all received a no objection and got regularly paid by the Bank disbursement service. Due to
the chaotic environment during project implementation, it should be noted that some irregularities in the
issuance of these DRF occurred which resulted in slow contract performance.

Disbursement of IDA Grant TF 092930-GUI. Funded by IDA, the US$ 2.5 million EULIWP started in
October 2008 with an initial deposit of US$ 1.25 million or 50 percent of the funding. The
implementation of the program was less subject to political vagaries than the country experienced during
the 2009-2010 periods. The program closing date was tied to the UDP3 Phase II, and all planned activities
were implemented with a disbursement rate of 99.46 percent. The following categories of expenditure
were financed by the grant: work (96.30 percent), supplies (0.50 percent), consulting services (1.39
percent) and operations (1.81 percent). A balance of US$ 13,419 was available in the designated account
at project end

Payment of Counterpart Funds
Government/BND. Operations Project: The GoG paid a total amount of about GNF 5 billion equivalent
to US$ 768,439, or 123 percent of target. This level of performance reflects the Government’s interest in
the achievement of project objectives. In fact, the political crisis that was marked by building material
shortages and sharp price increases, and the project restructuring that followed called for significant
financial effort from local authorities. The GoG had to supplement communes with funds to avoid a
serious disturbance in the investment schedule that could have brought some cancellation. Thus, on the
basis of an authorization granted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the GoG has agreed to pay
GNF 544.8 million (US$ 78,076 equivalent) representing 5 percent of the investment cost owed by
Dixinn, Matoto and Ratoma which were the beneficiaries of the 2nd tranche of road works under the
Conakry MC. Then, to avoid the cancellation of commercial facilities in some secondary cities, the
Government has decided to bridge the balance of GNF 588.1 million (US$ 84,262 equivalent) counterpart
funds of the project against future reimbursement structured along sustainable repayment for these
municipalities.

Support system for SWM: The guarantee fund of 300 million GNF established since Phase 1 SME of
solid waste collection had been preserved until the cancellation of the SWM project sub-component and
restituted to BND counterpart funds. Under the depreciation of SPTD equipment, the cumulative amount
of payments made by the Government amounted to GNF 1.8 billion equivalent to US$ 280,500. At the
request of the project, the Government has provided GNF 5 million in budgetary support to perform work
on some roads, adding gutters and culverts to improve the storm water drainage system.

City of Conakry. Its financial obligations were at two levels with the following results: Financing SPTD
operations for an estimated amount of US$ 1,360,000 over the project lifetime or US$ 340,000 per year.
The cumulative amount of payments to the end of December 2011, the date of the cancellation of the

                                                       59
project sub-component, was GNF 5.5 billion or US$ 963,970; Funding for 5 percent of the amount of
work for SWM chain as counterpart funds in the PIP for the implementation of the Conakry MC
corresponding to US$ 75,000. This work has been canceled and no payment has been made in this
context.

Municipalities of Conakry. Under the project sweeping scheme, the cumulative amount was estimated at
US$ 614,000 or US$ 153,500 per year for four years. This scheme was replaced by a direct intervention
of municipalities, the amounts of counterpart funding for sweeping are not accounted for in the project.
Regarding the PIP financing, the municipalities have fulfilled all their obligations except for Ratoma,
which still owes a total of GNF 46.2 million.

Secondary Cities. The counterpart funds for the PIP under 10 MCs totaled GNF 1.5 billion. Payments
amounted to GNF 1.2 billion corresponding to 83.13 percent target. The rest was cleared by the GoG
against a sustainable repayment schedule for communes.

Project Financial Audits. Audit obligations were met during project implementation. The PCU project
accounts were audited for each fiscal year by an independent firm hired for this purpose. The audit reports
were regularly provided to the Bank in a timely manner, with the exception of 2012 when the
transmission of the report encountered a slight delay due to the change of staff. During the project, the
PCU worked to ensure that the scope and level of detail of the audit reports were continuously improved
in accordance with the principles of the profession and the recommendations of the Bank. The audit of the
SPTD was only made for fiscal year 2008, and was unable to be continued for the next few years because
of the many failures recorded in the management of this establishment, especially under emergency rules.
The audit was limited to PCU financial statements which led to the reduction of both the response time of
field missions and decrease in the annual fee amount from US$ 21,086 (2008) to US$ 18,500 (2011), a
savings of 12 percent.

Project implementation has not recorded any abnormalities that may affect the accuracy and/or reliability
of the management of available funds. The recommendations focused on general elements of internal
control (procurement accounting entries, allocation of certain costs, efficient use of management
software, etc.) and have always led to the establishment of implementation action plans whose monitoring
was carried out by the PCU, the Financial Management Specialist and IDA supervision missions and
specific supervision mission organized by the Bank.

Project Technical Audit
An independent consultant was hired as a technical auditor to provide independent professional advice on
the conditions of procurement and works as well as the technical and functional quality of the works
carried out under the project. The contract signed in 2008 included four field missions, at the rate of one
mission per year. Disruption of the project implementation schedule did not allow the implementation of
the contract. An amendment to the contract was signed in January 2011 for the delivery of two missions
that took place in January and June 2013. They were sanctioned by the reports that were submitted to the
project supervision and to IDA. Dissemination of the first report and consultant recommendations to
members of the PCU, the CVS, and municipalities’ technical services contributed to better management
of contracts. The second mission coincided with the end of the project and helped to provide details on
the progress and quality of the works. The audit did not identify any significant points of non-compliance
although some weaknesses were identified related to the safety of users.

Project Procurement
The UDP3 Phase II saw the recruitment of a procurement specialist and allow the project to improve its
procurement performance. The procurement plan approved at the start of the project was regularly
updated to take into account both the adjustment of activities and possible delays. The plan resulting from
the restructuring in December 2011 was reviewed and amended during the supervision mission in
December 2012. Equipment for Mamou and Nzérékoré and some institutional support actions that led to
implementation delays were incompatible with the cut-off date of June 30, 2013 and were deleted from
the Action Plans. Overall, the procurement plan implemented during the project involved 60 contracts
with 28 works (47 percent of the budget), 11 for supplies (18 percent of the budget) and 21 consultants


                                                      60
(35 percent of the budget). All of these contracts have been awarded in accordance with the Grant
Agreement while the provisions were laid down and clarified in the project implementation manual.

The amendments to the Grant Agreement that occurred after project restructuring increased the amount of
Tier 1 “work” and thus continue implementation of the road program in Conakry whose realization of
tranches 2 and 3 were compromised due to insufficient resources. The capacity building for the project
team and government officials involved in project implementation was limited to various trainings
provided on site by IDA procurement specialists. No procurement training was organized in specialized
centers during Phase II. The training enabled the beneficiaries to learn about the amendments that
regularly occur in the Bank guidelines and how to better control procedures in the field. However, these
capacity-building efforts have not always had the desired effects. Indeed, some activities experienced
failures that have resulted in the cancellation or interruption of significant investments in particular
markets and bus stations. It is desirable to further expand these programs to the public administration of
the Government and local communities and involve in situ training with training in specialized centers.


5. Major Factors Affecting Project Implementation

Three major factors affected the progress of the project.

The national and international political-economic environment has negatively impacted the project.

- A persistent political crisis characterized the period of preparation and implementation of PDU3 Phase
II. This has resulted in social violence, repeated changes in government, and even a military coup paving
the way for a State of Emergency for two years. Institutional instability became the rule as seven
ministers oversaw the project, six governors have succeeded to the governorship of Conakry, and 11 out
of 15 mayors have been replaced at least once. The constant change of all major stakeholders of the
project, and the deleterious atmosphere that prevailed were a serious obstacle to the implementation of
activities. This was exacerbated by the suspension of Bank activities during the two years of emergency
rule;

- The political crisis has had a direct economic impact. At the national level, the macroeconomic
framework has significantly deteriorated, especially with a negative growth rate, an inflation rate of over
30 percent, a sharp increase in the consumer price index, and sharp contraction in economic activities.
The period was also marked by a global economic crisis and rising prices of raw materials, energy and
food. For the project, this has resulted in biddings with financial envelops exceeding the appraisal-
estimated project costs which affected the availability of resources earmarked for certain civil works
including roads;

- Municipal management progress initiated under Phase I was not consolidated in Phase II. The operation
of communes was disrupted by the decade-long political, economic and social crisis, which prevented
mayors and their municipal councils to mobilize their efforts and concentrate on their work programs.
Furthermore, the non-compliance with election dates has eroded the legitimacy of local officials and
somewhat affected the staff enthusiasm at work. Ultimately, the positive results that were accomplished
are due to the resilience of decentralized services.

The activities of the project team were heavily affected by the prevailing political and social situation in
the country. The following provides an illustration:

- The PCU was forced to relocate the head office three times between 2009 and 2011 as a result of
unjustified decisions. As a result of these changes, the project lost its archiving system, communication
networks (intranet, internet and telephone), part of the furniture and office equipment, its spatial
organization and its brand image built partly on the location of its original head office. The degradation of
working conditions, combined with a strong psychological pressure, has affected work effectiveness and
group cohesion;



                                                       61
- The mobilization of the project partners at both central and local levels regarding MCs and many work
programs was challenging; information, advocacy and awareness responsibilities were constantly
reassigned with the constant institutional changes. This has impacted the MC signing, timely procurement,
the regular payment of counterpart funds, etc.;

- Procurement and implementation of activities suffered from delays in bid evaluation and in contract
issuance, contrary to procedures; e.g., with regard to contracted companies, despite their good references,
their financial and technical performance was poor notably in managing contracts, and a lack of
experience in the urban work implementation;

- Land jurisdiction conflicts occurred when works were initiated in Kindia, Matam and Ratoma, while
leadership problems arose in Kankan around the bus station. These problems indeed caused delays but
they revealed a larger problem in that the authorities do not know their assets and have no control over the
land. Many sites were reclaimed by local authorities after tedious negotiations;

- The Advisory Committee was unable to play an active role in supporting and facilitating the project,
leaving an institutional vacuum at the central level. There were high project expectations that could not be
achieved but there was also considerable institutional instability that prevailed during the period.
Moreover, it was difficult to find a function for the Advisory Committee in the highly participatory
operational system that had brought together local stakeholders, the government, the PCU and the
development partners. As a result, the project lacked authoritative guidance and supervision, leaving the
project PCU without strategic guidance and under pressure to conduct its activities;

-The Bank reengagement and project restructuring took almost all of 2011 and accounted for a significant
amount of work that has distracted the teams from implementing the activities. During this critical period,
it was also necessary to recruit a new Project Coordinator.

Analysis of Project Performance
 The project achievements showed that despite the contingencies, for the most part, the project met the
target performance indicators. The level of performance achieved by each of the stakeholders is reviewed
below.

Performance of beneficiaries
The implementation of the project has received support from the Government. The counterpart
institutional entities involved in the project included the Ministries of Finance, Decentralization and
Planning and the Ministry of Urban, Housing and Construction (MUHC) which functioned as the project
anchor. The MUHC regularly informed the Government on the project status and proposed solutions to
problems. The Government assured the mobilization of counterpart funds both to meet its own obligations
and provide necessary support to LGs’ financial needs. After signing the Conakry and secondary city
MCs, the Ministries of Housing and Decentralization strived to accelerate the pace of implementation and
remove institutional barriers. However, the lack of interdepartmental communication that prevailed
during the privatization of the SWM sector remains regretful.

 Through the communal and city councils as well as financial services, technical services and operational
units (SPTD, CVS), the City and five communes of Conakry had assumed responsibilities in the
implementation of activities related to MCs’ PIP and the MAP. The assessment at the end of the phase
showed that despite the encountered difficulties, the overall goals of access improvement, construction of
municipal facilities and provision of equipment have been achieved. In addition, municipalities mobilized
their counterpart funds to the realization investments, and have implemented the AMP for at least two
years. Given these results on the ground, the project had received strong support from local officials and
people who had stepped up requests for further interventions in their respective neighborhoods. However,
the SWM subcomponent did not achieve its goals due to many parallel initiatives, lack of political support,
and overlapping institutional responsibility for SWM. Despite the change of government options,
embodied in the overall privatization of the sector signed in 2012, SMEs and SPTD continued the
collection and transfer of solid waste according to the scheme set in place under UDP3. The municipal
councils, district councils and youth have rapidly adopted the EULIWP through monitoring committees


                                                      62
they set up during the program initiation. All planned activities in the five municipalities of Conakry were
performed and transparent.

The secondary cities had always shown a keen interest in the project that favored a participatory approach
to implementation of its activities. The project restructuring and periodic revisions led to a scaling down
of activities due to the chaotic situation in the country. Despite incurring investment losses, however, the
municipalities got fully involved in implementing the activities as initially convened. This resulted in the
realization of investments as programmed in the action plan, payment of the bulk of the counterpart funds,
the set up and implementation of AMP, and the initiation of new commercial facility management
systems. It might be premature to comment on the sustainability of the effects resulting from these many
gains.
The PCU and the operational units had jointly secured project implementation, especially with the help of
various specific and relevant tools: the Project Implementation Manual, Administrative Procedures, the
Financial and Accounting Manual, software and financial accounting, MCs, etc. However, their work
was heavily impacted by the factors discussed above. The implementation of the action plan resulting
from the restructuring was made possible by the technical skills of the members of the project team, and
the explicit support of the ministry and the Bank project team. However, the difficulties of the
implementation of the institutional strengthening activities and the cancellation of a number of
investments due to the PCU processing delays – notably procurement – were regretful.

The Advisory Committee set up during Phase I was extended in Phase II, with roles and responsibility
updates. The Committee met during project preparation to contribute to the formalization of the
institutional and financial framework of the project and the financial mechanisms of MCs. Thereafter,
apart from the launching project workshop in 2008, its role was confined to actual participation in crisis
meetings to contribute to the search for solutions. Some of the most important missions were not assumed,
such as approval of programs and annual budgets, and facilitation within administrations.

Bank Performance
The Bank performance was satisfactory to the recipient. The Bank consistently supported the project team
in monitoring activities through: (a) supervision missions (10), specific missions monitoring financial
procedures, disbursement and procurement review missions monitoring procedures (2), and numerous
missions to monitor projects in Conakry and the secondary cities; and (b) the extensive use of modern
means of communication (video conferencing, electronic and phone messages). The Bank conducted
workshops and seminars for the project team on specific issues (procurement fraud and corruption,
disbursement and financial management) to speed up the activities. The resident mission was also active,
and its close monitoring helped obtain relevant information and resolved operational emergencies that
arose during project implementation. The Bank team as a whole demonstrated high availability and
interaction with all stakeholders and beneficiaries.

Project Impacts
The results framework and their impact were analyzed in the context of the main PDO, namely:
strengthening of infrastructure and basic services in Conakry and secondary cities, and improving the
administrative and financial management of communes in support of decentralization.

Impact on the quality of life of the people
Implementation of MC activities generally helped improve people’s access to urban services and social
services. In this context, more than 348,800 people (52 percent women) benefited from the direct impacts
of the project in all the municipalities; while the target was 249,000 people (at least 128 percent for the
first indicator). In Conakry over 110,000 people (110 percent of target) benefited from local all season
access secondary roads within 500 meters. This result was leveraged by additional results of the
Emergency EULIWP which allowed better access to more than 106,000 additional people. The
development of roads and sanitation, rainwater networks (ditches, drains, culverts, etc.) significantly
contributed to the improvement of people’s lives. In the secondary cities, the realization of amenities in
schools enabled more than 5,800 people to have access to drinking water from boreholes or 70 percent of
target (the drilling in Sambaya and Kindia schools were not achieved) and more than 6,640 people (100
percent of the target) to have access to latrines. In addition, the construction/rehabilitation of 10 improved
communal water standpoints represented a completion rate of 83 percent of target.

                                                       63
A total of 18 facilities targeting poor neighborhoods were built in secondary cities (90 percent of target).
The 12 school facilities increased the enrollment capacity in the concerned locations by about 4,050
students. The two new markets led to the creation of 420 stands (halls and shops) and four bus stations
totaling 350 bus station parking spaces. These commercial facilities improved professional opportunities
and income with positive effects on the population. Although the profitability of commercial facilities
was not evaluated, it can easily be verified for the most part, because of their location in the city and its
dynamism. The results of various indicators of the labor-intensive program were as follows: 4,328
temporary jobs or 81 percent of the 5,300-target; GNF 6.2 billion in wages distributed to unskilled
workers or 88 percent of the target of GNF 7 billion and 71 kilometers of collectors/channels rehabilitated
or 131 percent of the target of 54 kilometers. The positive results of this program have attracted additional
funding by IDA and the European Union to perform the same activities. Given past experience, the CVS
will implement the labor-intensive component of productive safety nets over five years.

Impact on the administrative and financial management of communes
The project’s achievements greatly enriched the heritage of local communities, improved working
conditions and enhanced management capabilities. Most of the services within the municipality were
located in clean, modern and functional premises, featuring furniture, computers and office equipment.
This contributed to the provision of effective services to the population by LGs. The project’s communes
adopted the practice of preparation and execution of annual AMP and funds were appropriated in their
respective budgets. In terms of management, this had a significant impact on the quality and life of
municipal properties and assets. Also, the communes were still debating on how to manage their
commercial facilities (bus stops and markets). For example, the cities of Boke, Labe Kankan and Macenta
opted for delegating the management of their bus stations to the union carriers, while the Kissidougou and
Faranah markets were directly managed by the communes.

The indicators (i) Number of municipalities of Conakry with improved fiscal registers in place and in use,
and (ii) Number of municipalities with street addressing in place and operational for improving service
delivery and fiscal registers in Conakry (3 municipalities) were satisfied after the implementation of
relevant activities of the action plan. These actions provided tools to assess the potential of local taxation
in the concerned municipalities and update addresses on the basis of the investigation files produced
under Phase I of the project in 2003/2004. Now, of the five municipalities of Conakry, Kaloum, Dixinn
and Matam had improved tax records and an updated address file. The DNI, municipalities and service
users (SEG water utility, EDG electricity utility and CVS) were involved in the preparation and studies as
they were members of a steering committee and the primary users of these services. Municipal authorities
expressed great interest in the data available within these services and used them to improve resource
mobilization. Finally, they were invited to consolidate and amplify gains associated with the street
addressing and use tax records. Overall, the project enabled the establishment of mechanisms for
management and resource mobilization in the communes. The results can be truly evaluated over time,
hence the need to take appropriate measures for the effective use of these tools /mechanisms by
municipalities.

Impact of markets and bus stations
The decision-making process, which led to the selection of commercial facilities, emanated from a two-
pronged approach – participatory (needs expressed by local people and city authorities) and technical
(priority needs identified in urban, organizational and financial audits). These investments are the only
ones of their kind carried out in cities whose populations tend to have more than tripled over the past 40
years. With a total of 420 stands for both markets and 350 parking spaces for four bus stations,
commercial facilities remain modest but are promising. They can play a major role in structuring the
urban space and reorganization of economic activities due to their location in areas of recent expansion
that are under-equipped. Yet, satisfactory levels of profitability could be achieved when these facilities
will be scaled up to host more kiosks, warehouses and bus station parking spaces. The Faranah market
economic analysis found that the market could be profitable under three scenarios: with a 2nd hall and 20
private stores with an ERR of 72 percent; a 2nd hall with an ERR of 46 percent; and neither additional hall
nor stores with an ERR of 41 percent).

Impact on urban development
Through the realization of commercial facilities, town halls and schools, the project helped create
necessary structuring facilities essential for the modernization of secondary cities. These facilities will
give a new dynamism to the cities and allow them to participate in the structuring and consolidation of the
urban framework.
