                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is closing on June 30, 2013 and this update on implementation status follows the support mission form April 15 to May 3, 2013.

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                         Report No: ISR10913



                         The implementation of the project has been undermined by the serious governance challenges that affected Guinea between 2007 and 2010, including the coup of December 2008.
                         Despite the very difficult environment which led to the suspension of Bank financing with the coup and the time lost during the crisis, the project has made good progress towards the
                         achievement of the PDO although with some shortcomings. Following the implementation of priority actions identified during project restructuring in December 2011 and based on
                         assessment of subsequent implementation support missions by the Bank team, the project has progressed relatively well towards the achievement of its development objectives.

                         Performance in project implementation slightly improved before and steadily improved since the last implementation support mission of December 2012 when the government
                         renewed commitment to improve the project implementation at about six months of project closing. Reflecting these efforts, disbursements went up from 51% in December 2012 to
                         67% in April 2013 and are projected to reach about 80% by project closing. Nevertheless, no outcome indicator has been achieved so far in terms of improvements in the financial
                         and organizational management of LGs in support of the decentralization process, the intermediary results achieved towards the PDO indicators being at diverse levels of completion.

                         At the strategic level, the project has contributed to improve access for people in project areas to various infrastructure services, including to all-season roads (100% of target), to
                         improved water sources (86% of target) and public sanitation under the project (92% of target). Implementation of the Labor-Intensive Public Works under the Additional Financing
                         (Food Price Crisis Response) has contributed with additional outcomes in terms of access to all-season roads for poor neighborhoods. Two outcomes of the parent project as
                         restructured had not yet been so far achieved fully i.e. (i) management systems established by local governments to operate commercial infrastructure; and (ii) local governments
                         generating budget reports on time. Both were expected to contribute to PDO outcomes in support of the decentralization process. With regard to the first outcome, all concerned city
                         councils have already decided on the types of management systems to be put in place. Based on these decisions, two systems out of a target of five are expected to be in place by
                         project closing. With regard to the second outcome, the required training for LGs generating budget reports was under completion at the time of the mission. The mission pressed the
                         government to take necessary actions to have it achieved by project closing to secure a satisfactory rating on overall performance in PDO achievements.

                         During implementation, the project (as an APL with phase 1 closed in June 2005), has remained highly relevant and fully aligned with both the country 2002- Poverty Reduction
                         Strategy Paper (PRSP) (as well the new PRSP under discussion) and the Bank's corresponding Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). This was confirmed during the project
                         restructuring workshop held in September 2011 and further in the project restructuring paper completed in December 2011.

                         Despite Local Governments (LGs) operating under exceptional powers (elective mandates have expired for years) the project has provided them with a unique opportunity to fulfill
                         their mandates under municipal contracts arrangements. This has allowed, for example, a relative good commitment and subsequent performance in LGs' counterpart funding for
                         investments despite high inflation experienced in the country since project approval in 2007.

                         In view of project closing, it is worth signaling that this Phase 2 of the APL was supposed to build on Phase I achievements. But, this hasn't fully materialized as the solid waste
                         management component, which revealed to be a strategic and long standing success for the project, was dropped at project restructuring by central government. The risk to the
                         sustainability of project development objectives remains high despite some improved management capacity of local governments through municipal contracting (MC) arrangements.
                         The mission has requested the government to provide its own project implementation report (ICR) by project closing.
