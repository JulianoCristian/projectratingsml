                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project restructuring was completed in December 2011 with the signing of Amendment Letter to the Financing Agreement on December 30, 2011 by the Bank and January 24, 2012
                         by the GoG respectively. It resulted in integrating the results frameworks for both the parent project (APL Urban III - phase 2) and its Additional Financing (AF - Labor Intensive Public
                         Works). Also, as the results of project restructuring are (i) the cancellation of solid waste management (SWM) activities in the Conakry component of the parent project; (ii) the scaling
                         back of other activities for all three components of the parent project to focus on those that can be implemented as a coherent program; and (iii) the extension of closing dates for

                         both the parent project and the AF by 18 months, i.e. from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013. The project amount remains unchanged: $16m for the parent project ($15 million
                         IDA funding; $1 million central and local governments' counterparts) and $2.5 million for the AF.

                         So far, project implementation has resulted in providing improved infrastructure services to about 95,100 people against a target of 249,000 people direct beneficiaries. These

                         outcomes consist of (i) 91,000 people provided with access to all-season roads within a 500 meter through rehabilitation of 6 Km of roads in Conakry; and (ii) 4,100 people provided
                         with temporary jobs through labor intensive public works (70 km of drains cleaned and neighborhoods roads rehabilitated).

                         Among the eleven (11) works sites that were opened in September 2011 for schools rehabilitation, five have been completed while three are expected to be completed in late June
                         2012 and the remaining three in late September 2012, i.e. just before the new academic year. Fifteen (15) other infrastructure works are expected to be completed, by project closing,
                         altogether in Conakry and the ten project secondary cities: contractors have been already hired for six works sites while for the remaining infrastructure, activities implementation is at
                         bidding documentation stage. Despite some delays in the hiring of supervision firms, which could result in slippage in the launch of works already contracted outa recent assessment
                         indicates that all project activities are likely to be completed by the revised closing date.
