                                RESTRUCTING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.     The proposed restructuring has been discussed and agreed upon with the Ministry
of Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW) during the last supervision mission of
November 15-20, 2012. This restructuring paper aims to reallocate the trust fund
proceeds to facilitate project implementation. Indicators in the results framework will be
revised to include the sector core indicators to better reflect project outcomes without any
changes to the Project Development Objective. A letter establishing a Grace Period after
Closing will be prepared as part of this restructuring package.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      As of December 2012, disbursement stands at about $92.5 million (out of a total
project grant of $110 million), with more than $107 million committed. Two sub-projects
are fully operational, a third one is operational (except the repair of the groundwater tank
that is on-going) and a fourth is in the handover process. The remaining two works
contracts are under implementation but moving very slowly. The goods contract for
Kena’an (Diyala) has been awarded and is currently under implementation.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Results/indicators

3.      The current set of indicators focuses solely on infrastructure built rather than
benefits of this infrastructure on water users, and does not contain sector core indicators.
The framework will be revised to include relevant core sector indicators, and shift the
focus from outputs to outcomes, as described in Annex 1.

Disbursement arrangements

4.     A letter establishing a Grace Period after Closing will be prepared to ensure that
the Project will operate under a grace period of 4 months.

Reallocation of proceeds

5.     As of December 2012, $92.5 million have been disbursed, and 97% of funds
($107 million) are now committed. As implementation progresses, a clearer picture
emerges and estimates of expected remaining commitments are revised. In particular,
additional commitments are needed for:
                                        1
      a. A shortfall of proceeds for consultant services, as a result of contract
         extensions due to implementation delays;
      b. A shortfall of proceeds for goods;
      c. Estimated remaining commitments for works, accounting for recovered
         penalties.

6.     The proposed reallocation will consist of transferring proceeds from the
unallocated funds to the main categories of proceeds in the following manner:

 Category of Expenditure             Allocation                 % of Financing

Project Development Objective (PDO):
The principal objective of the Project is to assist the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW) to restore basic water supply, sanitation and urban
services for urban areas outside Baghdad through (a) the reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing priority networks and treatment facilities; and (b) providing
capacity building support through training and technical assistance.
