                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Disbursement stands at about $97 million compared to $91.5 million in November 2012 (out of a total project grant of $110 million of which $107 million is committed) So far, three
                         subprojects (Majar and Al-Muthanna and Badawa, Erbil) are fully completed and operational. A fourth subproject in Beiji was completed and is in the process of handover. The two
                         remaining on-going subprojects in Al-Hussainiya and Karbala are experiencing significant implementation delays, whereas the goods contract (funded under the Diyala component) is
                         under implementation.
