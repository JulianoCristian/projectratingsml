Some lessons learned included:\n            the Bank should consider expanding the role and scope of the\n            Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) to respond effectively to\n            the ground realities. In hindsight since the allocation for\n            capacity building under the project was bundled with\n            technical assistance, the actual allocation of funds to\n            capacity building was limited especially as the\n            implementation delays required more funds for technical\n            assistance. In future projects, the capacity building budget\n            allocation should be independently dedicated. Project\n            experience shows that Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of\n            an emergency operation may not incorporate the necessary\n            rigor at the preparation stage as the project preparation is\n            not based on a comprehensive sector review. In the case of\n            Iraq, monitoring was further complicated by the lack of\n            reliable data. M&E should be given due priority for\n            reassessment during implementation. Additionally M&E\n            should focus equally on outputs and outcomes, should be kept\n            simple, and target values should be established. Most\n            importantly, the project should facilitate client capacity\n            to assume these responsibilities from the beginning of the\n            project to foster a target- and results-driven mindset for\n            the project. A simple beneficiary assessment should be a\n            standard part of Bank preparation and implementation to\n            validate project results. Supervision in a conflict\n            environment is costly, as is reflected in the high cost of\n            supervision and the dependence on FMA. Hence, in such an\n            environment it is important that the Bank is very selective\n            in its operations and focuses its interventions on working\n            with those agencies that have implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "2013-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
