﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
In the 1970s, large oil reserves and abundant human resources enabled Iraq to attain the status of a middle
income country, with developed infrastructure and well-performing education and health systems. ' Soon
thereafter, ensuing wars, international sanctions and a repressive, state-dominated economic system stifled
economic growth and development, and debilitated basic infrastructure and social services. International trade
sanctions in 1991 took a toll on the economy. In addition, the increasing concentration of economic and social
activities in the main urban centers2 was not matched by the required expansion in the provision of services,
resulting in proliferation of under-serviced neighborhoods in major Iraqi cities. By 2001, despite the country's
rich resource endowment, human development indicators were among the lowest in the region, and income per
capita dropped to US$800, steadily declining to about US$500 by 2003.
Prior to the 1991 Gulf war, the population of Iraq enjoyed a relatively high level of water supply and sanitation
services. The sector operated efficiently, utilizing then -current technologies, and water quality was good as it
was treated by the 1,561 water treatment plants and units operating throughout the country. Over 95% of the
urban population, and over75%  in rural areas had access to safe potable water; while 75% of the urban
communities and about 40% in rural areas were connected to sanitation services.
However, since 1991 the water supply and sanitation sector experienced a steady but devastating decline, mainly
due to: aging infrastructure, poorly maintained equipment, leaking water and sewer networks and low technical
capacity and morale. These problems were further compounded by lack of funding leading to insufficient
imports, lack of maintenance, and curtailment of needed expansion. Moreover, these services were surpassed by
other pressing national priorities, which resulted in further degradation of the quality and extent of services
delivered. By the end of 2003 war, Iraq's infrastructure was seriously degraded, as destruction, looting and
pervasive insecurity were leading the country down a path of increasing instability.
In 2004, at the time of appraisal, water production was 24% less than demand,3 water coverage was 80%, but
30% of the network needed replacement, 91% of the urban population outside Baghdad were not served by
sewerage system, water of poor quality was available only for a few hours a day, water system losses were in the
excess of 50%, more than 70% of sewerage discharged was not treated, tariff were extremely low and barely
covered the cost of delivery of water, and unavailability of continuous power supply further crippled service
delivery. Additionally, diseases associated with poor sanitation, unsafe water and unhygienic practices were
seen on the rise, based on the premise that 50% of Iraqi's did not have access to clean water, and 25% of all
deaths of children were due to water bome diseases. In urban areas, unpaved and dilapidated conditions of
roads, exacerbated by the lack of proper storm water drainage, were significantly increasing health risks.
In 2003, a Joint UN/WB Needs Assessment was undertaken, adopting a multilateral approach to the
reconstruction and development, which estimated that Iraq required about US$35.8 billion from 2004-2007. In
response, the donors expressed support for the Needs Assessment and pledged about US$32.0 billion for the
four-year period.4 To ensure swift, flexible and coordinated donor financing for priority investments identified
in the Needs Assessment, the World Bank and UN set up an International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iran,
1 By early 1980s, income per capita was over US$3,600.
2 At appraisal, close to 70% of the estimated Iraqi population of 26 million lived in cities, a quarter of which (6 million people) lived in
Baghdad.
The demand for potable water was estimated to be 9 million cubic meters per day whereas production capacity was only 6.8 million
cubic meters per day
4 At the International Donors' Conference for Iraq held in Madrid on October 23-24, 2003

﻿which comprised of two trusts funds - a World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (WB-ITF) and UNDG Iraq Trust Fund -
each with its own internal governance procedures and a management structure, with mechanisms for close
coordination to avoid overlap.
The Bank's involvement was regarded as critical as: (i) Bank financing could complement ongoing
infrastructure investments, especially the large financing gap for infrastructure rehabilitation, the biggest
obstacle to economic recovery; (ii) share international experience and best practices based on the Bank's
considerable international experience with infrastructure reconstruction projects in post conflict effected areas.
In addition, it was conceived that Bank financing would be implemented by the Iraqi institutions ensuring
ownership and building institutional capacity, crucial for country's sustainable development; and Bank
financing for rehabilitation would be coupled with policy advice, thereby laying the ground for sector
restructuring, essential for long term sustainability of infrastructure investments.
The project was conceived as a part of the Iraq Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Program which
intended to cover five sectors: water supply and sanitation, electricity, urban rehabilitation, transport, and
telecommunications. However, in view of the limited availability of fund in WB-ITF, and expressed interest of
donors for certain sectors, the project was to focus only on urgent water supply, sanitation, and municipal
infrastructure needs of cities outside Baghdad. The project scope was the urgent sectoral needs of urban
communities outside of Baghdad in the following manner: rehabilitations of water and sewer networks, pumping
stations, small treatment plants, community roads, and other urban facilities. It would also provide support in a
post-conflict environment to the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW) to better manage
projects at design, supervision, operation, and maintenance stages by building the capacity of its staff.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Project Development Objective (PDO), as noted in the Grant Agreement (Schedule 2, p.10) was to: "restore
basic water supply, sanitation and urban services for urban areas outside the city of Baghdad through: (i) the
reconstruction, rehabilitation, and upgrading of such facilities and municipal infrastructure; and (ii) the
provision of capacity building support through training and technical assistance."
According to the Technical Annex (p.9) the PDO was stated slightly differently than the GA formulation: "to
restore basic water supply, sanitation and urban services for urban areas outside the city of Baghdad through:
(i) the construction and rehabilitation of existing facilities, and (ii) providing capacity building support through
training and technical assistance. " In addition, it also stated that the project would aim to improve the existing
environmental and health conditions by renewing the old water networks and sanitation services. It would also
contribute to the reduction of waterborne diseases through the reduction of water supply by tankers and the
provision of potable water and sanitation networks. This would help improve the economic conditions of the
population by reducing the amount of water obtained from tankers, which was more expensive. The project
would also create vitally needed short-term employment and help build Iraq's capacity to manage large-scale
reconstruction. The additional scope will be addressed in Section 3. The Implementation Completion Report
adopts the GA formulation of the PDO as it is legally binding and reflective of the intended objectives.
PDO Indicators. 5 These were: (i) increase in the quantity of water produced in the project cities; (ii)
improvement in the percentage of water samples meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) biological and
chemical standards; (iii) Karbala water supply system rehabilitated and upgraded; (iv) Majar water supply
system rehabilitated and upgraded; (v) Beji water supply system rehabilitated and upgraded; (vi) Kena'an water
5 As per the Grant Agreement (Schedule 5, p.20), but according to the Technical Annex (Annex 1, p.26) there were 19 indicators, the
additional ones were: (i) increase in the quantity of sewerage treated in Karabala; (ii) improvement in travel circulation in the project
cities; (iii) Dohuk water system upgraded; and (iv) Dohuk storm water rehabilitated, while one indicator on Dokan water supply system
upgraded was not included.

Central Karbala municipal roads and markets rehabilitated; (xiii) Badawa slum municipal roads and stormwater
drainage system constructed; (xiv) Basra municipal roads rehabilitated; and (xv) about 300 man-month of
training for municipal staff provided.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The Project Development Objectives were not revised, but changes were made to the results framework under
each restructuring adjusting for the changes made to the component and funding allocation, impacting the target
values or the indicators. In addition, the indicator "Increase in the quantity of water supply per capita" was
added as a PDO indicator during the course of 2008 project restructuring. In 2013 restructuring the key
indicators were significantly revised and realigned, on the basis that the initial set of indicators focused solely on
infrastructure built rather than benefits of this infrastructure on water users, and did not contain sector core
indicators. The results framework was therefore revised to include relevant core sector indicators, and shift the
focus from outputs to outcomes. The revised indicators, in addition to the indicators that were used through
project implementation are being used for the assessment of project achievements. The revised indicators are as
follows:
PDO Indicators. These were: (i) number of people benefitting from new or improved water distribution under
the project; (ii) number of people benefitting from sewerage extension or rehabilitation works under the project;
(iii) number of direct project beneficiaries; (iv) direct project beneficiaries who are female; and (v) number of
beneficiaries from urban rehabilitation investments (access to an all season road and/or storm water drainage)
Intermediate Outcome Indicators. These were: (i) water supply production capacity; (ii) length of water supply
network rehabilitated; (iii) number of people in urban areas provided with access to improved water sources
under the project; (iv) number of households with new water distribution connection; (v) Number of households
with access to rehabilitated water distribution; (vi) number of new sewerage connections; (vii) number of
rehabilitated sewerage connections; (viii) length of new sewerage network installed; (ix) length of sewerage
network rehabilitated; and (x) no. of man-month training provided through the project.

Direct beneficiaries of the project are inhabitants of the areas or neighborhoods where rehabilitation works
occurred, whose water supply or sanitation services were improved or underwent urban rehabilitation under the
project. Indirect or secondary beneficiaries were the seasonal/tourist visitors to the City of Karbala. At appraisal,

﻿the number of direct beneficiaries was estimated to be around 2 million inhabitants, a number that was
progressively revised down to 1 million inhabitants during restructuring (2009) when the scope of the project
was reduced. At Project closing, it was estimated that about 1 million inhabitants benefitted from the Project.
Due to lack of completion of all works in Karbala and Al Hussainia and the on-going process of installation of
goods delivered, this number will still increase significantly in the months ahead.
MMPW had just been created in 2004 out of the Civil Services Division of the Iraq Interior Ministry to be
responsible for all municipal services (safe drinking water, environmental sanitation, wastewater and solid
waste), urban development, municipal road works, and public land management. It was to benefit from
significant capacity-building activities to ensure effective and sustainable project implementation.

impact assessments, environmental management plans, and preparation of detailed design for potential follow-up projects.
1.6 Revised Components
The Project components were subject to several revisions, in price and scope, during implementation: (i) The
February 2008 restructuring canceled five components: Beiji (Component 3), Kenaan (Component 4), Dohuk
(Component 8 ), Dukan (Component 9 ) and Basra (Component 12 ) and merged the two Badawa components
(Component 7 and 11) and the two Karbala components (Component 1 and 10); (ii) The July 2009
restructuring reinstated the Beiji (Component 3) and Kenaan (Component 4 ), due to improved security
situation since 2008 restructuring and cost savings amounting to US$10 million due to now lower than expected
bidding outcomes; (iii) The restructuring in December 2011 changed the Kenaan (Component 4) from a works
to a goods contract named "Goods for Water Directorate in Diyala Governorate," as the depletion of water
resources in the Project area rendered the initial design impossible to implement and forced MMPW to switch to
the procurement of goods to increase the reliability of the actual water supply.
1.7 Other significant changes
Projects Costs: The cost of the project was initially estimated to be US$90.45 million grant funded from the
World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (WB-ITF) and the Borrower. To accommodate the gap in appraisal estimated costs
(works and goods) compared to market price as a result of bidding outcomes in Iraq an additional financing of
US$20 million was allocated from the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) in December 2006; thus increasing the Grant value
to US$110.45 million. The price escalation was attributable to increases in international and local prices of raw
materials and labor, largely due to the deteriorating security situation (for more details, see Annex 2).
Grant Financing: At closing, the actual project disbursement was US$104.2 million or 116% of planned
6
commitment. Almost US$5.8 million remained undisbursed at closing.
Borrower Contribution: At appraisal the Borrower planned to contribute US$0.45 million; whereas the actual
contribution was US$0.45 million equivalent or 100% of planned. The MMWP agreed to cover the cost of Iraqi
staff seconded to Project Management Team (PMT). The project did not actively document this contribution
6 This is based on actual Bank reported disbursement from the World Bank Client Connection. There is still a withdrawal application of
about US$0.4 million pending, but has been included in the amount reported.
6


﻿because it was in kind contribution, and may very well have run over the appraisal amount as the project ran
longer than initially conceived and the staffing costs continued to be bome by the counterparts during that time.
Project Effectiveness: As this was an ERL, project attained effectiveness on the Grant Agreement signing
(December 8, 2004).
Project Extension: The Project Grant closing date was extended five times during project implementation: (i)
extended for 23 months (legal amendment), establishing July 31, 2009 as the closing date in view of major
delays in implementation due to unfamiliarity of MMPW staff with World Bank procurement procedures and
the degraded security situation in Iraq; (ii) granted for an additional five months (2008 restructuring),
establishing December 31, 2009 as the closing date in order to complete the Upgrading of Al-Hussainia Water
Supply System which had experienced delays due to unexpected design changes; (iii) additionally extended for
six months (legal amendment), establishing June 30, 2010 as the closing date to provide sufficient time to
complete activities under the project; (iv) granted for an additional 18 months (2009 restructuring), establishing
December 31, 2011 as the closing date to enable the implementation of reinstated components as well as
significantly delayed ones; and (v) granted for an additional 18 months (2011 restructuring), establishing June
30, 2013 as the closing date to enable the implementation of significantly delayed components as well as new
goods component.
Design Changes: Project was restructured in February 2008 to reflect a significant design change to increase
water supply using Compact Water Treatment Units (CWU), initially chosen by the Government of Iraq (Go 1)
to conventional water treatment plants, due to numerous problems encountered with existing CWU throughout
Iraq. Given the higher cost of the conventional plants, the number of project components was accordingly
scaled down to match the funds.
Funding Allocation: Funding allocations for the components were changed at the stage of additional financing
and during restructuring. Details on this are provided in Annex 2.
Reallocation of the Proceeds of the Grant: There were five reallocations of grant proceeds for the original
project, as follows:

﻿Results Framework for the Project: Adjustments were made under all the four restructurings the project went
through (see Annex 2 for detail).
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project Design: The rationale for Bank involvement in the reconstruction and development of Iraq following the
2003 war was sound. It would focus on infrastructure rehabilitation, where there were significant needs and
demand as the other donors were focusing on other sectors or on new investments. In addition, the Bank brought
significant experience in post-conflict countries as well as strong added value in infrastructure rehabilitation and
capacity building. However, the background analysis of the situation was hindered by significant difficulties
getting access to reliable information on the ground, which affected the quality of assessment of the
rehabilitation needs. The PDO was carefully calibrated to focus all investments and efforts on the urgent
rehabilitation of infrastructure, while enshrining the need to build capacity to implement and operate the
infrastructure.
Project design was kept simple but ambitious, providing mostly rehabilitation works for networks and
production structures and some urban rehabilitation works (storm water drainage, roads and urban facilities).
The proposed components were in line with the development objective and consistent with the Project rationale.
However, with 12 works components in 10 different geographic areas, geographic dispersion was a structural
source of complexity, for project preparation and supervision, exacerbated by security risks, and stretching the
capacity of the implementing agency and its ability to deal with multiple regional directorates.
Implementation Arrangements were straightforward. The newly created MMPW had a clear mandate in the
sector and the recipient of a strong government and multilateral mandate to rehabilitate a derelict sector. A
Project Management Team (PMT) was created to ensure proper implementation and compliance with bank
processes and rules, with clear reporting and accountability mechanisms, including with regional directorates.
However, Iraq's public institutions at both the central and sub-national levels had been degraded by years of
neglect, autocratic rule, and sanctions. Ongoing conflict, patronage and political appointments undermined
central human resource planning and payroll management. This was particularly true of the newly minted
MMPW. As a result, the PMT's capacity was deemed low from the start, and would need significant efforts in
training and institutional strengthening. No beneficiary assessment, to ascertain the project's welfare impacts
was planned.
Lessons learned: As a result of Bank's increased role in post-conflict reconstruction over the past decade and
guided by the World Bank Operational Policy (OP) 2.30, Development Cooperation and Conflict were the
following: reconstruction efforts put a premium on early but selective engagement,8 while the Bank should focus
on flexibility in design and implementation, capacity building, coordination with donors and other partners, and
close monitoring and evaluation.9 In addition lesson learnt from previous sector projects were adequately
reflected in project design, mainly: (i) project should be kept flexible to permit a quick response to changing
circumstances; (ii) the need for generic training, including project management, procurement, financial
management, and environmental and social safeguards for staff members associated with requisite ministries;
(iii) planned capacity building to ensure client readiness in project implementation; and (iv) early and effective
collaborations with donors, external partners, and representatives of line ministries proved vital in previous
emergency operations.
8 The O.P 2.30 recognizes that countries even in conflict, the Bank should "continue efforts at poverty reduction and maintenance of
socioeconomic assets" and in developing a program for a country in transition from conflict may become involved incrementally.

﻿Risks: Risks were generally and adequately identified and included: (i) transition to New Iraqi government -
unknown outcomes that could affect project implementation; (ii) administration changes in MMPW -
jeopardizing current commitment to project design and inputs; (iii) sectoral priorities - difficult to establish in
the current political setting - possible disagreements between the MMPW and other controlling agencies
(MOPDC, MOF); and (iv) deterioration of fiscal conditions - with sustainability problems for operations. The
following additional constraints were faced: goods lost or stolen, security deterioration hampering project
completion, difficulties hiring expatriate technical assistance consultants due to unavailability of local capacity,
inability to supervise on-site and a resulting reliance on intermediaries for supervision, lack of familiarity or
affinity with Bank procedures, which would most probably lead to implementation delays, and difficulties with
the flow of funds through the banking system. Most of these risks were a consequence of project implementation
taking place in a post conflict environment. There was no evidence of systematic and extensive contingency
planning in the event that such risks materialized. Once it became clear that Iraq was not yet in a post-conflict
phase, the toolkit for the Bank to respond to these risks turned out to be rather modest in scope.
Quality at Entry (QEA): The project underwent a Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA7) by the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) in 2004-05.1o The Panel considered the overall quality of project preparation to be
Satisfactory. It acknowledged the necessity for this high priority project to address basic needs of mostly poor
people in a country still in midst of conflict. The Panel mentioned the following strong aspects of the project: (i)
Bank's post conflict experience and (ii) even without the ability to travel in-country, the task team had done
incredible work in the environmental area by providing training to develop institutional capacity. However, the
Panel thought that the associated costs of operation and maintenance of the completed assets should have been
paid more attention upfront. Panel suggestions in light of the ongoing insurgency and the associated security
issues to the team were: successful implementation of the project would remain a major challenge; the task team
will need to find ways of implementing the project with due regard to fiduciary aspects--both procurement and
financial management; issues relating to capacity building and funding for operations and maintenance should
be addressed on a priority basis through technical assistance being provided under the project and other studies;
and further attention and analysis would be needed to address Poverty, Gender, and Social Development issues.
2.2 Implementation
Supervision: Project implementation, from effectiveness, spanned 8.5 years till grant closing and project
completion, with a regular trajectory of supervision missions (average of two to three missions annually). The
task team leader (TTL) was HQ based, with one country-level staff working in country on day to day issues.
The project counted - despite its long duration - only three TTL transitions. The Aide Memoires were
sufficiently detailed and tended to focus on key implementation issues (the quality of project documentation was
thorough). The project successfully dealt with several implementation hurdles.
The project implementation was significantly impacted by the three years of war (2006 to 2008) marked by
violence, sectarianism and political volatility in Iraq. In February 2008, the Project was restructured to cancel
five components, three for security reasons, and two others to preserve the nominal 17% of Project proceeds that
would go to the Kurdish areas. In addition, other components suffered significant delays as the security situation
on the ground was making it difficult to attract qualified bidders. For those components that had started
implementation, the violence was increasingly impeding the progress of works, and their supervision.
Supervision proactively responded to ground realities by taking the necessary actions to keep the project on
course and to have the necessary documentation to support it. As a result, the project was restructured a total of
4 times as follows: extension of the closing date of the Project to allow for the completion of delayed
10 The QEA6/QAG point scale comprised: (a) strategic relevance and approach (2), (b) technical, financial, and economic aspects (2), (c)
poverty and social aspects (3), (d) environmental aspects (2), (e) fiduciary aspects (2), (f) policy and institutional aspects (2), (g)
implementation arrangement (2), (h) risk assessment (2), and (i) Bank input and processes (2). This was evaluated on a 6-point scale from
"Highly Satisfactory" to "Highly Unsatisfactory."

﻿components; cancellation, reinstatement or modification of components; and changes in designs and reallocation
of proceeds following higher than expected bidding outcomes (resulting from a significant increase in market
prices in the time between appraisal and the initial bidding processes). These restructurings responded to
requests by the Government of Iraq (GOI) in view of ground realities as they evolved.
Project implementation suffered systematic and significant implementation delays, both due to project level and
exogenous factors. Initially contracts were signed with an average lag of three years (as attested by the graph
below) mostly as a result of: the lack of familiarity of the PMT with Bank procedures; design changes; or
changes in initial price estimate since appraisal, changing security situation at the local level, and difficulties
finding quality bidders willing to work in Iraq. Once contracts were signed, the project encountered delays
during implementation (contract aimed to be completed in one year on average took three years to be
completed). These delays were the result of weak contract management, designs that not always matched the
situation on the ground, and serious cash flow problems facing many contractors.
Contract Management of works and consultancy contracts was a major and constant bottleneck during project
implementation Basic elements of contract management, such as: regular updates of implementation plans,
proactive management of delays, proper justification and documentation to adjust to contracts to deal with
changes in circumstances were taken care of in an ad hoc manner, and often retroactively. In addition, local
supervision consultants were at times in a very adversarial relationship with the contractor due to a lack of
understanding of their role in the process - seeing their role as being mainly to command and control the
contractor, which was another factor adding to the delays. This was further exacerbated by their time-based
contracts which provided supervision consultants with little incentive to accelerate project implementation.
Moreover, the Water and Sewerage Directorates in the governorates - even though they were part of MMPW -
often set their own conditions to contractors, such as in Beiji and Karbala, that drove up costs and delayed
project implementation. Finally, financial progress in all projects trailed far behind physical progress, having an
adverse impact on contractors' cash flow and further adding to implementation delays.
Security remained a major challenge during project implementation. The areas where the security situation was
particularly challenging saw significant delays such as but not limited to Hussainiya, Beiji, and Diyala
Governorate.

Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR mission took place from July 21 - July 29, 2008 in Jordan." The Bank
delayed the MTR to allow the PMT time for the preparation of the mid-term review report. The MTR confirmed
that the PDO as stated in the Grant Agreement were still valid. The MTR also acknowledged that the project
continued to experience delays in implementation. Drastic increases in the price of fuel and raw materials, weak
implementation capacity and prevailing security conditions in Iraq affected the pace of implementation. The
MTR focused the project mainly on the provision of water supply services, thus reducing the scope of the

﻿intervention to a much smaller number of components and decreasing some of the implementation burden of the
PMT. At the time of the MTR 14 contracts had been awarded worth US$ 73.38 million, while disbursement was
US$ 27.43 million, which was approximately 24% of the total value of the project.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design: Granted that the project was an emergency operation and much was not known at the outset, a
basic monitoring and evaluation framework was included in project design. The M&E design depended upon the
use of project supervision reports, mid-term review reports and annual implementation progress reports to
monitor and evaluate progress of the Results Framework. The design of the M&E framework on indicators
focused on measuring progress of the component (percentage of works completed per subcomponent) as output
rather than outcomes to be achieved under the project, which made it difficult to monitor PDO achievements.
However, two indicators focused on the quantity and quality of the water supplied, but no consideration of the
larger outcome of the project was taken into account. Staffing to undertake project level M&E at the PMT was
not defined and neither was the scope of monitoring activities clearly delineated at appraisal, the Technical
Annex (p.20) merely stating "will measure annually during supervision" (Technical Annex, p.20).
The (QEA7)/QAG rated "adequacy of arrangements for monitoring and evaluation" to be "satisfactory" even
when the results framework was not satisfactorily focused on "availability and quality of baseline survey" and
"evaluating impact and measuring outcomes," as rated. Most importantly, the "appropriateness of arrangement
of monitoring implementation" was also rated "satisfactory," with the comments that: "Given the emergency
nature of the project, the task team has kept the measurable indicators simple (i.e., at the output level)."
(QEA7)/QAG did flag its concerns on "Appropriateness of arrangements for monitoring poverty and social
aspects" rated "moderately satisfactory" . According to QAG, "...while keeping the project simple, and with a
view toward ensuring realism in monitoring ofpoverty and social aspects, the monitoring arrangements seem to
be too cautious in tracking social inclusion"
M&E Implementation: M&E during implementation of the project focused primarily on the physical progress
of works. Dedicated M&E staff was not available in the PMT team for most of the duration of the project. The
Bank was challenged on many fronts in regard to M&E, due to travel restrictions, project uncertainties and
changes due to security situation, but mostly because direct supervision was not possible. The Bank team
frequently reminded the PMT of its obligations on M&E. The physical progress was monitored but outputs and
outcomes were not accounted for during implementation.
Project restructuring of February 2013, focused on revising the indicators in the results framework to include
sector core indicators to better reflect project outcomes but target value were left as "to be decided (TBD)." In
the last six months of the project a dedicated M&E specialist was recruited, the results framework was
restructured to better account for outcomes, and successful efforts were made to collect and jointly review data
with the Bank, partly in preparation of the Implementation Completion Report. No formal beneficiary
assessments were conducted, but at completion ad-hoc unstructured assessments were undertaken.
M&E Utilization: M&E utilization was exclusively a compliance issue, as data was collected with the objective
to comply with World Bank requirement for monitoring the projects implementation progress and PMT's buy-in
was limited. However, at the tail end of the project, some positive improvements were observed in the PMT's
M&E activities improving to sustainable M&E post project support.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Among the Bank's Operational Policies (OP) for Safeguards, two policies were triggered. These were (i)
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), and (iii) International Waters (OP 7.50). At appraisal, the Bank had
already conducted significant generic training of counterparts, including project management, procurement,
financial management, and environmental and social safeguards, for staff members of ministries associated with
infrastructure. Further capacity building took place in the following months (World Bank organized training,
11


﻿study tours, etc.) to ensure client readiness in project implementation, and on a regular basis during
implementation, in spite of significant movement restrictions of PMT staff.
(a) Safeguards
Environment: The project triggered OP 4.01 and was classified as Category B (Partial Assessment) at appraisal
since the investments were related to civil works without significant impact to the environment. Under the
project all sub-projects were processed in accordance with the Environmental and Social Safeguards Assessment
Framework (ESSAF) for Iraq (which was disclosed in English through the InfoShop for EWSSURP in October
2004) was fairly detailed and comprehensive.
Throughout the project implementation period with the exception of the initial years, environmental Safeguard
was rated "Moderately Satisfactory" but six months before the project completion, it was downgraded to
"Moderately Unsatisfactory" mostly because: (i) a dedicated consultant was not hired by PMT to monitor
environmental safeguard and act as Safeguard Focal Point (SFP) to the PMT;12 (ii) significant concerns were
raised regarding compliance with, and enforcement of, all requirements under the Bank's Environmental and
Social Screening Assessment Framework (ESSAF); and (iii) unsatisfactory enforcement of workers and general
public health and safety procedures. These environmental safeguard issues were only flagged a year before
project closing. Iraq also due to its embargo had little experience with safeguard compliance nor was it an
included among the responsibilities of third party monitoring agent. Environmental safeguard monitoring
compliance, if undertaken during supervision regularly, was not always reported in the mission record (Aide
Memoires).
Social: At appraisal, Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) was not triggered. It was anticipated that land
acquisition and resettlement would be kept to a minimum and all land acquisition would be carried out in
accordance with the guidelines set forth in the ESSAF for Iraq. As per ESSAF guidelines, the project was not
allowed to finance any sub-projects on non-publicly owned land or allow for land acquisition as the investment
focus was rehabilitation of current assets. It was understood all works would be on land under Ministry of
Finance ownership. Contract technical specifications included provisions to provide unimpeded public access
through diversions during project construction.
International Waters: The Bank's policy on International Waterways (OP 7.50) was triggered as the project
was drawing intake water from both the Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries. At appraisal it was
determined that projects fell within the exception to notification requirement of the policy (Paragraph 7(a)) and a
"no objection" was obtained from the Regional Vice President to this effect. Compliance with this Bank's policy
was considered Satisfactory as no issues were raised during implementation.
(b) Fiduciary Compliance
Procurement: Procurement implementation was a major factor in implementation delays. Nationally in Iraq
there were some non-compliant procurement procedures and practices in place. These included: inadequate
requirements for registration of suppliers and contractors; insufficiently transparent and fair debarment
procedures; continued use of obsolete methods and procedures for procurement of goods and works and
selection of consultants; undue restrictions on access to bidding documents; absence of adequate national
bidding documents; insufficiently transparent bid submission; opening and evaluation procedures and contract
award procedures; lack of effective bid protest mechanisms on contract awards; and lack of effective contract
12 In the last ISR (June 2013) it was noted that the PMT has now hired an environmental consultant, who is improving
subproject EA/EMP quality and EMP monitoring and compliance. EMP enforcement of workers and general public health
and safety procedures remains uneven and under documented.
12


﻿management. Additionally, the Global Integrity Report points out that there is no law governing conflicts of
interest for public procurement.
Financial Management: A FMA was employed for third party monitoring purposes to help ensure compliance
with fiduciary requirements. This was very helpful, as the contractor became familiar with Bank procedures and
was able to allocate the required resources when necessary. However, at the beginning, the project suffered from
frequent turnover of PMT staff which added to the lack of understanding of World Bank guidelines, inaccurate
accounting records, significant delays in replenishing expenditures from the World Bank, and delays in
reconciling project records with the World Bank Client Connection. The frequent moves of the PMT office
within the MMPW further exacerbated the problem as data files kept on moving. However, the overall
performance of the financial management team improved during the later stages of project implementation as
PMT familiarity with Bank procedures increased.
Disbursement. The project suffered from payment delays, especially payments in Iraqi Dinars (IDQ), mainly
due to: (i) the weak banking system in Iraq, (ii) lack of familiarity of consultants and contractors with
internationally accepted business practices, especially the monthly submission of invoices and full
documentation of invoices, (iii) limited capacity within the PMT for management, and (iv) unavailability of
Designated Accounts for the project. Moreover, the project did not benefit from electronic signature during most
of the life of the project and had to send hard copies of documents to India and later Europe. This heavy
administrative process put an extra burden on the PMT and Bank staff.
Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA). The fiduciary monitoring agent (FMA) employed by the Bank to assist in
fiduciary management, was effectively operating within the scope of their terms of reference. FMA staff visited
the PMTs two to three times per month on average to: (i) review the PMTs' IFRs and reconcile their records
with the Bank records; (ii) monitor unclaimed expenditures; (iii) verify disbursement plan updates; and (iv)
provide on-the-job training in FM matters. The FMA included the PMT-prepared IFRs in their quarterly reports,
as well as the adjusted IFRs (with their review comments and recommendations for the PMT IFRs). IFRs were
submitted in a timely manner. The FMA also conducted, on a sample basis, pre-screening and post-review of
withdrawal applications for direct payments and reimbursements. FMA technical staff visited all sites on a
regular basis to carry out physical verification with reporting and digital evidence of on-going works and
alerting the Bank on deficiencies in quality and complementation. The World Bank staff had the FMA staff
participating in all supervision missions.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
During the final stages of implementation, the PMT was regularly reminded that any works that were not
completed by Project closing would have to be financed and completed under the MMPW's direct
responsibility, and that follow-up was needed to ensure that the works can be completed accordingly.
Two subprojects were not fully completed by Project Closing date. In Karbala, one element of the works, the
pumping stations for stormwater drainage was not fully completed. By the project closing date, 10 percent of
the work on the pumping stations was still to be completed. The contractor has worked since the project closing
date to finalize the works - with minor items still to be completed by December 2013. In the case of the intake
for Al-Hussainiya, the MMPW decided to terminate the contracts with contractor and consultant. A committee
has been set up and is currently assessing what remaining works still need to be undertaken. The next step will
be for the Directorate of Water in the govemorate to use this assessment to request a budget allocation to
complete the remaining works and employ contractors and consultants. The work on the water intake (Package
I) was 72 percent completed. The Government is committed to finalize the works but time is needed to employ a
new contractor to complete the works.
During implementation, the main focus was on dealing with the significant complexities of achieving results in
the difficult Iraqi circumstances, and little attention was given to institutional reform and capacity-building as
prerequisites to the sustainable operation and maintenance of the investments financed by the Project. Yet, the
significance of this has become increasingly clear to MMPW management. The MMPW is currently also
13


﻿implementing another water project through funded through an IDA Credit. The MMPW has in their ICR report
and also in their response to the ICR layout the importance of large-scale technical training of operators of water
and wastewater infrastructure in Iraq. The Client has requested that a certification program will be funded under
the proposed Technical Assistance and Capacity Building Fund.     The financial sustainability of the
infrastructure is an issue as tariffs are very low, but the Government transfers to the sector are significant.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High
The objective was highly relevant to Iraq's reconstruction and development priorities as an emergency project,
and was clear on the reconstruction of physical assets, especially the water and sanitation infrastructure and
services, and capacity building. The Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2013-2016 also identified: poor
public service delivery (including water) as a major source of discontent for the Iraqi people and poor water
quality and sanitation are also serious concerns in the key development challenges facing Iraq. The project's
objectives remain consistent with the Bank's CPS 2013-2016, and directly respond to two out of three broad
result areas of engagement mainly: supporting economic diversification for broadly-shared prosperity, and
improving social inclusion and reducing poverty which identifies: improved delivery of water supply services,
and strengthened infrastructure services as clear CPS outcomes.
The project's objectives also align with the Government's National Development Plan (2013- 2017), a medium-
term development strategy aimed at providing a framework for the country's sustainable development. One of
the goals of the Iraq National Development Plan is to reduce poverty through amongst others the provision of
basic services. The government's policy is still to improve access to drinking water with a major focus on
rehabilitation and serving the Governorates where the water shortages are highest, whereas access to safe
sanitation is also a major issue that the government wants to address. The project focused mainly on
rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing systems as outlined in the National Development Plan. Many of the
sub-projects were concentrated in areas where water shortages were highest. Therefore, the objective, design
and implementation remain highly relevant to the country and sector context.
The relevance of design and implementation was Modest. The scope of design was simple, but ambitious, both
geographically as well as front loaded with 13 components. The scope of project design was carefully calibrated
to focus all investments and efforts on the urgent rehabilitation of infrastructure, while enshrining the need to
build capacity to implement and operate the infrastructure. The project was fully consistent with the then Interim
Strategy Note, which also emphasized the need for rapid rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and services,
short-term employment generation and institutional capacity building as pre-requisite for long-term sustainable
recovery (Technical Annex p.3). The results framework accounted for all the components, and investment
allocations were made such that they focused on poorer neighborhoods as well geo politically allocated
investments across Iraq.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The PDO essentially consists of one part and focused on: Restoring basic water supply, sanitation, and urban
services for urban areas outside the city ofBaghdad to be implemented through a two pronged approach: (i) the
reconstruction, rehabilitation, and upgrading of such facilities and municipal infrastructure in urban areas
outside the city of Baghdad; and (ii) the provision of capacity building support through training and technical
assistance.
Rating: Substantial
14


﻿The project successfully accomplished its PDO of restoring basic water supply and sanitation services through
emergency response as well rebuilding and rehabilitation, supported substantially through "on the job" training.
Infrastructure investments in urban areas outside the city of Baghdad assisted in connecting neighborhoods to
water, sewerage, stormwater and road networks and benefitted 1,030,718 people directly impacting their quality
of lives, well-being, and health. Of the total number of direct beneficiaries, 507,711 beneficiaries were female.13
Outputs:
-  Water supply production capacity increased 9,895 m3/hour. The achieved water production capacity was
slightly below the target value of 1 0,000m3/hour.
-   Increase in the quantity of water produced in the project cities increased to 178,644 m3/day. The
achieved quantity of water produced was at least 49% more than then the target value of 120,000m3/day.
-  Additionally under the project 372 km of water supply network got rehabilitated, and 20.3 km of
sewerage network was installed; and 28km of roads were completed.
-   In addition, the project supplied 230 pumps of varying capacities, 126 chlorinators of varying capacities
and 15 backhoe wheel loaders to assist in the maintenance of water supply systems
-   Man-month training provided through the project -A total of 276 man-month of training was provided
over 8.5 year of project implementation, against a target of 300 man-month - almost 8% less than the
target was achieved. Virtually all of this training was provided as "on-the-job" training provided to the
PMT and the Water and Sewer Directorates by the FMA agents, the Bank, contractor and suppliers.
The Bank staff organized a set of formal trainings to the PMT for at least a total of 10 months, mostly
funded through other than project resources.
Outcomes:
Beneficiary population -. Overall the project provided improved access to water supply and sanitation for
690,718 people, and 340,000 people directly benefitted from urban rehabilitation investments (access to all
season road and/or storm water drainage, including an estimated 45,000 benefiting from stormwater services in
Karbala through a bypass), Of the total number of direct beneficiaries, 507,113 beneficiaries were female. These
beneficiaries' estimates may be on the conservative side as the population data for several of the sub-projects are
hard to verify in the absence of recent census data (the latest census dates back at least two decades).
Tourist Population (secondary beneficiary population) - At appraisal it was estimated that investment in
Karbala would indirectly also benefit the tourists in the Saif Said area. These tourists are likely to be a fraction
of the around 3 to 4 million per year that visit Karbala. This number once again is a conservative estimate.
According to Iraq Business News (November 2013) City of Karbala attracts more than 12 million visitors
annually.14
Household Connected - Around 23,503 new households connected to the water distribution network, and
approximately 2,061 households to sewerage network.
Accrued health and other benefits - Between 2000 and 2011, UNICEF conducted three surveys in Iraq, which
amongst others looked into water and sanitation access and diarrhea incidence. According to these surveys,
diarrhea incidence decreased between 2000 and 2011. It also noted that the sharpest declines were registered in
Erbil, Salahaddin and Baghdad Govemorates - all govemorates where the Bank worked. Yet, in Karbala
govemorate, diarrhea incidence increased between 2000 and 2011 and in Missan Govemorate - where the Bank
undertook a small project in Al Majar villages - diarrhea incidence marginally increased. As the diarrhea

could be found for Baghdad.

﻿incidence is still high, it is clear that access to reliable water and wastewater services remains of critical
importance to improving households' welfare.
Capacity Gains - Due to low staff retention the built capacity under the project was not always sufficiently
retained by the PMT.
Short -term employment - It is not quantifiable but the project did generate some gains in short-term
employment as a result of the physical works undertaken during the project implementation.
3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial
The economic and financial benefits of this project were not quantified at appraisal (Technical Annex p.20), as
this was an emergency operation (as allowed under OP8.50). However, a case was made that the project
investment was economically viable as: more than two million people would benefit from the improvement in
the water, sanitation and other urban services made possible in towns and cities outside Baghdad. Wastewater
currently discharged in rivers and streams would be reduced thus lessening the risk of epidemics due to
waterborne diseases (typhoid etc.). Other accrued benefits were due to increase labor productivity due to
reduced burden of disease of the population. In addition to ensure sustainability, the project provided for
capacity building in accounting, financial management information systems, billing, collection and tariff. In
addition, with a forecasted investment of US$ 90 million and 2 million beneficiaries, the per capita project cost
was estimated at US$45. Therefore given the high positive externalities for investment of this type, the project
was expected ex-ante to be cost effective.
In the absence of an economic and financial analysis at project appraisal, the analysis made at project
completion can only be limited in scope as there is no baseline to compare the results with. In addition access to
project sites was still not possible due to travel restrictions in Iraq at the time of project completion.
Most of the works referred to improvements in access to piped water supply, while a subset of projects (Badawa
and Karbala) also provided improvements in access to sewer services, stormwater drainage and access to roads.
We hence made a very rapid appraisal of the costs of the systems, assuming that the operation and maintenance
cost of the system would add 5 percent of the investment costs'5. The number of beneficiaries used in this rapid
assessment is discussed in the previous Section 3.2 and Annex 2, while we used the government standard of
providing water of 350 led with a wastewater flow of 90 percent. 16 Project delays are included in these
calculations as actual work under either of these schemes did not start until 2008. Under these assumptions, the
following conclusions can be reached:
Water Supply Investments:
-   The net present value of the total cost per person served over the lifetime of the project of 25 years is
US$22.51;
-   The net present value of the cost of water supplied is US$0.176 per cubic meter;
1s The 5 percent of investment costs as a proxy for operation and maintenance costs is rather high in view of the large
inefficiencies currently being experienced as reflected in very low staff productivity (i.e., high number of employees per
connection served). The per capita cost assumes no increase in population served, whereas the systems have the capacity to
serve future population growth.

﻿- Consumers before rehabilitation were relying on tankers and were reportedly spending 20 percent of
their family income on water. In such a context, the cost benefit ratio - even before taking into
consideration any externalities - is positive;
- In summary, this investment is a very cost-effective one if compared to an average price of water supply
infrastructure of US$1.0617 as mentioned in the literature.
Other municipal investments:
-   The net present value of the total cost per person served over the lifetime of the investment of 25 years
is US$18.73;
-   In such a context, the cost benefit ratio - even before taking into consideration any externalities - is
likely to be positive
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The project successfully delivered on its project development objective to restore basic water supply, sanitation
and urban services for urban areas outside the city of Baghdad under a very difficult context. Overall the project
benefitted more than 1 million people. The project did suffer from some delays and increased costs for reasons
explained above, but effectively stayed on course toward emergency rebuilding of infrastructure in towns
outside Baghdad. The project positively dealt with many unknowns in post conflict/ongoing conflict
environment, resulted in almost full disbursement, and a full completion that is being assessed conservatively to
be modest.
Relevance of the objectives is rated High, and design is rated Modest. The objective "Restore basic water supply
and sanitation services for the urban areas outside the city ofBaghdad" is rated Substantial. Overall, efficiency
is rated as Substantial. As a result, the overall Project Outcome is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project was focused on serving these areas where the poor are very well represented. In a World Bank
study on confronting poverty in Iraq, the governorates covered by the project had high poverty headcount
indices, notably Al-Muthanna, Salahhadin (Al-Hussainiya, Beiji), Karbala, Diyala and rural Missan (Majar).
Although Erbil govemorate has a low poverty headcount index, the project in that govemorate was targeted to
slum upgrading.
Based on the same Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) - UNICEF access of the poorest quintile in Iraq of
"Piped into Dwelling" increased almost 30 times from 9.2 percent to 31.1 percent; and "Piped into Compound,
Yard, or Plot" increased almost 10 times from 3.6 percent to 10.5 percent from 2001 to 2011. This was a huge
accomplishment towards targeting the poor for access to water services. These outcomes cannot be fully
attributed to project investments, but the project may have made some contribution.
17 Whittington, Dale, W. Michael Hanemann, Claudia Sadoff and Marc Jeuland, 2009. The Challenge of Improving Water
and Sanitation Services in Less Developed Countries. Foundations and Trends In Microeconomics, Vol.4, pp. 469-609. In
this the authors calculate the basic cost of water and wastewater and come up with a price of about USD 2.50 (assuming a
NPV of 10 percent), of which USD 1.06 is linked to water supply production and distribution, and the rest to wastewater
collection, treatment and disposal.
17


﻿Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project included technical assistance and capacity building to especially PMT staff. Although the project
provided generic training during project preparation and implementation, this generic training turned out to be
possibly too generic for the staff receiving the training whose capacity was very weak. Staff turnover further
limited the retention of this knowledge. Although the issues with contract management improved, they
remained bottlenecks until the end of project implementation.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
One of the visible unintended outcome of the Project is the success of combining urban rehabilitation with the
restoration of water distribution services, as implemented in Badawa, in the suburbs of Erbil, the biggest and
fastest-growing city in the Kurdistan Regional Government. The general improvement of urban services led to a
rapid improvement in the quality of life in that neighborhood, resulting in noticeable economic and rapid
demographic growth, and an increase in real estate values.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not Applicable. A beneficiary survey was not conducted or programmed under implementation. However, the
PMT included a number of beneficiary random ad-hoc surveys while preparing their completion report. The
major outcome of these surveys is that in generally there is significant satisfaction with the outcomes of the
project. Yet, in some cases beneficiaries noted that due to the major energy shortages, the water systems pumps
less water than it should.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
At completion, not all works were completed. It is likely that works will be completed using counterpart
funding, for example: the completion of works on the pumping station in Karbala; the completion of works on
the water intake and water treatment plant in Al Hussainiya; the sustained rehabilitation of the pumping station
in Diyala using the goods provided under the project. Conversely, the likelihood that these works are not
completed, or that completed works are not operated and maintained in a satisfactory manner, or that
improvements in water services received by beneficiaries are not maintained, is high. This is due to: inefficient
sector governance is a large, as institutional reform has not yet been initiated and the sector is still marred by
low technical and fiduciary capacity; an inefficient financial model where water tariffs are grossly inadequate
(even though the Government funds the Water and Sewer Directorates to operate the infrastructure, and where
the capacity for proper financial and asset management is still low. In addition, the difficult security situation
remains a major challenge. Whereas, in Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), the likelihood of a similar
outcome is moderate as there is higher capacity, more appetite for reform and much less severe security
challenges. Therefore, overall the risk to development outcome is high.
18


﻿5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank's performance during preparation is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank adequately responded to
sector and country demands with the objective to help Iraq's developmental and reconstruction priorities. The
simple design was geographically spread and front loaded with many components. The design carefully
calibrated to respond to immediate needs, both with regard to investment and capacity, in order to restore basic
water supply and sanitation services to urban areas outside the city of Baghdad. The urgency with which the
project was prepared did not always allow the project team to focus on all elements of project preparation. As a
result, in an environment where much was not known due to years of isolation and conflict, the project was
prepared well within these constraints. The technical annex and ESSAF were fairly detailed. Lack of
information precluded full preparation for capacity building, financial and economic analysis, monitoring and
evaluation and contingency planning for a situation of security deterioration (despite a clear identification of
these risks at design), but this was also in line with working on emergency projects.
In essence the project design hinged on the assumption that project implementation would happen in a post-
conflict environment, which did not materialize during the life of the project. The Bank did not have any
precedent in this context when the reality in Iraq, especially in Baghdad turned out to be that project
implementation continued in a conflict situation. At the outset the scope of the Third Party monitoring was
designed to palliate the inability of Bank teams to supervise the Project on the ground, but their terms of
reference had a limited scope that essentially did not compensate for the lack of Bank in-country supervision
(especially with regard to safeguard compliance and project monitoring).
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank's performance during implementation is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank essentially operated
in an environment where it did not have any precedent (conflict situation) and did not have the tools to respond
adequately. The Bank team supported the implementation of the Project during extraordinarily difficult
circumstances, which were only partially foreseen at appraisal.
The Bank was continually challenged on the implementation front; as a result it was constantly in a response
mode throughout the implementation period and grappled with many hurdles. The deterioration of the security
situation quickly prohibited any field missions and hindered the team's capacity to perform direct supervision of
implementation progress. As a result the Bank team had to rely on third parties that were working under a terms
of reference of limited scope focusing on procurement, physical verification of works and financial
management. In spite of these circumstances, the team met regularly with counterparts and was proactive in
assessing the evolution of the situation and proposing adjustments as a result to deal with the construction of the
infrastructure. The Bank team invested significantly in supervision support to deal with the capacity gaps and
constantly provide on-the-job advice with field staff providing continuous support. It also provided training
wherever it could - in view of the small project budget and spent major efforts to secure other funding sources
to provide support for capacity building. Monitoring of activities was mainly related to the on-going physical
progress with little emphasis on outcomes. The project was diligently and timely restructured four times in
response to project changes as they surfaced, and compliance with fiduciary was adequate but M&E and
safeguard monitoring left room for improvement. Monitoring of activities was mainly related to the on-going
physical output progress with little emphasis on outcomes but was revised at the end of project implementation.
19


﻿Capacity building activities - apart from on-the-job training - were mostly to familiarize PMT staff with Bank
procedures and improve contract management. Very little was invested in the way of institutional change, gap
analysis, technical training, etc. as this was neither explicitly requested by the borrower nor forcefully proposed
by the Bank - partially linked to the lack of funding to fund such activities (as due to the constantly changing
environment on the ground, a large contingency fund remained necessary) and the high cost of conventional
training in an conflict environment as many qualified trainers were not willing to travel to Iraq was challenging.
Despite the lack of an enabling environment, the implementing agency and the Bank were able to deliver most
of the project output s, and by the end of the project almost 1 million people were provided with improved urban
services. In hindsight, there were some shortcomings which should be considered in the extremely difficult
environment in which the project was implemented as the "growing pains" or "learning opportunity" of working
in a conflict environment.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project was a timely response to realities on the ground in Iraq. The urgency with which the project was
prepared did not enable the team - especially in an environment where much was not known - to ensure that the
project was fully ready to be implemented as it relied on the assumption that a post-conflict environment would
materialize once the project would be implemented. When this crucial assumption did not materialize, the Bank
was left with a very limited set of instruments to undertake project implementation. The project did suffer delays
during implementation, mostly a consequence of factors relating to security and ongoing conflict. The Bank
team responded proactively to issues that arose during implementation and adapted to the unpredictable
circumstances in Iraq, but not all of its efforts in finding alternative solutions were equally successful. World
Bank support to the Government of Iraq in preparing and implementing the project is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory as the Bank was able to perform and deliver on the project outputs and outcomes. Most importantly,
the project responded directly to the Borrower's rebuilding needs in a timely and responsive manner, despite the
lack of enabling environment, directly benefitting around one million people (directly and indirectly) in urban
areas outside Baghdad.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
At appraisal, the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW) was created, out of the Civil Services
Division of the Iraq Interior Ministry, to be responsible for the provision of all municipal services, except for
electricity and telecommunications. The aim of the Ministry was to decentralize service delivery and
administrative organization for increasing water supply coverage, reducing unaccounted for water, and
increasing sewerage coverage, and responding to issues and interests expressed by local councils. Overall, it was
mired in the same difficulties faced by most public sector institutions and it mainly focused on increasing water
supply and sewerage coverage, with little regard for the other elements of its mission. Although the Ministry
strongly supported the project and its objectives are aligned with the National Development Strategy, support
wavered slightly during implementation which resulted in implementation delays when the government refused
to pay for taxes incurred by contractors and consultants.
20


﻿(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Within the MMPW the project implementation was undertaken by the Project Management Team (PMT).
Administrative and bureaucratic constrains impeded efficient project progress. Staff turnover remained high and
as a result capacity retention was lower than anticipated, whereas embedded incentives to retain staff were either
weak or non-existent. The PMT during implementation was stretched, not only because lagging capacity
constraints, but the staff seconded to the PMT in reality was performing two jobs without adequate
compensation which caused strain, drop in morale, lack of effectiveness, and staff turnover, directly impacting
implementation. Moreover, it turned out to be difficult to attract environmental and legal staff, even as
consultants, given the dearth of such specialists. Additional exogenous factors included continued lack of
clarity with respect to tax treatment, transportation and interbank payment delays in Iraq Dinar. It should be
taken into account that the PMT worked under very difficult conditions that included amongst others a 2009
bombing in which MMPW sustained severe damage which also affected project documentation availability.
The initially weak capacity of PMT staff, though built up during the Project, was compounded by frequent
turnover of staff. As a result, shortcomings in contractor and consultant management were pervasive. Inefficient
contract management (weak monitoring of contract implementation, belated extension of closing date, erratic
payment of invoices, etc.) generated significant uncertainty and cash flow problems for contractors, who were in
turn dis-incentivized to perform remaining works. The PMT relied heavily on supervision consultants. Yet, it
did not always call into question the performance of these consultants, in turn dis-incentivizing some of them
from working towards the successful completion of the Project. These factors combined to create a situation
with a significant misalignment of incentives towards the completion of components. In addition safeguard
compliance was an issue due to lack of dedicated staff, and a subsequent lack of attention with regard to
safeguard compliance and monitoring in accordance with ESSAF.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the Government's commitment to
achieve the Project Development's Objective, their continued staffing of the PMT, but also taking into account
delays in project implementation, all this within the context of lack of a proper enabling environment.
6. Lessons Learned
Iraq significantly challenged the Bank's ability to perform successfully in post conflict-states under O.P 8.50.
The Bank's tools to mitigate risks were limited in Iraq, when the post-conflict environment did not materialize.
Even though the Bank had identified the risk of on-going conflict, it did not include sufficient contingency
planning as to how to operate in such an environment. In addition, the spread of subprojects was not only
geographic (covering amongst others govemorates where security remained very challenging), but also was
ambitious is covering different subsectors especially in view of the limited capacity of the implementing agency.
The Bank's experience and its instruments to deal with such a situation were limited; the teams were mostly
reliant on the FMA and on restructuring (which is not a very flexible tool, is time consuming and requires a
formal client request which can be difficult to obtain in conflict-affected situations).  The number of
restructurings could have been reduced if a more flexible approach in the definition of project components had
been applied (with for instance one investment component instead of each subproject defined into a project
component). Postponing project readiness to implementation is moving delays from the preparation to
implementation phase.
Need to examine trade-off between risk mitigation measures and speed of implementation/achievement of
development outcomes. The Bank often has to make difficult trade-offs in conflict areas between risk
21


﻿mitigation and implementation expediency. For example, the lack of a designated account (put in place as a risk
mitigation measure) meant that all payments were to be processed by the Bank team, and similarly virtually all
procurement was made under prior review procedures, and this added to the transaction costs of implementation
in terms of time needed to achieve project goals. Considering these trade-offs during project preparation may
result in a more realistic assessment of project implementation period.
The Bank should consider expanding the role and scope of the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) to
respond effectively to the ground realities. Under the project FMA scope was limited to physical verification,
procurement and financial management and did not include safeguard compliance and project monitoring or
technical supervision. Project experience confirms that in situations where the Bank cannot go on field visits,
and hence the accessibility to project implementation monitoring is limited, the scope of the FMA activities to
assist in project supervision should be expanded to encompass all project aspects if possible. It should also be
noted that in conflict-affected countries such as Iraq, technical and managerial capacity may not be available in
the local consulting market to a degree sufficient to substitute for Bank team supervision. Nevertheless, in such
an environment, while the Bank regularly assessed the effectiveness of the FMA, it might have usefully
explored the possibility of expanding the scope of their Terms of Reference beyond fiduciary monitoring alone.
Capacity building should not be bundled with technical assistance. In hindsight since the allocation for
capacity building under the project was bundled with technical assistance, the actual allocation of funds to
capacity building was limited especially as the implementation delays required more funds for technical
assistance. In future projects, the capacity building budget allocation should be independently dedicated.
Conflict situation calls for thinking about M&E differently. Project experience shows that M&E of an
emergency operation may not incorporate the necessary rigor at the preparation stage as the project preparation
is not based on a comprehensive sector review. In the case of Iraq, monitoring was further complicated by the
lack of reliable data. M&E should be given due priority for reassessment during implementation. Additionally
M&E should focus equally on outputs and outcomes, should be kept simple, and target values should be
established. Most importantly, the project should facilitate client capacity to assume these responsibilities from
the beginning of the project to foster a target- and results-driven mindset for the project. A simple beneficiary
assessment should be a standard part of Bank preparation and implementation to validate project results.
The cost of doing business in conflict areas is high. Supervision in a conflict environment is costly, as is
reflected in the high cost of supervision and the dependence on FMA. Hence, in such an environment it is
important that the Bank is very selective in its operations and focuses its interventions on working with those
agencies that have implementation capacity.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors
(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies
Comments were received from the Borrower on December 19, 2013. They advised the Bank on certain
corrections, which were incorporated and an updated version of their ICR has been incorporated in the
document. A table for outputs and outcomes was also provided, which has been filed in the project folder.
In addition, the implementing agency provided the following lessons learned from implementing the
project:
-  It is recommended that the World Bank is to re-evaluate and revise its "List of Criteria" or the T.o.R. in
respect  to the Criteria of selection of Consultants and Contracting Companies, because; the
implementation of the Project has faced serious shortages in both; qualifications and past experiences for
working sites constructions and planning.
22


﻿-  It is recommended that the World Bank wouldn't allow the participating of the same bidder or bidders for
more than a single sub-project.
-  It is recommended that the World Bank concentrates in the directions of massive field trainings for
engineers and technicians in the sectors of: designs, maintaining and repairing of stages such: hydraulics,
electrical, mechanical and chemical in parallel to the Project's implementation on-going phase.
-  A point which must be mentioned that; the PMT has carried out the required tasks though slowly, but in a
good manner keeping the standard level, as much as they have been authorized, and it is acceptable that in
general the officially things move slowly.
-  It is preferable that the World Bank would keep experienced engineers in the fields of at least Water and
Sewerage systems for bilateral consultation though from remote.
-  It is recommended that the World Bank is to sense earlier the progress behavior and precautions of any of
the under-construction components, and try earlier to mitigate such a risk, and to search for the right
solution or solutions to avoid any possible collapse in the completion schedule.
-  It is recommended that the World Bank is not to delay decisions whenever there is an ongoing construction
on the real ground.
- The work links, strategies and dialogues between the World Bank and the Implementing agency must be
upgraded in a way that each party integrates the other, i.e. (One team spirit).
-  It is recommended that the World Bank is to select a computer's Software program for project's financing
control just for the accountancy office, for, the current adopted system is brittle and subject to un-sensed
mistakes and missing financial peripherals, such software should impost the feeding of all the relevant
figures for each individual contract independently.
- It is a very good practice to hire a third part consultant to verify for the undocumented Contractual claims.
- It is recommended that the World Bank would never drop an incomplete component for whichever to be the
reason, components have to be completed once have commenced.
- It is recommended that the World Bank would help in appointing for the missing qualified individual, the
PMT was not able to hire a "Legal Advisor"for the project in spite of the several announces.

﻿Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Introduction
The project at appraisal was conceived very differently from as the project that was eventually implemented.
Several factors that affected all project components during implementation were: (i) radical change in the
macroeconomic climate between project appraisal and project implementation; (ii) the endurance of the conflict
and the ensuing lack of safety in many parts of the country; and (iii) a legal and regulatory environment that was
biased towards the private sector.
Changes in the macroeconomic environment. The project was prepared in 2004, just after the war started, in an
environment with scant and unreliable data dating back from an era in which prices were heavily state
controlled. After 2003, the economy started to liberalize all prices, with the exception of energy and some food
items. In addition, the country suffered from supply bottlenecks and conflict that resulted in an acceleration of
inflation between 2003 and 2006, averaging close to 40% annually (see figure below). By the end of 2007,
although inflation was brought under control, but high inflation in the earlier project years resulted in a sharp
increase in overall price levels compared to the estimates at project appraisal. As a result of high inflation,
project components ended up being significantly more expensive than as originally planned.

The endurance of the conflict. The intensity of the conflict in Iraq has varied over the years, and lack of
security has remained a major concern. The lack of safety has had profound impact on project implementation,
making it difficult to attract high quality contractors and consultants. Especially during the project's early years
international contractors and consultants proved impossible to attract (with bidding process not attracting any, or
sufficient bidders). At the same time, in a country where the private sector is underdeveloped, the capacity of
local contractors to bid for works - especially larger ones - has been limited. The lack of supply of high quality
staff to implement projects resulted in extended time needed to award contracts as often several rounds of
bidding were necessary, resulting higher bid prices to account for the lack of security in the country that exceed
the budgets allocated at appraisal. To deal with the limited local capacity and lack of interest of international
bidders, solutions were introduced; such as splitting contracts into a set of smaller contracts to attract local
contractors; and the use of joint ventures. However, these strategies were not without costs as the capacity of
local contractors turned out to be highly variable (as is shown in the relatively frequent use of early contract
terminations and long implementation periods), while the burden on project management to supervise a larger
series of small contracts increased. The use of joint ventures was often not very successful as the lack of legal
26


﻿clarity in these joint venture agreements often resulted in one of the partners disappearing affecting the financial
capabilities of the remaining partner.

Note: 2013 data pertain the period from January 1 - September 15, 2013 from www.iraqbodycount.org
The lack of security was also reflected in the quality of engineering designs and implementation. As consultants
prepared the designs, the lack of security often did not make it possible to go to the sites. A number of designs
were made using remote sensing data, but the lack of ability to calibrate the satellite data with the situation at the
site - in combination with the long delays in awarding contracts - resulted in the need to often significantly
change the design while it was being implemented; resulting in higher costs and implementation delays. During
implementation, the lack of security resulted at work being interrupted at times - both at the site and at the
Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works (which in 2007 was bombed with ministerial staff being killed and
wounded).
The regulatory environment is still not very favourable to the private sector. The limited capacity of local
contractors and consultants was further aggravated by regulation that often was not very conducive to doing
business. The Bank's "Doing Business" report of 2013 ranked Iraq still as very low in the ease of doing
business. Contractors and consultants were operating in an environment of byzantine rules and regulations and
a government not at all familiar with international business practices.
Component 1: Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Karbala Water and Sewerage Systems (appraisal amount
US$21.94 million; additional financing amount: US$11.50 million; actual US$8.7 million). This component
would finance the rehabilitation and upgrading of water and sewerage systems in selected parts of the city of
Karbala, including rehabilitation of two treatment plants, the distribution network, and trunk and lateral sewer
lines.
This component as originally planned during appraisal was abandoned as the Government of Iraq only started
implementation of the component in 2005 due to critical nature of the water and sewer situation in Karbala's
shrine area, where the project was located. The scope of this project was replaced at project appraisal by the
rehabilitation and upgrading of the sewer and storm networks in Saif Saad quarter in Karbala.
27


﻿This component took much longer to implement than originally anticipated for a multitude of reasons. First, the
winning bid under the contract was much lower, than the second placed bid received -the ensuing result that the
contractor faced cash flow problems from the start. Second, the works progress in Saif Saad was continuously
affected by works that started on the Imam Ali road overpass. Due to the ongoing road construction, a detour
route was set up in Saif Saad quarter impeding the contractor's access to the works, while the religious festivals
in Karbala (as an important religious centre) were on-going, limiting the access of the contractor for
implementation of works. Third, the demand for sewer was so high, that even before full completion of works,
households started to illegally dump their wastewater in the manholes, resulting in sewer overflows that the
contractor was obliged to pump out as the Sewer Directorate was unwilling to enforce the existing regulation to
avoid illegal dumping of wastewater. Finally, the unfamiliarity to work under contractual agreements by
contractor, supervision consultant, the Sewer Directorate of Karbala and the PMT was a major source of the
long implementation delays. The contract was originally signed for US$8.7 million which was with variation
orders increased to US$9.8 million.
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Outputs:
-   Completed 20.3 km of sewer network, with 2,061 house connections in Said Saif quarter;
-   Completed 14 km of stormwater network covering Saif Said and 19 other quarters in the south-east of
Karbala and two pumping stations (the latter of which were mostly completed at project closing). At
project closing, the stormwater and sewer network had been handed over to the Sewer Directorate of
Karbala.
Outcome:
At completion, the project directly benefitted a population of 14,442 people with sewer services and stormwater
network. Although the pump stations were not fully completed at completion, the stormwater main was being
used through a bypass to an already existing pump station, as a result benefitting another 19 quarters adjacent to
Saif Saad for their stormwater disposal, benefitting an additional population of 149,100 people. At the time of
the closing, 45,000 people were benefiting from the works through a bypass.
Component 2: Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Majar Water Supply System (appraisal amount US$3.16
million; additional financing amount: US$2.15 million; actual US$2.6 million). This component would finance
the rehabilitation and upgrading of Majar water supply system, including supply and installation of water
treatment units, distribution networks, pumping stations and house connections.
This component was located in Majar district of Maysan Governorate, to provide water to two of the poorest
villages (Mabroko and Al-Yarmook villages). The project aimed to supply and install two water treatment units
each with a capacity of 200 cubic meter per hour, 9 km of transmission lines, and distribution networks. The
works were completed in 2009. The water authorities have divided the towns' drinking water network into
sectors of which each sector covers several living areas, and are linked via gate valves, so they can be switched
when facing any emergency failure in one of the purification units. The work was delayed for two reasons; (i) a
serious earth collapse with the groundwater tank required a redesign of the tank; and (ii) as the two villages are
located at opposite sides of the river, the distance between the two sites - where worked started simultaneously
- resulted in extra time needed to implement the works. The works have been operational for the past four years.
The contract was originally signed for US$ 2.63 million.
Rating: Satisfactory

﻿Outputs:
-  Completed of 19 km drinking water network in Mabrooka (11.1km) and Al Yarmook (7.9km)
-  The project provided two water treatment units with each a capacity of 200 cubic meter per hour,
contributing 400m3/h assured supply of water.
Outcome:
-  This component directly benefitted a population of 28,023 in the two villages of Mabrooka (18,970
people) and Al Yarmook (9,053 people), and a 60 bed hospital, and at least one school.
-  This component provided 3,405 household connections to the water network in the two villages of Al
Mabrooka (2,305 households) and Al Yarmook (1,100 households).
-  Based on a random ad-hoc survey (July 2013) found that satisfaction level to of the beneficiaries to be at
65.7% with the level of service in Al Majar (this component), which confirms lower than average
service quality due to frequent electrical power interruptions affecting pumping water has direct
consequences on the opinion of the people.
Component 3: Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Beji Water Supply System (appraisal amount US$1.83
million; additional financing amount: US$0 million; actual US$8.3 million). This component would finance the
rehabilitation and upgrading of Beji water supply system, including supply and installation of water treatment
units, the rehabilitation of distribution networks, and house connections.
This component was located in Beiji district of Salahaddin Governorate, aimed to provide water to two of the
poorest villages Albu To'ama and Al-Hajjaj villages. The project would supply and install two water treatment
units with each a capacity of 200 cubic meter per hour and a distribution network totalling 35 km. This project
was only awarded in January 2011 due to the difficult security situation. The Governorate in Salahaddin is still
under Level 4 of the UN. This component was omitted in the 2008 restructuring, but added back in 2009
restructuring with US$5.5 million commitment.
The work was delayed for the following reasons; (i) the Water Directorate in Beiji rejected the concrete samples
several times; (iii) samples of network pipe failed in the quality tests and required the contractor to remedy the
issue; and (iii) a severe - and very rare - flooding took place in the spring of 2013 that resulted in minor damage
but much cleanup work for the contractor. The contract was originally signed for US$ 7.2 million which with
variation orders increased to US$7.8 million.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Outputs:
-  Completed of 51.3 km drinking water distribution network in Al-Hajaj (25.7km) and Albu To'ama
(25.6km)
-  The project provided two water treatment units with each a capacity of 200 cubic meter per hour,
contributing 400m3/h assured supply of water.
Outcome:
-  This component directly benefitted a population of 22,253 in the two villages of Albu To'ama (9,762
people) and Al-Hajjaj (12,491 people)
-  This component provided 3,094 household connections to the water network in the two villages of Albu
To'ama (1,487 households) and Al-Hajjaj (1,607 households)
-  Based on a random ad-hoc survey (July 2013) found that satisfaction level to of the beneficiaries to be at
83% with the level of service in Albo Tomma and Al-Hajaj villages (this component).

﻿Component 4: Goods for Water Directorate in Diyala Governorate (previously Rehabilitation and
Upgrading of Kena'an Water Supply System) (original estimated amount US$1.89 million; additional
financing amount US$0 million; actual US$5.4 million).
This original component was aimed to provide water to three of the poorest villages in the govemorate with
three water treatment units of a total capacity of 600 cubic meter per hour and 31 km of distribution network.
However, when the project - that was in the beginning of the project postponed because of the security situation
in the Diyala Govemorate - was finally to be implemented, the actual availability of water sources did not
support the implementation of a water treatment capacity of 600 cubic meter per hour. Hence, it was decided to
replace this component by a goods contract that would supply necessary equipment to support the provision of
drinking water services in the Diyala Govemorate. The goods were only delivered in June 2013 and installation
of pumps and chlorinators is still on-going as the security situations may delay the installation process. The
installation program for the above mentioned goods supplied Water Pumps and Chlorinators would cover 63
existing drinking water facilities. Yet, the govemorate's security situation remains difficult which is classified as
"level 5"18 or "high" on UN Security System. By closing date -just after delivery of the pumps large capacity
pumps have been installed with a total capacity of 6,250 cubic meters per hour have been installed benefitting a
total population of 111,000. This component was omitted in the 2008 restructuring, but added back in 2009
restructuring with US$5.5 million commitment.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Outputs:
-  The component supplied 230 pumps of varying capacities, 126 chlorinators of varying capacities and 15
backhoe wheel loaders to assist in the maintenance of water supply systems.
-  At project completion, pumps with a total capacity of 6,250 cubic meter per hour had been installed and
running.
Outcome:
This component indirectly benefitted 111,000 (after full installation 1.4 million) people of the Diyala
Govemorate with goods that supported the provision of drinking water. The security situation in Diyala remains
a major challenge.
Component 5: Upgrading of Al Hussainia Water Supply System (appraisal amount US$7.60 million;
additional financing amount: US$16.82 million; actual US$18.9 million). This component would finance the
upgrading of Al Hussainia water supply system, including construction of water treatment facilities,
rehabilitation of distribution networks, and house connections.
This component planned to serve one of the poorest cities in Baghdad Govemorate that has suffered from years
of neglect. It had a total population of approximately 135,000 inhabitants of which more than 60% did not have
access to adequate water supply for all purposes. The proposed component aimed to increase the quantity,
quality and access of potable water for the inhabitants of Al Hussainia city while reducing the demand on
Baghdad pipeline. This component consisted mainly of the supply and construction of a water intake, a raw
water transmission line, a water treatment plant consisting of five water treatments units, with recommended
two- year's supply of spare parts, and a distribution network including house connections.
During implementation this component changed in composition and was split into three packages to respond to
the ground reality, mainly due to the lack of interest of the bidders to work in Baghdad Govemorate; similarly to
18 The UN Security system classification uses 6 levels to classify security levels, with level 1 being minimal issues with security to level
6 classified as extreme levels of insecurity.
30


﻿Diyala Governorate - as the security situation remained precarious and was noted as most critical among all
governorates in Iraq:
Package I - Construction of "Raw Water Intake" on Tigris River funded by the World Bank: This package
comprised of supply and installation, the works being the major backbone facility to produce potable water for
the poorest districts in Baghdad's countryside. The first contract was signed in April 2007, and terminated in
2008 as the contractor had not mobilized due to the lack of security. Due to an interruption in the control of the
quantities of raw water in Al Khalis channel because of sabotage actions to the channel's penstocks regulator,
MMPW was forced to change the location of the intake. As the first contract was cancelled, they had to rebid
the contract with a new design.
After the works re-bid, a new contract was awarded in December 2009, but this contract was also terminated in
June 2013 due to the Grant closing date - by which time about 72% of the works had been completed. The
problems encountered in this project included (i) location of the raw water intake had to be changes due to
security issues with the first location requiring redesign and the need to rebid the contract; (ii) the contractor
imported the ductile piping that was not approved by the inspection company and insisted on laying it; and (ii)
tense relationships between contractor and consultant.
Package II - Construction of a complete water treatment plant of 1000 cubic meter per hour funded by the
Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works: This contract is progressing very slowly after it has already been
terminated twice and does not lie within the scope of this project as it is funded by the Ministry.
Package III: As the works completed in 2010, MMPW added a total of 12 km of pipes to the World Bank's
network to connect other villages to the current water system. The current distribution network - as Package I
and II are not yet completed - obtains water from water treatment units that were put in by the Government.
Currently, 150,000 are benefiting from the distribution network that has allowed most people to switch from
water tankers (as was the case during appraisal) to piped water. Although people's access to improved water
supplies improved greatly compared to the time of appraisal, the water flow is still rationed providing water 12
hours per day.
The works under Package III also encountered several problems, including (i) due to internal displaced people
movements, adjustments to the design had to be made; (ii) during excavation works at Al Shaoora and
Rudainiyah along the planned route of the network, archaeological items were sensed and their existence
confirmed, which required a change in the outlay of the network. The contract was originally signed for US$9.1
million.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Outputs:
-  Works under Package I were not fully completed and consist of a river intake with two submersible
pumps of 1,100 cum per hour and a high pressure pumping station with three horizontal pumps
-  Completed construction of two potable water elevated tanks each of 500 cubic meter, 25.2km of mains
(Ductile 700mm dia), and 135.9 km of drinking water distribution network under Package III
Outcome:

﻿Component 6: Upgrading of Al-Samawa Water Supply System (appraisal amount US$12.34 million;
additional financing amount US$23.01 million, actual US$25.7 million). This component would finance the
upgrading of Al-Samawa water supply system, including supply and installation of water treatment units, a
water pipeline, and a staging water tank, and rehabilitation of pumping stations.
This project consisted of two packages: (i) to supply and install water treatment units with a total capacity of
1,800 cubic meter per hour; and (ii) a distribution network with a length of 24 km, a pumping station and a
staging water tank with a capacity of 2,500 cubic meter.
The project benefited part of Al-Samawa and surrounding areas, yet, due to the lack of funds, the works could
not cover the full area - a follow-up project is to be completed by 2014 and will further increase water
production. The works were completed in 2010. According to Engineer Abid (Director General of Al Muthanna
Water Directorate), in his words: "The World Bank's component has saved our city of a serious thirst"
Rating: Satisfactory
Outputs:
-  Completed water treatment units with a capacity of 1,800 cubic meter per hour and mains of 24 km
length.
-  Completed construction of a reservoir with a capacity of 2,500 cubic meters and a pumping station of
500 cubic meter per hour were put into operation for an average 22 hours since 2010.
Outcome:
-  This component directly benefitted a population of 250,000 which covers part of Al-Samawa and
surrounding areas in provision of treated drinking water.
-  Based on a random and ad-hoc survey (July 2013) found that satisfaction level of the beneficiaries to be
at 70% with the level of service in Al Zahra'a, Al Qishla, Nadthim, Gasil, Tash Heem, Musa Al Khadim,
Al Nasr, Al Shuhada'a, Al Sharqi, Al Gharbi, Maternity Hospital, The General Hospital, School, Al
Soub, Al Kabeer, Al Khudur (this component).
Component 7: Upgrading of Badawa Water Supply System (appraisal amount US$9.26 million; additional
financing amount US$23.78 million, actual US$23.9 million). This component would finance the upgrading of
the Badawa water supply system, including supply and installation of a water distribution network, drilling of
wells, installation of pumps, storage tanks, chlorinators and diesel generators. In 2009 restructuring, the
component 11 of Badawa Urban Rehabilitation scope was combined under one package for bidding (with
estimated costs of US$ 7.76 million).
Erbil City, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, has a population of 1.6 million, covering an area 100 sq. km. Al
Badawa quarter consists of two sectors; "Old" and "New" and covers an area of 12sq. km respectively.
The component was also to provide water services to the Badawa slum area in Erbil. The component was to
supply and install a water distribution network, drilling 10 wells, and install pump houses, storage tanks and
equipment. This component was combined with component 11, Badawa Urban Rehabilitation (estimated
costs of US$ 7.76 million) and bid out as one package.
The urban rehabilitation component completed roads, stormwater in Badawa as the district has significantly
grown since appraisal with a total population of 115,000 (compared to 42,000 during appraisal) and four
adjacent quarters (Hanaset, Gollan 21, Havalat, Saroran) serving a total population of 150,000 with access to
improved stormwater drainage. In addition, it is conservatively estimated that only 10 percent of the population
in the adjacent districts benefit from the road, which amounts to a total of 145,000 beneficiaries for stormwater
drainage and a similar number of 145,000 for road access.
Problems encountered during the implementation were: (i) termination of one contractor and the time lost to re-
bid the remaining works; (ii) the impossibility of using heavy equipment in the slums, due to their narrow
32


﻿widths and the existence of cesspools (after the works were completed new cesspools had to be installed); (iii)
widespread leakages in the groundwater tanks that were installed by the first contractor and the existence of
opposite opinions about the cause of the leaks and the subsequent time lost in getting an independent third
opinion and work plan to fix the leaks. The contract was originally signed for US$ 24.4 million.
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
Outputs:
-    Completed and installed ground storage tanks with a total volume of 2 x 3,200 cubic meter, elevated tank
of 700 cubic meter and a pumping station which has increased the availability of water significantly in the
Badawa area that during appraisal had access to only 14 lcd.
-    Completed a water distribution network of 116 km length.
-    Completed construction of 28 km of roads in length that serves all of Badawa (both Old and New
Badawa) and 4 adjacent quarters.
-    Completed stormwater network with a concrete culvert of 2.5 km and 6.5 km of length to bypass
stormwater that serves Badawa.
Outcome:
-    115,000 people (42,000 at appraisal) with water supply services
-    150,000 people (42,000 at appraisal) with stormwater services
-    145,000 people (42,000 at approval) with improved road access
-    In addition, because of the fast growth of Badawa the water supply also benefits a school and other non-
residential water users.
-    This component provided 4,050 household connections to the water network
-    Based on a random ad-hoc survey (July 2013) found that satisfaction level of the beneficiaries to be at
99.9% with the level of service in Al-Badawa residents, which confirms high service quality satisfaction
level.
Component 8: Upgrading of Dohuk Water Supply and Stormwater Drainage Systems (appraisal amount
US$4.92 million; additional financing amount US$0 million, actual US$0 million). This component would
finance the upgrading of the Dohuk water supply and stormwater drainage systems, including supply and
installation of a distribution network. Lack of funding and the requirement to not spend more than 17% on
projects in Kurdistan resulted in the cancellation of this component.
Rating: Not Rated
Component 9: Upgrading of Dukan Water Supply System (appraisal amount US$4.48 million; actual US$0
million). This component would finance the upgrading of the Dukan water supply system, including
construction of intake, as water treatment plant with standby generator, a high lift pump station, a service
reservoir, a transmission pipeline, and rehabilitation and upgrading of a distribution network. This component
was to fund the rehabilitation of the intake works, construction of a water treatment plant with a standby
generator, construction of high lift pump station, installation of a new reservoir with a capacity of 1,800 cubic
meters, and construction of a new transmission main. Lack of funding and the requirement to not spend more
than 17% on projects in Kurdistan resulted in the cancellation of this component.

Component 11: Badawa Urban Rehabilitation (appraisal amount US$7.76 million; additional financing
amount US$ 0 million; actual US$0 million). This component would finance rehabilitation of the urban
infrastructure in selected parts of the district of Badawa in south-eastern Arbil, including upgrading of unpaved
neighborhood roads and main streets, and construction of stormwater drainage system. During 2008 project
restructuring the scope of this component was combined with Component 7: Upgrading of Badawa Water
Supply and bid as one package.
Rating: Rated under Component 7 of the Project
Component 12: Basra Urban Rehabilitation (appraisal amount US$7.78 million; additional financing amount
US$0 million; actual US$0 million). This component would finance rehabilitation of the urban infrastructure in
selected parts of the city of Basra, including resurfacing of main streets, paving of neighborhood roads,
construction of pedestrian sidewalks and construction of a stormwater drainage network. Lack of funding
resulted in a cancellation of this component in the 2008 restructuring.
Rating: Not Rated
Component 13 - Technical Assistance and Capacity Building. (appraisal amount US$4.0 million; additional
financing amount US$ 6.91 million; actual amount US$10.7 million ). This component was essential to ensure
the proper implementation of the project and to train MMPW staff throughout Iraq on efficient utility practices
and financing. It included the following activities: consulting services to complete final designs and tender
documents, consulting services for construction and implementation supervision, audits, individual consultants
to support the Project Management Team (PMT) and operating costs for the project. Most of the funds were
used for supervision consultants whose contracts had to be extended due to the large implementation delays.
About 75 percent of the total costs were linked to construction supervision consultancies which ballooned
because of the many project delays. Another US$ 1.48 million was to fund operating costs. The rest was used
mainly for consultants other than supervision consultants.
The small allocation for capacity building and technical assistance essentially meant that the amount of funding
for capacity building and training of MMPW staff throughout the implementation period was extremely limited.
The lack of security made it difficult to attract trainers and other experts willing to work in Iraq. Therefore,
most of the capacity building and training has taken place as "on-the-job" training. The financial management
consultant from Etiman provided on-the-job training and more formal training to MMPW staff during the
project implementation on a regular basis during the 9 years of implementation. The very close supervision of
the project on a virtual daily basis provided "on-the-job" training to a large PMT of about 30 staff on all aspects
of Bank project management (procurement, financial management, disbursement, contract management, etc.)
and funding to allow staff to learn about water and wastewater management through study tours, and other
formal training practices amounting to at least 10 months of training. "On-the-job" training was provided to
Directorate staff at the final stages of project implementation when the contractor handed works over to local
staff and trained them in the use of the facilities; it is estimated by the PMT that this type of "on-the-job"
training has at least amounted to 65 staff months, whereas another 10 months were provided by the suppliers of
goods. However, when the different on-the job training is included from FMA staff, Bank staff, training by
contractors and suppliers and the formal training, the total manmonths of training add up to 276 months
(including formal training of 10 months). In addition, the Bank was instrumental in designing a capacity
building program that was funded through USAID and that dealt with asset management, non-revenue water and
other technical matters to about 28 Iraqis through a series of multi-day workshops.
34


﻿Outputs:
-  In addition, the Bank staff organized a set of formal trainings to the PMT with a total of 10 months of
formal training courses.
-  It is estimated by the PMT that this type of "on-the-job" training has at least amounted to 65 staff
months.
-  The different on-the job training estimated by the Bank includes on-the-job training from FMA staff,
Bank staff, training by contractors and suppliers. The total man-months of training add up to 276
months (including formal training, mostly funded through other than Bank funding).

﻿Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
The Borrower prepared an extensive assessment of the project which has been preliminary
summarized in this section. The full document is available in the Project Files.
Project Preparation, Design, and quality at entry
a.    Soundness of the Background Analysis:
The appraisal study was initiated, completed and prepared as a work context during the
year 2004, when the country was trying to re- rise after a severe war destruction and
sabotage due to the severe shake in Country's Skelton, and hence; state of "Missing in
Power of Law".
In spite of all the difficulties that one had lived or to imagine it during that period, still
the World Bank's Task Team managed to collect the majority of the required
information and data within the domain of the intended services. Years have passed and
have proved that those data and figures were very close to the reality, moreover; this
analysis has covered most of the topics in relevance to the prospective objectives.
b.    Assessment of the project's design:
The project is satisfactorily designed, it is comprehensive, well organized to an
outstanding extent as a working context, also, the steps at the entry are logically
adopted, its achievability on the ground looked feasible, and no complexity or obstacles
have been judged in advance.
The noted reservation is below mentioned:
Topic               Rating                        Justification
Objectives            Moderately Satisfactory        Missing is the Water &
Sewerage specialty training

Organization                Satisfactory               No shortcomings

Agency                                                    framework.
Social &                    Satisfactory               No shortcomings
Environment Factors
The incurred efforts and produced documentation are "outstanding" and of a "High
Satisfactory Level", including the soundness of the background analysis and the
following clauses, as it has given a strong working planner for those who will undertake
the process of implementation,...the "PMT's " staff.
While reviewing the Project's outcomes, the only shortcoming noted was that within
the "Objective (b) Capacity Building" which didn't cover the "Technical Training
42


﻿Courses", in other words; the "Capacity Building" plan has been quite effective in
upgrading and strengthening the ability of the "PMT" staff, contractors, consultants and
agency's staff in the fields of; Procurements, pre-qualification standards, selection of
Consultants and Contractors, recovery plan, financing and Project Managements, This
was confirmed by the majority of the staff who received the trainings, but negligible for
the core of the Objective (a) which is mainly; construction of new "Drinking Water
Plants" and "Handling the Sewage and Sewerage Evacuation Systems".
Therefore, one may denote the experienced "Capacity Building" as a Tool that should
facilitate the "Project's" application, but not as an Objective.
The purpose is to bring up a generation of technicians who can feel and smell the
optimum and appropriate operation of the water purification and sewage treatment
plants and its peripherals, the national know-how and ability in this field is available
and rich and of an acceptable level, but the expertise and inputs of international
institutes, and the reciprocating knowledge is a must, since science has got no limitation.
There should have been enough number of lectures and training courses that cover all
the aspects in the water purification process, and its recent concepts. This is a very
sensitive issue as it is related directly to the general hygiene and human/public health.
Nevertheless, the same is recommended for the treatment of the sewerage systems.
But, fortunately, it seems that eventually, the above point was sensed by the World
Bank's Task Team, for; the agenda of the last mutual meeting held in September 2013,
it was suggested to the PMT to set a list of all the necessary, training requirements in
the (technical/engineering and treatments) subjects and expertise that concerns Water
and Sewerage where shortages are felt, in order to activate intensive theoretical and
practical courses during the year 2014, by using the remainder of the Grant's budget.
Though it comes late, but still it shall quite important for both the project and the
trainees, nevertheless; it will be registered as an excellent step initiated by the World
Bank. Efforts ought to gather to bring this promising plan into reality. The World Bank
staff may also gain experience in preparing for such a program.
c. Adequacy of Government's Commitments:
Stakeholders have been positive and of satisfactorily response in respect to their office
structure and standards. The Project's Resident Engineers were appointed by the
stakeholders, and those have had the tasks to supervise, facilitate the obstacle to achieve
a smooth working ambient, and this was experienced in reality, when they were not
able to solve problems, then they would go to a higher grade key employees, upon
completion; any completed component is directly received and put into operation
according to the adopted measures by the concerned directorate.
It is very important to mention, that in the majority of the completed subproject, one
can see several engineers, technicians and operators are daily in a dynamic action to
keep it well functioning.
Also, there is at least three visits per week paid by the staff of the Ministry of Health to
follow up the bacteriology tests, plus occasionally visits paid by the staff of the
Ministry of Environment to sense for any kind of pollution.
43


﻿Moreover; several Water Directorates have added peripheral parts their components in
accordance to the tolerances in their assets, (e.g. piping network, mains, automatic
control).
Such, have been applied at components of; Badawa, Al Hussainiyah pckge III, Beigi,
Al Majar and at Al Muthanna pckge II.

e. Implementation Phase:
It is understandable that the pre-estimated allocation for each component cannot be
applied exactly, especially when the country was living in an unstable economic
profile due the fact of being a semi-conflicted country and this has continued over
the project's closing date.
During the year 2004 the exchange rate of the Iraqi Dinars against the US$ was low,
and started gradually to rise through the years followed, but in parallel, the cost of
living started to climb up and the buying power has weakened, living has become
complicated and hard, the recruitment chances in state offices have diminished, and
thousands of diploma certificate holders in different specialty are jobless and have
to work in lines far from their studies. For these reasons and probably more, the
components' estimated costs have risen, and the time table pre-set for the
implementation of the project couldn't match, also the three governorates; Basra,
Sulaimaniyah and Dohuk couldn't receive their components done, due to the
insufficient in the funds.
48


﻿Achievements and Financial Details:
The final achievement was that:
+ Six components have been implemented, scattered in six Iraqi governorates, by the
involvement of:
+ One component as equipment provision for Diyala Water Directorate.
+ Seven consultancy Bureaus, and;
+ Nine contracting companies, of which; Four are "Joint Ventured", plus not less
than;
+ Two equipment supplying manufacturers.
+ At least Twenty resident engineers from the implementing agency's and;
+ Eight follow up engineers of the PMTs'.
+ Six key staff of the PMT's.
+ Five hired freelance consultants.
+ Backup Staff.

﻿b.01: Outcomes / Objectives Shortcomings:
% Al Hussainiyah and Karbala components have not been completed by the closing
date 30.06.2013.
% Technical training for the technicians and operators of the achieved components, (in
general for Drinking Water Purification systems and Waste Water Treatment is
inadequate).
b.02: Outcomes / Efficiency:
The Return of Cost looks to be perfect, for; the total expenditure of the achieved
components for the total estimated beneficiated inhabitants would result the fractured
cost to be 60 usd / capita.
Since such projects in this country are supported financially by the authorities, then
they are considered as an investment projects, even though people pay for the purified
waters consumed by them, the charges are much less than the project's cost.
But still a simple calculation may be done to stand before the financial aspects of such
projects which may be seen as follows:
*  Project's Cost = (85'000'000) MUS$. (Only for Water subprojects; deduct "17"
MUSD approximately from both Al Badawa and Karbala components).
*  Beneficiaries = (1'313'000) Inhabitants.
*  Number of families= 218'833 average family members is considered (6).
*  Average Charges/family/month= 6'000 Iraqi Dinars equivalent to (5) US$.
*  Consider 20% profit/ month= (1) US$.
*  Annually= (12) US$.
*  Total net profit / year= 218833 x 12= 2'626'000 US$.
*  Time to reimburse the capital cost= 80'000'000 / 2'626'000 =30 years (keeping the
same above mentioned tariff of the produced water).
Least Cost Alternative:
*  It is noted that Badawa and Al Muthanna have been rather costly components,
which is reasonable for each of them; in respect to the; large mass of the component,
high quality of the; executed works, materials and equipment procured for these
completed components.
*  A simple verification is that each of the contracts of the three components
concerning World Bank's second project with the MMPW under (IDA - EWSP) is;
for the construction of (1000) m 3/h  "Water Treatment Plants" with a total
contractual amount very close to our largest component cost.
51


﻿b.03: Outcomes / Relevance Shortcomings
All the components selected and completed are consistent with country's current
development priorities and with the current Banks' country and sectorial assistance
strategies; this was subject of study and was approved during the appraisal (Clause
G-29) of this in hand report.
b.04: Bank Performance/ Quality of Supervision
*  The (TT) not being able to stay in Iraq was a great burden to the Project and the
decision making process. Times and times when the PMT sent an email on a
Thursday and had to wait until Tuesday to get a reply, in the best cases.
*   The specific nature of the components of the Project required that the World Bank
(WB) (TT) have engineers and specialists in water and sewerage to avoid delays in
decision making or erroneous decisions, otherwise to listen to the suggestion of the
(PMT) or to study in allowing further power in decisions making, moreover; there
had been occasions when stubborn arguments were taking place between the two
groups regarding an engineering topic.
*  The PMT should have had a legal specialist. However, on several occasions, the
PMT explained to the (TT) that the PMT has not been able to acquire such a
specialist in Iraq. With the unlimited resources at the hand of the WB could have
had such a specialist, who understands engineering contracts in addition to Iraqi law,
especially during the periods before the termination of the first Badawa contractor,
the Al-Hussainiyah three packages on the first award, the Al-Hussainiyah I on the
second award, and the contracts of the first consultants in Badawa and Al-Muthanna.
*  Few meetings were held between the World Bank (TT's) member or members
directly with at least one of the awarded contractors engaged for undertaking the
work of one of components, without the presence of the PMT's staff, such an action
have had some negative consequences against the commitments of the contractor
towards the agency.
*  During the attendance of the (TT) together with PMT staff in few missions, some
"out of main subject" arguments were registered from at least one member of the
(TT) which touched the dignity or the feelings of at least one member of their
counterparts. Can would any reason explanation this?
*  It was clear that the World Bank's (TT) were not acquainted enough about the
country's real conditions regarding the topics of; people and their religious
commitment and their obligations, taxes, details of marketed material, ability and
capability workers, measures for keeping the security, the brittle power of law and
the role of governmental updated resolutions.
* The (TT) frequently refused to act on the basis of the advices of the Project
Management Team (PMT) of such themes.
52


﻿b.05: Bank Performance/ Focus on Development Impact:
*  Al Hussainiyah, Package I, construction lost its smooth progress and was not
finalized, the World Bank's should have detected this at a prior time and had set the
proper decision at the appropriate time, keeping a margin of time to complete the
work by an alternative method. Leaving this component as a pending subject is
frustrating to all.
*  A like to AL- Hussainiyah, Karbala component has suffered, but fortunately, the
burden over the contractor diminished and has been able to manage towards a
remarkable progress for completing the component.
*  Al Badawa Component: construction lost its smooth progress due the delay in the
Bank's decisions. The Resident Engineer of Al Badawa project has registered with
anger a verbal "complaint" against the World Bank's former "Task Team Leader"
when (she) or the (TT) delayed for rather a long time, the World Bank's decision
and approval of the first contractor's contract termination, while the concrete works
of the elevated tank were incomplete and the ground storage tank left dry for almost
two years, which technically encounters some negative impacts. If the World
Bank's former "Task Team Leader" tried to understand the situation at that time,
then the work could have been completed in three years earlier than its actual
completion date.
b.06: Bank Performance/ Supervision on fiduciary and Safeguard aspects:
*  The position of the Environment Specialist had been vacant for rather a long time.
*  The WB guidelines, regulations, procedures, and documents lacked a method to
deal with none compliant design consultants regarding incorrect design and with
contractors regarding the issue of insurance;
*  The Bank's safeguards on paper were not sufficient to protect the Project from
inefficient contractors and consultants;
*  The relation of international banks towards the WB requires more organizing and
boosting, for, Diyala Governorate's goods suppliers couldn't receive their deserves
smoothly when the PMT released those finance according to the contractual
payment terms.
*  An important issue was the high financial and experience qualifications imposed in
the criteria for awarding the contracts. It was clear that practically few local
contractors or consultants could achieve these qualifications and at the same time
there was the practical impossibility of getting international qualified contractors
and consultants to work in Iraq. The result was local contractors who submitted
together with their bids documents that did not reflect their true qualifications. All
international partners of the joint ventures who raised the qualifications of the
bidders disappeared immediately after signing of the contracts, such as with the
contractors of Badawa, Al-Muthanna I and II, Al-Hussainiya III, and Karbala in
addition to the consultants of Al-Muthanna and Al-Hussainiya I. If the criteria
allowed to be lowered the PMT would have accepted more contractors applying
who are also able to work in these locations with minimum problems with the tribes.
53


﻿So much time was lost due to this, and the EWSSURP, which was supposed to be
completed in 2008 continued until 2013.
*  The (TT) did not understand the mentality and the ways of the work force in Iraq
nor the security situation, nor the new dangers that affected the supervision staff
and was insistent on not being flexible in accepting all the variation orders and time
extensions that the PMT understood and accepted. Only to accept them at a later
date after having harmed the contractor or the consultant.
*  Consultants are responsible for their designs. However, WB contracts do not have
the mechanism for holding the consultants responsible for their mistakes. The PMT
tried several times to explain this to the (TT), but they did not consider it as
important and they did not have the eagerness to find a solution. Actually all
international consultants in the world are covered by liability insurance that extends
for years beyond their completing the designs for such cases. The conditions in Iraq
did not allow this to be enforced and a condition in the WB documents that covered
such a contingency could not be found.
*  Topic of insurance policies was always raised with the WB but there was no
mechanism from the WB that allowed the PMT to pay these premiums and then
deduct them from the invoices.
b.07: Bank Performance/ Candor and Quality of performance Reporting:
*  MMPW was not informed of the last possible deadline for the Project Closing Date,
which caused wrong decisions for some contracts. i.e. whether to continue with the
same contractor or to go through the longer procedure of termination and rebidding
for a better contractor;
*  The reports of the (TT) did not always describe the practical difficulties facing
implementation of the contracts, which was reflected in the WB decisions. e.g. Beiji,
Diyala, Al-Hussainiya and Badawa.
b.08: Recipient Performance/ Government Performance:
*  Whenever and for whichever component a request was set by the  PMT, the
government has acted legally after ensuring the correct information, and then just
undertaking the measures to fulfill the request, the only shortcoming is the time
waste, for the System in applying the instructions starts getting slow afterwards
upon leaving the key person's office.
*  The Ministers or Ministries from whom the PMT placed requests regarding various
subjects within the project's implementation necessities, looked keen to facilitate
such demands, and they used to initiate by the measures to what had been requested,
but, again; such matters move slowly, examples at Al Hussainiyah pckge I "land
clearance", getting the green light to "lay the piping (600) mm under the highway
Baghdad/ Diyala", "land clearance "Al Yarmook unit at Al Majar and "land
clearance" at Beigi.
54


﻿*  The (MMPW) has taken the legal actions in urging the contracting companies of
both; Al-Hussainiyah-I and Karbala components to respect their contractual
commitments in completing the works at the soonest.
*  The (MMPW) has taken the legal actions against the contracting companies of Al-
Hussainiyah I and Karbala in signing a testimony for their responsibilities in
complying to the contractual documents to complete the works.
b.09: Recipient Performance/ Implementing A$ency Performance:
*  At the beginning of grant's operation, understanding and elaborating contract in
English were difficult issues.
*  At the beginning of grant's operation, the World Bank's dependent system and
methodology to release Water and Sewerage Contracts were recognized as a kind of
sophisticated approach.
b.1O: Post-Completion operation /next phase:
o  Appropriate technical, financial, commercial, and institutional provisions: It has
been noticed that the stakeholders (Water Directorates) in the different governorates
are supported with a very good engineering qualifications, as well the technicians
but few skilled operators understand what they must do to grant the best of their
station's product, financial back-up is always available but through few measures
which require some time, oppositely is the institutional provisions which is less than
the operation and maintenance demands , especially for the recruitments of,
engineers, technicians and skilled operators. For whom most of the directorates face
serious shortages in such aspects, this would require new law
o  Timely provision of all necessary inputs: is not punctual.
o  Adequate budget provision; yes, it is available, within boundaries and measures.
o  Theoretical and field training; umbrella require being of wider information and
frequent courses with advanced stages, for all who are in responsible in operation
and maintenance.
o  Adequate staffing and management including training; have to be improved as
illustrated in (i) above.
o  The marketing of the project's output: this system has been applied since decades,
but nowadays it is fluctuating in manner that some people pay the fees and others
do not. This due to the serious poverty found in the society in general.
o  According to the opinions majority of the MMPW engineering staff, consultants
and contractors who have had a direct role in the project's implementation rush, and
the reflections collected during the components' visits; that there remains a
significant volume to the World Bank to keep it self occasionally present, as a
technical as a monitoring agent for the purpose of supporting whenever needed,
either as a recommender or by a direct intervention this wealth of those constructed
components so that they are kept functioning at its best possible standard.
