                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Disbursement stands at about $87.4 million compared to $83.9 million in December 2011 (out of a total project grant of $110 million) So far, two subprojects (Majar and Al-Muthanna)
                         are fully completed and operational. A third subproject (Badawa, Erbil) is completed and is operational, but a groundwater reservoir is not operating as intended.It is estimated that in
                         these three localities more than 424,000 people are benefiting from improved water supplies. In addition, smaller populations are benefiting from urban rehabilitation in Erbil (about
                         42,000 people). Two of the three on-going subprojects are experiencing significant implementation delays.
