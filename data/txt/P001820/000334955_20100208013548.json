The economic return on the maintenance\n            item is estimated at about 36percent over the six-year\n            expected life of the capital investment. The betterment\n            program will ensure all-weather transport on two roads\n            serving the most agriculturally productive and densely\n            populated areas of the country. This project item yields an\n            economic return of about 35percent on the Boghe-Kaedi-Kiffa\n            road in the south, and of about 16percent on the\n            Akjoujt-Atar-Choum road in the north. The pre-investment\n            studies concern improvement of the most heavily trafficked\n            unpaved road in the country.  The project will consist of\n            the following: (a) technical assistance to the Ministry of\n            Equipment; (b) purchase of highway equipment for maintenance\n            and betterment works; (c) continuation of a betterment\n            program on about 365 km of roads; and (d) feasibility study\n            and detailed engineering for construction of the Rosso-Boghe\n            road (200 km), the most heavily trafficked unpaved road in\n            the country."}, "docdt": "1974-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
