traffic by\n            exploiting its favored location as an important staging\n            point for long-range flights to Central Africa and South\n            America. The plan aims at promoting tourism, at improving\n            utilization of the domestic airline fleet and at offering\n            better services by providing reliable air navigation and\n            night flight aids. The project would be executed over the\n            period 1979-1982 and would comprise: (a) strenghthening and\n            leveling the main runway and taxiway and improving the\n            taxiway alignment at Dakar airport; (b) the installation of\n            navigation aids, runway lighting and related works at\n            Ziguinchor airport; and (c) the installation of visual\n            approach aids at Cap Skirring airport."}, "docdt": "1979-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
