RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Rural Development Project for which an
IDA credit of US$10 million equivalent is proposed. The credit would help
finance basic infrastructure and services for rural development in the Northern
Department of Haiti where over 90% of the rural population are under the level
of absolute poverty. The project would consist of (a) rehabilitation and
expansion of the Quartier Morin (2,000 ha) and St. Raphael (1,900 ha) irriga-
tion systems and irrigation of up to 1,000 ha based on deep wells; (b) rehab-
ilitation and construction of 66.5 km of feeder roads and 27 km of farm access
roads; (c) construction of up to 400 wells operated with hand pumps and of up
to five small water supply systems served by springs, for rural potable water
supply; and (d) rehabilitation and improvement of the two municipal markets
and abattoir in Cap-Haitien and construction of a market in St. Raphael. The
credit would also strengthen and support regional agricultural services pro-
viding (a) short-term and medium-term credit to groups of small farmers and
to individual medium-size farmers; (b) agricultural trials and improved seed
multiplication; and (c) agricultural extension, rural animation, and animal
health services. About 4,000 rural families would benefit from directly
productive components of the project as well as from the productive support
activities and the road component, increasing their on-farm consumption by
about 30% and their average annual cash income from agricultural and livestock
activities from US$60 to US$150. In addition, some 26,000 rural families would
benefit from better roads, improved agricultural services and availability of
improved seeds and would increase their on-farm consumption by 10% to 20%, and
about 3,000 rural households would receive potable water. Also, about 60,000
urban inhabitants would benefit from decreased health hazards and more competi-
tive trading due to the rehabilitation and improvement of three municipal
markets and an abattoir.
ii.       The project would be IDA's first agricultural rural development
operation in Haiti but the Bank Group has already assisted the Government with
a US$2.6 million loan for highway rehabilitation in 1956 (141-HA), followed by a
highway maintenance project, partially financed by a US$350,000 credit in 1962
(32-HA) and reconstruction of the Northern Road through a credit of US$10
million in 1974 (478-HA) and a credit of US$20 million in 1975 (556-HA).
Assistance to education was also provided through a US$5.5 million credit in
February 1976 (618-HA) and for electric power in the Port-au-Prince area
through a US$16 million credit in June 1976 (645-HA). Project execution under
the two recent highway projects and the education project has been satisfac-
tory. The implementation of the electric power project has just begun.
iii.      Agriculture is the most important sector in Haiti's economy, provid-
ing about 45% of GDP and over 50% of merchandise exports and meeting most of
the needs of domestic consumption of agricultural products, but agricultural



- ii -
imports absorb about 90% of agricultural export earnings. The importance of
the sector is further emphasized by the fact that about 80% of Haiti's popu-
lation obtains its livelihood from agriculture. Development of the rural
sector constitutes a major priority of the Government and increased production
of food crops is one of its major goals.
iv.       With an area of 27,750 km and a population of 4.7 million in 1976,
growing annually at a rate of about 1.6%, Haiti has an average population
density of about 170 persons per square kilometer, one of the highest in Latin
America. With agriculture concentrated mainly in a limited number of river
valleys and coastal plains, development of these areas becomes essential to
the country's economy and welfare. The arrondissement of Cap-Haitien and
the irrigated district of St.. Raphael are two such productive areas, with poor
agricultural services and existing infrastructure in severe need of rehabili-
tation and expansion. The proposed project would help correct these deficien-
cies and provide the basis for the development of the whole Northern Department.
v.        An "Organisme de Developpement du Nord" (ODN), established under the
President of the Republic would implement the project under the supervision of
a Board chaired by the State Secretary of the Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources and Rural Development (DARNDR), and including representa-
tives of the Department of Public Works, Transport and Communications (TPTC),
the Department of Finance and Economic Affairs, the National Bank (BNRH) and
the Planning Council (CONADEP).
vi.       Government would provide the counterpart funds for project manage-
ment and strengthening of agricultural services. Funds from the World Food
Program (WFP) would finance two million man-days of unskilled labor in the
form of "food for work". Project costs are estimated to total US$13.4 million
equivalent. IDA would finance US$10 million, or about 75%; Government would
contribute US$2 million, or almost 15%; and the WFP, US$1.4 million, or about
10%. IDA's contribution would cover US$8.2 million, or 100% of the estimated
foreign exchange component, and US$1.8 million, or 35%, of local currency
expenditures, which is justified on country grounds. Government would pass
on the proceeds of the IDA credit as a grant to ODN for the execution of the
project.
vii.      The Government has requested bilateral assistance from the Federal
Republic of Germany and France to finance the cost of resident consultants.
Should this assistance materialize, IDA would cancel an amount of the proposed
IDA credit equivalent to the assistance so received, which is expected to
amount to about US$2 million.
viii.     Procurement of items financed by the WFP would be in line with
its procurement procedures. All other procurement would be in accordance with
the Bank Group's Procurement Guidelines. Contracts in excess of US$50,000,
aggregating about US$2 million, would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. Contracts of less than US$50,000 but over US$10,000
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally. The



- iii -
bulk of civil works for irrigation rehabilitation/expansion and road construc-
tion would be done on force account, but small local contractors would be
hired to carry out specific construction tasks.
ix.       Financial rates of return based on four representative farm model
projections have been estimated at 18% for rainfed and 29%, 31% and 48%,
respectively, for three irrigated farm models. The economic rate of return
for the project is 14%, with sensitivity tests showing that the project could
absorb some setbacks and still be economically viable.
x.        During negotiations appropriate assurances were obtained that
provide a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$10 million equivalent under
normal IDA terms.






HAITI
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Haiti has requested IDA assistance in financing
a rural development project in the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien and the irri-
gation district of St. Raphael in the arrondissement of Grande Riviere du
Nord, both located in the Northern Department. The project would benefit
about 30,000 rural families mostly within the category of absolute poverty
and would be financed jointly with the World Food Program (WFP).
1.02      The project would be IDA's first agricultural/rural development ope-
ration in Haiti but the Bank Group has assisted the Government in other projects
for highway rehabilitation, financed by Loan 141-HA (US$2.6 million) in 1956;
highway maintenance, financed by Credit 32-HA (US$350,000) in 1962; reconstruc-
tion of the Northern Road, financed by Credit 478-HA (US$10 million) in 1974
and Credit 556-HA (US$20 million) in 1975; education, financed by Credit
618-HA (US$5.5 million) in February 1976; and supply of electric power in the
Port-au-Prince area, financed by Credit 645-HA (US$16 million) in June 1976.
1.03      The project was identified by an agricultural sector study jointly
undertaken by IDB, FAO and IBRD in 1973. It was prepared from February to May
1975 by an FAO/CP team.
II.   BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Haiti is the poorest country of the Americas.  With an area of
27,750 km and a population of 4.7 million in 1976, the average population
density is about 170 persons per square kilometer. GNP per capita in 1975
was US$180, but the depressed living standards of the population can be better
illustrated by a high infant mortality rate of about 150 per thousand live
births, an average life expectancy of only 50 years, very low nutrition and
sanitation standards, and an adult illiteracy of about 80%.
2.02      Haiti's economy has shown contrasting trends over the last four
years. In real terms, GDP grew by about 2.5% p.a. and gross domestic income
by about 3.8% p.a. between 1971 and 1975, thanks to relatively favorable terms
of trade. Agriculture, Haiti's most important sector, however, has shown
little progress, growing at only 1.2% annually, which is less than the average
rate of population growth of 1.6%. Further, the volume of agricultural exports
has been declining but, because of increased industrial exports, the overall
annual decrease in exports was only about 2% in the same period. The trade
balance, however, was converted from a US$1.5 million surplus in 1971 to a
deficit of US$22.5 million in 1975.



- 2 -
B.   The Rural Sector
2.03      In 1975, the rural sector accounted for about 45% of GDP (about US$400
million) and over 50% of merchandise exports (US$39.5 million) (coffee, 20%;
essential oils, 5%; sugar, 10%; sisal, 3%; and other agricultural products,
12%). Not only does agriculture provide the livelihood of about 80% of Haiti's
population now, or about 680,000 families, it will continue to be the largest
source of employment for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, in 1975,
the sector received less than 7% of total Government expenditures, and the
Government assistance in terms of production support services (research,
extension, credit and marketing) is inadequate. Thus, except for sugarcane
and some rice and tobacco cultivation, agricultural production methods remain
primitive. Domestic agricultural output falls short of the country's require-
ments of grain, edible oils and fats, and dairy products by 20 to 30%. Imports
of these products absorb an estimated 92% of agricultural exports.
Land Use and Land Tenure
2.04      Of the country's total area, only 15% is well suited to agriculture
although twice as much is actually under cultivation. The remaining 70% is
too arid or steep for cultivation. Mountain agriculture is limited to coffee
and cocoa, while most of the country's food crops and some of the export crops
(sugar, citrus, sisal) are grown in the river valleys. The Artibonite valley,
which has an extensive irrigation system, is the rice producing center of the
country. The large northwest peninsula, with its semi-arid climate, and the
western portion of the Cul-de-Sac plain, restricted by lack of water and
underlying salinity, constitute the country's low production regions. Forest
cover has been drastically reduced as trees have been cut to provide firewood,
and erosion is a serious problem, especially where subsistence crops are grown
on steep slopes.
2.05      The lack of an adequate cadaster makes it difficult to determine
the land tenure situation. The revolution in the early 1800s, with the
extensive distribution of land among peasants, resulted in a structure of
small farms which in time have been further subdivided. Most land is pri-
vately owned and the present Rural Code legislation divides the land among
surviving heirs, resulting in increasing minifundia. Other forms of land
tenure include absentee owners, tenants and sharecroppers. An average of
about 1.2 ha is available per family of five to six persons. The majority
of the farms are too small to provide more than a family subsistence. The
typical Haitian farmer has only a hoe and machete as basic farming tools.
2.06      Farmers' organizations are not common in Haiti and the few existing
cooperatives are either in the form of pilot projects or associated with
private groups, generally religious in motivation. Other forms of agricultural
cooperation exist, including mutual assistance labor groups which rotate among
a number of farms to carry out essential agricultural work as well as groups
of small farmers who constitute Agricultural Credit Societies (SACs) of mutual
guarantee.



-3-
Rural Income Structure
2.07      The income distribution pattern in 1970 obtained from a survey of the
Haitian Institute of Statistics shows that about 90% of the rural population
earned an average income of less than US$45 per person. Analysis of rural
incomes and annual per capita consumption rates of essential goods and services
indicates that more than 90% of the rural population and 85% of the total
population of Haiti were, in 1975, below the absolute poverty level of about
US$60.
Agricultural Services
2.08      Training, research and technical assistance in agriculture are the
responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural
Development (DARNDR). The Faculty of Agronomy in Port-au-Prince turns out
about 40 agronomists and 15 veterinary assistants per year, and agricultural
schools in the interior train about 100 agricultural technicians per year.
Rural education and functional literacy courses are under the responsibility
of DARNDR and the National Office of Alphabetization and Community Development
(ONAAC), respectively, while several private groups give training in agricul-
ture at the vocational level and education at the elementary level for rural
children. Although the training programs and output of agricultural staff and
veterinary assistants are, by and large, adequate, there is a lack of veteri-
narians. Research is conducted at a central experimental station in Damien
and at plots throughout the country, but facilities and personnel are inade-
quate. The Agricultural Extension Service (SVA) assists farmers in adopting
improved methods of production, while the Rural Animation Service (SAR)
further supports such efforts and also assists in community development. Both
services are staffed by some 200 mostly medium-level technicians, reaching at
present only about 5% of farmers (30,000 farmers). A proposed program to
strengthen agricultural extension is included in the 1976-81 Agricultural
Development Plan and would increase to 300,000 the number of farmers reached
by 1981.
2.09      Agricultural credit is provided through two specialized Government
agencies -- the Institute for Agricultural and Industrial Development (IDAI),
which is a multi-sector financing institution, and the Bureau of Agricultural
Credit (BCA), which has been especially designed to serve the needs of small
farmers by organizing them into groups. In 1975, the portfolio of both these
agencies amounted to US$593,000, which represents only about 0.17% of the
value of agricultural production and reached only about 0.5% of all farmers.
Both institutions require Government financial support to break even.
Rural indebtedness to non-institutional credit sources, such as relatives,
merchants and moneylenders, is widespread, with interest rates running up to
120% a year or higher. The bulk of IDAI's funds is invested in industry, and
most of its agricultural loans go to farmers owning more than 5 ha. The rate
of interest charged by IDAI was raised from 8% to 9% in September 1976. The
BCA is a bureau within the framework of DARNDR, which is chaired by the State
Secretary of DARNDR and managed by a Director appointed by the President of
the Republic. Its staff of 50 persons is distributed among nine regional
offices, including one at Cap-Haitien with a staff of eight. In 1975, BCA



advanced US$165,000, mainly by way of short-term loans for crop production, to
groups of seven to 15 small farmers known as SACs who would borrow under a
mutual group guarantee, and to particularly efficient individual farmers. The
average loan per SAC was about US$200 and that to individuals, about US$90.
A limited amount of term credit was also extended for small irrigation works,
land improvement, and agricultural machinery. In December 1976, the rate of
interest charged by BCA for all its loans was increased from 8% to 9%. Com-
pared to around 15% at commercial banks, this rate is negative in real terms,
in view of the about 18% rate of inflation in 1975, which, however, is ex-
pected to decline sharply over the medium term. BCA's income from interest
in 1975 amounted to only 11% of total operating costs while the Government
subsidy amounted to 70% and other income to 3%, leaving a loss equal to 16%.
Arrears, uncollectible in large part, stood at about 40% of its portfolio.
2.10      Although the BCA's financial standing is poor, it will have to play
an important role in rural development programs, as it is, by statute, dedi-
cated to providing technical assistance and credit to small farmers. Its
past performance mainly reflects the impact of the basic difficulties faced
in the supply of agricultural credit to small farmers in Haiti such as: (a)
fragmentation of holdings (1.2 ha average); (b) lack of farmer organizations at
the grass-root level; (c) inadequacy of the infrastructure such as feeder and
farm access roads and irrigation facilities; and (d) lack of adequate extension
and marketing services. In view of the severe constraint of financial, tech-
nical and administrative resources, the strategy of the Government is to
promote the development of institutional credit gradually in step with that of
other agricultural services and infrastructure, which is being undertaken on a
region-by-region basis as, for example, under programs such as the on-going
projects in Artibonite, the Plain of Gonaives, and the proposed IDA project.
The problem of the reorganization of BCA is, at the same time, being reviewed
by Government with the assistance of consultants employed by the USAID in
connection with its agricultural credit activities in Haiti, which include (a)
a grant of US$3 million for disbursement as fertilizer credit to small coffee
growers; (b) strengthening of BCA with the support of three expatriate consul-
tants (agriculturalist, credit adviser and management specialist) and 28
agricultural credit extensionists; and (c) a proposed US$1 million project for
similarly assisting the production of subsistence crops.
Agricultural Prices and Marketing
2.11      Except for sugarcane, for which the Government sets the price, there
is no price regulation. The weak bargaining position of the producers,
particularly small farmers, works to the advantage of exporters, processing
industries and the merchant sector, which enjoy the availability of capital
and, to some extent, of credit. Thus, the agricultural price system in Haiti
has not so far provided sufficient incentives for increased production.
2.12      Coffee exports are controlled by a few large operators, with about
2,000 middlemen providing the link with producers, mostly small farmers.
Food crops, on the other hand, are marketed along traditional lines by num-
erous small operators who purchase, assemble, process and transport the produce



in small lots to regional and consumer markets. The system is labor-intensive
and reasonably efficient, but, because of an almost total lack of storage,
marketing and credit facilities, crop forecasts and market information, as
well as of all-weather roads, the farmer is unable to cushion steep seasonal
and geographic price variations.
Physical Infrastructure
2.13      Irrigation is a major priority in Governnent's development policy.
Of the estimated 150,000 ha of irrigable land in the country, about 70,000 ha
are being irrigated by over 100 systems. The larger irrigation districts
include the Artibonite, the Trois Rivieres, the Gonaives, the Limbe, the
Quartier Morin and St. Raphael systems. The smaller systems are largely con-
centrated in the Southern Peninsula and the Arcahaie Plain, and a well irri-
gation system is operative in the Cul-de-Sac plain. Systems serving about
80% of the irrigated lands are in need of extensive rehabilitation, particu-
larly those in the Northern Department.
2.14      The main Port-au-Prince/Cap-Haitien highway is being reconstructed,
with assistance from IDA (para 1.02), while the important southern route,
Port-au-Prince/Les Cayes, is being built with IDB assistance. A branch to
Jacmel is being financed by the French Fund for Assistance and Cooperation
(FAC). Lack of adequate secondary, feeder and farm access roads, however,
continues to handicap rural development, and the chronic lack of maintenance
must be overcome if the transport infrastructure is to be effective.
2.15      Potable water supply facilities are insufficient in all rural/urban
centers. Some of the existing systems require extensive rehabilitation, and
a program to tap underground water and springs is needed.
2.16      A series of privately owned small thermoelectric plants are scat-
tered throughout the country to provide electricity to the rural sector.
An IDA-financed power project (para 1.02) will help construct a 21-MW diesel
power station in Port-au-Prince, expand and rehabilitate the distribution
network and provide technical assistance.
Health Services
2.17      The health services provided in rural areas are much poorer than
those in urban areas, although the 1975 Health Plan designates the rural
population as its principal objective. The Governnent has been giving health
a high priority, providing it with almost 14% of current budgetary expendi-
tures. The health sector has been recently strengthened by an IDB-financed
program for rural health services and by UNICEF grants to equip health facili-
ties and promote a nutrition program.
C.   Government's Rural Development Strategy
2.18      With over 80% of its population in agriculture and limited pros-
pects in other sectors, development of the rural sector is a major goal of the



- 6 -
Government. An average annual public expenditure in the rural sector, esti-
mated at US$4.9 million for the 1974-77 period, is scheduled to be increased
to about US$20 million in 1977-81, rîsing from 9 to 25% of total public expendi-
tures.   Since these amounts far exceed Government's own resources, most of the
funds will have to be provided by external assistance.
2.19      The agricultural sector is characterized by (a) a low per capita
income (slightly over US$60); (b) by small farm sizes (1.2 ha); (c) a poor
infrastructure; and (d) lack of public support services. The Government's
strategy for rural development, therefore, calls first for the rehabilitation
and extension of the existing transport and irrigation infrastructure. Food
crop production would be increased next, followed by an expansion of export
crops, particularly coffee and sugar, through increased agricultural credit
and improved extension services to farmers to be organized into groups.
However, because of the constraints encountered in the sector, nationwide
efforts have little chance to succeed and Government is formulating projects
and plans in the framework of a policy of regionalization, based on on-going
projects such as those in the Gonaives and Artibonite plains and the Petit
Goave and Les Cayes projects. Special attention will also be given to increas-
ing the incomes and living standards of small farmers by providing basic
infrastructure, improved technology packages and adequate support and social
services through rural development projects.
2.20      The proposed project is in line with the above strategy and the
overall approach of regionalization, with emphasis on rehabilitation of
existing infrastructure, increased food crop production and the establishment
of a project organization whose operations would gradually extend, in a second
phase, to the whole Northern Department.
III.   THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      The project would be located in Haiti's Northern Department and
would cover the entire arrondissement of Cap-Haitien (500 km 2) (Map), in-
cluding the irrigation district of Quartier Morin, and the irrigation district
of St. Raphael in the arrondissement of Grande Riviere du Nord (Annex 1).
Quartier Morin, with about 2,000 ha, and St. Raphael, with about 1,900 ha,
are both presently irrigating only about 50% of the areas commanded, being
in need of extensive rehabilitation. There is a total of about 45,000 ha
of agricultural land of which about 35,000 ha is cultivated each year. The
soils present well structured clay and clay loams highly suitable for crop
production. Rainfall (annual average in the lower plain, 1,300 mm; in
St. Raphael, 850 mm) is very irregular and droughts are frequent (Annex 1).
Groundwater potential in the lower plain is extensive. Several privately
owned wells north of Quartier Morin penetrate a slightly artesian aquifer and
yield over 100 liters/second, pumped from a relatively shallow depth at
reasonable costs.
3.02      There are about 220,000 people in the project area, including about
8,000 people living in the irrigation district of St. Raphael. About 50,000



- 7 -
people live in the capital of the Northern Department, Cap-Haitien, whereas
the rural population accounts for about 160,000 persons (or about 30,000
families). About 92% of the project area's rural population (roughly 147,000
persons) are under the level of absolute poverty (para 2.07). This economic
deprivation is compounded by lack of health and school facilities, malnutri-
tion and endemic diseases (diarrhea, tuberculosis, and the like), a poor
physical infrastructure (roads, drinking water, electricity) and an extremely
limited social and communications infrastructure. The municipal markets in
Cap-Haitien and St. Raphael are insanitary and badly equipped, as is the
abattoir at Cap-Haitien.
3.03      Over the last few years, the price of land in the project area has
gone up tenfold and land purchases by larger farmers have increased signifi-
cantly due to growing demand for agricultural products and rumors of infra-
structure improvements expected under the proposed project. However, the
Government has recently enacted a law to curtail land speculation in develop-
ment areas. Further, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
Governnent would (a) take all appropriate measures to determine and widely
publicize fair prices for land acquisition and for rental in the zones of the
project area which will remain rainfed under the project; (b) prohibit land
transactions in the Quartier Morin and St. Raphael irrigation districts until
the irrigation rehabilitation/expansion works of the project are completed
or the Government gives its prior approval; and (c) after the completion of
the irrigation rehabilitation/expansion works, take all appropriate measures
to determine and widely publicize fair prices for land acquisition and for
rental in the above irrigation districts.
3.04      Agriculture in the project area is dominated by small farms.
Farmers cultivating up to 6.5 ha -- who constitute the central core of the
target group -- represent about 92% of all farmers and their holdings repre-
sent about 53% of the cultivated land. About 98% of all farms have less than
13 ha, occupying almost 70% of the land, and there are only about 12 farms in
the 65- to 130-ha category, 12 farms with somewhat over 130 ha, and one farm
comprising about 400 ha. About 74% of all farms are run by owners, 10% by
tenants, 10% by managers and 6% by sharecroppers (Annex 1).
3.05      Food crops -- mainly corn and beans, some sorghum and rice, bananas,
yams and manioc -- occupy almost two-thirds of the cultivated area (23,000 ha).
Cash crops comprise sugarcane, on almost 20% of the cultivated area (7,000 ha),
and coffee, cocoa and citrus, on about 15% of the cultivated area (5,000 ha).
Agricultural services such as extension and credit are almost non-existent
and use of modern inputs is practically unknown. There are roughly 20,000
head of cattle, 50,000 pigs and 20,000 goats. Livestock diseases in the area
are controllable, but animal health facilities are poor. The project area's
production barely covers subsistence food needs for both the rural and
Cap-Haitien population and generates an annual per capita monetary income of
only about US$10.

IV.   THE PROJECT
A.   Brief Description
4.01      The project would be carried out over a four-year period and would
rehabilitate and expand irrigation systems, provide credit to mostly small
farmers, carry out agricultural trials and seed multiplication, improve tech-
nical assistance, set up an animal health service, rehabilitate two municipal
markets and an abattoir, repair and construct feeder and access roads, and
improve rural water supply. In addition, the project would sponsor training
for project staff, carry out studies for project implementation and prepara-
tion of a follow-up project, and undertake project monitoring and evaluation.
An "Organisme de Developpement du Nord" (ODN), established under the President
of the Republic would carry out the project and coordinate and supervise the
project-related efforts of all the participating agencies.
4.02      The project would concentrate on removing key constraints to devel-
opment not presently covered by other programs. Thus, no human.health compo-
nent is included since extensive assistance in health is already being pro-
vided by the Government, IDB, PAHO, UNICEF, USAID and religious organizations,
e.g., Center for Rural Development of Milot (CRUDEM) in the project area.
Likewise, education and erosion-prevention components are excluded as these
requirements are being met by IDA's first education project (para 1.02) and
by WFP/FAO project No. 2105, respectively.
B.  Detailed Features
Irrigation
4.03      Rainfall in the project area is relatively high, but very irregular
and droughts are frequent (Annex 1). Therefore, all canals and drains of the
Quartier Morin district would be cleared and repaired, syphons and distribution
structures rehabilitated, and dikes along the Grande Riviere du Nord repaired
(Annex 2). Irrigation and drainage canal systems would also be extended to
serve an additional 800 ha, bringing the total irrigated area to 2,000 ha.
Land leveling and construction of gates, farm ditches and drains would be
carried out on the total 2,000 ha. The 1,900-ha St. Raphael district would
receive similar extensive rehabilitation works, including on-farm improvements.
Pending the above improvements, sufficient water is available to allow double
cropping on about 85% of the area in the Quartier Morin district and 70% of
the St. Raphael district. In addition, up to 14 wells would be constructed in
the area north of Quartier Morin, each about 40 m deep and equipped with a
diesel pump, irrigating altogether about 1,000 ha.
Agricultural Credit
4.04      Agricultural credit would be made available through BCA (Annex 3)
to SACs and to individual farmers who cultivate up to 10 ha in the irrigated



- 9 -
areas and up to about 15 ha in the rainfed areas. Short-terim subloans to cover
the costs of fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, livestock medication and such,
and medium-term credit to purchase draft-oxen, yokes, plows, sprayers, pumps
and the like would be provided. On an experimental basis, medium-term credit
would also be extended for construction of simple grain storage facilities,
such as a 3- to 4-ton container, or larger storage of up to 50 tons for use on
a collective basis.
Agricultural Trials and Seed Production
4.05      The project would provide for comprehensive agricultural trials and
seed production programs in collaboration with the Caldos sugar mill and
CRUDEM and with individual farmers, subcontracted by ODN (Annex 4), by finan-
cing equipment for land preparation, planting and harvesting; transport; seed
processing and laboratory tests; and related operating expenses for fuel,
fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, seed and the like. It would also provide
technical assistance.
Extension Services
4.06      Both the regional SVA and SAR (para 2.08) would be strengthened by
the establishment of field offices in Quartier Morin, Plaine du Nord and
St. Raphael, as well as by transportation and working facilities and additional
staff (Annexes 5 and 6) to allow fôr one extension agent for about 200 farmers
and one animation agent for each commune.
Animal Health
4.07      The project would strengthen the regional Veterinary and Livestock
Services (SMV/SE) in the project area by providing two additional veterinary
assistants; constructing field offices in Plaine du Nord and St. Raphael;
purchasing motorbikes and veterinary equipment; providing incremental oper-
ating funds, principally for the operation of vehicles; and purchasing drugs,
medicines and vaccines (Annex 7).
Municipal Markets and Abattoir
2
4.08      The roofed 5,000 m  central market in Cap-Haitien would be completely
renovated and equipped with-adequate water and drainage facilities, sanitary
installations, display tables, butcher shops, and a 3-ton capacity cold
storage room. The open-air "abattoir market" would be provided with adequate
water supply, drainage, sanitary installations, some display tables, and paved
walkways. The municipal market of St. Raphael would also undergo improvement
works, including provision of water supply, pavement of the market area, pro-
vision of2adequate drainage, and construction of a slaughter-slab (Annex 8).
The 300 m municipal abattoir of Cap-Haitien would be completely renovated
(Annex 9).



- 10 -
Roads
4.09      The project would provide for the construction of 53.5 km of feeder
roads in the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien and 13 km of feeder roads and 27 km
of farm access roads in the St. Raphael area and for their maintenance during
the disbursement period (Annex 10). The project would also provide a simple
equipment fleet, related operating funds, as well as tools for maintaining and
repairing the equipment fleet at the workshop of the National Road Maintenance
Service (SPRRN) in Cap-Haitien.
Potable Water
4.10      The project would finance the construction of up to 400 hand-dug wells
operated with hand pumps and up to five small water supply systems served by
springs (Annex 11). Wells would be 2 to 10 m deep with 1 m diameter lined
with prefabricated reinforced concrete rings or brick, disinfected and protected
with reinforced concrete covers. The small water supply systems would have
spring catchments, a small concrete water reservoir, and plastic pipes leading
to three or four public standpipes.
Project Administration
4.11      The project would finance the establishment of the ODN in Cap-Haitien
(Annex 12) to plan, coordinate, supervise and administer project implementa-
tion (paras 5.01 to 5.04). Offices for this agency would be built and fur-
nished and the salaries of staff, including nine resident senior specialists
(Annex 13) and support staff, would be financed. Short-term consultant
services (35 man-months) would be divided between project implementation
(about 22 man-months) and the preparation of a follow-up rural development
project (about 13 man-months). Vehicles and equipment would be purchased
and operating expenses covered. ODN would be supplied with funds to finance
training in agricultural credit, agricultural extension, and rural animation
(Annexes 3, 5 and 6), and for overseas training for Haitian ODN staff in
practical aspects of project-related work.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
4.12      Project monitoring and evaluation would be carried out by the
Evaluation and Control Unit within the Agricultural Planning Unit of DARNDR
to assess project results, permit timely modifications of its design and
determine the extent to which the project could be replicated elsewhere in
the country. Project funds would cover salaries of a project monitoring and
evaluation specialist and support staff and operational expenses (Annex 14).
C.   Cost Estimates
4.13      Total project costs are estimated at US$13.4 million, including a
foreign exchange component of US$8.2 million, or about 61% of total project
costs. A detailed cost analysis is provided in Annexes 15 and 16 and
summarized follows:

4.14       Cost estimates are based on mid-1976 prices.  Physical contingencies
include about 20% on irrigation expansion/rehabilitation, water supply, trials
and seed production, municipal markets and abattoir and 10% on road construc-
tion. Expected price increases have been calculated by compounding the follow-
ing annual rates of increase for both local and foreign costs: for buildings
and civil works, 6.5% in 1976, 12% in 1977 through 1979, and 10% thereafter;
for equipment, 4.5% in 1976, 8% in 1977 through 1979, and 7% thereafter;
and for all other costs, 3.75% in 1976, and 7.5% thereafter.
D.   Financing
4.15       Project financing would be shared by the Haitian Government, WFP,
and by the IDA as follows:

The proposed IDA credit of US$10 million, or about 75% of total project
costs, would be made to the Government on standard terms. It would cover
US$8.2 million, or 100% of the estimated foreign exchange component, and
US$1.8 million, or 35% of local expenditures, which is justified on country
grounds. The contribution of the WFP--equivalent to the cost of two million
man-days of unskilled labor in the form of "food for work"--estimated at
appraisal at US$1.4 million, or about 10% of total project costs, would be
made to the Government as a grant, and the Government's contribution would
cover US$2 million, or almost 15% of total project costs. Government's
contribution would principally meet local salaries (US$1.5 million) and a
limited proportion (5% to 10%) of other local expenditures. A detailed
financing plan is given in Annex 17. Whereas the share of the WFP in project
financing would be in kind, Government and IDA funds, totalling US$12 million,
would be passed on as a grant to ODN. ODN would use about 28% of these funds
(US$3.4 million) for implementing the project and would channel the remaining
72% (US$8.6 million) to the participating regional agencies.
4.16      The Government has requested bilateral assistance from the Federal
Republic of Germany and France to finance the cost of the resident consultants.
The authorities in both countries are favorably inclined towards this request,



- 13 -
the processing of which has already been initiated. During negotiations, the
Government agreed that, should bilateral assistance materialize, IDA could
cancel an amount of the proposed IDA credit equivalent to the assistance so
received, which is expected to amount to about US$2 million.
4.17      It would be a condition of credit effectiveness that IDA had been
informed by WFP that its ongoing "food for work" program in Haiti, No. 2105,
had been modified to provide 200,000 man-days of unskilled labor for the first
year of the project. Agreement in principle has been reached regarding WFP's
next program in Haiti, which would provide the balance (1.8 million man-days)
of labor required for the project. In addition, assurances were obtained from
the Government during negotiations that it would make the necessary budgetary
allocations to cover its share of the project cost during the life of the
project.
E.   Procurement
4.18      "Food for work" (equivalent to the cost of two million man-days of
unskilled labor) would be financed by WFP, and procurement would be in line
with its procedures. All other procurement would be in accordance with the
Bank,Group's Procurement Guidelines. Contracts in excess of US$50,000 for
buildings (US$0.4 million), drilling of irrigation wells (US$0.3 million), and
purchase of vehicles and equipment (US$1.3 million), aggregating about US$2
million, would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA guidelines. Goods manufactured locally would be allowed a
preference of 15% (or the level of applicable import duty, whichever is lower)
over foreign goods, and for civil works, domestic contractors would be granted
a 7.5% preference over foreign contractors. Contracts of less than US$50,000
but over US$10,000 would be awarded in accordance with Government procedures
satisfactory to IDA. The bulk of civil works for irrigation rehabilitation/
expansion and road construction would be done on force account, but small
local contractors would be hired to carry out specific construction tasks.
The services of internationally recruited resident and short-term consul-
tants, costing about US$2.4 million, would be obtained in accordance with
procedures acceptable to IDA.
F.   Disbursement
4.19      The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed over a four-year
period to cover the following amounts:
(a)  Civil works, excluding expenditures on vehicles and equipment:
(i) 60% of total expenditures on irrigation rehabilitation/
expansion (US$1.9 million); and



- 14 -
(ii)  90Z of total expenditures on office buildings and staff
dwellings, rehabilitation and improvement of three muni-
cipal markets and one abattoir, potable water supply
facilities and road construction (US$1.7 million);
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures on imported vehicles and equipment,
or, if procured locally, 75% of local expenditures (US$1.3 million);
(c) 95% of expenditures for agricultural credit (US$1 million);
(d) 95% of total expenditures for project administration (except
salaries), and expenditures on vehicles and equipment (US$0.7
million); and
(e) 100% of total expenditures on resident and short-term consul-
tants and fellowships for project staff (US$2.2 million).
US$1.2 million would be unallocated. Any unspent balance would be cancelled.
Annex 18 shows the estimated quarterly disbursements. Disbursements would be
made against import documentation, contracts, or against certified statements
of expenditures. For disbursements against the latter, documents would not be
submitted to IDA for review, but would be retained by ODN for possible scrutiny
by project supervision missions. All statements of expenditures would be
signed by the Project Accountant and countersigned by the Project Director.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Administration
5.01      ODN.  Implementation of the project would be the responsibility of
ODN (Chart), established under the President of the Republic and supervised by
a Board chaired by the State Secretary of DARNDR and including representatives
of the Departments of Public Works (TPTC) and of Finance, BNRH, the Planning
Council (CONADEP), and the Director of ODN. A Regional Coordinating Committee,
comprising the Director of ODN and representatives of the relevant Government
services, non-Government agencies and farmers, would review twice a year, or
whenever the need arises, the progress of ODN operations and propose changes
if necessary. The draft statutes for ODN's establishment were submitted to
IDA for review prior to their enactment.
5.02      ODN headquarters would be in Cap-Haitien and be adequately staffed
and equipped (Annex 12). It would comprise two basic units: a planning,
coordinating and work supervision unit and an administrative and accounting
unit. The nine key staff members of ODN would be the Director, his Deputy
(an agricultural economist or agronomist), a surface water irrigation spe-
cialist, a groundwater irrigation specialist, an agronomist, a marketing/
agricultural credit specialist, a road construction engineer, a community
development officer, and a chief accountant. Necessary support personnel



- 15 -
would complete the staff and 35 man-months of short-term consultants would be
provided for the various project components. A Haitian national, who has been
selected in consultation with IDA, would be the Director, assisted by an
internationally recruited Deputy Director with project management experience.
The community development officer and chief accountant would also be Haitian
nationals. However, since it is unlikely that qualified and experienced
Haitian nationals would be available to fill the remaining posts, expatriates
would be hired, providing each with a suitably qualified counterpart. By the
end of the disbursement period, the counterparts would replace the special-
ists. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(a) candidates for the six internationally and three locally recruited key
project staff positions, as well as the short-term consultants, would be
approved by IDA and would fulfill terms of reference and conditions of
appointment acceptable to IDA within an established timeframe set out in
Schedule A of Annex 13; and (b) it would make available adequate support
staff also in accordance with Schedule A of Annex 13. A condition of credit
effectiveness would be that the Director and Deputy Director of ODN had been
employed by the Government.
5.03      ODN would coordinate the activities of other relevant regional
services involved in rural development in the project area, such as those for
health and education, as well as those of bilateral and multilateral agencies
and of private organizations. In addition, ODN would participate in the
yearly review by Government and IDA of projected sugarcane production in the
project area, of the processing capacity of the sugar mill and regarding the
establishment of a yearly cutting and collection schedule for sugarcane as
well as assist in the supervision of these arrangements (para 6.03).
5.04      ODN would rely on existing public services to execute specific
project components, but would execute by itself and/or through the use of
private consultants and/or governnental agencies all necessary planning and
pre-investment studies for the proposed project operations and the prepara-
tion of a follow-up project. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that each of the governmental agencies participating in the project would:
(a) carry out the components of the project entrusted to it and increase and
maintain its staff during the life of the project, following the timetable in
Schedule A of Annex 13, except as the Association shall otherwise agree;
(b) submit to ODN for approval, no later than July 1, 1977, its investment and
operating budget for project-related activities, as well as its operating
plans for the next fiscal year's activities under the project; (c) submit, by
July l of each following year, a report on its planned activities relating to
the project for subsequent years; and (d) submit the annual report of project-
related activities carried out in the year by October 31 of each following
year. An initial implementation schedule of project activities is given in
Annex 12, Table 3. Assurances were also obtained with regard to the improve-
ment of DARNDR services by requiring the Government to undertake annual
reviews, beginning not later than the end of the first project year, of:
(a) the adequacy of agricultural training programs so as to ensure a nationally
adequate number of trained support staff (based mainly on the requirements of
the regional integrated development projects) and to review their conditions



- 16 -
of employment with a view to attracting and retaining qualified personnel in
agriculture; and (b) the need for technical assistance to strengthen DARNDR.
5.05      Irrigation.  The rehabilitation, expansion and maintenance of irri-
gation facilities would be the responsibility of the Irrigation and River
Control Service (SICR), with assistance from the regional Hyraulics Service
(SHRH). Both services would be strengthened under the project to enable them
to carry out the bulk of the construction works on force account, and small
contractors would be hired to carry out specific construction tasks. Further-
more, international contractors would construct the irrigation wells if the
Government-owned drilling rig would not be available to construct them on force
account. SICR would also prepare the detailed program for rehabilitation/
expansion works, including the technical modifications to the existing gravity
irrigation systems and the design for expansion works and groundwater irriga-
tion. The present staff of SICR would be reinforced by a staff of 70 persons,
including assistant engineers/technicians, gate tenders, pump operators, tax
collectors and support staff (Annex 2).
5.06      Civil works would start in year 1 with the rehabilitation/expansion
of the Quartier Morin irrigation district, followed by the groundwater develop-
ment scheme north of Quartier Morin during year 2. The St. Raphael irrigation
rehabilitation would also begin in year 2. Responsibility for operating and
maintaining the irrigation systems would rest with ODN and SICR during the
disbursement period and with SICR thereafter. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that the project-financed irrigation systems would be properly
maintained during the life of the project (20 years). After completion of the
rehabilitation/ expansion works, all operating and maintenance costs would be
paid by the beneficiaries through water charges, which would include the costs
of supervisory staff, to be collected by SICR. Assurances were also obtained
from Government that:  (a) the level of water charges would cover operation
and maintenance costs and the largest possible share of the investment costs
of rehabilitation/expansion works (expected to be about 50% of these costs);
(b) SICR would be entrusted with the collection of these charges; and (c) the
charges would be determined in consultation with IDA after completion of the
rehabilitation/expansion works and in accordance with the payment capacity of
the beneficiaries. The water charges covering operation and maintenance costs
would be retained at the Cap-Haitien office of SICR to be used for necessary
works.
5.07      Agricultural Credit.  Agricultural credit would be the responsibi-
lity of ODN but would be provided through the BCA, which would act as its
agent for the purpose, with the support of a special staff of 13 to be
financed under the project and employed at BCA's Regional Office at Cap-Haitien
and at three field offices to be set up in the project area. The staff would
include an agricultural economist, a marketing officer, three credit exten-
sion officers, seven credit extension agents, and an accountant. This staff,
which would be trained by, and work under the guidance of the marketing/
agricultural credit specialist of ODN, would continue BCA's efforts to organ-
ize small farmers into about 400 SACs over a four-year period (from 20 in the



- 17 -
first year to 200 in the fourth). This staff would also prepare subloan
applications, help disburse credit as approved by ODN (which would also assure
that the farm plans are technically sound), and assist farmers in obtaining
agricultural inputs, marketing agricultural production and constructing grain
storage facilities. Subloan recoveries would be remitted to ODN to be avail-
able for relending.
5.08      Under the present statute governing SACs, 5% of the amount lent to
them is withheld by BCA as a guarantee deposit on which interest is paid and
which, in effect, would represent small farmers' contribution to project cost
in the case of project subloans. Farmers who borrow individually and are
likely to be cultivating up to 13 ha of land would, however, be required to
make a 10% cash contribution. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the Governnent would (a) maintain the interest rate charged by BCA on its
subloans at 9% per annum for the first two years of the project; and (b) raise,
thereafter, the cost of such loans, either by an increase in such interest rate
to 11% per annum, or by the addition thereto of a commission of 2% per annum.
Terms and conditions of project subloans are set out in Schedule A of Annex 3.
5.09      Though BCA would immediately be strengthened by the staff under the
USAID program, the employment of additional staff, and the establishment of
three field offices under the proposed IDA project, its role under the project
would be limited to that of an agency for channeling subloans and be subject
to the control of ODN, which would meet the staff and other operating costs of
BCA related to project subloans during the disbursement period. It is, how-
ever, necessary to build it up gradually into a viable credit institution to
serve the small farmers in the country generally and, in particular, those
covered by possible future rural development projects. Governanent recognizes
the importance of this goal and is reviewing the problem, with the assistance
of USAID, so as to formulate a suitable plan of action (para 2.10). Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that Governnent would furnish to IDA, within
nine months of Credit signature, or such longer period as IDA may agree,
a program for the reorganization and financial strengthening of the BCA and
implement such a program as agreed with the Association (the elements of such
a program are given in Schedule B of Annex 3).
5.10      Agricultural Trials and Seed Production.  ODN would have direct
responsibility for agricultural trials and seed production (Annex 4), with
supervision carried out by the agency's agronomist. Sugarcane trials would
be carried out in collaboration with the Caldos sugar mill while other trials
and seed production would be coordinated with CRUDEM at its experimental
station and subcontracted with individual farmers. ODN and the SVA would
provide the necessary inputs and technical assistance, and an agricultural
technician on ODN's staff would manage both programs. Three man-months of
short-term consultants would be provided for specific technical probleins.
5.11      Trial plots in individual farms would be distributed throughout
the project area but seed production would be carried out only in irrigation
districts to insure adequate yields and avoid crop failures. A proposed UNDP-
financed trial and seed production center in the project area is expected to
continue these programs at the end of the project's disbursement period.



- 18 -
5.12      Extension Services.  The regional SVA would carry out agricultural
and livestock extension under the project (Annex 5) and actively participate
in the agricultural trials and seed production activities (para 5.10). The
staff for this service would be reinforced by three additional extension
officers and 30 extension agents. The regional SAR would also be strengthened
by six additional agents (Annex 6) and would work in close coordination with
other relevant services, in particular with ONAAC as regards functional
literacy.
5.13      Animal Health.  The regional SMV/SE would treat livestock against
intestinal parasites and carry out vaccination campaigns in the project area
against Hog Cholera, New Castle disease, and other potential animal diseases.
Veterinary services would be free, but cost of vaccines, drugs and medications
would be collected (Annex 7). Assurances, therefore, were obtained during
negotiations that Government would cause the regional SMV/SE in the project
area (a) to be responsible for the collection of the cost of vaccines, drugs
and medication; (b) to determine the level of these costs and methods of
collection thereof in agreement with the Government and after consultation
with IDA; and (c) to ensure the continued control of major endemic diseases.
5.14      Markets and Abattoir.  ODN would, in collaboration with a short-
term construction engineer consultant, prepare detailed plans for the
rehabilitation/improvement of three markets (Annex 8) and one abattoir (Annex
9), provide the necessary construction materials and equipment, and supervise
the works. The bulk of work in Cap-Haitien would be carried out by municipal
technicians and laborers to be remunerated by the municipality, while in St.
Raphael, work would be done by small contractors paid by the project. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that the three
markets and the abattoir when completed would be properly organized, managed
and maintained by the respective municipalities, and that market and slaugh-
ter fees collected by the municipalities would be sufficient to cover the
management and maintenance costs of the facilities.
5.15      Roads.  Feeder and farm access roads (Annex 10) would be constructed
by the regional office of TPTC on force account. WFP "food for work" labor
forces (about 200,000 man-days) would carry out construction and maintenance
works by hand labor whenever feasible. Design of roads, their alignment
selection, and work supervision would be done by the same service, aided by
the road construction engineer on ODN's staff. Construction of project-
financed roads would start by mid-year 1, with the bulk of the works to be
carried out in years 2 and 3. SEPRRN would assume maintenance responsibility.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that the project-
financed roads would be properly maintained during the life of the project.
5.16      Of vital importance to the project would be the construction of
an all-weather road of about 30 km from Grande Riviere du Nord to the irriga-
tion district of St. Raphael (Map). This link is included in the second USAID
highway project, signed on June 29, 1976. The first section from Grande
Riviere du Nord to Dondon (about 15 km) has already been completed and work is
proceeding on the remaining section.



- 19 -
5.17      Potable Water.  Rural water supply facilities in the project area
(Annex 11) would be constructed and maintained by the SHRH in collaboration
with the National Agency for Rural Water Supply (COALEP). Water specialists
on ODN's staff would be available for technical assistance. SHRH, assist-
ed by ODN, would site and design both wells and small water supply systems,
supervise their construction and provide materials and equipment as well
as the assistance of two mechanics to assist with the installation, provided
the beneficiaries carried out excavation works and masonry free of charge.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that: (a) project-financed
potable water supply systems and wells would be properly maintained during the
life of the project; and (b) their maintenance costs would be met by the
beneficiarles.
5.18      Monitoring and Evaluation.  These tasks would be carried out by
the Evaluation and Control Unit wlthin the Agricultural Planning Unit of
DARNDR, which would be strengthened for this purpose by an experienced monitor-
ing and evaluation expert, and necessary support staff. The Unit would pre-
pare a summary report for the project at least once a year and other special
reports as needed. The reports would be reviewed with ODN and subsequently
made availabile to the Government, the ODN Board, the Regional Coordinating
Committee and IDA. A final summary evaluation would be prepared at the end of
project implementation. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government that it would: (a) within one year from the date of signing of
the Credit Agreement, appoint a project monitoring and evaluation expert,
acceptable to IDA, to the Evaluation and Control Unit of DARNDR and expand the
staff of this Unit in consultation with IDA; (b) require the expert, with the
assistance of Unit staff, to prepare annual reports on the progress of the
project, in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA; and
(c) within three months following the end of each project year, cause the Unit
to furnish the annual reports to the Government and IDA. In addition to
monitoring and evaluating the proposed project, the above expert would assist
the DARNDR Evaluation and Control Unit to train its staff, to develop monitor-
ing and evaluation methods for rural projects in Haiti and to expand the
Unit's activities nationwide.
Accounts and Audits
5.19      Accounts in the different regional services and the municipalities
of Cap-Haitien and St. Raphael, relevant to the implementation of the project,
would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, and the
auditors' reports thereon would be sent to ODN within three months of the end
of each fiscal year. ODN, in turn, would keep separate accounts of the
various project components; have them audited by independent auditors with
qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to IDA; and send
its balance sheet and profit-and-loss statement, together with the auditors'
report thereon, to IDA within four months after the end of ODN's fiscal
year. Assurances on these points were obtained at negotiations.



- 20 -
Cost Recovery
5.20      Based on the farm model projections (Annex 19) and the calculation
of rent and cost recovery indices (Annex 2, Table 7), about 50% of cash
investment for the rehabilitation of the irrigation systems would be paid
back by the beneficiaries over a period of 20 years, including a five-year
grace period, through water charges collected by SICR to be transferred
to the Government. Excluding this payment, ODN earnings due to the project
would be negligible (US$25,000). Government's cash flow throughout the
life of the project would be negative (Annex 20), due to operating costs of
about US$275,000, which Government would have to cover after the disbursement
period. The estimated annual incremental deficit, including credit repay-
ment (about US$200,000), is based on the assumption that only irrigation fees
(US$3.20 per ha, or about US$15,000 per year) and income from sales of drugs
and medications (about US$10,000 per year) would be collected and that no
additional project-related taxes or duties would be levied, except for export
taxes on incremental sugar production, expected to yield about US$140,000 per
year; further, it does not take into account the increased revenues from
indirect taxes--resulting from purchases of taxed goods by project benefi-
ciaries --which are difficult to quantify. During the disbursement period,
ODN, in consultation with IDA, would examine the possibilities of generating
revenues to cover part of Goverrment's deficit arising from the project.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES, AND PROJECT BENEFITS
Production
6.01      At full development, in year 7, annual incremental production by
some 4,000 smallholders (1,800 in the rainfed area and 2,200 in the irrigated
districts of Quartier Morin and St. Raphael) and about 100 medium-size farmers
would be some 80,000 tons of sugarcane, 1,200 tons of maize, 200 tons of
sorghum, 150 tons of rice, 470 tons of beans, 240 tons of bananas, 1,500 tons
of yams, 660 tons of manioc, 200 tons of tobacco, 720 tons of legumes, 150
tons of beef, 220 tons of pork, and 240 tons of milk. In addition, the proj-
ect would increase, to some extent, the production of the remaining 26,000
rural families in the area through better rural animation, agricultural
extension and animal health services and availability of improved seeds.
Markets and Prices
6.02      With the exception of sugar, about 80% of which would be exported,
all project-induced agricultural products would be consumed domestically.
Such products, accounting for only about 1% of Haiti's total agricultural
production, are in strong domestic demand. Grains, bananas, rice and tubers
are produced mostly for on-farm consumption (85%), the rest being sold on
the local rural market or through intermediaries in the departmental and
national capitals. Tobacco is, at present, largely consumed in the project
area, but production of higher grade leaf for manufacturing of cigarettes for



- 21 -
domestie consumption is increasing. Practically all incremental beef produc-
tion would be shipped to urban consumption centers, whereas incremental milk
and pork production would be consumed on the farm, with any surplus going to a
ready market in Cap-Haitien. The rehabilitation of the municipal markets
under the project would lead to more competitive trading, and the improvement
of about one-half of the project area's road network would facilitate and
drastically reduce the transport cost of agricultural products.
6.03      Up to some 10% of sugarcane production is expected to be consumed
on-farm, 20% transformed into a local rum ("clairin") by about 100 small
distilleries, and 70% converted into raw sugar by the Caldos sugar mill.
After the recent expansion of its capacity, the mill can process the incre-
mental production from the project.  During negotiations assurances were
obtained that (a) the milling capacity in the project area would be sufficient
to process the incremental sugarcane production due to the project; and (b) a
yearly review of sugarcane processing capacity in the project area would be
carried out by Government and discussed with IDA. Transportation of sugarcane
to the mill has been traditionally carried out by independent truck drivers
who used to require overpayment from farmers in exchange for priority given to
the collection of their cane. However, this practice has ceased, following
the purchase of additional trucks by the sugar mill for sale to drivers. To
prevent recurrence of the practice, assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment that it would establish, jointly with the sugar mill, a yearly schedule
for the cutting and collection of the sugarcane and ODN would assist in
supervising the effectiveness of these arrangements.
6.04      Agricultural prices have been steadily rising in the past five
years, but, except for the official increase to farmers in sugarcane prices
from US$5.10 to US$9.00 per ton in 1974, producers have not tended to benefit
(para 2.11). Since sugarcane is the only cash crop in the project area with
an assured market and is, at its present price level, sufficiently attractive
to farmers, and further, since sugar provides high Government revenues through
export taxation (which averaged about 15% of the export price in 1976), assur-
ances were obtained from Government during negotiations that it would
(a) periodicaliy review and exchange views with the Association on the offl-
cial producer price of sugarcane; and (b) not reduce such price without prior
consultation with IDA. Marked price declines at harvest time and in "good"
years are common because a large number of indebted farmers are obliged to
sell their grains immediately after harvest when prices are lowest and ade-
quate storage facilities are lacking. The grain storage facilities provided
under the project would improve the situation.
Project Benefits
6.05      Some 4,000 rural families would benefit from directly productive com-
ponents of the project as well as from the productive support activities and
the road component. In addition, about 26,000 rural families would profit
from better roads, improved agricultural services and the availability of
improved seeds and would increase their subsistence consumption by 10% to
20%, and about 3,000 rural households would receive potable water supply



- 22 -
which would improve general hygienic conditions and reduce widespread
intestinal diseases as well as the need to carry water over long distances.
Finally, about 60,000 urban inhabitants would benefit from decreased health
hazards and more competitive trading due to the rehabilitation and improve-
ment of three municipal markets and an abattoir.
6.06      Four illustrative farm model projections (Annex 19) present the
financial benefits expected from these investments. The financial rates
of return of the models amount to 18% for rainfed and 29%, 31% and 48%,
respectively, for the three irrigated farms. Assuming that 4,000 families
share the benefits due to the project equally, apart from improvement of their
on-farm consumption by about 30%, they would increase annual cash incomes from
agricultural and livestock activities from about US$60 to US$150 per family
per year. In addition, about 160 permanent jobs would be created during the
disbursement period and about 125 permanent jobs thereafter for continuation
and maintenance of project-financed infrastructure, and up to 2 million
man-days of unskilled labor would be provided for infrastructure develop-
ment in the project area under WFP's "food for work" program. Further,
project investments and activities would result in fuller employment of
small farmers.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Economic Rate of Return
7.01      The project would benefit a rural population with per capita
incomes ranging between US$40 and US$100 equivalent per annum. Quantifiable
benefits would take the form of incremental agricultural production (para
6.01), which at full development (year 7) would be worth about US$2 million
annually in 1976 terms. In the absence of the project, the two large irriga-
tion systems in the project area would continue to deteriorate, resulting in
a significant decrease of present output. Other benefits that are difficult
to quantify include the reduction of drought hazards by rehabilitation and
expansion of the irrigation districts; the reduction of transport costs
resulting from expansion and rehabilitation of the road network; the reduction
of storage losses and protection against seasonal price variations resulting
from construction of grain storage facilities; the improvement of agricultural
services through the creation and strengthening of regional institutions in
the Northern Department; and the possibility of implementing other rural
development projects in Haiti based on the experience acquired.
7.02      The project's economic rate of return is 14% (Annex 21).  Sensitiv-
ity tests show that a 25% increase in the cost of construction, vehicles and
equipment, or a 10% decrease in yields, or a one-year delay of project benefits
would reduce the rate of return to about 10%. The project could thus absorb
some setbacks and still be economically viable.



- 23 -
Project Risks
7.03      In addition to the difficulties inherent in organizing the new
entity--ODN-- and ensuring effective coordination of the various agencies
participating in the project, three major risks can be identified at this stage.
First, as some 30,000 ha of cultivated land would be rainfed and dependent upon
climatic conditions where a decreasing trend in precipitation has been observed
in recent years (Annex 1), production projections contain an element of uncer-
tainty. Second, Haiti's past record of maintaining the rural infrastructure
is not good. Therefore, project-financed irrigation, roads, water supply
systems, and markets and abattoir may not be kept up as called for. Finally,
there is a possibility of unsatisfactory loan collection as the group credit
arrangements are still in the process of development; but the denial of fresh
financing under the project to defaulters should help minimize this risk.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
on the following principal points:
(a) it would (i) take all appropriate measures to determine and widely
publicize fair prices for land acquisition and for rental in the
zones of the project area which will remain rainfed under the
project; (ii) prohibit land transactions in the Quartier Morin
and St. Raphael irrigation districts until the irrigation
rehabilitation/expansion works of the project are completed
or the Government gives its prior approval; and (iii) after the
completion of the irrigation rehabilitation/ expansion works, take
all appropriate measures to determine and widely publicize fair
prices for land acquisition and for rental in the above irrigation
districts (para 3.03);
(b) it would hire the following project senior staff: six to be inter-
nationally recruited--Deputy Director, surface water irrigation
specialist, groundwater irrigation specialist, agronomist,
marketing/agricultural credit specialist, and road construction
engineer--and three to be locally recruited--Director of ODN,
community development officer, and chief accountant--as well as
short-term consultants, all acceptable to IDA, and would make
available adequate support staff within an established time
frame set out in Schedule A of Annex 13 (para 5.02);
(c) it would undertake annual reviews of: (i) the adequacy of
agricultural training programs; and (ii) the need for technical
assistance to strengthen DARNDR (para 5.04);



- 24 -
(d) the level of water charges would cover operation and
maintenance costs and the largest possible share of
the investment costs of rehabilitation/expansion works
(expected to be about 50% of these costs), that SICR would
be entrusted with the collection of these charges, and that
the charges would be determined in consultation with IDA
after the completion of the rehabilitation/expansion works
and in accordance with the payment capacity of the benefi-
ciaries (para 5.06);
(e) the project-financed irrigation, roads, and potable water
supply systems and wells would be properly maintained
during the life of the project (paras 5.06, 5.15 and 5.17);
(f) it would (a) maintain the interest rate charged by BCA on
its subloans at 9% per annum for the first two years of the
project; and (b) raise, thereafter, the cost of such loans,
either by an increase in such interest rate to 11% per annum,
or by the addition thereto of a commission of 2% per annum
(para 5.08);
(g) it would furnish to IDA, within nine months of credit sig-
nature, or such longer period as IDA may agree, a program for
the reorganization and financial strengthening of the BCA and
implement such a program as agreed with the Association (the
elements of such a program are given in Schedule A of Annex 3)
(para 5.09);
(h)  it would:  (i) within one year from the date of signing of the
Credit Agreement, appoint a project monitoring and evaluation
expert, acceptable to IDA, to the Evaluation and Control Unit
of DARNDR and expand the staff of this Unit in consultation
with IDA; (ii) require the expert, with the assistance of Unit
staff, to prepare annual reports on the progress of the project,
in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA; and
(iii) within three months following the end of each project
year, cause the Unit to furnish the annual reports to the
Government and IDA (para 5.18);
(i) the milling capacity in the project area would be sufficient
to process the incremental sugarcane production due to the
project and a yearly review of sugarcane processing capacity
in the project area would be carried out by Government and
discussed with IDA (para 6.03);
(j) it would establish, jointly with the sugar mill, a yearly
schedule for the cutting and collection of the sugarcane
and ODN would assist in supervising the effectiveness of
these arrangements (para 6.03); and



- 25 -
(k)  it would not reduce the official price of sugarcane
without prior consultation with IDA (para 6.04).
8.02      Conditions for credit effectiveness would be that:
(a) IDA had been informed by WFP that its ongoing "food for
work" program in Haiti, No. 2105, has been modified to
provide 200,000 man-days of unskilled labor for the first
year of the project (para 4.17); and
(b) the Director and Deputy Director of ODN had been employed
by the Government (para 5.02).
8.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project is suitable for an
IDA credit of US$10 million on standard IDA terms.

HAITI
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
The Project Area
Introduction
1.        The Northern Department, with an area of about 2,300 km  and a
population estimated at 700,000 in 1971 (Table 1), is one of the most impor-
tant of the nine Departments into which the country is politically divided. 1/
The Department is subdivided into eight "arrondissements," which, in turn,
comprise a number of "communes." A further subdivision separates the communes
into "habitations," with the rural center of each commune being designated as
the "agglomeration" and the intervening rural areas subdivided into "sections
rurales."
2.        The project area affects two arrondissements--that of Cap-Haitien
with an area of 500 km2, and Grande Riviere du Nord. All of the Cap-Haitien
arrondissement is included in the project, with particular emphasis on the
plain, representing about 75% of the area, while in Grande Riviere du Nord,
only the irrigation district of St. Raphael, with an area of 1,900 ha, is
involved.
3.        The arrondissement of Cap-Haitien includes the departmental capital,
the city of Cap-Haitien, with a population estimated at about 46,000 in 1975
(Table 1), making it the second largest city after Port-au-Prince. In addi-
tion, the arrondissement has a rural population of some 145,000 persons, and
includes six communes: Cap-Haitien, Quartier Morin, Milot, Plaine du Nord,
Acul du Nord and Limonade. It comprises some 50,000 ha of productive soils,
including about 7,000 ha of sugarcane-producing lands as well as the 2,000-ha
Quartier Morin irrigation district built in the late 1950s and at present in
need of extensive rehabilitation.
4.        The irrigation district of St. Raphael, with a rural population of
about 8,000 persons, is situated at the edge of the Central Plateau and
separated from the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien by the mountain front of the
Massif du Nord. It was built in the early 1950s using the Bouyaha River as
a source of water. The irrigation system is at present only partially opera-
tive and in need of extensive rehabilitation. Agricultural production from
this part of the project area is sold in the Cap-Haitien and Port-au-Prince
1/   Legally, 13 departments have been established.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
markets in spite of the difficult communications with the departmental capital
through the St. Raphael-Grande Riviere du Nord road and with Port-au-Prince
by way of St. Michel de l'Atalaye.
Physiography and Soils
5.         The arrondissement of Cap-Haitien occupies a large portion of the
Northern Plain. A small portion of the arrondissement, approximately 10 to
15%, is covered by the foothills of the Massif du Nord and the isolated eleva-
tions of the Morne du Cap, west of the city of Cap-Haitien. The irrigated
area of St. Raphael, on the other hand, is constituted by an alluvial flood
plain which extends, fan-like, as the Bouyaha River descends from the Massif
into the edge of the Central Plateau.
6.         The project area comprises two different ecological zones with the
arrondissement of Cap-Haitien corresponding to a sub-tropical humid forest in
the Holdridge classification and the St. Raphael irrigation district to the
sub-tropical dry forest.  The soils in the arrondissement are derived from
Quaternary alluviums and present well structured clays and clay loams that
are very suitable for crops.  Soil texture is lighter in the vicinity of the
main rivers and heavier in the poorly drained area of Plaine du Nord. Most
of the soils in this part of the project area have been classified II and III
in a land capability survey, 1/ representing irrigable soils adequate for a
large variety of crops and requiring only moderate management and conservation
practices. In the irrigation district of St. Raphael, the soils are mainly
alluvial, corresponding to the flood plain of the Bouyaha River, but the
original materials are calcareous and siliceous rocks and clay schists of the
Massif du Nord, resulting in deep, well drained and structured soils that
respond well to irrigation. These soils, as in the case of the arrondisement
of Cap-Haitien, have also been identified as Classes II and III in the land
capability survey.
Climate and Hydrology
7.        Rainfall in the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien is usually abundant
although unevenly distributed. Records are scarce and lack continuity but
they do indicate higher yearly precipitations in the western portion of the
plain (1,988.7 mm at Plaine du Nord) than in the eastern portion (1,399.2 mm
at Limonade). More recent records from the sugar mill in the region (Table 2)
indicate however a gradual decrease in precipitation during the last 10-year period
(2,451 mm in 1960 to 670 mm in 1975), which has caused severe reductions in
yields of sugarcane and other crops. Rainy periods normally occur in the fall
and early winter and in May/June. Rainfall in the St. Raphael area is con-
siderably lower with 855.8 mm recorded as the annual average. The period of
December to March is very dry and the main rainfalls occur in May and June.
Average yearly temperatures in the project area range fran 26.10C in Cap-
Haitien to 24.8 C in St. Raphael.
1/   Following the USDA Land Capability Classification.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
8.        From April to June, the predominating winds blow from the north-
east (trade winds), carrying warm.and humid air from the center-Atlantic
regions. The winter winds blow from the American continent (cold fronts)
bringing rain from the northwest. This is the most abundant precipitation in
the Northern Plain.
9.        The arrondissement of Cap-Haitien comprises three hydrological
basins: those of the Riviere Salee, the Riviere Gallois or Haut-du-Cap,
and the Grande Riviere du Nord. The first two rivers drain the communes of
Acul du Nord, Plaine du Nord and Cap-Haitien, and obstruction and subse-
quent flooding in their lower portions has created a poorly drained area
affecting some 600 ha of productive land. The Haute du Cap River is only
10 km in length and originates within the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien.
One of its effluents is used at Grison Garde to irrigate some 50 ha.
10.       The Grande Riviere du Nord, 42 km long, originates in the arrondisse-
ment of Vallieres, in the Northern Department and is the source for an irri-
gation system covering some 2,000 ha in the communes of Quartier Morin and
Milot. The St. Raphael irrigation district is in the basin of the Bouyaha
River which flows southward from the Massif du Nord.
Physical Infrastructure
11.       The road network in the project area comprises about 105 km of
secondary and about 200 km of rural roads. While the main road connecting
Cap-Haitien with the capital city of Port-au-Prince is being reconstructed
under IDA Credits 478-HA and 556-HA, most of the secondary roads are in severe
need of rehabilitation. A serious lack of feeder roads further aggravates the
isolation of large areas of the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien and constitutes
a key constraint to the production and marketing of agricultural products.
12.       Rural electrification is restricted to the departmental capital and
to most of the "agglomerations," with some of the plants being provided by
private groups, often religious communities.
13.       Adequate supplies of drinking water are lacking in most of the rural
centers and those that do exist are in need of extensive protection and repair.
Provision of potable water constitutes one of the highest development prior-
ities for the population in the project area.
Institutions
14.       A number of institutions already exist in the project area which
can serve as a basis for rural development. They are, in general, severely
understaffed and in most cases seriously limited by financial constraints,
but they constitute the basis on which any development effort must be
initiated, since they have already been involved in assisting the regional
farmers and have acquired experience and recognition, the importance of
which cannot be underestimated. Among these, the most important from the



ANNEX 1
Page 4
point of view of the rural development project are the regional Agricultural
District of the Department of Agriculture Natural Resources and Rural
Development (DARNDR); the two agricultural credit agencies, BCA and IDAI; and
various non-governmental organizations, some of them religious while others,
such as the Community Councils, represent groups of inhabitants of the area
joining to promote improvements in their localities.
15.       DARNDR Agricultural District.  This district is staffed by one
agronomist, nine extension agents, four irrigation agents, five home econo-
mists, 12 forestry agents, and two office clerks. Of these, six positions are
at headquarters in the city of Cap-Haitien; five in the arrondissement of
Cap-Haitien; five in the irrigation district of St. Raphael and the remaining
17 scattered throughout the rest of the Northern Department. This agency,
which should play an essential role in the rural development project, is
chronically affected by a lack of programs and resources which allows for
only a very limited activity. Extension agents are limited in training.
Except for supervising some coffee plantations and assisting the Bureau
of Agricultural Credit (BCA) in transmittal of requests for agricultural
credit, they carry out, essentially, office work.
16.       Bureau of Agricultural Credit (BCA).  BCA has an office in Cap-
Haitien but its activities are very limited, being concerned mainly with
financing of coffee and cacao plantations, groups of small farmers providing
mutual guarantee (Agricultural Credit Societies - SACs) and, to some extent,
financing sugarcane plantations. A more detailed description of BCA appears
in Annex 3.
17.       Institute or Agricultural and Industrial Development (IDAI).  IDAI
also has an office in Cap-Haitien and has been operating in the Northern
Department sinde 1969. Its agricultural financing is mainly directed to
medium-size farmers and to financing of improved maize, beans and rice
(Annex 3).
18.       Non-governmental Organizations.  These include mainly the Rural
Center for Development of Milot (CRUDEM), managed by a Canadian religious
congregation which has had considerable success in some rural development
efforts in the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien, particularly in the commune of
Milot. This organization has improved 112 km of roads; installed a small
electric plant; and constructed and operated seven schools serving 1,650
students, a hospital, a mobile health unit, and a semi-industrial farm.
Other religious groups located outside the project area but having a general
impact in the region include a Mennonite congregation in Grande Riviere du
Nord, which has installed a plant for the manufacture of fruit preserves, and
another religious group in Limbe, which, besides operating a hospital, has
installed a hydroelectric plant to provide electricity to Limbe.
19.       Community Councils.  There are groups of rural inhabitants who
form local councils to improve conditions in their own areas, contributing
to road and irrigation canal maintenance and providing in many cases a head-
quarters for teaching adults to read and write and for carrying out home



ANNEX 1
Page 5
economics activities. The creation of community councils has been promoted
by the Rural Animation Service of DARNDR and, in many instances, by CRUDEM
and other non-governmental organizations. While sorely lacking financial
resources, these councils provide important local motivation as evidenced in
St. Raphael where an impressive new church building was constructed through
Community Council efforts.
Size of Land Holdings
20.       Information on land holdings in Haiti, specifically in the project
area, is partial, scattered in coverage and limited in detail. The lack
of a proper cadaster and the complexity of the system for registration of land
transactions makes any attempt, short of a physical survey, to determine size
of land holdings and actual land property a time consuming and only partially
reliable exercise.
21.       In an effort to determine the land distribution pattern in the
project area, the Department of Agriculture, in 1975, conducted a survey of
agricultural exploitation in the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien. 1/ Subse-
quently, at the request of the Bank, additional information was obtained on
land holdings larger than 10 carreaux 2/ (12.9 ha), established as a limit
for small farmers in the context of the rural development project. Due to
the difficult access to many of the rural sections, however, this second sur-
vey was limited to land holders inhabiting the agglomeration for each commune.
22.       In view of the difficulty of obtaining more reliable information on
the present land tenure situation, the results of the first survey, covering
about 70% of the project area, were extrapolated to cover 100% of each commune
and the results are presented in Table 3 for the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien
and in Table 4 for the irrigated district of St. Raphael.
23.       Results of the survey conducted in the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien
show that 97.6% of land owners hold farms ranging from less than 0.5 cx
(0.65 ha) to 10 cx (12.9 ha) while only 2.4% have farms ranging from more than
10 cx to more than 100 cx (129 ha). The large number of small farms is
reflected in the fact that such holdings occupy 68.3% of the land compared
to the 31.7% occupied by farms larger than 10 cx. It is probable, however,
that the number of smaller farmers and the land they use have been under-
estimated since their farms are too small to be either noticed or remem-
bered. This is particularly true in the case of the St. Raphael irrigation
district (Table 4) where only 558 ha out of some 1,900 ha were covered in the
survey, representing owners living in the urban center of St. Raphael. While

Agricoles de l'Arrondissement du Cap-Haitien," DARNDR (March 1975).
2/   A carreaux (cx) is a Haitien measurement equivalent to 1.29 ha.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
it is true that some large farms are known to account for the balance of the
irrigated area, a great number of farmers, mainly in the less than 0.5 cx and
the 1- to 5-cx categories, reside in the rural sections and are not included
in the survey.
24.       A trend has developed recently to consolidate small holdings into
larger farms. This is brought on by the higher prices of agricultural
products 1/ and probably the increased demand resulting from improvement of
the Cap-Haitien-Port-au-Prince highway which facilitates access to the market
of the capital and makes agriculture more attractive to entrepreneurs. The
result of this trend may be a greater percentage of land in farms larger than
10 cx, particularly in the 50- to 100-cx and larger than 100-cx groups, and
the corresponding reduction in percentage of area in farms smaller than 10 cx.
While the trend towards consolidation so far appears to be within reasonable
limits, improvements in infrastructure resulting from the project and the
renewed interest in specific crops 2/ may speed it up unless the Government
takes steps to prevent indiscriminate transfers of land from the smallholders
to the large farmers, particularly in the irrigated areas to be rehabilitated
and expanded under the project.
25.       Improvements resulting from the rural development project, as well
as from the construction of the new highways, may also cause land rents to
rise for the small farm tenants, which could counterbalance project efforts
to increase farm revenues. While the proportion of tenants in the arrondisse-
ment of Cap-Haitien is estimated at only 8.5% of landholders (Table 5), it
reaches 27.4% in the irrigation district of St. Raphael and may possibly be
higher. These figures, regardless of their limited reliability, indicate that
official measures are needed to prevent undue increases in land rentals, at
least over the period necessary for the project to achieve its goals of in-
creased production and improved marketing.
Land Use
26.       About 20% of the cultivated area of the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien
is used for sugarcane destined either for delivery to the large sugar mill for
processing into export sugar or to one of the 98 distilleries producing
"clairin," a local rum of high alcohol content. The sugar mill has been pro-
ducing an average of 8,000 to 11,000 tons of sugar per year and is expected to
increase its production capacity after 1976 by 50% with installation of addi-
tional equipment. Clairin distilleries are located in five of the communes
(Quartier Morin, 46; Milot, 33; Plaine du Nord, 7; Limonade, 6; and Cap-Haitien,
6). They are thought to be the most important producers of clairin in the
country. Sugarcane production in St. Raphael is of minor magnitude being
1/   Price of sugarcane in recent years increased from US$5.10/ton to US$9.00/
ton and food crops are estimated to have increased by 30% in price in the
last two years.
2/   Plans have been announced to develop 300 ha of Burley tobacco in the
Northern Plain.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
restricted to on-farm consumption and limited production of syrup. Total
production of clairin in the project area is estimated at some 2,130,000
gallons.
27.       Other important crops in the area are banana (plantains), manioc,
corn, yams, rice, malanga and, in the upper portions of the Plaine du Nord,
coffee, and cacao.
28.      In addition to the major agricultural products, there are three
essential oil extraction mills producing lime and sour orange oils for perfume
and liquor production. One of these plants is known to produce some 6,000
liters of oil per year. Fruit is collected from scattered trees and there are
no significant citrus plantations. In the irrigation district of St. Raphael,
vegetable production has become profitable, especially onions, tomatoes and
carrots. Tobacco is also planted in both the arrondissements of Cap-Haitien
and St. Raphael, but it is currently mainly for home consumption and local
market, although production for industrial processing is increasing and is
expected to expand in the near future.
29.       In the higher portions of the arrondissement of Cap-Haitien, in the
foothills of the Massif du Nord, there are five coffee processing plants three
of which produced 39,960 kg of washed coffee in 1973/74. USAID is presently
assisting Haiti with a comprehensive program to improve coffee plantations and
increase production throughout the country.
30.       Estimates by the DARNDR placed the sugarcane area in 1975 at 5,676
ha, the food crop area at 19,221 ha and other crop areas at 5,289 ha (Table 6).
Fallow lands, estimated at 20% in the September-December period and 31% in the
April-June period, have not been included but there is little doubt that these
occur only in larger holdings since small farmers cannot afford to let land
lie idle.
31.       In comparison to crop production, livestock production is of limited
importance. Very rough estimates indicate that there are about 20,000 cattle,
50,000 pigs, 2,000 sheep, some 3,000 horses/donkeys and 200,000 to 400,000
chickens. With the exception of about 10 commercial dairy farms involved in
low cost dairy production with herds numbering between 30 and 200 crossbred
cows (local breed "creole" x Brown Swiss, Jersey or Holstein Friesian) and
producing up to 400 gallons of milk per day, livestock production is carried
out on a smallholder basis, with local breeds grazing on fallow and receiving
crop residues mainly from sugarcane cultivation. Smallholder milk production
with local breeds, producing up to 600 liters of milk per cow per year, is
common in the irrigation district of Quartier Morin, geared primarily for the
market in Cap-Haitien. The use of draft animals is known only in the irriga-
tion district of St. Raphael where about 200 pairs of oxen are used. Apart from
pigs, which often show signs of Rachitis, livestock is generally in good con-
dition and animal health conditions are fairly satisfactory except for sporadic
Blackleg outbreaks, widespread internal parasites in irrigation districts and



ANNEX 1
Page 8
seasonally inundated areas, and frequent Hog Cholera and New Castle Disease
(Annex 7). Nevertheless, livestock productivity is relatively low, since
animal health services are inadequate and feeding of concentrate and minerals
are almost unknown. Thus, calving rates are only about 60% and cattle herd
offtake probably does not exceed 10% per year, with carcass weights of not
more than 125 to 140 kg. Cattle and goats are usually sold for in-town con-
sumption and funeral ceremonies, but pigs are slaughtered by the smallholder
producers who consume up to two to three 30- to 50-kg pigs per year per
family.
Family Production Units and Farm Income
32.       The predominant small size of land holdings in all of Haiti, as well
as in the project area, restricts the use of hired farm labor to a limited
number of commercial plantations. Larger sugarcane, coffee, rice and sisal
farmers in particular employ help, but mainly in the planting and harvesting
seasons. Therefore, the family production unit constitutes the core of
Haitian agriculture, with a large percentage of farmers and all those at sub-
sistence level depending on the efforts of each family member to achieve even
a low level of livelihood.
33.       The average family unit in the project area has been estimated at
five persons, of which three are adults. In spite of the already high rate
of population growth, high infant mortality in the country has prevented the
family unit from being larger. The small size of land holdings may have also
acted as a deterrent, at least in the lover income groups, forcing family
members to migrate, thus increasing the urban population. The primitive level
of farmiqg methods, based mainly on hoe and machete, requires the participation
of the whole family in agricultural production, with women and smaller children
taking charge of smaller chores or participating in critical phases such as
harvest or serving as substitutes for absent members of the family who are
working as laborers in the region's sugarcane fields or in the rice fields
of the Artibonite.
34.       Income distribution data in Haiti are available only for the
employed population. The latest updating was in 1970 (Table 7), which indi-
cates that approximately 92% of income earners in rural areas and 58% in urban
areas earned less than US$240 per year. In terms of average annual labor in-
come per head of population, that is, including those who were not employed,
92% of the population in rural areas made less than US$87 a year and 58% in
urban areas made less than US$57. It would appear that in the rural areas
some individuals at the upper limit of the US$87 income class were above the
level of absolute poverty, at least in terms of nutritional requirements,
since data on annual per capita consumption of essential goods and services
in 1970 (Table 8) show that about US$19 on average were spent by the rural
population on basic consumption items and about US$43 on food.
35.       A study to determine the composition of the basket of food required
to satisfy minimum nutritional needs based only on food items for which unit
prices were available indicates that a basket containing 2,390 calories per
day, the standard calorie requirement per day per person in Latin America,
would have been valued at US$75 per year in 1970.



ANNEX 1
Page 9
36.       The analysis of this information leads to the conclusion that in
1970 about 92% of the rural population and at least 58% of the urban popula-
tion in Haiti, representing 85% of the entire population of the country, were
below the level of absolute poverty.  There is no indication that this situa-
tion is different in the project area or has improved.

HAITI
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Expansion
Water Resources and Water Quality
1.        The average annual rainfall in the Northern Plain is estimated to
vary between 1,200 and 1,900 mm but a gradual decline has been noted over the
past 10 years. Distribution is very uneven, and serious flooding occurs in
low parts of the plain, made worse by insufficient natural drainage.
2.        The hydrogeology of the plains has not been studied in detail, but
the potential for groundwater development is considered to be very promising
since the water table is only 3 to 5 m below the surface, near the foothills
of the Northern Range mountains, and about 1 m below the surface at the north-
ern limit of the Quartier Morin Irrigation District.
3.        Surface water and groundwater are reported to be of good quality
and only some shallow wells close to the coast are known to have slightly
brackish water.
Irrigation Water Demand
4.        Water requirements were determined separately for Quartier Morin and
for St. Raphael based on rainfall data for a period of 16.5 years in Quartier
Morin (1960-76) and taking account the respective cropping patterns. Sugarcane
dominates the cropping pattern in Quartier Morin (80%) and requires water
mainly in its vegetative growth period, with only limited amounts needed
during the period of maturity. The irregularity of rainfall in the area,
however, makes irrigation essential to ensure a normal growth process and a
sufficiently long harvesting period to achieve production goals. The rela-
tively high clay content in the soils of the area, making for higher moisture
retention capacities, results in relatively modest water requirements. In
St. Raphael, cropping patterns based on high water-consuming crops and con-
siderable double cropping, combined with lighter textured soils and lower
water retention capacities, result in considerably higher water requirements.
The monthly irrigation water requirements are shown in Table 1.
5.        Information on rainfall is limited and data on evaporation, evap-
transpiration and percolation rates, used for determining demand for irriga-
tion in the project area, are not available. Water requirements obtained
by using the Blaney-Criddle method for the same crops under similar soil
and climatic conditions in the same general region were therefore used for
comparison purposes. Effective rainfall in the project area was estimated
to vary from 85% in the dry months to 45% in the wet months for the



ANNEX 2
Page 2
St. Raphael area, and from 80% to 20% in Quartier Morin. Field irrigation
efficiency was estimated to range between 50% in Quartier Morin to 60% in
St. Raphael, with a system efficiency of about 10% in both irrigation
district.
Water Rights
4.        The Irrigation and River Control Service (SICR) of the Department
of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (DARNDR) is the only
Government agency authorized to allocate water for irrigation purposes. Since
the two irrigation districts in the project are already in operation, there is
no problem with the use of the river water diverted for irrigation purposes.
Groundwater irrigation development would also be controlled by SICR.
Existing Irrigation Facilities
7.         Both the St. Raphael and the Quartier Morin irrigation systems have
been desi1ned for high volume of water.  The Quartier Morin main canal could
carry 4 m /second and the St. Raphael main canal, 2 m /second. The under-
utilization of both systems, and especially the Quartier Morin system, has led
to very high sedimentation in the canals which would be reduced under the
project through appropriate measures prepared by consultants. The design of
existing systems would also allow a shift from the proposed cropping pattern,
with its main emphasis on sugarcane for Quartier Morin, to crops with higher
water requirements, if updated hydrological records would indicate this to be
feasible.
8.        Quartier Morin Irrigation System.  This system was built in the late
1950s by div5rtirg water from the Grande Rivere du Nord, with a watershed of
about 700 km and an average annual discharge of about 250 million m . The
system was originally intended to irrigate 4,000 ha of land on the west bank
of the Grande Riviere du Nord. As a result of studies carried out in 1960,
however, the area was reduced to 2,000 ha because of the limited water supply.
In any case, the system was never completed and it now3serves only 1,200 ha.
The average mon5hly flow at the diversion dam is 7.8 m /sec, varying between
0.23 and 62.0 m /sec according to data gathered between 1922 and 1939. This
allows irrigation of the district under the cropping pattern assumed for the
farm models elaborated in Annex 19, without facing any irrigation water
deficits.
9.         St. Raphael Irrigation System.  This system is located about 35 km
south of the Quartier Morin District, near the southern limits of the North-
ern Department. It was built in the early 1950s and cammands 1,900 ha of
land in the flood plain of the Bouyaha River. Th s river, a tributary of the
Artibonite River with a watershed of about 160 km upstream of the irrigation
system, is channeled 5hrough a diversion dam into a main canal that has a
capacity of about 2 m /sec. The average annual volume of water at the intake
of the system is about 110 million m . The average monthly flow of the



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Bouyaha River varies between 0.2i and 18 m /sec according to 1923-39 data,
with an overall average of 3.4 m /sec. This allows irrigation of the district
under the assumed cropping pattern. Based on historical flow records, there
is an 85% probability of satisfying the monthly irrigation water requirements
during the main growing seasons.
10.       Groundwater Irrigation.  There is no detailed information available
on the number, depth and yields of existing irrigation wells in the project
area, but it is known that well irrigation development has been successfully
carried out by private drilling companies. A number of deep wells north of
Quartier Morin (about 30 to 35 m deep) penetrate a slightly artesian aquifer
and, when equipped with pumps, can yield over 100 liters/sec.
Proposed Works
11.       Quartier Morin Irrigation District.  Under the project, all canals
and drains would be cleaned and repaired, siphons and distribution structures
would be rehabilitated and the dikes along the Grande Riviere du Nord would be
repaired. The canal and drainage system of the district would be extended to
cover an additional 800 ha. On-farm development would be carried out on about
2,000 ha and would include land leveling and construction of gates, farm
ditches and drains.
12.       St. Raphael Irrigation District.  The project would rehabilitate
the canal and drainage systems as well as the distribution structures. On-
farm development, including land leveling and construction of gates, farm
ditches and drains, would be carried out in the 1,900 ha of the district.
13.       Groundwater Irrigation.  The groundwater potential of the lower
plain in the Northern Department is considered to be extensive and there are,
at present, only a few deep wells exploiting the aquifers. The proposed
project would be the first stage of a groundwater development program to
provide well irrigation in the region. The scope of the project was deter-
mined on the basis of the need for irrigation, the existing knowledge about
groundwater resources, and the capacity of the project organization. The
proposed number of wells is not expected to create any danger of over-
exploitation of the acquifer. However, if the groundwater development were
to be extended in the future, controls would have to be introduced to
regulate this development.
14.       Under the project, a total of up to 14 deep wells would be con-
structed, each about 40 m deep and equipped with a pump driven by a diesel
engine. Wells should yield an estimated 100 liters/second each (para 10).
The canal and drainage system associated with each well would serve about
70 ha. On-farm development would include land leveling and on-farm ditches
and drains. Control structures would be provided to determine the water con-
sumption of each group of users (Agricultural Credit Societies - SACs) bene-
fitting from a well.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
Project Implementation
15.       The project would be carried out under the overall supervision
of the Organisme de Developpement du Nord (ODN) with the assistance of two
resident consultants and 18 man-months of short-term consultants (paras 23
to 26). The consultants would, together with their counterparts from SICR,
prepare the detailed work program, including the design of the groundwater
irrigation scheme, and technical modifications necessary to rehabilitate the
existing gravity irrigation systems.
16.       Construction would start with the rehabilitation of the Quartier
Morin irrigation district, to be followed by the preparation of the ground-
water development during the second project year. Work on the St. Raphael
irrigation district would also begin during the second project year.
17.       The civil works would, in general, be carried out by force account
under the direction of ODN. Manual labor would be used wherever feasible.
Services of small contractors would be used whenever appropriate.
18.       The equipment provided under the project would be operated by ODN
under the supervision of the consultants and their counterparts. Drilling of
the up to 14 irrigation wells would either be carried out on force account,
with drilling equipment provided by the Government 1/, or be done by inter-
national contractors. All equipment would be maintained and repaired at the
workshop of the National Road Maintenance Service (SEPRRN) in Cap-Haitien.
Costs associated with the irrigation component are shown in Tables 2 to 5.
Operation and Maintenance
19.       During project implementation, operation and maintenance of the
irrigation districts would be the responsibility of ODN. After the disburse-
ment period, SICR would assume overall responsibility. One irrigation engi-
neer would be responsible for both the St. Raphael district and the Quartier
Morin district, including the area irrigated by groundwater. One assistant
engineer/technician with a small staff for administrative and technical work
would be employed for each district.
20.       The irrigation engineer would be responsible for the allocation of
water, the operation of the diversion dams and the water distribution system,
and overall supervision of the groundwater wells. He would, furthermore, be
responsible for maintenance works on the major distribution and drainage
canals and structures. The project would also provide vehicles and equipment
required to carry out operation and maintenance.
1/   SICR owns a modern (1975) drill rig which would be adequate for the
construction of the wells.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
21.       Farmers would be responsible for maintaining and operating the farm-
level distribution and drainage systems, and SACs would be strengthened or
reorganized to carry out the work in a cooperative way. The SACs benefitting
from a deep irrigation well would form a water user group which would be respon-
sible for the operation and maintenance of the well equipment to be run by a
pump operator.
Water Charges
22.       At full development, all operation and maintenance costs (Table 6)
would be paid by the beneficiaries through water charges. This would include
the cost of supervisory staff, labor, vehicles, repairs and fuel. Fuel and
repair of the diesel engines with which the wells are equipped would be paid
directly by each user group. Water charges would cover a part of the invest-
ment cost, which would be determined in consultation with IDA in accordance
with the payment capacity of the beneficiaries. The calculation of rent and
cost recovery indices (Table 7) for three relevant farm models (Annex 19) leads
to the conclusion that about 50% of the investment cost could be recovered dur-
ing the life of the project beginning after completion of the irrigation reha-
bilitation/expansion works. Final water charges would be adjusted, on the
basis of data collected by the Evaluation and Control Unit of DARNDR. While
small farmers would be subject to lower water charges covering only operation
and maintenance costs, larger farmers would be charged progressively higher
rates to recover as much of the investment cost as feasible. In the past, the
water charges (G 16 per ha per year) that were collected were transferred to
the Government in Port-au-Prince. None was channeled back to cover irrigation
expenses. However, they were not high enough to cover the cost of operation
and maintenance. Under the project, only the nominal water charges (G 16) and
the investment costs recovered would be transferred to the Central Government.
The remaining part of the charges would be at the disposal of ODN/SICR to cover
operating and maintenance costs.
Consultant Services
23.       The project would provide the services of two resident consultants
for irrigation development and 18 man-months of short-term consultants. One
resident consultant would be a specialist in the design and construction of
gravity irrigation systems, and the second would be a specialist in the design
and construction of deep well irrigation systems. The resident consultants
would be employed over a four-year period and assume the general responsi-
bility for:
(a) detailed surveys as required for preparing quantity estimates,
including topographic surveys for land leveling;
(b)  modifications of the existing gravity irrigation systems,
including studies to increase the water supply for the
St. Raphael district;



ANNEX 2
Page 6
(c) final design of the extension of the Quartier Morin irrigation
district and the design of the well-irrigation system;
(d) studies of further extension of irrigation in the northern
plain and the rehabilitation of the swamp near Ca,)-Haitien;
(e) construction supervision; and
(f) in-service training of local staff.
24.       The short-term consultants would assist the resident consultants in
the following activities:
(a) review of the existing irrigation systems, including the design
of modifications (e.g., structural improvement to reduce sedimen-
tation in the canal system);
(b) detailed study of the groundwater resources of the Northern Plain,
including determination of the location of deep wells for irriga-
tion;
(c) supervision of well drilling operations; and
(d) study of the rehabilitation of the 500- to 1,000-ha swamp near
Cap-Haitien, including preliminary design of a drainage system
and a proposal for agricultural and rural development.
25.       One important objective of the consultants would be to strengthen
the SICR in the Northern Department so that the farmers would be assisted in
better water management, which would, in turn, facilitate the extension of
irrigation in this area.
26.       The estimated schedule for the provision of consulting services
during the development period is as follows:

RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
Credit to Agriculture
A. General
1.        Institutional credit to the agricultural sector in Haiti is provided
mainly by the Bureau of Agricultural Credit and the Institute for Agricultural
and Industrial Development. A substantial amount of non-institutional credit
is provided by traders, and private moneylenders in the form of production
loans at extremely high interest rates running up to 120% per year and higher.
B. The Bureau of Agricultural Credit (BCA)
2.        BCA, which was established in September 1963 within the Department
of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (DARNDR), is defined
by its statute as a public service institute enjoying financial autonomy and
juridical status. Its main purpose is to supply production and term loans
to small farmers operating within Government agricultural plans to increase
agricultural production and to enhance economic and social living standards.
Organization and Management
3.        BCA has a Board of Directors appointed by the Government and repre-
senting the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, and Finance;
the Central Bank (BNRH); and the Institute for Agricultural and Industrial
Development (IDAI). The State Secretary and the Director-General of the
Department of Agriculture are by statute the President and Vice-President of
BCA's Board, while its Secretary is the General Manager of BCA. The latter
is endowed by the statute with all the prerogatives of a chief executive of a
public bank. BCA headquarters are at Damien, within DARNDR. Main operational
departments are Finance, Administration, Technical and Auditing, supported by
the Legal and the Studies and Research Departments.
4.        As of June 1976, BCA had a network of nine regional offices and nine
branch offices, the latter established according to operational needs within
the geographical framework of the regional offices. The regional office of
Cap-Haitien is Jocated in the general area of the project and has two branch
offices: Granie Riviere du Nord and Pilate-Plaisance. Although the BCA
office network is scattered country-wide, its operational efficiency is ham-
pered by a variety of problems such as lack of communication and coordination



ANNEX 3
Page 2
of geographical and sectorial intervention between and among regional offices;
lack of coordination of geographical and sectorial intervention between BCA
and IDAI; scarcity of qualified personnel to appraise subloans and extend
credit assistance; low level of salaries; and the need for delegation of power
for loan approval, streamlined procedures, proper acounting and auditing, and
an efficient loan recovery system. Special attention is being focussed on
organizing small farmers in groups (SAC's) so as to strengthen their financial
and marketing position and on recruiting and training qualified personnel to
assist small farmers in credit and commercial operations. BCA staff has
increased since 1974 from 27 to 50, about half of whom are technicians and
half are administrative and general services personnel. This staff is insuf-
ficient for its increased activities.  However, USAID programs provide for
support to BCA through the employment of three consultants and 27 extensionists,
and under the project, the regional office in Cap-Haitien would be strengthened
(Table 1) by an agricultural economist, a marketing officer, three credit exten-
sion officers, one accountant and seven credit extension agents. In addition,
one secretary and two drivers would be provided. Three local offices would be
established in Quartier Morin, Plaine du Nord and St. Raphael to facilitate the
availability of credit services and technical assistance in those areas.
Lending Policies
5.        The scale of BCA's lending operation is limited.  The loans advanced
in 1975 amounted to US$165,000 and were mainly made up of short-term loans for
crop production (Table 2). Almost all loans are extended to SAC's which BCA
helps organize. Individual loans are extended to particularly enterprising
and efficient small farmers. Average size of loans to SAC's is about US$200
and to individual farmers, about US$90. A limited amount of medium- and
long-term credit is extended for small irrigation works, land improvement, and
agricultural machinery. In December 1976, the rate of interest charged by BCA
was increased from 8% to 9%. Compared to around 15% at commercial banks, this
rate is negative in real terms, considering the about 18% rate of inflation in
1975, which, however, is expected to decline sharply over the medium term.
Portfolio arrears, most of which are uncollectible, are not precisely deter-
mined, but are estimated to be about 40%. Since most loan beneficiaries do
not have and, consequently, cannot pledge, land titles to receive credit, the
normal penalty in case of defaults is refusal by BCA to extend further credit
to them. It is not possible at present to determine the real value of the BCA
loan portfolio without a detailed analysis to ascertain the irrecoverable
debts; such analysis would be undertaken as part of the proposed reorganization
of BCA (para 4). *A consolidated balance sheet is shown in Table 3.
Financial Structure
6.        BCA is authorized by law to hold sight deposits to discount its
portfolio with the Central Bank and issue credit certificates to raise funds,
but all this produces only about 3% of its financial resources. Most of
BCA's lending is financed by budgetary allocations, and by USAID funds under
the small farmer coffee scheme. Government allocations cover about 85% of
administrative expenses (Table 4). BCA's financial position is weak, both in



ANNEX 3
Page 3
terms of the arrears in its loan portfolio and its continuing operational
losses. However, Government is reviewing, with technical and financial
assistance by USAID, the question of reorganizing BCA so as to develop it.
Accounts and Auditing
7.        Accounts are poorly compiled and kept and they do not provide accept-
able information on the current portfolio position, the level of arrears, the
number of beneficiaries, or sizes of property. There is no external audit.
USAID, however, is actively assisting BCA to establish an efficient accounting
system and to arrange for external auditing.
C. The Institute for Agricultural and Industrial Development (IDAI)
8.        IDAI is an autonomous Government institution established in 1961 to
help spur the country's agricultural and industrial development. The Law of
June 1973, which reorganized the institute, specifies that agriculture, includ-
ing forestry, fisheries and livestock, industry and tourism, are IDAI priority
investment sectors and that its main functions are to help individuals or
corporations to increase output and to produce import substitution goods and
services. To pursue such an aim, IDAI is authorized to either invest directly
in enterprises and development projects or to extend short- and long-term
loans.
Organization and Management
9.        A Board of Directors, composed of the State Secretaries of Agricul-
ture, Natural Resources and Rural Development; Finance and Economic Affairs;
and Commerce and Industry and of the Director General of the National Council
for Planning and Development (CONADEP) and the Director-General of the Central
Bank (BNRH), is responsible for policy issues and lending programs. IDAI's
administration is in the hands of a general manager and deputy general manager
nominated by the President of the Republic and assisted in their lending
decisions by a Credit Committee to which are also appointed the controller and
the credit manager of the Institute.
10.       IDAI has headquarters in Port-au-Prince and operates through a net-
work of five regional offices staffed by a large group of agricultural and
industrial extensionists. As of December 1975, IDAI personnel numbered 440,
about 50% of whom were technicians and the rest administrative and general
service personnel. The institution organizes training facilities for its
agricultural staff and offers more than competitive salaries and a variety
of fringe benefits.
Lending Policies and Financial Resources
11.       Although the bulk of IDAI's funds is invested in industry (Table 5),
a substantial amount (42% in 1975) is used to finance agricultural production.
Supervised credit to agriculture, which had increased from about US$71,000 in



ANNEX 3
Page 4
1970 to US$284,000 in 1974, has again almost doubled (US$428,000) in 1975,
mainly due to IDB funds and technical assistance. Production loans were
mainly for cotton (65%) to farmers owning more than 5 ha, with the rest (35%)
going to finance grains. Due to extremely high operational costs, the present
rate of interest (9%) for both short- and long-term lending is not sufficient
to cover administrative expenditures. The level of arrears, though decreasing,
still averaged about 22% of agricultural lending in 1975.
12.       As indicated by the balance sheet (Table 6), the bulk of IDAI's
financial resources has recently been supplied by IDB's short- and long-term
lending and by deposits from insurance companies on which IDAI is required to
pay an interest rate of only 2.5%, and by Government allocations (Table 7).
13.       Auditing is performed by an IDAI officer appointed under recommen-
dation of the Central Bank. Occasionally, external auditing is carried out by
international auditors.

HAITI
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
SCHEDULE A
Lending and Operating Policies and Procedures of BCA in Respect of
the Agricultural Credit Component of the Project
The Bureau of Agricultural Credit (BCA) would follow the policies
and procedures set forth in this Schedule in carrying out the agricultural
credit component of the project as the agent of ODN (paras 2.09, 2.10, 4.04,
5.07, 5.08 and 5.09 of the main text).
A.   Purpose
The BCA regional office of Cap-Haitien would make short-term loans
to eligible individual farmers and Agricultural Credit Societies (SACs) for
expenditures related to agricultural and livestock production, such as fertili-
zers, pesticides, seeds and livestock medications, and medium-term loans to
purchase draft oxen, yokes, plows, sprayers, pumps and other production-related
implements as well as to construct simple grain storage facilities for shared
use of SAC members or by individual farmers.
B.   Eligibility
In order to be eligible to receive a loan, a farmer would be (a) a
member of a SAC, or (b) an individual farmer cultivating up to 10 ha in the
irrigated districts and up to 15 ha in the rainfed area. In both cases a
farmer would meet all criteria established in the BCA statutes or as would be
reasonably established from time to time by BCA and the Organisme de Developpe-
ment du Nord (ODN).
C.   Terms and Conditions
1.        All loans would bear an interest rate of 9% per annum for the first
two years of the project, and 11% per annum thereafter, on the principal amount
of the credit withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, or on the total
amount of the loan.
2.        SACs would not be required to contribute to their project costs, but,
under the present statutes governing SACs, 5% of the amount lent to them would
be withheld by BCA as a guarantee deposit on which an interest rate equal to
the onlending rate would be paid.
3.        Individual farmers would be required to contribute at least 10% to
the total cost of the inputs financed under their short-term loans or of the
total investments under their medium-term loans.



ANNEX 3
Schedule A
Page 2
4.        Short-term loans would be repaid in periods of up to one year.
5.        Medium-term loans would be repaid in equal installments over
periods of up to five years, including two years of grace, the exact period
being determined in each case on the basis of the cash flow forecasts.
6.        SACs would guarantee collectively the repayment of loans granted
to their individual members. Normally, fresh loans would not be granted to
any farmer who is in default on an earlier loan.
D.   Procedures
1.        Individual applications of SAC-members for short-term loans would
be consolidated at the SAC level; applications for medium-term loans for
group-owned equipment or grain storage facilities would also originate at the
SAC level. BCA's credit extension agents would review each loan application,
including the individual SAC-member's farm plans and budgets, financing
requirements, repayment ability, debts and family needs, and the technical
recommendations of the Agricultural Extension Service (SVA). The consolidated
SAC applications, with comments and recommendations on the basis of such
review, would be submitted to ODN through the corresponding BCA office for
approval within two weeks.
2.        Short-term loans would be disbursed, to the extent possible, in
kind; that is, in the form of fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, livestock
medication, and the like.
E.   Supervision
1.        BCA's credit extension agents would be responsible for the super-
vision of loans, including the verification of the end use of credits and the
collection of repayments from the individual farmers and from SAC members
through the SACs.
2.        Agricultural Extension Service's (SVA) agents would regularly visit
borrowers to ensure that farmers and SACs effectively carry out farm and crop
development and comply with the technical provisions of their respective loan
agreements with BCA.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
Agricultural Trials and Seed Production
Introduction
1.        Agricultural development of the Northern Department requires improve-
ment in crop varieties presently cultivated as well as in agricultural tech-
niques. Because of the particular situation in the region, these improvements
must be based on investigations conducted in areas with similar soil and
climatic conditions and field trials in the region itself. This is parti-
cularly true for sugarcane where presently cultivated varieties are adapted to
soil and drainage conditions but are low-yielding in sugar content; but it is
also applicable to the other crops commonly grown in the region -- maize,
beans, sorghum, tobacco, and the like -- in which significant yield increases
have been obtained with selected varieties and improved management in neigh-
boring countries.
2.        The potential of the region for producing crops such as oil-bearing
seeds to substitute for imported edible oils and fats, which constitute about
40% of agricultural imports, should not be overlooked. The development of the
eastern portion of the Northern Plain for production of dairy products, another
important agricultural import, should be evaluated, with particular attention
to the production of suitable pastures adapted to regional conditions.
3.        In the absence of a strong research center at the Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (DARNDR) in Damien that
could develop a regional experimental station with close ties to the national
center, a different approach has been taken under the project, namely, to
strengthen local efforts in agricultural trials, while maintaining ties with
the Department's central research station, and to involve farmers themselves
in the trials through the Regional Extension Service. This approach is
expected to reduce the time necessary to adopt agricultural practices suitable
for implementation at the farm level.
4.        A similar approach is proposed for the production of selected seed,
a task which is essential to the improvement of present varieties and the
introduction of new ones with better characteristics. Thus, Organisme de
Developpement du Nord (ODN) would (a) assist the sugar mill in the production
and multiplication of proven varieties of cane which are adapted to regional
conditions and potentially higher in yields, both in weight and sugar content,
and (b) provide support to the Rural Development Center of Milot (CRUDEM)
for production of improved seeds of other crops. Simultaneously, contracts
would be made with individual farmers to produce the recommended improved seed
under close supervision by ODN. The resulting seed would be purchased by ODN
for distribution to project farmers, particularly those receiving credit from



ANNEX 4
Page 2
the Bureau of Agricultural Credit (BCA), on condition that Extension Service
and ODN recommendations would be strictly followed in the production, harvest
and processing of the improved seed.
Agricultural Trials
5.        The activities in agricultural trials would include applied research
and participation in the demonstration efforts to be carried out by the Exten-
sion Service. These activities would be under the supervision of the ODN
agronomist and the direct management of an agricultural technician who would
carry on after the project ended, thus providing continuity to the trials
program. The agronomist and agricultural technician would work in close
coordination with the Caldos sugar mill and with CRUDEM, providing technical
assistance when necessary and logistic and financial support for the project-
oriented trials being conducted by the two institutions.
6.        One month of consultant time per annum would be provided (Table 1)
to support agricultural trials and seed production activities as needed for
organization and planning, and to address specific technical problems. These
consultants would be contracted by ODN in agreement with the participating
institutions.
7.        Arrangements for establishment of trial plots in individual farms
would be made by the Extension Service, with ODN providing the necessary
inputs for the trials (fertilizers, seed, herbicides, pesticides and such).
Trials would also be under the supervision of the ODN agronomist and the
agricultural technicians, with the close participation of agricultural exten-
sion agents and, in the demonstration phases, of rural "animation" agents.
8.        In addition to existing trial plots at the sugar mill and at CRUDEM,
the program contemplates the establishment of a number of plots throughout
the project area. These plots would be scattered so that the maximum number
of representative conditions for the project area were experienced. The
Agricultural Extension Service, with assistance from the agronomist from
ODN, would design a program of trials, including adequate size and location
of trial plots to include as many representative conditions of the area
as possible.
9.        Equipment provided for land preparation, planting and harvesting and
laboratory and processing facilities, as well as small implements and tools
(Table 1), would be available for both the agricultural trial and seed produc-
tion activities under a work program devised by the ODN agronomist and the
agricultural technician, in consultation with Caldos and CRUDEM officials for
their respective plots, and with the Extension Service and farmers for indi-
vidual trial plots and seed production areas. Soil testing facilities would
be available for farmers participating in the trials and seed producing pro-
grams and for other project farmers at the request of the Extension Service.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
10.       No provision has been made for continuation of the agricultural
trials program beyond project year 4 since by that date it is expected that
a UNDP-financed agricultural experimentation program managed by DARNDR,
with support from FAO, would be fully operative. This program would be on a
regional basis and would expand and apply the resuIts of the present program
to regions similar to the project area throughout the Northern Department. It
would also initiate trials for the drier, heavier soil areas of the eastern
Northern Plain.
Improved Seed Production
ll.       The improved seed production activities are closely tied to the
agricultural trials and, like them, are under the supervision of the ODN agro-
nomist and management of the agricultural technician. The Extension Service
participates by identifying farmers willing to take part in the program and
by providing technical assistance in the production of the improved seed.
12.       It is expected that the program could eventually produce certified
seed, but for now, the objective would be to produce the necessary amount of
selected and treated seed to improve yields in the major crops of the area,
mainly maize, beans, sorghum and peanuts. In the case of sugarcane, the main
focus of the program would be the multiplication of seed cane of selected
varieties resulting from the agricultural trials being conducted at the sugar
mill. In due time, the trials conducted to identify potential new crops for
the area, particularly oil producing crops, would also require seed production
for introduction of these crops into the region's cropping pattern.
13.       Equipment for proper land preparation, planting and harvesting, trans-
port, and seed processing, as well as the necessary inputs, seed, fertilizers,
herbicides and pesticides, would be provided by ODN ta the participating
farmers, and technical assistance and supervision would be supplied to insure
that improved seed was produced according the technical instructions provided
to the farmer. The resulting seed crop would be purchased by ODN at prices
representing a reasonable incentive to the farmer, and surpluses not meeting
the required specifications for improved seed would be the property of the
farmer for consumption or sale in the local market. The produced improved
seed would be distributed by ODN to farmers in the project area at prices
corresponding to production costs, including packaging. Improved grain seed
would be packaged in 60-lb sisal sacks, while smaller seed for vegetables and
tobacco and the like would be packaged in 1-lb paper bags. Seeds would be
processed by ODN and treated to prevent deterioration or insect and rodent
attack before distribution to farmers.
14.       In the case of multiplication of sugarcane stock or production of
seed by either the sugar mill or CRUDEM, adequate arrangements would be made
between ODN and the participating institution to adjust the price of seed
to the corresponding production cost for ODN.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
15.       The program contemplates the production of improved seed following
a program to be established by ODN with assistance from the Extension Service.
After year 5, the proposed UNDP-financed project for agricultural trials and
seed production is expected to be operational and would concentrate on produc-
tion of improved varieties and introduction of new crops.
16.       ODN's soll testing facilities would be available to farmers parti-
cipating in the seed production program, and storage facilities created under
the project would be available for stocking improved seed, if necessary. It
should be stressed that purchase of seed resulting from the program by ODN
is subject to following strict production instructions from the program
management and the Extension Service.
17.       In addition to improved grain seed, the program would undertake the
introduction of improved plantains, yams, and manioc varieties with higher
yields. Grain seed should be produced in years 1 to 3 and improved tuber
and plantain varieties in year 4. Introduction of new cane varieties should
be considered only after satisfactory results have been obtained in the
experimental plots of the sugar mill, followed by careful testing in the
field to prove their higher yields in both cane and sugar. Once such a
variety had been identified and tested, the "animation" and extension agents
would undertake to convince farmers, by means of demonstrations and tests, to
replant deteriorating fields of the present varieties with the new ones.
18.       Experimental plots for agricultural trials would be distributed in
both the irrigated and non-irrigated areas of the project, but seed produc-
tion would be developed only in irrigated areas in order to insure adequate
harvests and to avoid possible crop failures due to lack of precipitation.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
Road Construction and Maintenance
The National Road Network
1.        Haiti's road network outside the urban centers comprises about
3,400 km, of which 430 km, or about 13%, have an asphalt or cobblestone sur-
face, the remainder being gravel or earth, with earth more predominant. The
network is largely adequate in extent, but its condition is in general very
unsatisfactory due to a nearly total neglect of maintenance for many years.
Composition and condition of the network in the project area is fairly close
to the national average.
2.        Responsibility for road construction and maintenance, both urban and
rural, rests with the Department of Public Works, Transport and Communication
(TPTC). The Department has a supervision service for construction of larger
projects and a force account equipment fleet and staff, which, in practice, is
occupied only with urban street construction and maintenance. Maintenance of
the extra-urban road network is delegated to an autonomous service of the
Departments, the permanent service for maintenance of the national road network
(SEPRRN 1), established in 1972 with assistance from USAID.
3.        The physical deterioration of the extra-urban network has progressed
so far that ordinary and periodic maintenance activities are largely meaning-
less. Consequently, SEPRRN's efforts have been directed to rehabilitation of
key links in the network, while the network as a whole until late 1975 received
scant attention. Recently, however, district offices have been established in
Cap-Haitien, Hinche, and Les Cayes, functioning as centers for mobile units
maintaining drainage works and structures.
4.        The Bank has assisted Haiti in financing four highway projects, of
which the last two comprise construction of the Port-au-Prince to Cap-Haitien
road to two-lane, paved standards. That road will provide all-weather
connection between the project area and the capital and is expected to be
completed by the end of 1976.
The Road Network of the Project Area
5.        In the project area, the main network comprises about 105 km, of
which 20 km are paved. The length of the motorable feeder road network is
estimated at about 200 km. Some roads in the area, such as the Cap-Haitien
1/   Service d'entretien permanent du reseau routier national.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
to Trou du Nord highway were previously either paved or had cobblestone or
gravel surfaces, of which virtually nothing remains to date. Presently,
feeder roads in the area are frequentIy unpassable in the rainy season.
6.        TPTC forces in the project area do not carry out any work outside
the town of Cap-Haitien, limiting itself to street maintenance work. Their
equipment is in complete disrepair, the maintenance yard is equipped with
only a few hand tools, and spare parts stock is non-existent. Operational
equipment is limited to two trucks and one jeep for the district engineer.
SEPRRN, on the other hand, has an equipment yard of ample size, as yet under-
utilized, and in need of cleaning out and refurbishment. An ongoing USAID
sponsored road maintenance program will finance modernizing of the Cap
Haitian SEPRRN workshop as well as the procurement of tools and maintenance
equipment.
7.        The only road construction activity undertaken in the area in
recent years has been carried out by the Rural Development Center of Milot
(CRUDEM), organized by a Canadian religious order and supported by Canada's
technical assistance agency (CIDA). CRUDEM has a limited equipment pool and
most work is done by hand. An average of 10 km of feeder roads has been up-
graded annually to all-weather standards, totalling 75 km in the Plaine du
Nord area. Work quality is uneven and the road elevation above surrounding
areas is generally insufficient, but the overall result is acceptable in view
of CRUDEM's limited construction capacity. Maintenance of the completed roads
is being done mostly by hand, assisted by CRUDEM's single grader. Construc-
tion is expected to continue during the coming years at the present rate,
providing a useful supplement to the road construction that would be done under
the project.
The Project:  Construction of 66.5 km of Feeder Roads and about 27 km of
Farm Access Roads
8.        With respect to transport infrastructure, the project area contains
two distinct regions: the lowlands of the Plaine du Nord and the high plateau
south of St. Raphael. The lowlands would have relatively easy access to Cap-
Haitien and its agro-industrial plants, provided that all-weather feeder roads
were constructed to connect to the main highways of the region. The St. Raphael
plateau is served by only one access road. Feeder roads in the St. Raphael
Plateau are relatively satisfactory, although primitive, due to the greater
permeability of the plateau soils (some of which are of volcanic origin) and
consequent lesser dependence on drainaged structures and ditches.
9.        To sustain the movement of agricultural produce envisaged in the
project area, it is estimated that 180 km of feeder roads and 60 km of all-
weather primary/secondary roads would be required. Of this, only about 75 km
of feeder roads, built by CRUDEM, and about 20 km of paved road from Cap-
Haitien to Milot (and, later in 1976, the 20 km of main road from Cap-Haitien
to Limbe) would be satisfactory to meet the immediate needs of the project.



ANNEX 10
Page 3
10.       The transport requirements of the project are, therefore, in
descending order of priority:
(a) an all-weather link from the existing paved road,
Cap-Haitien-Grande Riviere du Nord, to St. Raphael (30 km);
(b) a network comprising about 53.5 km of feeder roads in the
lowlands of the Plaine du Nord; and
(c) feeder roads (13 km) and access roads (27 km) to the
hydraulic works in the St. Raphael Plateau.
The link from Grande Riviere du Nord to St. Raphael is included in a second
USAID highway project, signed on June 29, 1976, comprising a US$5 million loan
and a Government contribution of US$1.6 million for rehabilitating 940 km of
roads to all-weather feeder road standards. The first section from Grande
Riviere du Nord to Dondon (about 15 km) has already been completed and work
is proceeding on the remaining section. The links to be financed under the
project cover points (b) and (c) above and are listed in Table 1.
Design
11.       There are no generally established road standards in Haiti; most
design in recent years is derived from French and US practice. With assis-
tance from USAID, the TPTC has, however, developed standards for feeder
roads, and design for them under the project (Table 2) would adhere to such
guidelines. The TPTC Cap-Haitien Regional Service, aided by a technical
assistant recruited under the project, would do the design work. Access roads
to farms and dam sites would be simple cleared tracks, 4 m wide with a suitable
cover (about 15 cm thick) but little or no earthworks.
Construction
12.       There are no contractors in the area capable of undertaking the
project works, and overseas firms are unlikely to be interested due to the
small size of the project. Construction of feeder roads and access roads to
farms and dam sites would therefore be done by the TPTC Regional Service in
Cap-Haitien on force account. Its manpower and equipment facilities are
presently very limited, and, although construction is envisaged to be carried
out by hand labor wherever feasible (for ditches, off-shoot drains and calverts),
additional equipment and technical assistance would be required to cope with
clearing and earthworks. The necessary equipment and a limited amount of work-
shop tools for equipment maintenance would be purchased under the project
(Table 3). Costs and phasing of expenditures are in Tables 4 and 5.
Construction Supervision
13.       Supervision of all construction work would be done by the TPTC
Regional Service under the guidance of a technical assistant provided under
the project (para 15).



ANNEX 10
Page 4
Maintenance
14.       SEPRRN would be responsible for maintenance of all roads constructed
under the project. The SEPRRN Regional Service is presently being established
(para 6) and operations in the area have begun. Average maintenance cost of
the feeder roads is tentatively estimated at US$600 per km annually, with
total maintenance costs for all the roads constructed under the project
expected to be about $35,000 per annum. Maintenance costs for all roads in
the project area would be about $150,000 annually. In the intermediate
period, until SEPRRN is fully operational, CRUDEM would continue to maintain
the feeder roads they construct.
Technical Assistance and Consulting Services
15.       To implement road design, construction and supervision, the TPTC
would require an estimated four man-years of technical assistance to carry
out feeder road alignment selection and to direct TPTC construction work in
the field. This assistance would be provided by an expert who would train
the TPTC district staff in feeder road construction. Ample need for further
feeder road construction outside the project area but within the Cap-Haitien
TPTC district would remain after project completion to warrant the retention
in the region of equipment and engineering talent acquired under the project.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
Potable Water Supply
Existing Potable Water Supply
1.        While 55% of the urban population of Haiti was served by public
potable water systems in 1973, only 2.3% of the rural population had such
service. In the Northern Department, the City of Cap-Haitien is served by
a potable water system (groundwater development) which reaches less than
1,000 of the more than 5,000 houses of the city, and the service was reduced
during the last few years, mainly because of the financial deficit of the
Regional Hydraulic Service. There are only two public systems in the rural
area of the Northern Department, one in Milot serving about 5,000 persons the
other in St. Raphael, providing water through two public faucets to about 50
households. The majority of the population obtains drinking water from
shallow, hand-dug, open wells, from rivers and a few springs in the foothills.
The wells, with a water table about 1.50 to 2.00 m below ground level (about
2.00 to 2.50 m during the dry season), are unprotected and mostly contaminated,
resulting in widespread intestinal diseases. Only a few wells that were built
by missionaries are well protected and equipped with hand pumps.
Proposed Expanded Potable Water Supply
2.        The project would provide for the construction of up to 400 hand-dug
wells and up to five small potable water system to improve general hygienic
conditions and to reduce widespread intestinal diseases substantially. In
addition, the present need to carry water over large distances would be elimi-
nated for about 3,000 households.
3.        Wells would be 2- to 10-m deep with a 1-m diameter.  Reinforced
concrete rings or brick walls would be used for their lining and they would be
disinfected, protected with reinforced concrete covers and equipped with hand
pumps. The small systems would include spring catchments, a small concrete
water reservoir, and plastic pipes leading to three to five standpipes. About
20 persons would benefit from each well, while each small system would serve
an estimated 2,500 persons. As a result, a total of about 20,000 persons
would be provided with potable water, as shown below:
Total Number of
Number            Persons Served
Small Systems              5                   12,500
Shallow wells            400                    8,000
20,500



ANNEX 11
Page 2
4.        While the wells would be built primarily to serve the population
with adequate drinking water, the project management would make all efforts
to encourage use of the wells for irrigating gardens and small plots in the
immediate neighborhood of the dwellings. Various ways of exploiting the
groundwater resource such as hand and small gasoline pumps and simple water
wheels would be experimented with.
Execution of Works
5.        Organisme de Developpement du Nord (ODN) would be responsible for
the preparation and supervision of project works, in cooperation with SHRH 1/
and COALEP 2/. The Rural Animation Service would promote the project among
the rural population.  SHRH and COALEP would be in charge of implementation
works, assisted by ODN, which would provide vehicles, construction materials
and pumps, determine the exact location of the wells, supervise their con-
struction and be responsible for their disinfection, and install the pumps.
The same agencies would design the small systems and be responsible for their
construction, for which the project would supply the necessary materials.
While the beneficiaries would contribute labor for excavation and other work
that can be carried out by unskilled labor, SHRH and COALEP would provide
technicians and skilled construction workers.
Operation and Maintenance
6.        The beneficiaries would be responsible for operation and maintenance
of the water supply systems. However, because of their lack of experience they
would have to rely on outside assistance for maintenance of the systems. The
only organizations in the Northern Department with experience in maintaining
wells and potable water systems are SHRH in Cap-Haitien and the Rural Development
Center of Milot (CRUDEM).
7.        The project would therefore strengthen SHRH in Cap-Haitien through
the provision of vehicles and equipment (Table 1) and two trained mechanics
during project execution to allow them to carry out the necessary maintenance
and repair of the small systems and the wells. SHRH would also carry out
routine checks of the sanitary conditions of the wells and of their state of
repair.  A fee, to be determined by SHRH, COALEP and ODN, would be charged for
these services.
1/   Service Hydraulique de la Republique d'Haiti, which is building water
supply systems in towns.
2/   Cooperative pour l'Alimentation en Eau de la Population Rurale, the
Government agency charged with building rural water supply systems.

Sewage Disposal
8.        Sewerage systems do not exist in the rural areas of the Northern
Department, but a US$6 million project of IDB 1/ is underway which provides
for the construction of small water supply systems and latrines in various
parts of the country. Since more than 1,000 latrines are to be built in
Northern Haiti, the project does not include a sewage disposal component.
The project management, however, would cooperate closely with the IDB project
to assure that latrines were built according to adequate hygienic standards.

HAITI
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
Objectives
1.        Project monitoring and evaluation would be carried out by the
Evaluation and Control Unit within the Agricultural Planning Unit of the
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (DARNDR),
which would produce feedback information for decision-making by both the
Project Board, the "Organisme de Developpement du Nord" (ODN) and the Regional
Coordinating Committee (Chart). The Unit's main responsibilities would be to:
(a) determine the key indicators reflecting the impact of the
project on the quality of rural life in the project area;
(b) measure the effectiveness and efficiency of project activities
in achieving the objectives of the project in its first phase;
(c) submit proposals to project management on ways to make neces-
sary adjustments to project goals and assumptions involved
in the project's design;
(d) provide the ODN and the Project Board with an independent
evaluation of the physical, social and financial progress of
the project and an identification of major project constraints;
and
(e) assess the extent to which the project could be expanded to
other parts of the Northern Department or replicated else-
where in Haiti.
Monitoring and Evaluation Responsibility
2.        Under the project, the Evaluation and Control Unit of DARNDR would
be strengthened by a resident consultant with experience in project monitoring
and evaluation, supported by a staff of about five (Table 1).  He would be
assisted by regional Government staff in the data collection necessary. The
qualifications of the specialist would be subject to Government approval in
consultation with IDA. The Unit would prepare a summary analysis report on
the project at least once each year, plus such other special reports to ODN
and/or the Project Board as needed. The summary report would be reviewed with
the project management and subsequently be made available to Government and
IDA, as well as to the Project Board and the Regional Coordinating Committee.
At the end of project implementation, the Unit would prepare a final summary



ANNEX 14
Page 2
project evaluation, including specific recommendations for the second phase
rural development project. In addition to monitoring and evaluating the pro-
posed project, the above resident consultant would assist the DARNDR Evalua-
tion and Control Unit to train its staff, to develop monitoring and evaluation
methods for rural projects in Haiti and to expand the Unit's activities
nationwide.
3.        On-going evaluation during project disbursement should aim at
producing revised projections of project effects and impact. Ex-post evalua-
tions, scheduled after project disbursement, should aim at social and econo-
mic assessment of all project effects and ultimate project impact, including
an assessment of the original objectives. In this way, both on-going and
ex-post evaluations would influence future planning of rural development
projects.
Project Key Indicators
4.        The following indicators, which focus on the most crucial factors
contributing to the success of the project, would be observed in.the monitor-
ing process:
(a) changes in incomes of participants, particularly members of
the Agricultural Credit Societies (SACs);
(b) changes in volume and value of production arising from improved
agricultural practices as a result of extension efforts and
from double cropping resulting from application of gravity
and well irrigation;
(c) stabilization of prices for agricultural products resulting
from improved storage facilities;
(d) changes in economic and social indicators such as patterns
of consumption and spending, participation in education and
health prôgrams, acceptance and implementation of extension
recommendations, and other measures of human vell-being in
the project area;
(e) changes in land tenure and land use;
(f) improvement in rural cooperation through increased numbers of
SACs or other grouping of farmers;
(g) improvements in health conditions through provision of water
supplies;
(h) increased mobility of people and farm products resulting
from an improved road network in the project area; and
(i) increased support by the project area population of a follow-up
rural development project.



ANNEX 14
Page 3
5.        Precise types of measurements to be made and methods of data collec-
tion and analyses would be developed by the DARNDR Evaluation and Control Unit.
Some of the data needed would be generated by ODN records and other data would
be collected by the Unit from direct surveys conducted by is staff or from
public and private agencies operating in the project area or in other parts of
the country. During year 1, the Unit would prepare detailed terms of reference
and a timetable for completion of the monitoring and evaluation task, which
would be reviewed by the ODN and the Project Board and submitted to IDA
for approval no later than one year after the signing of the Credit. Table 1
gives estimated costs as to the strengthening of the DARNDR Evaluation and
Control Unit.
Project Design Summary
6.        A "Project Design Summary and Evaluation Framework" is shown in
Table 2. The vertical organization of the chart presents the hierarchy of
objectives and characterizes the project as a set of linked hypothesis,
fostering the analytical sorting of evidence that will be required for the
purpose of evaluation. Futhermore, for each level in the hierarchy of objec-
tives, indicators have been specified that will allow actual results to be
measured. Similarly, for each hierarchy of objectives, specific mechanisms
are identified through which accomplishment of project objectives can be
verified.  The fourth colunn in Table 2 lists some critical assumptions,
some of which are project risks, affecting the success or failure of the
project components. These assumptions can influence the extent to which

RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT
Farm Models
1.        Farm models are representative of the three main agricultural con-
ditions in the project area, namely, (a) an irrigated unit at an altitude
of about 400 m in the lower rainfall (average 850 mm per annum) area of
St. Raphael; (b) two irrigated units, one from surface water and one from
wells, at an altitude of about 15 m in the higher rainfall (average 1,300 mm
per annum) area of Quartier Morin; and (c) a rainfed unit in the non-irrigated
area of the Western Northern Plain.
2.        The size of the irrigated units in St. Raphael and Quartier Morin
areas was established at 10 ha, which is closely related to the size estab-
lished by the Bureau of Agricultural Credit (BCA) for an Agricultural Credit
Society (SAC), which is 5 to 10 carreaux. These units are assuméd to be oper-
ated individually by the members of the SAC, but each farm model represents,
a productive unit. For the rainfed area, a 15-ha size has been established
in order to achieve a unit of similar production level without the benefit of
irrigation.
3.        For each of the units, seven families have been assumed, this num-
ber constituting the minimal number of members for a SAC. Since the unit is
treated as a whole in the model, no attempt has been made to distribute sizes
among the seven operators. Each family has been assigned an average of five
members, which is consistent with national and regional averages (Annex 1).
4.        The selection of crops for the models is based on the actual crops
and crop varieties grown in each area, since the project does not foresee
introduction of new crops until the agricultural trial program would even-
tually recommend, together with the Organisme de Developpement du Nord (ODN)
marketing specialist, new crops and/or varieties.  In the area of St. Raphael,
sugarcane is grown mainly for on-farm consumption, with limited amounts being
utilized for syrup; but, since the latter is normally grown by the processor,
it was not introduced as a cash crop in the model. Other crops grown in the
area, including maize, beans, bananas, yams, manioc, tobacco and rice are
mainly for on-farm consumption, except for vegetables (mainly onions, tomatoes
and carrots), which are sold in Cap-Haitien and Port-au-Prince. In Quartier
Morin, sugarcane dominates the cropping pattern, with an assured market in the
Caldos sugar mill. Additional crops such as maize, beans and yams are grown
mainly for on-farm consumption. In the rainfed areas, sugarcane also plays an
important role although the distance from the sugar mill prevents economic
processing for export. A large part is consumed on the farm and surpluses are



ANNEX 19
Page 2
sold to numerous small distilleries or mills for the manufacture of alcohol
("clairin") or of block sugar ("rapadou"). In this area, tobacco is becoming
an important cash crop due to extension efforts of the national tobacco
manufacturers.
5.        Present yields used for the farm model projections are based on
average rainfall conditions and were established after discussions with
farmers.and community councils in representative locations of the project
area. They were further supported by local Agricultural Extension Service
staff and agricultural agents from the sugar mill.
6.        Incremental yields were established through correlation with con-
servative yields in the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, under comparable
conditions of soils and rainfall and assuming an improved level of manage-
ment. Such yields are possible for Haitian farmers to achieve during the
four-year disbursements period with the improvements provided by the proj-
ect. In the St. Raphael and Quartier Morin areas, yields are the result of
improved agricultural management practices through intensive extension
efforts, increased farm inputs and double cropping of some of.the good crops
through rehabilitation and expansion of the irrigation systems. Increments
in sugarcane yields are not substantially larger in the irrigated than in
the rainfed areas because of the low yielding sugarcane variety presently
cultivated and because sugarcane is a full-year crop and rainfall in the
area is not so much insufficient as irregularly distributed. Therefore,
the improved irrigation system at Quartier Morin would assure regular pro-
duction (on which the local sugar mill depends) and guarantee what has been
estimated as a relatively modest yield increase until results from the
trials at the Caldos sugar mill allow the introduction of varieties with
significantly higher yields and sugar content.
7.        Extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides can be recommended
only once their economic use has been successfully tested and demonstrated
by ODN. The yields assumed for the farm models are therefore, mainly based on
the expected effects of (a) strengthening the Agricultural Extension Service
(SVA) and the Rural Animation Service (SAR); (b) the recognized ability of the
Haitian farmer to absorb and apply new agricultural practices; (c) the avail-
ability of improved seed; and (d) short-term credit for small farmers to cover
costs of some fertilizer, pesticides, improved seeds, livestock medication,
and such, as well as medium-term credit to purchase draft oxen, yokes, plows,
sprayers, irrigation pumps and the like. In relation to actual yields in the
Dominican Republic and Haiti under similar conditions and level of improved
management, the assumed yield increases can be considered as rather conser-
vative.
8.        Projected incremental livestock production is based on (a) in-
creased output of crop residues as a result of expected incremental agri-
cultural production due to the project, with crop residues from sugarcane,
grain and vegetable cultivation preponderantly benefitting cattle raising;
(b) the introduction of efficient animal health services expected to benefit



ANNEX 19
Page 3
mainly pork and poultry production; and (c) improved animal husbandry prac-
tices to be extended by the agents of the Animal Health and Agricultural
Extension Services.
9.        On-farm consumption at subsistence level is extremely low in Haiti,
since even in the smaller farms (average 0.5 ha) a small amount of agricul-
tural production is being reserved for sale or barter. The on-farm consump-
tion, therefore, has been assumed to amount to about 85% of production during
the first three years of the project and to level off thereafter.
10.       Farmgate prices for agricultural products and investment and
operating costs reflect mid-harvest 1976 prices. Labor cost has been off-set
by on-farm consumption, except for the Quartier Morin irrigation district
where additional labor is required during harvest of sugarcane. The legal
salary rate of G 6.00 per day (US$1.20) was applied for compensating addi-
tional laborers.

Economic Analyses
1.        The economic rate of return was calculated on the basis of data
shown in Table 1. The key assumptions made in transforming financial costs,
prices, inputs and outputs are indicated below:
(a)  Due to the high unemployment and underemployment in the country,
a shadow wage equal to 50% of the current legal minimum monetary
wage was applied for all incremental unskilled labor;
(b)  Costs for improvement and construction of three municipal mar-
kets and an abattoir, and rural water supply (3% of total costs)
were excluded because of the difficulty of quantifying benefits,
which are mainly of a social nature;
(c)  The price of fertilizers was reduced by 38%, the amount of
Government subsidy on the import price. The cost of gasoline
to operate vehicles was also reduced to make it equivalent to
the US gasoline price before taxes are applied;
(d)  The revenue deriving from sugar exports was determined by
applying the Bank's projections on the international price
of sugar;
(e)  Equipment and machinery and other imported inputs to be
used under the project were costed, custom-duty-free;
(f)  No shadow exchange rates have been applied as the inflationary
rate of US and Haitian economies are assumed to be similar;
(g)  The grant of the World Food Program (WFP) to help finance
labor cost under the project was considered to be a net
benefit to the Haitian economy, as such food is additional
to the WFP planned allocation of food; and
(h)  Costs and prices other than sugar were calculated throughout
the project at June 1976 levels.
2.        On the basis of the above assumptions, the project's economic rate
of return was 14%. A sensitivity analysis on potential cost benefit varia-
tions has yielded the following results:



ANNEX 21
Page 2
(a) A 25% increase in the cost of construction, vehicles and
equipment would reduce the rate of return to 10%;
(b) A 10% decrease in yields would reduce the rate of return
to 10%;
(c) A 10% increase in the cost of construction, vehicles and
equipment combined with a 10% decrease in yields would
-reduce the rate of return to 9%; and
(d) A one-year delay of project benefits would reduce the rate
of return to 10.5%.
