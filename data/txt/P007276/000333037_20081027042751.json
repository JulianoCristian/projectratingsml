The\n            audit finds that the PCR covers adequately the\n            project's salient features, and the audit memorandum\n            generally agrees with its conclusions. In addition to\n            summarizing the objectives and outcome of the project, the\n            memorandum devotes special attention to three issues which\n            are seen in numerous rural development projects:\n            insufficient preparation, an error of judgment regarding the\n            time needed to exert a significant impact on agricultural\n            production, and a project organization which, from the\n            outset, did not meet the requirements of integrated regional\n            development. As such ratings for the Rural Development\n            Project of Haiti were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; the risk to development was substantial; the\n            Bank\u0092s performance was moderately satisfactory; and the\n            Borrower\u0092s performance was reasonably satisfactory.\n            Considering the complexity of the agricultural sector, lack\n            of sufficient Knowledge on socioeconomic aspects, and the\n            fact that the project was the first IDA involvement in\n            agriculture in Haiti, the project proved to be a good\n            learning experience. (a) The major lesson has been the need\n            for flexibility and active participation in adjustment and\n            redesign by supervision missions. Without substantial\n            changes in organization and scope of components, the project\n            would have experienced greater difficulties. (b) At the same\n            time, a critical review or issues by supervision missions\n            was required before changes were made, considering that the\n            Northern Department Development Agency (ODN) occasionally\n            proposed changes that could not be justified. (c) Projects\n            of this type in Haiti require a commitment of sufficient and\n            continuing local manpower to ensure frequent supervision.\n            (d) Experience suggests that the main risk in this project\n            (and probably in the follow-up project) was institutional\n            uncertainty. This results from a lack of continuity in\n            staffing, policies and programs, and from uncertainty of\n            funding. (e) IDA and the Government learned the importance\n            of the availability of viable technical packages and the\n            role of regional development."}, "docdt": "2005-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
