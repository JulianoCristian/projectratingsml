to: 1) slow the rate\n            of oil production decline in Western Siberia and thus\n            strengthen the Russian Federation's ability to earn\n            foreign exchange in the near term; 2) transfer international\n            technical, environmental and managerial practice to the\n            operation of oil fields in Western Siberia; 3) promote a\n            more efficient and environmentally sustainable use of\n            Russia's petroleum resources; and 4) through policy\n            consultations, continue past support to sector reforms\n            conducive to attracting the equity and loan finance and\n            international participation necessary to reverse the oil\n            production decline. The project will contain the following\n            broad categories of components: a) rehabiliation of idle\n            wells and facilities where warranted; b) systematic\n            reconstruction of existing field infrastructure for a\n            limited number of fields; c) in-fill drilling in existing\n            fields; d) technical assistance for project implementation\n            and for preparation of field optimization plans and e)\n            equipment and services to help mitigate the effects of oil\n            operations on the environment."}, "docdt": "1994-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
