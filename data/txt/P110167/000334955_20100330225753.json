Support\n            Credit Project for Bangladesh were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: even during difficult political times\n            (e.g. the 2007 and 2008 transition) and periods when a\n            transition government is in place, there is a merit for the\n            Bank to maintain engagement on critical policy and\n            institutional reforms in order to ensure government's\n            continued attention on critical development issues. The Bank\n            must remain cognizant of risks associated with implementing\n            far reaching institutional reforms during the tenure of an\n            unelected government. While supporting an opportunistic use\n            of the window opened during the transition period and\n            recognizing the role of Caretaker Government (CTG) in giving\n            traction to some critical reforms, it must also be\n            acknowledged that, in Bangladesh, many challenging reforms,\n            such as privatization, deregulation and trade openness were\n            initiated and implemented under elected governments.\n            Evidence shows that these reforms although more difficult\n            and time consuming have been more sustainable. The Bank must\n            continue to maintain dialogue with the political parties,\n            including those in opposition, and with other key opinion\n            makers in a more institutionalized manner to ensure\n            continuous and better assessment of the public support for reforms."}, "docdt": "2009-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
