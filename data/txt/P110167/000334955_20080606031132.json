Government (CTG), which assumed power in\n            January 2007. The transitional part of the TSC reflects the\n            transitional nature of the political situation. The TSC will\n            support a subset of the CTG's wide-ranging reform\n            agenda, which is heavily focused on tackling critical and\n            long-festering weaknesses in core governance functions.\n            Notably, the reforms have sought to strengthen and enhance\n            the autonomy of important institutions of accountability\n            such as the election commission and the anti-corruption\n            commission. Other measures have included separation of the\n            lower judiciary from the executive, preparation of the right\n            to information legislation, and formation of the regulatory\n            reforms commission to streamline business processes. The CTG\n            is also deepening economic reforms in a number of areas,\n            including trade liberalization, macroeconomic stability, and\n            strengthening public financial management and tax\n            mobilization. The recently concluded joint damage, loss and\n            needs assessment has outlined a long-term strategy that\n            integrates structural and nonstructural interventions in\n            light of the lessons learned from the natural disasters over\n            last two decades. Central to this strategy is a long term\n            disaster risk reduction framework which has five strategic\n            pillars: (a) risk identification and assessment; (b)\n            strengthening and enhancing emergency preparedness; (c)\n            institutional and community capacity building; (d) risk\n            mitigation investments; and (e) introducing catastrophe risk\n            financing in the longer term."}, "docdt": "2008-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
