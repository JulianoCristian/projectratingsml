satisfactory\n            outcomes, likely sustainability, though only modest\n            institutional development impacts. Despite being too early\n            to draw firm lessons on the project's operation, and\n            strategy, some tentative lessons convey experiences to\n            consider, as follows. The approach of using a one-tranche\n            operation, has seemingly worked, particularly as it relates\n            to the operation within the context of the Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS). Likewise, the strategic approach,\n            seems particularly suited for a government, where its\n            ability to implement a reform program, needs a further\n            confident reestablishment, and, this in turn suggests that\n            it might be useful to conduct an Intensive Learning\n            Implementation Completion Report, following the next one, or\n            two one-tranche adjustment operations. Nonetheless, it will\n            be important to maintain a medium-to-long term focus on the\n            actions supported, if such one-tranche operations are to be\n            implemented in the context of the CAS, so as to ensure a\n            timely start on measures requiring a longer lead time.\n            Similarly, implementation of actions already taken, should\n            be ensured, to sustain the effective momentum of their\n            intended outcomes. However, it is important to review the\n            government's bold devolution program, since both\n            opportunities, and risks have been identified: opportunities\n            include a greater voice for the country's people;\n            conversely, risks include a potential disconnect between\n            national, and local priorities, particularly where\n            traditional elites have not fully appreciated the benefits\n            of social actions."}, "docdt": "2002-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
