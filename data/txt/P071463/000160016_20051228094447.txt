 About this Report
        The IndependentEvaluationGroupassessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bankfor two purposes:
 first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessandto verifythat the Bank'swork is producingthe
 expected results,and second,to helpdevelop improveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough the
 disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience. As part of this work, IEGannuallyassessesabout 25 percent of the
 Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those that are innovative,
 large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which Executive
 Directorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;and those that are likelyto generate importantlessons.
 The projects, topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluationstudies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is basedon a review of the ImplementationCompletion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsibleBank department)and fieldwork conducted by IEG. To prepare
 PPARs, IEG staff examine projectfiles and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowing country for onsite discussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
validate and augment the informationprovided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
 IEG studies.
        Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and IEG management approval. Once cleared internally, the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsibleBank departmentand amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
 Board of Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEG are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the IEG website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
       Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       lnstitutional DevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitableand sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organizationwith its mandate, which derives from these
institutional arrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operationof the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrowerassumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparationand implementation,and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of developmentobjectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

         This report evaluates four adjustment loans/credits to Pakistan during the decade
1993-2002. The Public Sector Adjustment Loan/Credit (PSAL), inthe amount o f
US$250 million equivalent (loan o fUS$150 million and credit o fUS$lOO million
equivalent), was approved on September 14, 1993, and fully disbursedintwo tranches
before closing on December 31, 1995, as originally scheduled. The other three
loans/credits were single tranche operations that disbursedwithin days o f approval. The
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL), inthe amount ofUS$350 million, was approved on
January 21,1999, and closed on June 30, 1999. The Structural Adjustment Credit
(SACI), inthe amount o f US$350million equivalent, was approved on June 12,2001,
andclosedon December 31,2001. The SecondStructural Adjustment Credit (SAC 11), in
the amount ofUS$500 million equivalent, was approved on June 11,2002, andclosed on
December 31,2002.

       The PPAR is basedon all relevant Bank andFunddocuments and on interviews
withBank and Fundstaff. A mission visited PakistaninOctober/November 2004 to
discuss performance with federal andprovincial officials who implemented the projects,

 Summary
 1.               Duringthe 1970sand 1980sPakistanmaintained ahighrate of economic
growth (over 6 percent), and the incidence o fpoverty fell steadily - from about 50
percent inthe early 1970sto around 20 percent by 1988. Bythe late 1980s,however,
Pakistan faced increasinglyserious obstacles to continued growth. Growing current
account and fiscal imbalances raisedthe level o f debt andundermined investor
confidence. A narrow tax basekept the tax/GDP ratio low while highdefense
expenditures, numerous subsidies, andgrowing interest payments created strong
pressures for continued deficit spending. Trade restrictions biased incentives against
exports. Inefficient state-owned enterprises dominated infrastructure, bankingandmuch
o f industrywhile controls andprice distortions limitedprivate sector growth.

2.       Since 1988,successive governments have triedto come to grips with Pakistan's
legacy o f fiscal weakness, poor policy, and institutionaldecay. Governments have
repeatedly introducedprograms o f stabilizationand endorsed deregulation, privatization,
and reforms intrade, banking, power, energy, andpublic finance. But political
instability, deep-rooted corruption, andweakened institutionshad left the country poorly
equipped to cope with a series o f shocks - some exogenous and some self-inflicted-
includingregional conflict, floods, droughts, and economic sanctions. The net results
were that, duringthe 199Os,growth slowed, the ratio ofdebt remained high, andpoverty
grew.

3.       Structural adjustment duringthe 1990swas a stop-go process. Some important
and lasting reforms didtake place but outcomes were mixed. Since 1999,however, the
Government haspursueda more consistent program o f stabilizationand structural
adjustment. (See Table 1 for selected macroeconomic indicators for the period 1992/93-
2003/04). One indicator o f the change i s that whereas Pakistan failed to complete any o f
its six IMFprograms during 1988-99, it completed the 2000 Stand-By Arrangement and
has remained on track throughout the PRGFprogram initiated in2001.

4.       This report evaluates four adjustment loans/credits to Pakistanduring the decade
1993-2002: the Public Sector Adjustment Loan/Credit (PSAL), the Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL), the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC I),      and the Second
StructuralAdjustment Credit (SAC 11).

5.      The main objective o fthe PSALwas to improve public sector management
through: better expenditure allocation andhigher revenue collection; deregulation o f the
economy andprivatizationo f government enterprises; and trade reform. The PSAL
helpedimprove fiscal management over aperiodo f fifteen months andhadsome success
inpromotingtrade reform, deregulation, andbetter development expenditure
management. But progress on stabilization, resource mobilization, civil service reform,
and governance was not sustained. Secondtranche release took place inDecember 1994
after a delay o f six months, but by July 1995 Pakistan was off track with the Fund. The
PSALhad no lasting impact on the main structural problem -the weak fiscal system.
The PSAL's objectives were substantially relevant to Pakistan's development challenges,
but efficacy was modest. Keyreforms oftax administrationandbroadening the tax base
were not achieved, leavingpublic finances susceptible to later shocks. Fears o f stop-go

                                                vi


 were fully realized, as were warnings about risks ofpoor governance underminingthe
 reform program. PSAL's outcome i s rated moderately unsatisfactory. The main net
 benefits of the PSAL were progress on trade liberalization andprivatization, cotton
 marketliberalization, andimprovements inPSDPcontrol andmonitoring. These
 achievements, though modest incomparison with original objectives, have proven(and
 are likely to remain) resilient to risk. Sustainability i s therefore rated as likely.
 Institutionaldevelopment i s rated as negligible. The fundamental strategy o f all parties to
 constrain the incoming government through second-tranche conditionality i s
 questionable: the conditions were too numerous and vague to be effective andmay have
 contributed to the new Government's lack o f ownership for the program. The
 Government complied more with the letter than the spirit o f conditionality. Overall, both
 Bank and Borrower performance are rated unsatisfactory.

 6.       The SAL's immediate (and overriding) objective was to helpPakistan overcome
 its external financing crisis (Pakistan was on the verge o f default to preferred creditors).
 Its medium-termobjective was to support fbrther reform infiscal and financial
 governance. The SAL played a crucial part inhelpingPakistanovercome its balance o f
payments crisis, but it did little to advance structural reform and the macroeconomic
 framework failed to hold. Eventually, reforms resumed andmacroeconomic policies
 improved, but only after the military takeover inOctober 1999. Although the relevance o f
 SAL's objectives was high,efficacywas modest. The operation helpedprevent default,
but satisfactory fiscal andmacro performance lasted only a few months andmost o fthe
 follow-up reforms were not implementeduntilafter a change o f Government. The
outcome i s rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Improvements inloan repayment have
beensustained and are likely to continue. Subsequent debt rescheduling and
improvements inmacro management have also reduced the threat o f default. Eventhough
debt service levels remainhigh, sustainability of these net benefitsi s rated likely.
Institutionalreform was negligible under the loan. Because o f the failure to implement
the reformprogram, Borrower performance is ratedunsatisfactory. The problems with
SALreflect alack ofbroad-based commitment inPakistan, not theprogramdesign; Bank
performance i s rated satisfactory.

7.       The objective o f SAC Iwas to helpmaintainthe macroeconomic stability needed
to support the implementationo f structural reforms grouped under the objectives (or
pillars) ofthe Government's new PovertyReductionStrategy: improving governance,
growthprospects and the delivery o f social services. The relevance of SAC Iobjectives
was substantial and the extent to which they were achieved (efficacy) was also
substantial. Progress was made inthe critical area o ftax reform and administration, and
the Government followed through inimplantingreforms on abroadfront. Important
exceptions were the power sector and social sector spending. Overall, outcome o f SAC I
i s rated satisfactory. The systemic nature o fmany o f the reforms, along with continued
monitoring and support by the Bank, make sustainability o fproject achievements likely.
Therewere promising institutionalreforms intax administration, public financial
management, andprice setting, but continuingresistance to change inthe power sector.
Overall institutionaldevelopment impact is rated modest. Performance o fboth the Bank
and the Borrower are ratedsatisfactory.

8.      The mainobjective of SAC I1was to support the implementationofthe I-PRSP,
with a particular focus on growth andemployment, governance, social protection, and
human development. Although immediate balance o fpayments assistancewas not an
objective o f SAC 11, it didprovide substantial longer-termassistance indebt management
byproviding US$500millionequivalent (about 0.7 percent o f GDP) on IDAterms.
Implementation o f SAC I1started strongly on the basis o fwell defined prior actions taken
before Board approval, but slowed down during elections inOctober 2002 and the
transition to a new government after the elections. Although the economic team
remained inplace and the new government continued to support reforms, the
implementationwas sufficiently delayed that the Bankdidnot process a third SAC as
planned. Incontrast with the mixedperformance andprotracted implementation o f
structural reforms, Pakistan's macro performance after SAC I1was strong-although          it i s
not clear how much o fthe improvement was due to SAC 11. The relevance o f SAC I1
objectives was substantial, but efficacy o f implementationwas modest, and the overall
outcome i s rated as moderately satisfactory. Sustainability o fnet project benefits i s rated
likely. SAC I1had important institutional objectives intax administration, public financial
management, civil service reform, procurement, and utilityrestructuringand regulation.
Overall institutional development impact i s rated modest. Both Bank and Borrower
performance are rated satisfactory.

9.      The main lessons from these loans are:

    0   A series ofone-tranche loans inaprogrammatic framework canbean effective
        instrumentto support reforms inacountrywith apoor track record. However,
        effectiveness o f a series o f one-tranche loans depends on a willingness to
        withhold lendinguntil a critical mass o fpreviously-agreed prior actions have been
        undertaken. The delay betweenthe SAL and the first SAC was particularly
        effective inthis respect.

   0    Complex or politically difficult sector reforms are best supported through
        dedicated sector operations. A multi-sector operation canplay only a secondary
        or facilitating role when dealing with institutionaldevelopment (as intax reform
        or civil service reform), deep-rooted reluctance to reform (as inpower), needfor
        specific funding to offset costs o f adjustment (as inbanking), or weak service
        delivery(as inhealthand education).

 1.       Introduction

  1.1     Duringthe 1970sand 1980sPakistanmaintained ahighrateofeconomic growth
 (over 6 percent), and the incidence o fpoverty fell steadily - from about 50percent inthe
 early 1970sto around 20 percent by 1988. Bythe late 1980s, however, Pakistanfaced
 increasingly serious obstaclesto continued growth. Growing current account and fiscal
 imbalances raisedthe level o f debt andunderminedinvestor confidence. A narrow tax base
 keptthe tax/GDP ratio low while highdefense expenditures, numerous subsidies, and
 growing interest payments createdstrong pressures for continued deficit spending. Trade
 restrictions biased incentives against exports. Inefficient state-owned enterprises
 dominated infrastructure, banking andmuch ofindustrywhile controls andprice distortions
 limitedprivate sector growth. Politicalappointments, low salaries, andcorruptionhad
 underminedgovernment institutions. Anddespitethe favorable impact of growthon
 povertyreduction, Pakistan's social indicators lagged behindthose o fmost other low-
 income countries.

 1.2      These macro imbalances and structural weaknessesprompted the Government to
 launch a medium-termstructural adjustment program inmid-1988. The program, which
 was supportedby the IMF, World Bank, andAsian Development Bank, aimed to put
 growth on a more sustainable path and address poverty and social concerns by redressing
macro imbalances and restructuring the roles o fthe private andpublic sectors.

 1.3      Since 1988 successive governments have triedto come to grips with Pakistan's
 legacy o f fiscal weakness, poor policy, andinstitutional decay. Governments have
repeatedly introducedprograms o f stabilization and endorsedderegulation, privatization,
 andreforms intrade, banking, power, energy, andpublic finance. Butpoliticalinstability,
deep-rooted corruption, andweakened institutions hadleft the countrypoorly equipped to
cope with a series o f shocks -some exogenous and some self-inflicted-includingregional
conflict, floods, droughts, and economic sanctions. The net results were that, duringthe
 1990s, growth slowed, the ratio o fdebt remainedhigh, andpoverty grew:

     0   Per capita GDP rose by less than 13 percent duringthe 1990s compared to over
         34 percent duringthe previous decade.

     0   The debt/GDP ratio hovered around 90 percent throughout the 1990s.

    0    The incidence o fpoverty rose steadily after 1988, reaching 32.1 percent in2001.

    0    Social indicators improved slowly or not at all. Net primary enrollment fell
         duringthe decade.

1.4      Structural adjustment duringthe 1990swas a stop-go process. Some important
and lasting reforms didtake place but outcomes were mixed. Since 1999, however, the
Government has pursueda more consistent program o f stabilization and structural
adjustment. (See Table 1for selected macroeconomic indicators for the period 1992/93 -
2003/04). One indicator o f the change i s that whereas Pakistanfailed to complete any o f
its six IMFprograms during 1988-99, it completed the 2000 Stand-By Arrangement and
has remained on track throughout the PRGF program initiated in2001.

      2.           Public SectorAdjustment Loadcredit (9/14/1993)

      Background and Overview

      2.1         During 1988-92 outcomes ofthe reformprogramlaunched in1988were mixed, in
      part due to political instability. (See Annex C for a timeline o fpolitical and other events).
      There was someprogress onprivatization, de-licensing o f industry, and deregulation, but
      weak performance on fiscal reform, with fiscal deficits averaging over 7 percent ofGDP.
      The Bankprovidedthree sector adjustment loans duringthis periodwhich hadmoderately
      successfuloutcomes overall. Inlate 1992, floods andblight o fthe cotton crop contributed
      to an economic crisis and fwther political instability. The growth rate fell, the fiscal deficit
     rose to over 9 percent of GDP, and gross foreign exchangereservesfell to less thantwo
     weeks o fimports. Followingtheresignation o fPrimeMinisterNawaz Sharifandthe

                                                       3


 President inJuly, 1993, MoeenQureshi took over as interimPrimeMinister, pending
 elections inOctober o fthat year. The interim Government took severalmeasuresto
 stabilize the economy andnegotiated a Stand-ByArrangement (SBA)with the IMFand the
 Public Sector Adjustment Loadcredit (PSAL) with the World Bank.

 2.2      The priorities ofthe Bank's country assistance strategy duringthis periodwere,
 first, to support structural adjustment, primarily by improvingpublic expenditure
 management and the enabling environment for the private sector, and second, to promote
 better social sector outcomes.' The PSALwas intendedto be the main instrument for
 achievingthe first goal and the Social Action Program(SAP) project was to bethe main
 instrument for social sector development. The overarching objective o fthe PSAL, as the
 name implies, was to improve public sector management through: better expenditure
 allocation and higher revenuecollection; deregulation o f the economy andprivatization
 o f government enterprises; andtrade reform. The PSAL and SAP were complementary
 inthe sense that betterpublic expenditure allocationandhigherrevenues would augment
 resources for social sector expenditure.

 2.3      The BankandFundprograms were also highly complementary. Measures taken
 duringJuly andAugust servedas prior actions for boththe PSALandFundprogram
 (which started off as an SBA inSeptember, 1993, andevolved into a US$1.4 billion
 Extended FundFacility/ Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility - ESAF/EFFin
February, 1994). The mainmeasuresincluded devaluation, anincrease ininterest rates,
reduction o f the maximum tariff by 28 percent, and energy and other price increases
 amountingto 0.7 percent o f GDP. Privatization o f 69 industrial units (out o f an ultimate
target o f 100 enterprises) duringFY91-93 was also considered to be a prior action under
the PSAL. The main stabilization target was to reduce the fiscal deficit by five
percentage points o f GDP inthree years. ThePSALpublic expendituremeasures
complemented this ambitious target.

2.4       Although resource transfer was clearly a factor inthe timing o f the operation, the
main consideration seems to have beento take advantage o f the interimGovernment's
tenure to negotiate a stabilizationandreform program (there hadbeenfive abortive
appraisal missions before the sixth successhl one inAugust)' and to tie the hands o fthe
successor elected government.

Design,Implementation,and Outcome

2.5       The operationprovided a loano fUS$l50 millionand a credit ofUS$lOO million
equivalent intwo equal tranches. The Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
provided cofinancingo fUS$150 million equivalent.


'Asdiscussed   inthe CAE (forthcoming), theBank's stated objectives were more complex and included
things like improving the environment, but these were the priorities.

  Originally, Pakistan was to have received a low-conditionality loan to offset the effects o f the Gulf War,
butthe war ended quickly and the case for low conditionality couldnotbe maintained. This was a matter
o f some resentment. Moreover, some inthe Government felt that the delay inloan processing meant
Pakistan got no credit for actions taken inearlier years.

                                               4


2.6      Therewere five specific conditions for secondtranche release:

       0   adoption o f a satisfactory macroeconomic framework for FY95 (inpractice
           linkedto the framework agreedbetweenthe new government andthe Fund);

       0   adoption o f an agreedPublic Sector Development Program(PSDP) for FY95;

       0   preparation o fplans for liquidating an agreedlist o fpublic sector industrial
           units;

       0   implementationo f an agreed action planto reform public administration; and

       0   increasing FY95 spending on basic social services under the SAP by at least 0.1
           percent o f GDP.

2.7      These five conditions were among 28 "actions to betaken by end-June 1994",
along with 15 "actions already taken". Inthe event, releaseo f the second tranche was
delayed untilDecember, 1994, but there was generally satisfactory progress up to the
final supervision missioninNovember 1994 on overall PSAL/ESAF/EFF
implementation.

2.8      The problem i s that this generally satisfactory progress was not sustained. There
were some significant accomplishments intrade reform (including abolitiono fexport
duties and import license fees and surcharges as well as tariff reduction), deregulation o f
cottonmarketing, and inimproving PSDP control andmonitoring, but implementation
was already acknowledged to have beenweak inseveral areas by the time o f ICR review,
including: resource mobilization(including cost recovery inirrigation and shortfalls in
tax collection and intax restructuring), civil service reform (little systemic reform and
reversals o f some staffreductions), and ingovernance (political interference indecisions
of autonomous agencies, continuedgrantingo f special exemptions and subsidies).
Subsequent budget actual figures showed that, while the allocationto basic social
services increased by 0.1 percent o f GDP, the increased allocation was not spent - actual
expenditure remained constant as a share o f GDP. Most importantly, a satisfactory
macro framework was not maintained. Although Pakistanwas still on track with the
Fund's ESAF/EFF at the end o f 1994whenthe secondtranche releasetook place, itwent
offtrack inJuly 1995. A new SBA was negotiated and approved inDecember, 1995, but
little progress was made infiscal deficit reduction, which the PSAL's complementary
structural reforms were supposedto support.

2.9      The ICRnoted a number o fweaknesses indesign and implementation, including:
narrow "ownership" o f the reforms within Pakistan; too many vague and un-prioritized
measures; and overemphasis onprivatizingor liquidating a givennumber o f enterprises
rather than on theprocess o fprivatizationandregulation. At a more general level, there
were three underlyingweaknesses:

     0   Unintended consequences. Some o f the successes o f specific reforms undermined
         other objectives. Most notably, although tariff reductionwas carriedout as
         plannedandhadthe intendedeffect of improving incentives, it also hadthe
         unintendedeffect o freducing government revenuebecausethe substitution o f
         domestic taxation took much longer than expected. Elimination o f the export tax

                                                  5


          on cottonalso benefited farmers, buttextile producers took much longer than
          expected to adjust. The problemwas not so much that designo f the program
          lackedcoherence, but rather that there were unrealistic expectations about how
          long some measures or adjustments would take to carry out.

     0   Failure to come to grips with institutional weakness. The main structural problem
         was (and still is) the weak fiscal system. Although the PSAL initiated some
         improvements inexpenditure management andtaxes, there was too much
         emphasis on specific measures (as with privatization) andtoo little attention paid
         to systemic or institutional change. A SAL can do little by itself to promote such
         change; this i s mainly a criticism o f failure to tackle the hndamentalproblem
         through other instruments. Inthe case o fpublic administrationreform, the Bank
         had done no prior ESW.The PSAL's conditionalitywas based on a government
         report which staff hadnot yet seen.

     0   Placing conditionality on a reluctant reformer. Tryingto tie the hands o f the
         incoming government through secondtranche conditionalitydidnot work very
         well or for very long. Such an approachmay work for specific stroke-of-the-pen
         actions, but not for complex processesthat require cooperation o f a willing and
         committed partner.
Ratings

 Outcome

2.10     The PSAL's objectives were substantially relevant to Pakistan's development
challenges, but efficacy was modest. The ICR gave an excellent overview o f design and
implementationo fthe operation. It also gave the benefit o f a doubt on outcome, which
was rated marginally satisfactory. IEGconcurred with that rating at the time. While there
were some lasting accomplishments intrade reform, cottonmarketing, andprivatization,
it is clear after the passageo fninemore years that some things that were thought to have
beenachieved at the time (such as increased expenditureon social programs) were not,
andthat neithermacro stabilizationnor fiscal improvements were sustained. Key
reforms o f tax administrationand broadening the tax base were not achieved, leaving
public finances susceptible to later shocks. Fears o f stop-go were fully realized, as were
warnings about risks ofpoor governance underminingthe reformprogram. Inretrospect,
outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Sustainability

2.11     Boththe ICR and IEGrated sustainability uncertainshortly after closing o f the
loan. I t i s now known that some o f the accomplishments were sustained, and that others
were not. Sustainabilityi s definedas "resilience to risk of the net benefits over time". The
main net benefits o fthe PSALwere progress on trade liberalization and privatization,
cottonmarket liberalization, and improvements inPSDP control andmonitoring. These


 The Borrowerdisagreeswith the rating(see Annex B). The policyimprovements that took place in2001-
02 were madeunder a newGovernment and with the support of newBank operations. Thesepolicy
changes are reflectedinthe ratings for SAC IandSAC11. The changescannotbe attributedto the PSAL.

                                               6


achievements, thoughmodest incomparison with original objectives, have proven (and are
likelyto remain) resilient to risk. Sustainability is therefore ratedas likely.

Institutional development impact

2.12    Institutional development i s rated as negligible (unchanged from the ICR and
previous IEGreview).

Bank and Borrower performance

2.13    The ICR evaluated components o f Bank and Borrower performance but gave no
overall rating. IEGrated overall Bankperformance as satisfactory, but gave no rating for
Borrower performance.

2.14    The identificationandpreparation stageswere lengthyand contentious, andthe
Bank inadvertently gave mixedmessages on the prerequisites for an adjustment program.
The ICR concluded that the main constraints to preparationwere onthe Government side,
but that bothparties' performance was deficient.

2.15    Final appraisal andnegotiations were characterized by close agreement between
Bank and Government views, with good Bank-Fund (and OECF) coordination. The
project design addressedrelevant issues but was flawed inhaving too manyun-prioritized
conditions and insufficient focus on tax reform. Nevertheless, the ICR concludedthat
overall Bank performance at this stage was satisfactory. The Government was criticized
for leaving too much o f the initiative for designto the Bank andFund. Inaddition,
however, the fundamental strategy o f all parties to constrain the incoming government
through second-tranche conditionalityi s questionable. The ICR concluded that this
provided a useful and timely "nudge" to action on a number o f fronts, but the conditions
were too numerous andvague to be effective andmay have contributedto the new
Government's lack o f ownership for the program.

2.16    Finally, implementationwas rated satisfactory by the ICR. Inretrospect,
however, implementationwas not as effective as it appearedat that time andthe
Government complied more with the letter than the spirit o f conditionality.

2.17    Overall, both Bank and Borrower performance are rated unsatisfactory.


3.      StructuralAdjustmentLoan(1/21/1999)

Background and Overview

3.1     The periodbetweenrelease o fthe second tranche o f the PSAL inDecember 1994
and approval o f the SAL inJanuary 1999 was difficult both economically and politically
for Pakistan. Growth o f GDP averaged only 3.3 percent during 1995-98, exports
fluctuated with no clear trend, and the fiscal deficit averaged over 7 percent o f GDP. In

                                                     7


 October 1996 the government o fBenazir Bhutto was dismissedon conuption charges'.
 The new government underNawaz Sharif embarked on an anti-conuption campaign and
 economic reform program, and inOctober 1997 reached agreement on a Policy
 FrameworkPaper (PFP) with the BankandFund. This underpinneda 3-year US$1.56
billionESAF/EFF arrangement with the IMFinOctober 1997; a US$250 million Bank
 Sector Adjustment Loanwith the Bank (and an equivalent amount o f cofinancing from
 Japan's OECF) inDecember 1997; and a CapitalMarket Development loan o f US$250
millionwith ADB (plus an equivalent amount o f cofinancingfrom Export Import Bank
 o f Japan) inJanuary 1998. The reforms and extraordinary support helpedovercome a
 severe foreign exchange crisis andbeganto promote economic recovery.

 3.2      Recovery abruptly halted after Pakistan tested a nuclear device inMay 1998.
This was widely condemned andmajor industrialcountries imposedeconomic sanctions,
including oppositionto any new lendingby international financial institutions (IFIs)
 except as neededto meet basic humanneeds. Sanctions ledto severe balance o f
payments problems. Despite tax increases, spendingcuts, import restrictions, and
accumulation o fUS$1.7 billioninarrears, reserves fell by nearlyUS$1 billionto US$400
million (weeks o f imports) inearly December. InNovember 1998 the Government
reached agreement with the IFIs on a new program o f stabilizationandreforms to be
supported by the SAL, fast-disbursing loans from the ADB, and continuedpurchases
underthe ESAF/EFFarrangement withtheFund.

3.3      The SAL'Smedium-termobjective was to support further reform infiscal and
financial governance. Its immediate (and overriding) objective was to help Pakistan
overcome its external financing crisis. Pakistan was on the verge o f default to preferred
creditors. The IMF could only go to the Board for continuationo f the ESAF/EFF if
Pakistan's arrears to all preferredcreditors (US$400 million) could be cleared. A Fund
prograd hadto be inplace to pave the way for Paris and London Club debt rescheduling.
Pakistan therefore neededup-front external assistanceto prevent financial meltdown.

Design,Implementation,andOutcome

3.4      The SALprovided a US$350millionIBRDloanto be disbursedina single
tranche. The stated objectives were to helpPakistan overcome its external financing
crisis and to restore investors' confidence and creditworthiness by supporting a major
programo freform to improve fiscal and financial governance. The SAL was the second
inaproposedseries ofBank-supported adjustment loans, buildingonthe BankingSector
Adjustment Loan approved inNovember 1997, with emphasis on deepening reforms in
banking, energy, and taxation. (A Power Sector Adjustment Loan was projectedto
follow, perhaps as early as June 1999, but this never materialized.) It was expected that
the reforms supported by this operation and further anticipated follow up reforms, would
lead to: (a) a banking systemthat i s largely inprivate hands, operating under banking
regulations and prudentialnorms that meet internationalstandards; (b) a financially
viable energy sector with a growing role for private investors, with independent
regulatoryauthorities; (c) an autonomous, efficient and equitable tax administration that

progressively raises the tax to GDP ratio bybroadening the tax base and improving
 enforcement; and (d) an expenditure policy that subjects public spendingto rigorous
 appraisal and spendingceilings.

 3.5    Prior actions for the loan (see Annex C for complete list) included:

    0   Macroeconomicframework. Agreement with the Bank and Fundon a framework
        for deficit reduction.

    0   Banking. Administrative steps to accelerate loan recovery; improvement inthe
        collateralforeclosure system.

    0   Power. Introduce legislationto allow for WAPDA restructuring; implement
        agreed framework for resolving disputes with IndependentPower Producers;
        implement loss and theft reductionprogram; clear up government arrears to
        WAPDA; ensure that regulatory authority (NEPRA) is fully operational.

    0   Natural gas. Recovery o f overdues; introductiono f legislation for regulatory
        authority.

        Taxation. Recover tax arrears (specific target); submit legislationto create
        Pakistan RevenueAuthority (PRA); increase number o fregisteredtaxpayers and
        tax tribunals.

    0  Public expenditure. Reduce size o f PSDP andprotect core programs; reduce size
        and composition o fnon-budgetary PSDP; ensure adequate funding o f SAP.

3.6    The SAL achieved its main short-term objective, which was to overcome
Pakistan's balance o fpayments crisis andprevent default. Up-front financing from the
SALpermittedthe IMFprogramto continue and subsequentdebt rescheduling to take
place. Prior actions under the SAL also helpedreduce the fiscal deficit as the
Government met or exceededall tax and arrears collectiontargets. With respect to
structural reform, the most significant accomplishment was the creation inthe power
sector o fnew corporatized entities for generation, transmission, and distributionunder a
newregulatory authority, thoughfollow-up implementationhasbeenslow. Therewas
also progress insettlingsome (but not all) IPP disputes. Finally, implementation o fprior
actions inthe bankingsector represented a modest step forward ina reform program
mainly carried out - slowly but effectively -inother sector-specific operations.

3.7    Most o f the SAL'Sreform objectives were not achieved. Legislation on gas
regulation and creation o f the PRA were submittedto the National Assembly, but were
not enacted. Measures to restore WAPDA's financial viability were not fully
implemented, andthere was no prospect of apower sector adjustment loanbeingfeasible.
Intax administration, the targetsfor identifyingnewtaxpayers were met,butreformof
tax administrationdidnot take place and the tax/GDP ratio improved only temporarily. In
public expenditure, agreed cuts inthe PSDP were unevenandpartial. Spendinginmany
low-priority projects andprograms was close to the original allocationwhereas spending
on the highpriority core program fell short o f the original allocationby as much as 10
percent.

                                                      9


 3.8      Pakistan's fiscal effort and reform implementationslowed after early 1999. By
 September 1999the IMFprogramwent offtrack for lack ofprogress inimplementing
 fiscal reforms. It later emergedthat the Government hadbeenmisreporting fiscal data
 since the early 1990s and that the fiscal deficit was larger than previously estimated*.

 3.9      Insummary, the SAL playedacrucialpart inhelpingPakistanovercome its
 balance o fpayments crisis, but it did little to advance structural reform and the
 macroeconomic framework failed to hold. Eventually, reforms resumedand
 macroeconomic policies improved, but only after the military takeover inOctober 1999.

 3.10    From the beginning there were questions about the designo f the operation, or
 whether it should go forward at all. The Region's claim that Pakistan's performance
 merited a highbase case designation (a prerequisite for this operation) was questionable.
 At the Board discussion ofthe loan, six speakers abstainedfrom voting on the grounds
 that Pakistan had yet to demonstrate that its commitment to reform was irreversible. The
proposal for a single tranche operation was also controversial. A notewas circulatedby
 several boardmembersproposingphased-in support through a tranched operation. Bank
 Staff acknowledged that the risks o f going aheadwere high,but argued that the risks o f
doing nothingwere evenhigher. A default would be very disruptiveand create hardship
 for the poor. Staff also argued that a series o f simple- tranche loans would mitigate the
risk ofpolicyreversalandineffect act likeamulti-tranche loan.

3.11 The role o fthe Bank inproviding short-term balance o fpayments (BOP) support
was also anissue. Short-term BOP support is the mandate o fthe Fund. Inthis case,
however, the Fundcouldnot complete its review nor extend fbrther support unless Pakistan
cleared its arrears, despite Pakistan's compliance with the Fundprograminother respects.
The SALwas the only feasible source o fshort-term BOPfinance available. Giventhe
exceptional circumstances andthe fact that Bank support was undertaken inclose
collaboration with the Fund, andthat it openedthe way for bothFundfinancing and
bilateraldebt rescheduling, short-term BOP financing through the SAL wasjustifiable.

3.12     Much o f the case for the SAL hingedon the unknownconsequences o f default.
Would default have been the calamity that was feared? Would it have ledto chaos, more
political instability, andhardshipsfor the poor -or would it have provoked an earlier
change o f government? Itwas reasonable for the Bank to take the risk o f going forward
with the loan. Nevertheless, the outcome was very mixed. The S A Lhelpedavoid an
imminent train wreck andkept the economy and reform programheaded inthe right
direction. But forward progress soon stalled and the SAL failed to remove obstacles
which could lead to necessary changes further down the line.

3.13    Could the program have been designedto promote a more favorable outcome?
The Bankwas supporting what was said to be ahome-grownprogram ofreforms, but
commitment was Iimitedto a fairly narrow range o f officials. Identifyingthe underlying
problem as one o f governance was perceptive. Corruption and vestedinterests-and                    a
broader culture o fnon-payment-affected            public utilities, banks, andtax collection. The


 The Borrower comments that this statement is out ofplace (see Annex B). The statement i s intended to
show that Pakistan was further off track than thought at the time.

                                                    10


 proposed solutions included ad hoc measures and proposals for longer term institutional
 change like that embodied inregulatory and organizational reform. However, the reform
 program was modest and lacking ina sense o f urgency and only the ad hoc measures
 were implemented.

 3.14    Mightthe Bankmighthaveusedthe crisis to force moredrastic change, Le. should
 the Bankhave imposed stronger conditionality? Itis true that the prior actions were modest
 andthat most o fthe revenue andcost recoverytargets were exceeded. Itdoesnot appear,
 however, that these targets were set knowing that they hadalready beenmet. Staff involved
 inpreparation anddesign statedthat the targetswere set inJune, not atnegotiations in
 November. Moreover we haveno evidence that the loanwas motivatedprimarilyby
 considerations o f defensive lending (to finance repayment to the BankandFund) rather than
 the statedrationale o fpreventing severe consequencesto Pakistanandproviding a breathing
 space for reforms to take holdandimprove the country's creditworthiness. Rather than
 impose its ownprogram through stronger conditionality the Bankchose to support the
 Government's reformprogram. This weaker concept o fconditionality is normally abetter
 guide for Bankoperations inthe sense that it entails less risko fnon- performance. Inthe
 event, however, that weaker standardo fconditionality failedbecause the Government was
unable to follow through with legislativeapproval o fstructured reforms. It i s unlikely that a
multi-tranche operation would havebeenmore successful. The logic o fa series o fone-
tranche operations is that succeedingprograms only go forward when agreed actions under a
previous adjustment loan havebeen fullymet inspirit. This shouldmeanthat while it may

3.15     Inbrief, the SALdidn't succeed, butthiswas due to lack o fbroad-based

Outcome

3.16     The I C R rated outcome satisfactory. IEG's earlier desk review downgraded the
rating to marginally satisfactory. We have rated outcome as moderately unsatisfactory.
Although the relevance o f the objectives was high, efficacy was modest. The operation
helped prevent default, but satisfactory fiscal and macro performance lasted only a few
months andmost o f the follow-ups reforms were not implemented untilafter a change o f

4.       StructuralAdjustment Credit (6/12/2001)

Background and Overview

4.1      After the previous Government's reform program stalled inmid-1999 with
important parts o f the 1999 S A L program unimplemented, there was a pause inBank
lending. The Fundalso decided not to negotiate a new program after suspending the
ESAF/EFF program in September 1999. As Pakistan had failed to complete any o f its
programs with the Fundduringthe period 1988-99, the Fundinsisted that the new
Government establish a strong track record before becoming eligible for any new
arrangement. A new IMFprogram (a 10-month, non-concessional SBA) was approved
only inNovember 2000.

4.2      The new Government was committed to far-reaching political and economic
reforms. It focused on reviving the economy, improving governance (especially reducing
corruption), and devolving power to lower levels o f government. The Government
assembled a strong economic team, including technocrats andPakistanis working in
prominent positions abroad. There was a sense of urgency inpromoting its program, as
elections were scheduled for October, 2002.

4.3      Despite a severe drought, adverse terms o f trade, and the absence of support from
the Bank and the Fund, the new Government made substantial progress in stabilizing the
economy and resuming structural reforms. The fiscal and current account deficits were
reduced, disputes with the IPPs were finally resolved, more predictable market-based
pricing policies for oil products were introduced, banking reforms continued, and the Gas

                                              12


 Regulatory Authority Act was enacted. The Pakistan RevenueAuthority was not
 established, but some reforms o f the Central Board o fRevenuewere initiated.

 4.4     Inthe six months prior to the SAC, Pakistanmaintained agenerally goodtrack
 recordo fmacroeconomic management underthe SBA and met all major targets except
 for revenue and foreign exchange reserves. The former shortfall reflected slow GDP
 growth due to drought and, as inthe past, slower than anticipated improvements intax
 administration. The shortfall inreaching the reserve target reflectedadverse terms o f
trade. Despite the SBA and new debt rescheduling with the Paris Club inJanuary 2001,
 foreign exchange reserves had fallenbelow three weeks o f imports by May 2001.
Pakistan's fragile external payments obviously providedpart o fthe motivation for
renewedadjustment lendingbythe Bank.

4.5     Although the Bank approved no new loans between June 1999 and April 2001,
the Bank, Fund, andADB were all engagedinanalytical work andpolicy dialogue with
the Government. This dialogue formed the basis for renewedlendinginsupport o fthe
PovertyReductionStrategy developed by the Government duringthis period.

4.6     InaCAS ProgressReportaccompanying thepresentation ofthe SAC to the
Board, the Bank reiterated its strategy o fusinga series o f one-tranche operations. The
one-tranche disbursementstrategy was seen as a way for Pakistan to build a credible
track recordwhile giving the Bank flexibility to respond to policy reversals. The SAC
was to be the first ina new series o f one-tranche operations and was linked to ongoing
andplanned operations, includingthe Improvementto FinancialReporting andAuditing
Project (PIFRA), the Banking Sector Restructuring andPrivatizationProject (BSRPP),
and the Fund's SBA.

4.7     The objective o f the SAC was to help maintainthe macroeconomic stability
neededto support the implementationo f structural reforms. More specifically, the Credit
was to support an array o fmeasures grouped under the objectives (or pillars) o f the
Government's new PovertyReduction Strategy:

    0   Improving governance -tax reform, devolution, decentralization, improved
        financial management, civil service reform, and public access to information.

    0   Strengthening thefoundations for economic growth -power, oil, and gas pricing,
        regulatoryreforms, and privatization.

    0   Improving delivery of social services -by strengtheningleadership, improving
        incentives influencing delivery o f services and transition from provincial-basedto
        district-based delivery o f services.
Design,Implementation,and Outcome

4.8     The SAC provided an IDA credit o fUS$350 million equivalent disbursedinone
tranche.

4.9     The Government took the following actions which were deemedto beprior actions
for the SAC (see Annex D for a complete list o fprior actions andrelatedmeasures):

                                             13


Improving governance

   0   Extended coverage o f the general sales tax or GST (actually a value added tax) to
       include services previously subject to excise taxes.

   0   Established fiscal monitoring committees to reconcile expenditure data at both the
       federal and provincial levels. The target for reconciliation at the federal level was
       six months, which was met for first semester o f FY00-01.

   0   Adopted a revised, modern accounting system for integrated financial management.

   0   Issuedordinance to separate public accounting and auditing systems.

   0   Established ad hoc federal and provincial Public Accounts Committees (PACs)
       and opened up federal PAC hearings to the press.
       Amended the FederalPublic Service Commission (FPSC) ordinance to increase
       independence andjurisdiction o f FPSC.
Achieving broad-based growth

   0   Issued a Privatization Ordinance to provide for increase transparency and
       settlement o f disputes.

   0   Liberalized petroleum products marketing and introduced a mechanism for
       quarterly adjustment o fprices.

   0   Announced new gas pricing framework providing for links to international oil
       prices and phasing out o f subsidies except for fertilizer and a consumer lifeline
       rate.

   0   Revisedpower tariff and set a formula for periodic revision.

   0   Reduced or eliminated differential excise tariffs to bringdown the maximum
       effective tariffto 35 percent (except for 11products).
Human development

   0   Developed an education sector reform program and action planfor the federal,
       provincial, and territorial governments.

   0   Provincial and territorial governments introduced a competitive selection system
       for new teachers and started making appointments under a school-based or area-
       specific contract system.

   0   Consolidated investment programs to complete ongoing works.

   0   Introducedprograms at the provincial and territorial levels to monitor and
       discipline teacher andhealth staff absenteeism.
4.10  All the mainprior actions were implemented before Board discussion andmost
were sustained and extended inthe following year. Implementation o f the SAC-
supportedprogram bolstered Pakistan's track record and, along with successful
completion o f the SBA inSeptember 2001 and a favorable review o f Pakistan's I-PRSP
inNovember, helpedpave the way for a three year US$1.25 billionPRGFwiththe Fund

 and debt reschedulingwith the Paris Club inDecember 2001. The events o f September
 11,2001,hadbothnegative andpositive effects on Pakistan. Onthe one hand, the
resulting uncertainty and war inneighboring Afghanistanlimited the supply response to
reforms andmade it more difficult to attain revenue and other targets. On the other hand,
 inthe aftermathofSeptember 11,bilateral aid andremittancesbothincreased
 substantially, easing the balances o f payments constraint.

4.11 Important achievements o fthe SAC prior actions andfollow-up measures
included:

        Taxpolicy and administration. The GST was extendedto services, provinces
       began to tax agricultural income and an ordinance for a simpler and more
        equitable income tax was issued. These and follow-up measures under SAC I1
       helped raise the tax/GDP ratio from 12.9 percent in2000/01 to 13.2 percent in
       2001/02 and 13.8 percent in2002/03.
       Publicfinancial management. Fiscal monitoring committees helped improve the
       timeliness o f expenditure reporting; accounting and auditing functions were
       separated; the new accounting model was implemented with help from the
       ongoing PIFRA project; after some delay PACs were established and opened to
       the press at the federal level.
       Civil service reform. Measuresto strengthen the FPSC helped improve
       recruitment based on merit and facilitated removal o f over 5,000 inefficient or
       corrupt staff.
       Tradereform and deregulation. The maximum tariffwas lowered to 30 percent
       andthe number o f slabs reducedto four; trade inagricultural products was
       liberalized further; no new exemptions for income taxes, customs duties or GST
       are being granted, and old exemptions are being phased out.
       Petroleum sector. Retail prices were either deregulated completely or adjusted
       quarterly inline with international prices. Significant subsidies and other
       distortions remained, but subsidies to refineries were made transparent andwere
       provided through the budget.
       Social sectors. A start was made on implementing the Education Reform
       Strategy, including initiatives at the provincial level for better recruitment,
       training, and reduction o f absenteeism o f teachers.
4.12   Inadditionto these reforms promotedunder the SAC, there was substantial
progress infinancial sector reform, supported separately under the B S W P o f October
2001 a




4.13   There were also some significant shortcomings infollow-up implementation o f
the SAC:

       Privatization. Although the Government continuedpreparations to bringa
       number o f State Operated Enterprises (SOE) to the point o f sale, only one SOE
       was fully privatized inthe year following the SAC. This was due to uncertainty

                                              15


        inthebusinessenvironment after September 11andwas largelyoutside
        Government control.

     0  Power sector. After completion o fthe prior actions, reforms slowed for several
        months. Little progress was made, therefore, inWAPDA's restructuring or
        financial position.

     0  Natural gas. The price increase madeprior to SAC approval was maintained but
        the semi-annual adjustment scheduledfor September 2001 was delayed until
        March 2002. Implementationo f a new well-head pricing agreement for the state-
        owned Pakistan Petroleum Limited(PPL) was also postponed untilMarch2002,
        whenthe Cabinet agreed (supported by SAC 11)to aninitial increase o f 50 percent
        and a five-year phase-in to international prices.

     0  Social sector spending. Spendingon education was significantlybelow budgeted
        levels inFYO1-02 and the budget allocation for several high-priority health
        programs fell short o f agreed levels untiladditional donor financing was made
        available after September 11.
 4.14   Progress under the SAC was broadly satisfactory. The main reasons for improved
 performance compared to previous operations under review were stronger Government
 commitment and better program design.

 4.15   The Government was more fully committedto reformthanprevious governments,
 was more securely inpower, and had a longer time horizon. For reasons o fboth
pragmatism andpride, the Government was particularly determined to improve
Pakistan's reputation for good management, good governance, and follow-through on
reforms.

4.16    The SAC program design was basedon stronger, andbetter-defined, prior actions.
Conditionalitywas backedup byprior ESW and policy dialogue. It also helpedthat there
was some room for maneuveron the timing o fthe SAC. The balance of payments crisis
was not so severe that the Bank was forced to choosebetween timely support and
substantive up-front actions. Finally, the SAC designincludedindicative actions for a
follow-up program. This not only provided a goodbasis for designingSAC 11,but also
provided an incentive for following through on implementationo f SAC I.

were achieved (efficacy) was also substantial. Progresswas made inthe critical area o f
tax reform and administration, and the Government followed through inimplanting
reforms on a broad front. Important exceptions were the power sector, inwhich there are
strong vested interests opposed to reform, and social sector spendinginwhich weak

5.      Second StructuralAdjustment Credit (6/11/2002)

Background and Overview

5.1     Inthe year between approvals ofthe first andsecond SACS,Pakistan's external
circumstance changed dramatically. The events o f September 11just three months after
approval o f SAC Ijeopardized the economic recoverywhich was underwayinresponse to
the Government's reformprogram. GDP growth hadbeenrecoveringdespite a severe
drought and was on course to rise from 2.6 percent in2000/01 to 4.0 percent in2001/02.
After September 11prospects for foreign direct investment, privatization, and export
growth were reduced. Growth o f exports (incurrent U S dollars) fell from 9.1 percent in
2000/01 to 2.3 percent in2001/02 and actual GDPMP growth in2001/02 was 2.8 percent
with knock-on effects on budget revenues. Bothexternal andinternal security deteriorated
after September 11as Pakistanwas inevitably affected bythe war inAfghanistan, and
tensions with Indiarose. Military expenditure, which hadbeenfalling, increased by
0.4 percent o f GDP.

5.2     Despite the external shock, Pakistan's macro management and structural reform
program stayed on course. Based on Pakistan's successful completiono fthe SBA before
September 11and presentation o f an I-   PRSPwhich was reviewedfavorably inthe Bank-
FundJSA, the Fundapproved athree year US$1.25 billionPRGFprograminDecember
2001. The international community also helpedoffset the shocks through increased aid
and debt rescheduling and relief. Grant aid increased from 1.2 percent ifGDP in200/01
to 2.3 percent o f GDP in2001/02. The Paris club agreed to a debt rescheduling with
some implicit debt relief.

5.3     Several donor countries followed up with debt swaps or outright debt relief. The
net effect was to provide substantial liquidityrelief for Pakistan for a three-year period,
but overallexternal debt indicators remained above HIPC levels of sustainability.

5.4    The second SAC was unusual inthree respects. First, its timingwas distinctive. It
was the first o f the four operations under review that took placewhen Pakistan was not
facing an external liquidity crisis. Reserves were above three months o f imports and

                                                 17


continuedto increase. Second, SAC I1followed a periodo f sustained goodperformance.
Pakistan had successfilly completed its first programwith the Fund(the SBA) in 13 years,
was on track with the PRGF, and had successfully completed and sustained most o f the
structural reforms agreedunder the first SAC. Third, the SAC I1program had largelybeen
pre-definedunder indicative targets set duringSAC 1negotiations. Itwas the first follow-
on operation ina series o fprogrammatic one-tranche operations to be carriedout as
planned.

5.5       Although immediate balance o fpayments assistancewas not an objective o f SAC 11,
it didprovide substantial longer-termassistanceindebt management byprovidingUS$500
million equivalent (about 0.7 percent o f GDP) on IDAterms. The program document argued
that the loan size was justified because exceptional financing requirementswould remain
highfor another two years, notwithstandingprojected flows ofbilateral grant assistance.
The size o fthis operation remains debatable; however SAC I1was followed by two
provincial SACSapproved inJuly 2002.

5.6       SAC I1was presented along with a new CAS, the first since 1995. The CAS
proposed three main instruments to support the Government's I-PRSP: analytical work
and other non-lending services to support knowledgetransfer andpolicy dialogue;
policy-based fast disbursinglendingat both the federal andprovinciallevels; and
programmatic sector and investmentlendingto improve economic infrastructureand
delivery o f social services. SAC I1was seen as the main instrument for Bank support o f
the I-PRSP and medium-term reform agenda over the following year.

Design,implementationand outcome

5.7      The second SAC provided an IDA credit o fUSWOOmillion equivalent disbursed
inone tranche, Themainobjective ofthe operationwas to support theimplementation
o f the I-PRSP which focuses on:

     0   Engendering Growth by addressing the debt problem through fiscal consolidation
         andbuildingthe base for faster export growth; creating fiscal space for social
         sector and infrastructure by increasing revenuemobilization and changingthe
         compositiono f expenditure; strengtheningthe business environment by
         improvingthe credibility o f government policies, removing distortions and
         implementingpower sector reforms.

     0   Improving governance through tax administrationreforms, devolution o fpowers
         to newly established local governments; improvedpublic finance management,
         andcivil service reforms.

     0   Improving human development by strengthening delivery and finding o f social
         services.

     0  Improving socialprotection and employment opportunities through access to
         credit, redistribution o fpublic lands, implementationo f communitybased
         infrastructure programs, and direct cash transfers to the most needy.
5.8      Implementationo f the program started strongly on the basis o fwell definedprior
actions taken before Board approval, but slowed down during elections inOctober 2002
andthe transition to anew government after the elections. Although the economic team

                                                    18


 remained inplace and the new government continued to support reforms, the
 implementation was sufficiently delayed that the Bank didnot process a third SAC as
planned'. A Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) approved inSeptember 2004
 continues Bank support for reforms andthe Government's PRSP. The PRSC is intended
 to be the first ina new series o fone-tranche development policyloans.

 5.9     The main policy measures supported through SAC11fell into the first two
 categories, Annex Dpresents a detailed list o fprior actions andrelated measures along
with indicators of follow-up actions intendedto be supportedunder future operations.

 5.10    The main actions under SAC I1included the following:

      0  Trade reform and deregulation. The maximum tariff was reduced to 30 percent
         on all remaining products before the Boardandto 25 percent after the Board;
         CBR cleared the backlog o f GST refunds to exporters and introduced measures
         for quicker and more transparent refunds infuture; price controls on 64 o f 66
         previously-controlled products were removed; and there was some progress on
         follow-up actions to rationalize labor laws and outdated industrial regulations.

      0  Petroleum sector. Petroleumproduct price adjustments inline with international
         prices began to be made fortnightly rather than quarterly. With the exception o f a
         brief lapse duringMarch-May 2002, these adjustments have continued regularly
         even inthe face o f changing international oil prices.

     0   Taxpolicy and administration. An action planfor fundamental reform o f Central
         Board o f Revenue (CBR) was introduced; integrated large taxpayer and medium
         taxpayer units were set up inKarachi and Lahore, respectively; and GST was
         extended to agricultural inputs including fertilizer.

     0   PublicJinancial management. Provincial as well as federal Public Accounts
         Committees (PACs) opened up their proceedings to the press; separation o f
         accounting and auditing begun under SACIwas advanced with the help o f
         PIFRA; andreconciliation o f accounts improved from almost nila few years ago
         to between 50 and 100 percent (with federal reconciliations at the highend).

     0   Civil service reform. Pay andpensionreform has been implemented through
        revision o f pay scales and rationalization o f pensionbenefits. N e w pay scales
        restored 75 percent o f lost value after 1994, folded many allowances into salaries
        and resulted ina modest decompression. The federal public service commission
        (FPSC) was given responsibility for recruitment of all middle and higher level
        professionals, but the cabinet overturned a provisiono f the FSPC amendment
        ordinance suggested by SACIwhich provided for the FPSC to recruit grades 11- 16.
        Social Sector Spending. Increasedresources for education were allocated for
        lower level governments. Expended or new special healthprograms were
        launched for LadyHealthworkers, immunization o f children, TB control and
        H N / A I D S prevention.

'TheBorrower    comments that the reasons for delay should be mentioned (see Annex B). The mainreason
was the need to form a coalition Government with the lengthy bargainingprocess that such a process
entails.

                                               19


 5.11   Significant progress continued to bemade inbankingsector reform as well. Three
 nationalized commercial bankswere restructured (including branch closures andvoluntary
 retirement o f 8,000 staff), one was privatizedandthe non-performing NationalFinance
 Development Corporation was closedthrough amergerwiththe state-ownedNational
 Bank o fPakistan. Although these measureswere includedinSAC I1conditionality, the
 conditions were redundantas reforms were carried out under other dedicated operations.

 5.12   As inthe case of SACIthere weremixedresults and some significant shortcomings
 inimplementation, inmanyofthe sameareas as inSACI.

        Privatization. Several large utilities andbanks moved forward to the point o f
        expressions o f interest and pre-qualificationbut inthe year following approval o f
        SAC I1only one bank was privatized, largelybecauseo f the difficult international
        environment. However, as o f early 2005 another bank has been privatized and
        the Government has successfully divested shares o f several state corporations to
        domestic investors.

     0  Power sector. Corporatization continued to proceed slowly and almost no
        progress has beenmade inimprovingthe sector's financial performance by
        reducing system losses (still about 25 percent) due to inefficiency andtheft o f
        power, nor to improvingbill collection. The electricity price set byNEPRA was
        scaled back 20 percent after a request for reviewby the Government. While
        technically within the terms o f the law, this may have compromised NEPRA's
        independence and it contributed to shortfalls inrevenue inFY03. In2002/03
        budgetary subsidiesto the power sector amounted to 1.6percent o f GDP.

     0  Natural Gas. Price adjustments for both consumers and producers have been
        inconsistent. Three o f seven scheduled semi-annual price adjustments have been
        missed, subsidieshavenot beenphasedout andreform o fthe household lifeline
        subsidy(whose limit is set too highand consequently benefits mainly the non-
        poor) has yet to take place.

     0  Procurement reform. An independentPakistan Procurement Regulatory
        Authority (PPRA) was established as a prior actionunder SAC 11. Staffing o f the
        new unit and formulation ofnewprocurement rules were very slow, but in2004
        the Government gazettednewpublic procurement rules which are to be followed
        byall federal departments and agenciesandbypublic sector corporations.

5.13    Most o fthe structural reform accomplishments o f SAC I1were the result o fprior
actions before Board approval, Most lapses inperformance and other shortcomings
occurred later duringthe run-upto elections inOctober 2002 and the subsequent
formation o f a new government. The Bank reacted appropriately to the slowdown in
implementation(following the logic o f a series o f one-tranche operations) by not going
aheadwith a scheduled third SAC. After implementation improved, the Bankprocessed
a PRSC insupport o f the full PRSP prepared by the Government.

5.14    Incontrastwiththemixedperformance andprotractedimplementation ofstructural
reforms, Pakistan's macro performance after SAC I1was strong. Growth o f GDP and
exports accelerated, reserves increased, the fiscal deficit excluding grants fell below 5 percent

 o f GDP in2002/03 for the first time in25 years, the share o f social expenditure increased and
 the debt burdenwas reduced. It is not clear how mucho f the improvement was due to SAC
 11,however, nor isit clear that increasedsocial sector expenditure hashadanappreciable
 impact on poverty. Improvements intax administration andpublic expenditure management
 played a role inbetter fiscal performance but much o fthe improvement inthe foreign
 exchange position and other macro indicators reflected increasedbilateral aid anddebt
 reschedulinghelief, a large increase inremittances, andlower interest payments (due to good
 internal management domestic debt andlower international interest rates). Nevertheless the
 SAC I1operation did contribute to improvingPakistan's creditworthiness directly (through
 provision o f IDA finds) and indirectly byhelping to sustain Pakistan's reformprogram.

 Ratings

 Outcome

 5.15    The ICR rated outcome satisfactory. The initial IEGreview reduced this to
 moderately satisfactory because o f numerous shortcomings. Inthe time that has elapsed
 since previous reviews it appears that the overall reformprogram has resumed. However,
 implementation has beenprotracted andreform inthe power sector has remained
unsatisfactory. The relevance o f the project objectives was substantial, but efficacy o f
 implementation was modest. This review rates overall outcome as moderately
satisfactory?

Sustuinability

5-16    Sustainability o f net project benefits is rated likely.

Institutional Development Impact

5.17    SAC I1had important institutional objectives intax administration, public
financial management, civil service reform, procurement, and utility restructuring and
regulation. Overall institutional development impact is rated modest.

Bank and Borrower Performance

5.18    Both Bank and Borrower performance are ratedsatisfactory.

Overall Progress

6.1     The four operations under review were the main instruments o f Bank support for
Pakistan's growth andreform for over a decade. Although emphasis varied from loan to
loan, certain broad objectives were common to all operations: finding a medium-term
(and sometimes immediate) external financing gap; improving public sector management

 and allocation o f resources; andpromoting a better climate for private sector
 development. H o w successful were these operations inachieving these and other more
 specific objectives?

 6.2     Balance ofpayment support and debt management. Avoiding default was initself
 a significant accomplishment for Pakistan over the decade afier 1993. Pakistanmanaged
 to overcome or muddle through recurring balance o fpayments crises, external and
 internal shocks, and HIPC-like debt levels without financial meltdown. Bank assistance
 through these loans played a part inthis achievement, but the following observations are
 pertinent:

     0   Bank assistance was always part o f a Fund-led effort andwas normally secondary
         inimportance. The exceptionwas the 1999 SAL inwhich Bankparticipationwas
         a critical link inpreventing default.

     0   Structural reforms supported bythe Bankwere meant to help prevent future
         balance o f payments crises. The first two operations essentially failed to achieve
         necessary structural changes to reduce the likelihood o f future crises. It was only
         after first the Fundandthen the Bankheldup financing until strong prior actions
         were taken that overall macro performance improved.

     0  Under SAC Iand 11, the debt/GDP ratio fell from 108 percent in2000/01 to 84
        percent in2003/04. This was mainly attributable to bilateral support and good
         internal debt management, though Bank-supported trade reforms also helped.

6.3      Creatingjscal space. A major objective o f these four operations has beento
increase fiscal space by raising the share o f tax revenue and reducing certain categories o f
expenditure: interest costs, wastefbl development projects and subsidies for non-poor
consumers and for loss-making enterprises. (Defense spending was outside the Bank's
purview). Throughout the 1990s tax revenue remained stuck at around 13 percent o f
GDP (low incomparison to other countries at a similar income level), while defense and
interest payments claimed about 70 percent o f tax revenue. (See Table 2 and Figures 1,2,
and 3). This squeezed out development and social sector expenditure andmade it
difficult to cut the fiscal deficit. Attempts to cut the budget deficit infact resulted in
reductions inPSDP expenditure from 5.2 percent o f GDP in 1993/94 to 2.6 percent in
2000/01, though the PSDP review processes put inplace under the PSAL may have
helped improve the quality o fpublic investment. Inthe last (three) years tax revenue has
increased by 0.6-0.8 percent o f GDP, partly inresponse to the tax administration reforms
supported under the two SACS. The share o f expenditure has also declined, reducing the
fiscal deficit below 5 percent o f GDP. The biggest factor accounting for expenditure
reduction was the decline ininterest rates which, as noted above, had little to do with
Bankoperations. Finally, the Bank structural adjustment operations helpedreducethe
budgetary drain o f some loss-making SOEs (no quantitative estimates are available), but
they have largely failed to reduce losses and subsidies inthe power sector or innatural
gas. As o f 2002/03 power sector subsidies were estimated to be around 1.6 percent o f
GDP and gas sector subsidies about 0.2 percent.

 6.4     Itis worth highlightingthe importance ofinterest rates and ofgrants. Falling
 interest payments were mainly responsible for the improvement inthe overall budget
 balance andthe primarybalance (Figures. 2 and 3). From 1999/00 to 2003/04, the overall
 budget balance including grants improved as a share o f GDP by 3.1 percentage points.
 Interest payments also fell by 3.1 percentage points over the same period. (Revenues
 increasedby 1.6 points as well -- tax revenue by 0.7 points, non-tax revenues by 0.3 points,
 andgrants by0.6 points -- butthis was offset bya rise innon-interest expenditure). The
 fall ininterest payments was due to debt relief, low international rates, and good internal
 debt management. Grants surged after September 1, reaching2.8 percent o f GDP in
 2002/03. It i s important to distinguish betweenbalances with andwithout grants. The shift
 to primary fiscal surplus andthe reductioninthe overall deficit are important
 achievements, but balances excluding grants are a better measure o fPakistan's own efforts
 ando flikely sustainability. Grants have started to decline andinternationalinterestrates
 may rise. The sustainability o f recent fiscal improvements i s therefore a matter o f concern.

 6.5     Tax reform. Although the quantity o ftaxes (tax/GDP ratio) remainedunchanged
 duringthe 1990s, the quality o ftaxes improved as other broader-based and more efficient
 domestic taxes substituted for the loss o f tariff revenue under trade reform. More
 recently, the tax/GDP ratio has risen somewhat. Equally important, tax administration
 reforms have started to change the culture from one o f extortion to one based o n
 transparency and integrity. Much remains to be done, however an investment climate
 survey in2003 found that the private sector still regarded official harassment, especially
 from CBR, as a serious impediment.

 6.6     Publicjnancial management, There has beenprogress inaccounting and
 financial reporting (especially reconciliation o f accounts), auditing, legislative oversight
through PACs, and more recently, inprocurement reform. There has also been modest
progress incivil service reform.

6.7      Tradereform. Significant reforms inthe trade regime have taken place. Export
taxes and other restrictions on exports have been largely eliminated. The maximum tariff
levelwas reduced from 125 percent in 1990/91 to 25 percent in2002/03 andthe effective
tariffrate (net customs duties as a share o fdutiable imports) has fallen from 73 percent to
 16 percent during the same period. Pakistan's level o f protection is now among the
lowest inSouth Asia, but still inthe highest 20 percent o f developing countries. All
quantitative restrictions have beenbanned (with the significant exception of trade with
India), and exemptions are being phased out.

6.8     Power sector. Although some progress has been made inunbundlingthrough
creation o f independent corporations, efforts to improve the sector's efficiency and
financial performance have failed. Inlight o f the failure to reform the power sector
through multi sector adjustment loans, the Bank has decided to start over again. The
PRSC approved inSeptember 2004 has only one condition related to the power sector-
to prepare an action plan. Bank strategy is help prepare a medium- term adjustment
strategy for the sector supported by a dedicated sector operation, which aims to eliminate
the sectors drawn inthe budget on a more gradual basis.

6.9     Petroleum and natural gas. Progresshas beenmade since 2000 inimproving the
autonomy and commercial orientation o f SOE's, most o fwhich are moving toward
privatization. Manyproduct prices have beencompletely deregulated. Remainingprice
controls have beenregularly adjusted for petroleumproducts, but there are still
significant subsidiesinthe gas sector andprice adjustments have not always taken place
as scheduled.

6.10    Banking sector. Significant progress has beenmade inrestructuring and
privatizingthe banking sector. Although conditionality onbankingsector reform has
been includedinthe four operations under review, progress i s mainly due to support from
sector-specific operations.

6.11 Social sectors. Spendingon health and education has increased as a share o f GDP
inrecent years, but it remains lowbyinternational standards. Theimpact ofincreased
spendinghasbeenlimiteddueto weak implementationcapacity and the limited
jurisdiction and influence o f the federal government. The overall impact onpoverty
reduction i s questionable. However, the Regionreports that preliminary data from a Core
Welfare Indicators Questionnaire completed inearly 2005 show substantial
improvements ina range o f social indicators. Higher economic growth and increased
public social expenditure may thus bebeginningto have more impact onpoverty and
social indicators.


Lessons

    0   A series ofone-tranche loans inaprogrammatic framework canbe an effective
        instrumentfor support reforms ofa country with apoor track record. However,
        effectiveness o f a series o f one-tranche loans depends on a willingness to
        withhold lendinguntil a critical mass o fpreviously-agreed prior actions have been
        undertaken. The delay betweenthe SAL andthe first SAC was particularly
        effective inthis respect.

    0   Complex or politically-difficult sector reforms are best supported through
        dedicated sector operations. A multi-sector operation canplay only a secondary
        or facilitating role when dealing with institutionaldevelopment (as intax reform
        or civil service reform), deep-rooted reluctance to reform (as inpower), need for
        specific fundingto offset costs o f adjustment (as inbanking), or weak service
        delivery (as inhealthand education). O fcourse, even a dedicated sector
        operation can succeed only ifthere i s commitment to reform.

package that significantly reduces the maximum       reform program which was public!;; announced inJune 1994, inthe
tariff rate further.                                 context o f the 1994195budget. All import taxes were consolidated
                                                     into one all-inclusive tariff schedule. The maximumtariff rate was
                                                     reduced from 92 percent to 70 percent and a minimumtariff rate o f
                                                     10percent was imposed. (The tariff rate on imported automobiles,
                                                     which remains above the maximumrate, will be brought down by
                                                     the end o fthe program). The maximumrate willbe reducedto 45

2) Eliminatemost exemptions and simplifythe          2) Additional key measures introduced are: (i)   reductionin
tariff schedule to reduce dispersions.               intermediate tariff rates on imports; (ii)withdrawal o f one-third o f
                                                    the import tariff exemptions and concessions: arid (iii)   reduction in
                                                    the number o f tariffbands to further reduce dispersion. The
                                                    remaining exemptions and concessions will be imitated during the
                                                     1995/96-1996197 period, except for existingcontractual
