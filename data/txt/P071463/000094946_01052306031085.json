decentralization, improved financial\n            management, civil service reform, and public access to\n            information; by strengthening the foundations for economic\n            growth, through regulatory reforms, privatization, and\n            pricing policies of power, and, oil and gas public\n            companies; and, by improving the delivery of social\n            services, through strengthened leadership, improved\n            incentives to influence delivery of services, and, an eased\n            transition from provincial-based, to district-based service\n            delivery. The project will contribute to maintain\n            macroeconomic stability needed to support structural\n            reforms. However, several risks exist, namely,\n            Pakistan's debt situation; political changes as of\n            October 2002, which may hinder reforms; and, fiduciary, and\n            implementation risks associated to devolution. Thus, risk\n            management will require strong reform implementation to\n            facilitate domestic adjustment, market responses, and\n            external support; the establishment of institutional\n            mechanisms for policy continuity, such as the elected\n            district governments; and, a phased approach in devolving\n            the responsibilities of civil service management, to the new\n            district governments, including technical assistance\n            programs to strengthen financial management reforms."}, "docdt": "2001-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
