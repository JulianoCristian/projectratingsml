Subsequent debt\n            rescheduling and improvements in macro management have also\n            reduced the threat of default. Even though debt service\n            levels remain high, sustainability of these net benefits is\n            rated likely. Institutional development is negligible.\n            Overall, both Bank and Borrower performance are rated\n            unsatisfactory.  SAL's outcome is rated as moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Improvements in loan repayment have been\n            sustained and are likely to continue. Even though debt\n            service levels remain high, sustainability of these net\n            benefits is rated likely. Institutional reform was\n            negligible. Because of the failure to implement the reform\n            program, Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory. The\n            problems with SAL reflect a lack of broad-based commitment\n            in Pakistan, not the program design; Bank performance is\n            rated satisfactory.  Overall, outcome of SAC I is rated\n            satisfactory, and sustainability of project achievements is\n            likely. Overall institutional development impact is rated\n            modest. Performance o f both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            rated satisfactory. The overall outcome of SAC II is rated\n            as moderately satisfactory, and sustainability of net\n            project benefits is rated likely. SAC II had important\n            institutional objectives in tax administration, public\n            financial management, civil service reform, procurement, and\n            utility restructuring and regulation. Overall institutional\n            development impact is rated modest. Both Bank and Borrower\n            performance are rated satisfactory.  The main lessons from\n            these loans are: 1) Effectiveness of a series of one-tranche\n            loans depends on a willingness to withhold lending until a\n            critical mass of previously-agreed prior actions have been\n            undertaken. The delay between the SAL and the first SAC was\n            particularly effective in this respect.2) Complex or\n            politically difficult sector reforms are best supported\n            through dedicated sector operations. A multi-sector\n            operation can play only a secondary or facilitating role\n            when dealing with institutional development (as in tax\n            reform or civil service reform), deep-rooted reluctance to\n            reform (as in power), need for specific funding to offset\n            costs of adjustment (as in banking), or weak service\n            delivery (as in health and education)."}, "docdt": "2005-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
