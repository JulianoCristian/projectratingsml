cities.  Moreover, the project seeks to help implement a\n            high priority program of infrastructure improvement measures\n            aimed at relieving traffic congestion and promoting\n            transport efficiency in Indonesia's four largest cities\n            outside Jakarta.  The principal project objectives are to:\n            (a) strengthen city government capabilities in the planning,\n            implementation, and maintenance of traffic and transport\n            facilities and services; (b) strengthen Central Government\n            capabilities in the preparation and implementation of\n            national policies and technical standards for the urban\n            transport sector; and (c) establish a process of\n            coordinating the investment activities of central,\n            provincial, and city government agencies in urban transport\n            infrastructure.  To achieve these goals, the project\n            includes financing for:  (a) major road construction; (b)\n            comprehensive corridor improvements; (c) city-wide traffic\n            engineering works; (d) road rehabilitation and maintenance;\n            and (e) technical assistance and training.  As a result of\n            this project, transport and traffic conditions will be\n            improved in the four largest secondary cities of Indonesia."}, "docdt": "1987-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
