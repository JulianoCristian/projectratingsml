NAU to\n            improve its facilities and the quality of its courses and\n            research activities and to expand its graduate program. The\n            project would finance: (1) rehabilitation of the central\n            campus, which was heavily damaged by a 1974 earthquake; (ii)\n            instruction and research facilities for four of the five\n            farms which comprise the NAU's regional development\n            institutes; (iii) equipment for the central campus and\n            regional development institutes; (iv) studies abroad at the\n            graduate level for about 60 NAU professors; and (v)\n            technical assistance to reorganize and strengthen the\n            NAU's graduate agricultural economics program. The only\n            special risk faced by the project is the possibility of\n            future earthquake damage. To minimize this risk, antiseismic\n            designs have been adopted and construction would be closely\n            supervised by engineers experienced in seismic construction."}, "docdt": "1982-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
