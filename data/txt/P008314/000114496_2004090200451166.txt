In connection with the Guarantee Agreement-Sofia of this date between Republic of

“transactions under loans” (as so described) not later than March 31 of the year following that for 
which the report is made. 
 
2. 
We represent that no mortgages, pledges, charges, privileges, priorities or other 
liens, other than those excluded pursuant to paragraph (c) of Section 9.03 of the General
