moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) Policy setting is conducive to project\n            success. Before the project started and in the early years\n            of implementation, a number of policy measures were taken\n            that supported the project. Also, a tariff regulatory system\n            exists and tariffs were regularly increased. 2) Investments\n            should be affordable. To avoid raising tariffs, the\n            investments were chosen in a manner that would be affordable\n            and result in savings for the companies. Thus, the project\n            focused on demand side management (DSM) to conserve energy\n            and critical network rehabilitation that would result in\n            reducing heat and water losses. Further, a large part of the\n            investments were funded by grants from Kozloduy\n            International Decommissioning Support Fund (KIDSF) which\n            reduced the financial burden in Toplofikacia Sofia (TS) and\n            Toplofikacia Pernik (TP) to raise counterpart funds. 3) A\n            decentralized Bank team increases supervision effectiveness.\n            The Bank team was highly decentralized as mentioned above.\n            This increased contact and eased communication among the\n            Bank and project entities, made travel cost-effective, and\n            boosted implementation effectiveness. Thus, when possible,\n            the Bank should consider decentralized staff to supervise projects."}, "docdt": "2008-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
