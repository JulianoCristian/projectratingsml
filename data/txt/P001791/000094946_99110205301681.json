decentralization program\n            in Mozambique, and, the enactment, and establishment of new\n            municipal governments. Nonetheless, the legislative\n            framework needs to be completed, to build municipal\n            governments' capacity, and thus, expand their\n            authority. The key lessons convey the importance of\n            obtaining the government's commitment at the policy\n            making level, as demonstrated by the success of the project,\n            which overcame performance problems, and political\n            difficulties. Unfortunately, and regardless of success, the\n            design of the project was limited by the choice for an\n            Engineering Credit Instrument - intended for large\n            investment projects - which failed to provide the required\n            flexibility, and, allowed neither learning, nor long-term\n            support, that other instruments do provide nowadays. In\n            turn, the inadequate assessment, and management of project\n            risks, was the consequence of inflexible design, where the\n            risks and uncertainties of decentralization, would have\n            better evolved, by undertaking a fundamental project\n            restructuring. Since difficulties existed due to the\n            inclusion of several components, magnified by the\n            constrained-capacity environment, essential streamlined,\n            management structures should have been considered, in\n            addition to management training."}, "docdt": "1999-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
