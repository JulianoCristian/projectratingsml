The reforms focus on the legal, institutional\n            and fiscal framework of local government in order to create\n            a suitable structure for self-sufficient and accountable\n            local authorities, and are implemented on a pilot basis in\n            five urban areas designated as the project cities.\n            Complementary objectives include assisting the GOM to: (a)\n            create an appropriate policy framework for investments in\n            the urban sector; (b) prepare urban investment plans for\n            five project cities, including plans for the efficient\n            management, rehabilitation, and financing of essential urban\n            infrastructure and services; (c) test specific, replicable\n            approaches to solving entrenched urban problems (including\n            absorption of rural migrants, environmental degradation, low\n            cost transportation); and (d) coordinate the work of donor\n            agencies, multilateral and non-governmental organizations\n            (NGOs) in the urban/local government sector. The project\n            finances technical assistance and studies, and also provides\n            for the selective implementation of the findings of these\n            studies, including some modest pilot investments in the five\n            project cities. The project comprises: (i) legal and\n            institutional reform; (ii) fiscal, financial and\n            organizational reform; (iii) urban/environmental management;\n            and (iv) capacity building, institutional support and\n            project management."}, "docdt": "1993-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
