F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
Prepared annually within a rolling three-year horizon, the PRSCs 1-3 were a
comprehensive series of operations that were designed to support the Government in
implementing cross-cutting policies and reforms aimed at improving the living conditions
of the population through three components: (i) the promotion of growth, income and
employment; (ii) improving service delivery for human development; and (iii) improving
governance and public sector reform. These three components encompassed the five
thematic themes of the GPRS, namely (i) ensuring macroeconomic stability; (ii)
expanding production and employment; (iii) supporting human development; (iv)
protecting the vulnerable and extremely poor; and (v) promoting good governance and
public sector reform. While the support provided under PRSC 1-3 was primarily
budgetary funding for the implementation of the GPRS, particular attention was also
focused on: (i) leveraging the poverty emphasis of several sector-focused operations by
ensuring appropriated expenditure allocation (level and structure) and addressing some of
the financing implications of proposed policy actions (e.g., removal of school fees); (ii)
policy dialogue; and (iii) monitoring resource allocations and outcomes. Each PRSC also
monitored welfare and poverty indicators to enable assessments of whether poverty
reduction objectives (both income and non-income dimensions of poverty) were being
achieved.The close and parallel linkage between the PRSCs and the GPRS ensured that
these operations were highly responsive to the country's circumstances and development
priorities. The budget support provided by the PRSCs was also complemented by a series
of Bank investment and technical assistance operations in the education and health sector,
HIV/AIDS, public sector reform, and finance and private sector development.

  The three PRSCs were each in the amount of $125 million. They were on standard
highly concessional IDA terms, with PRSCs 1 and 2 also being roughly one third in the
form of grants to assist in implementing critical human development services supported
by these operations. The PRSCs were coordinated with budget support from other donors,
with coordination increasing over the three-year period. This coordination took place
through the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS) framework between the GoG and
its DPs. The goals of this framework were to: (i) support implementation of the GPRS
through the budget, thereby ensuring consistency in the policy dialogue; (ii) develop a
common progress framework; (iii) reduce Government transaction costs from negotiating
and reporting to multiple donors: (iv) enhance the predictability of resource flows; and
(v) conduct joint progress reviews between the GoG and its DPs. The purpose of the
MDBS was to harmonize the dialogue and efforts of Ghana's development partners with
the Government's own development strategy. While the principles of the common MDBS
framework were agreed upon in 2003, a common progress assessment framework (PAF)
to measure GPRS performance was not developed until 2004.

  The PRSCs were intended to provide a series of benefits. The main and ultimate benefit
was the human progress towards achieving the MDGs as a result of the economic growth
and improvements in service delivery that would result from the implementation of the



                                           vii

GPRS. The additional benefits of PRSC 1-3 were to be (i) the maintenance of
macroeconomic stability by contributing to the closing of the external financing gap, and
(ii) enabling the GoG to generate the funds required to execute the GPRS policies and
programs.

  Each of the three PRSCs were centered on the same three components described above,
but the actions supported under each one varied somewhat because, broadly speaking, the
actions completed under the program supported by PRSC-1 focused on laying out the
groundwork for legislative changes and designing strategies for key areas of the reform
agenda. Subsequent operations would then build on the reforms implemented in each
preceding operation. The key objectives of each operation are discussed below. (The key
modifications to the policy areas under each operation are addressed in Section 6.5
below.)

  PRSC-1: The first component of PRSC-1 focused on ensuring progress on
macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth by eliminating factors inhibiting growth.
The first set of actions included: (i) reducing the high public domestic debt, which
crowded out credit to the private sector, kept interest rates high, and limited the scope in
the budget for financing services that were supportive of development; and (ii) reducing
the cost of doing business, such as the unreliable and "high-price" supply of critical
inputs, especially energy, and the administrative costs of complying with government
regulations. The second set of actions consisted of removing constraints on rural
development. The rural sector was selected because: (i) it included the bulk of the
country's natural resources; (ii) it was home to the largest number of the people; and (iii)
it embraced the largest proportion of the poor.
  The second component of PRSC-1 aimed at improving service delivery in education,
health, and social protection. It focused on: (i) expanding access to education and health
services, with particular attention to the needs of underserved areas and populations; and
(ii) improving the efficiency and equity of financing. By focusing on these actions, the
program aimed at dealing with issues such as (i) redressing the unequal regional and
gender outcomes in health and education; and (ii) attaining sustainable and equitable
financing of these critical services. The program also aimed at contributing to sharpening
the national focus on reaching the MDGs by 2015, adding value to the support already
provided by sector projects.

  The third component of PRSC-1 incorporated actions designed to: (i) strengthen the
institutions of participatory democracy and accountable rule; and (ii) improve the
efficiency of the public services and the quality of public expenditure management
(PEM). Again, the areas identified for PRSC support were selected with a view of adding
value to the existing sectoral support by elevating the issues to the center of Government,
where collective interest generated by the GPRS would facilitate debate, consensus
building, and decision-making.

  PRSC-2: Reforms supported by PRSC-2 built on the measures implemented with the
support of PRSC-1. As with PRSC-1, the first component of PRSC-2 focused on ensuring
progress on macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth by eliminating factors



                                             viii

inhibiting growth, including reducing public domestic debt to create room for increased
credit to the private sector; and strengthening the business environment through the
expansion of energy supply services, increased trade facilitation, and the removal of
administrative barriers for business development. The second set of actions consisted of
removing constraints on rural development through an increase in Government's support
to agriculture and developing a new framework for micro-finance, as well as adding a
focus on natural resources, primarily in the form of completion of a strategic
environmental assessment (SEA).

  Under the second component of PRSC-2, measures to improve service delivery in
education again focused on: (i) increasing access and completion of quality basic
education, with particular attention to the needs of underserved areas and populations;
and (ii) improving the efficiency and equity of financing. Measures to improve the
delivery of health services centered on bridging the equity gaps in the access to health
care services in deprived regions, and at reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Measures to
improve social protection focused on actions supporting the vulnerable and the excluded,
such as people living with HIV/AIDS, orphans, homeless, and children living on the
street.

  The third component of PRSC-2 incorporated actions designed to strengthen
governance and public sector management. The policy actions supported under this
component ranged from strengthening governance institutions and moving ahead with
decentralization, to carrying out public sector reforms, including PEM modernization,
and building the capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda.

  PRSC-3: Policies supported by PRSC-3 built on reforms implemented under PRSC-2.
The first component of PRSC-3 focused on actions aimed at ensuring progress in
attaining macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth. Measures focused on (i) creating
a more diversified financial sector to enable an increase in credit to the private sector; (ii)
strengthening the business environment through the expansion of energy supply services
and the removal of administrative barriers to business development; and (iii) encouraging
the development of extension services, especially for poorer farmers. The component also
supported measures to improve the performance of the rural sector through policy actions
aimed at strengthening the government's support to agriculture. In the area of natural
resources management, attention shifted towards the more pressing issues relating to the
management of forestry resources.

  The second component incorporated measures aimed at assisting Ghana reach the MDG
goals by improving service delivery in education, health, social protection, water, and
sanitation. The measures to improve service delivery in education focused on increasing
access and completion of quality basic education, particularly in the three most deprived
regions (Northern, Upper East, and Upper West), and on improving the efficiency and
equity of education financing. Measures to improve the delivery of health services
centered on bridging the equity gaps in the access to health care serves in four deprived
regions (Northern, Upper East, and Upper West, plus the Central region) and at reducing
the spread of HIV/AIDS.Measures to improve social protection focused on actions



                                            ix

supporting the vulnerable and the excluded (such as orphans, the homeless, and people
living with HIV/AIDS). Finally, measures to expand the provision of safe water and
sanitation included the development of a comprehensive sector strategy addressing a
variety of measures, including existing coverage, implementation capacity, and the
incidence of water-borne diseases.

  The third component of PRSC-3 incorporated measures designed to strengthen
governance and public sector management. These actions included moving forward with
a medium-term agenda for public sector reform that included decentralization, improving
public sector performance, modernizing the fiduciary and PEM frameworks, and
strengthening the capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda.

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Program objectives remained unchanged. Approximately 13 policy indicators in the
policy matrix were eliminated under PRSC-2 (and subsequent operations).              Key
indicators that were eliminated included one relating to foreign direct investment,
reflecting a shift under PRSC-2 away from improving the investment climate towards a
greater focus on enhancing private sector competitiveness. In addition, the indicators
supporting improved rural sector growth were revised, with "real per capita food
production" replacing three indicators used under PRSC-1 (the indicators that were
dropped were "increased cocoa exports," "increased producer prices for cocoa," and
"agriculture growth").

  A number of new indicators were also added under PRSC-2. To reflect the addition of
natural resource management as a policy area, an indicator for "forest coverage" was
added to measure the improved management of natural resources. (Under PRSC-3, this
indicator was again revised, to "forest plantation coverage.") Two other indicators -- the
"ratio of population per nurse in the four deprived regions," and the "ratio of population
per doctor in the four deprived regions" -- were also added under PRSC-2 as better
measurements of improving access to quality health care services. PRSC-2 also added
indicators for the primary pupil-teacher ratio in the three most deprived regions, and an
improvement in the pupil-textbook ratio in these regions. Under PRSC-3, still more of
the indicators in the policy matrix were modified in language, or dropped.            The
quantitative monitoring indicators were also modified somewhat in each successive
program document. These changes reflected modifications in the policy areas addressed
under these operations, development priorities on the ground, and the harmonization of
the progress framework used by the GoG and its DPs.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.Context at Appraisal

Since embarking on economic reforms in the mid-1980s, Ghana has made considerable progress
in laying the foundations for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. This has resulted in
significant growth and increased private sector activity and investment over the last two decades.
In parallel, important political reforms were also adopted that moved the country firmly to a
democratic form of government. This progress has been periodically interrupted, however, by
episodes of weak macroeconomic management associated with the electoral cycle, as occurred in
1992, 1996, and 2000. As a consequence, the newly elected government inherited in 2001 a very
difficult economic situation but nonetheless moved quickly to restore stability, including
increasing retail petroleum prices by 60 percent, increasing electricity and water tariffs to stem
losses at those utilities, and raising taxes and cutting expenditures. Sustained implementation of
tight financial policies in 2001 resulted in significant macroeconomic stabilization, enabling
inflation to be halved (from 42 percent), the exchange rate to remain stable, and foreign reserves
to be rebuilt

Program implementation during 2002, the year prior to the implementation of the first Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-1), was mixed, however. While real GDP growth accelerated to
about 4.5 percent, inflation was further reduced (to 15 percent), and reserves continued to
strengthen (to 2 months), there were serious fiscal and quasi-fiscal slippages associated with
weaknesses in public expenditure management; particularly in the management of the wage bill,
payment of unbudgeted 2001 expenditures, delays in divestiture, and non-implementation of
revenue-enhancing measures. Moreover the failure to adjust petroleum prices contributed to the
GoG having to assume the debt of the refinery (equivalent to almost 3 percent of GDP) and
domestic debt rose to 29 percent of GDP by end-2002.

To reverse these slippages, the GoG redoubled its reform efforts in late 2002 and early 2003 and -
- following a broad participatory process -- finalized a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy
(GPRS) that set poverty reduction goals in alignment with the MDGs. It identified measures to
increase growth, income, and employment; improve the delivery of basic social services; and
enhance governance and public sector management. The GPRS recognized that there could be no
meaningful poverty reduction without a strong economic foundation and sustained growth. In
March 2003, the Bank-Fund Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the GPRS concluded that it
provided a sound framework for implementing the Government's anti-poverty agenda and that
the medium-term macroeconomic framework set out in the GPRS was realistic.i

It was in this context that the Bank and Ghana's other key development partners (DPs) considered
that the country's stable democratic governance, improving investment climate, and progress in
achieving the MDGs constituted a good set of fundamentals on which to build support for the
GPRS through a coordinated approach (discussed further below). The series of three PRSCs,
designed in 2003, was the Bank's major contribution to this partnership.

The PRSCs focused on programmatic lending that was grounded in Ghana's clear commitment
and capacity to reform, structured in a series of operations supporting a medium-term reform
program, and disbursed on the basis of completed actions rather than future commitments. The
funds provided under the PRSCs would help to maintain macroeconomic stability by contributing
to the closing of the external financing gap, as well as enable the Government to generate the
funds needed to execute the GPRS policies and programs.

1.2.Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

Prepared annually within a rolling three-year horizon, the PRSCs 1-3 were a comprehensive
series of operations that were designed to support the Government in implementing cross-cutting
policies and reforms aimed at improving the living conditions of the population through three
components: (i) the promotion of growth, income and employment; (ii) improving service
delivery for human development; and (iii) improving governance and public sector reform. These
three components encompassed the five thematic themes of the GPRS, namely (i) ensuring
macroeconomic stability; (ii) expanding production and employment; (iii) supporting human
development; (iv) protecting the vulnerable and extremely poor; and (v) promoting good
governance and public sector reform. While the support provided under PRSC 1-3 was primarily
budgetary funding for the implementation of the GPRS, particular attention was also focused on:
(i) leveraging the poverty emphasis of several sector-focused operations by ensuring appropriated
expenditure allocation (level and structure) and addressing some of the financing implications of
proposed policy actions (e.g., removal of school fees); (ii) policy dialogue; and (iii) monitoring
resource allocations and outcomes. Each PRSC also monitored welfare and poverty indicators to
enable assessments of whether poverty reduction objectives (both income and non-income
dimensions of poverty) were being achieved. The close and parallel linkage between the PRSCs
and the GPRS ensured that these operations were highly responsive to the country's
circumstances and development priorities. The budget support provided by the PRSCs was also
complemented by a series of Bank investment and technical assistance operations in the
education and health sector, HIV/AIDS, public sector reform, and finance and private sector
development.

The three PRSCs were each in the amount of $125 million. They were on standard highly
concessional IDA terms, with PRSCs 1 and 2 also being roughly one third in the form of grants to
assist in implementing critical human development services supported by these operations. The
PRSCs were coordinated with budget support from other donors, with coordination increasing
over the three-year period. This coordination took place through the Multi-Donor Budgetary
Support (MDBS) framework between the GoG and its DPs.ii The goals of this framework were
to: (i) support implementation of the GPRS through the budget, thereby ensuring consistency in
the policy dialogue; (ii) develop a common progress framework; (iii) reduce Government
transaction costs from negotiating and reporting to multiple donors: (iv) enhance the
predictability of resource flows; and (v) conduct joint progress reviews between the GoG and its
DPs.    The purpose of the MDBS was to harmonize the dialogue and efforts of Ghana's
development partners with the Government's own development strategy. While the principles of
the common MDBS framework were agreed upon in 2003, a common progress assessment
framework (PAF) to measure GPRS performance was not developed until 2004.

The PRSCs were intended to provide a series of benefits. The main and ultimate benefit was the
human progress towards achieving the MDGs as a result of the economic growth and
improvements in service delivery that would result from the implementation of the GPRS. The
additional benefits of PRSC 1-3 were to be (i) the maintenance of macroeconomic stability by
contributing to the closing of the external financing gap, and (ii) enabling the GoG to generate the
funds required to execute the GPRS policies and programs.

Each of the three PRSCs were centered on the same three components described above, but the
actions supported under each one varied somewhat because, broadly speaking, the actions
completed under the program supported by PRSC-1 focused on laying out the groundwork for
legislative changes and designing strategies for key areas of the reform agenda. Subsequent
operations would then build on the reforms implemented in each preceding operation. The key



                                                  2

objectives of each operation are discussed below. (The key modifications to the policy areas
under each operation are addressed in Section 6.5 below.)

PRSC-1: The first component of PRSC-1 focused on ensuring progress on macroeconomic
stability and pro-poor growth by eliminating factors inhibiting growth. The first set of actions
included: (i) reducing the high public domestic debt, which crowded out credit to the private
sector, kept interest rates high, and limited the scope in the budget for financing services that
were supportive of development; and (ii) reducing the cost of doing business, such as the
unreliable and "high-price" supply of critical inputs, especially energy, and the administrative
costs of complying with government regulations.          The second set of actions consisted of
removing constraints on rural development. The rural sector was selected because: (i) it included
the bulk of the country's natural resources; (ii) it was home to the largest number of the people;
and (iii) it embraced the largest proportion of the poor.

The second component of PRSC-1 aimed at improving service delivery in education, health, and
social protection. It focused on: (i) expanding access to education and health services, with
particular attention to the needs of underserved areas and populations; and (ii) improving the
efficiency and equity of financing. By focusing on these actions, the program aimed at dealing
with issues such as (i) redressing the unequal regional and gender outcomes in health and
education; and (ii) attaining sustainable and equitable financing of these critical services. The
program also aimed at contributing to sharpening the national focus on reaching the MDGs by
2015, adding value to the support already provided by sector projects.

The third component of PRSC-1 incorporated actions designed to: (i) strengthen the institutions of
participatory democracy and accountable rule; and (ii) improve the efficiency of the public
services and the quality of public expenditure management (PEM). Again, the areas identified for
PRSC support were selected with a view of adding value to the existing sectoral support by
elevating the issues to the center of Government, where collective interest generated by the GPRS
would facilitate debate, consensus building, and decision-making.

PRSC-2: Reforms supported by PRSC-2 built on the measures implemented with the support of
PRSC-1. As with PRSC-1, the first component of PRSC-2 focused on ensuring progress on
macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth by eliminating factors inhibiting growth, including
reducing public domestic debt to create room for increased credit to the private sector; and
strengthening the business environment through the expansion of energy supply services,
increased trade facilitation, and the removal of administrative barriers for business development.
The second set of actions consisted of removing constraints on rural development through an
increase in Government's support to agriculture and developing a new framework for micro-
finance, as well as adding a focus on natural resources, primarily in the form of completion of a
strategic environmental assessment (SEA).

Under the second component of PRSC-2, measures to improve service delivery in education
again focused on: (i) increasing access and completion of quality basic education, with particular
attention to the needs of underserved areas and populations; and (ii) improving the efficiency and
equity of financing. Measures to improve the delivery of health services centered on bridging the
equity gaps in the access to health care services in deprived regions, and at reducing the spread of
HIV/AIDS. Measures to improve social protection focused on actions supporting the vulnerable
and the excluded, such as people living with HIV/AIDS, orphans, homeless, and children living
on the street.

The third component of PRSC-2 incorporated actions designed to strengthen governance and public
sector management. The policy actions supported under this component ranged from strengthening


                                                  3

governance institutions and moving ahead with decentralization, to carrying out public sector
reforms, including PEM modernization, and building the capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy
agenda.

PRSC-3: Policies supported by PRSC-3 built on reforms implemented under PRSC-2. The first
component of PRSC-3 focused on actions aimed at ensuring progress in attaining
macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth.          Measures focused on (i) creating a more
diversified financial sector to enable an increase in credit to the private sector; (ii) strengthening
the business environment through the expansion of energy supply services and the removal of
administrative barriers to business development; and (iii) encouraging the development of
extension services, especially for poorer farmers.    The component also supported measures to
improve the performance of the rural sector through policy actions aimed at strengthening the
government's support to agriculture. In the area of natural resources management, attention
shifted towards the more pressing issues relating to the management of forestry resources.

The second component incorporated measures aimed at assisting Ghana reach the MDG goals by
improving service delivery in education, health, social protection, water, and sanitation. The
measures to improve service delivery in education focused on increasing access and completion
of quality basic education, particularly in the three most deprived regions (Northern, Upper East,
and Upper West), and on improving the efficiency and equity of education financing. Measures
to improve the delivery of health services centered on bridging the equity gaps in the access to
health care serves in four deprived regions (Northern, Upper East, and Upper West, plus the
Central region) and at reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Measures to improve social protection
focused on actions supporting the vulnerable and the excluded (such as orphans, the homeless,
and people living with HIV/AIDS). Finally, measures to expand the provision of safe water and
sanitation included the development of a comprehensive sector strategy addressing a variety of
measures, including existing coverage, implementation capacity, and the incidence of water-
borne diseases.

The third component of PRSC-3 incorporated measures designed to strengthen governance and
public sector management. These actions included moving forward with a medium-term agenda
for public sector reform that included decentralization, improving public sector performance,
modernizing the fiduciary and PEM frameworks, and strengthening the capacity to monitor and
evaluate the policy agenda.

1.3.Revised PDO

Program objectives remained unchanged. Approximately 13 policy indicators in the policy
matrix were eliminated under PRSC-2 (and subsequent operations). Key indicators that were
eliminated included one relating to foreign direct investment, reflecting a shift under PRSC-2
away from improving the investment climate towards a greater focus on enhancing private sector
competitiveness.    In addition, the indicators supporting improved rural sector growth were
revised, with "real per capita food production" replacing three indicators used under PRSC-1 (the
indicators that were dropped were "increased cocoa exports," "increased producer prices for
cocoa," and "agriculture growth").

A number of new indicators were also added under PRSC-2. To reflect the addition of natural
resource management as a policy area, an indicator for "forest coverage" was added to measure
the improved management of natural resources. (Under PRSC-3, this indicator was again revised,
to "forest plantation coverage.") Two other indicators -- the "ratio of population per nurse in the
four deprived regions," and the "ratio of population per doctor in the four deprived regions" --



                                                  4

were also added under PRSC-2 as better measurements of improving access to quality health care
services. PRSC-2 also added indicators for the primary pupil-teacher ratio in the three most
deprived regions, and an improvement in the pupil-textbook ratio in these regions. Under PRSC-
3, still more of the indicators in the policy matrix were modified in language, or dropped. The
quantitative monitoring indicators were also modified somewhat in each successive program
document. These changes reflected modifications in the policy areas addressed under these
operations, development priorities on the ground, and the harmonization of the progress
framework used by the GoG and its DPs.

1.4.Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The policy areas supported by PRSC-1 correspond to the three components outlined above,
namely:

    (i) Promoting growth, income, and employment (addressing the issues of high public
    domestic debt; high-cost business environment and obstacles to competitiveness; and the
    stagnation of rural development).

    (ii) Improving service delivery for human development (education, health, HIV/AIDs, and
    the vulnerable and excluded).

    (iii)Improving governance and public sector management (building a democratic,
    inclusive, and decentralized state; improving the performance of the public sector;
    strengthening the fiduciary framework and public expenditure management (PEM); and
    strengthening the capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda).

The policy areas supported by PRSC-2 are (new issues are in italics):

    (i) Promoting growth, income, and employment (addressing high public domestic debt;
    high-cost business environment; the low reliability of energy supply; high cost of bringing
    agricultural production to market; and ineffective management of natural resources).

    (ii) Improving service delivery for human development (education, health, HIV/AIDs, and
    the poor and vulnerable).

    (iii)Improving governance and public sector management (improving the performance of
    the public sector; strengthening public financial management; strengthening governance
    institutions; and strengthening the capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda).

The policy areas supported by PRSC-3 are (new issues are in italics):

    (i) Promoting growth, income, and employment (addressing high public domestic debt;
    high-cost business environment; the low reliability of energy supply; low level of financial
    intermediation; high cost of bringing agricultural production to market; and ineffective
    management of natural resources).

    (ii) Improving service delivery for human development (education, health, HIV/AIDs,
    social protection; and water and sanitation).

    (iii)Improving governance and public sector management (improving the performance of
    the public sector; strengthening public financial management; strengthening governance
    institutions; and enhancing the capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda).




                                                  5

1.5.Revised Policy Areas

Although there was broad continuity between each of the PRSC operations, the programmatic
approach inherent to the PRSCs enabled greater adaptability for step-by-step institutional reforms
or other modifications. Thus, while project components and objectives remained unchanged
throughout the three operations, some new areas of focus were added in PRSC-2 and subsequent
operations. These areas, and the rationale for their addition, were: (i) creation of a more
diversified financial sector, to address the low level of financial intermediation compared to other
SSA countries, and which constrained private sector growth; (ii) a focus on the improved
management of natural resources, to prevent the depletion of the quality and quantity of Ghana's
natural resource base; and (iii) improving rural sector farm and non-farm growth by addressing
financial, transport and other barriers to the expansion of non-cocoa agriculture and poverty
reduction. In addition, the policy objective of decentralized government was replaced with
improved governance and accountability broadening this policy objective.

Beginning with PRSC-3, there was also an increased emphasis on actions that aimed at improving
service delivery at the decentralized level in sectors that accounted for a larger share of
expenditures on wages and salaries (e.g., education and health), broadening the focus of reforms
to incorporate reforms aimed at improving human resource management. In response to the
preliminary findings from the 2003 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey,
PRSC-3 placed an increasing emphasis on broadening access to education and health services,
especially in the deprived regions. PRSC-3 also introduced a water sector and sanitation strategy
after the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) indicated deterioration in infant mortality and
under-5 mortality rates between 1997 and 2003. This deterioration was attributable in part to
emerging problems with child malnutrition, as well as to slow progress in increasing access to
safe water sources and to safe sanitation.iii A social protection strategy was also added to help
address emerging problems with child welfare in urban and peri-urban areas. There was also an
expanded educational focus to expand teacher retention schemes in deprived districts and ensure
timely delivery of core textbooks in deprived regions.

The addition of the new areas to PRSC-2 corresponded to the use ­ for the first time ­ of the joint
performance matrix developed under the MDBS framework. Similarly, modifications to PRSC-3
were made in response to emerging developmental needs. As such, these modifications to the
original areas of focus under PRSC-1 were largely opportunistic and reflected new evidence on
development priorities and therefore should be viewed positively, rather than reflecting
negatively on the original design of PRSC-1.iv

1.6.Other significant changes

There were no other changes in design, financing, or implementation arrangements.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

As noted, most of the actions completed under PRSC-1 focused on laying out the groundwork for
legislative changes and developing strategies for key areas of the reform agenda. Follow-up
actions were then implemented in the context of PRSC-2 and PRSC-3. The discussion below
highlights program performance for each individual credit.

PRSC-1: Prior to Board presentation of PRSC-1, the Government had completed all planned
actions aimed at promoting growth, incomes, and employment; accelerating human resource



                                                  6

development, and strengthening governance and public sector management (see Table 1 below
for a list of prior actions). Progress in the implementation of the PRSC-1 reform program was
broadly satisfactory, as discussed below in each component area.

Growth, Income, and Employment Promotion: The implementation of PRSC-1 began against the
backdrop of the completion of the GPRS, and the renewal of efforts to achieve macroeconomic
stability and accelerate growth. In February 2003, the Government redoubled its reform efforts,
raising petroleum prices by around 90 percent to stem loses of the state-owned oil refinery
company. Increases in utility prices followed suit, with the adoption of an automatic adjustment
mechanism for electricity and water tariffs. There was a significant improvement in the external
environment, with rising prices for the country's main export commodities (cocoa and gold), and
an increase in aid inflows and debt relief. Political sensitivity, especially as the 2004 electoral
process drew nearer, and limited capacity within the public sector, meant, however, that there
were delays in following up on actions designed to encourage private sector development and
carry out the public sector reform agenda. At the time, these delays raised legitimate questions
about the sustainability of the advances under PRSC-1, given the importance of these reforms for
the implementation of the country's broader development program. Nonetheless, macroeconomic
growth rose to 5.2 percent, up from 4.5 percent in 2002, and the overall fiscal deficit fell to 4.5
percent of GDP, down from 6.8 percent in 2002. This combination of a growing economy with
fiscal discipline enabled a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 19.6 percent by end-2003,
compared to 26.2 percent at end-2002.

Human Service Delivery Improvement: Progress was made in the implementation of social
policies in the education and health sectors. As noted in the GoG's 2003 Annual Progress Report
(APR) on the GPRS, however, renewed efforts were still needed to improve basic social services
delivery targeted to the poor.       A particular concern was the DHS' documentation of a
deterioration of health indices, namely the increase in infant mortality and under-5 mortality
rates, as well as the slow reduction in maternal mortality rates.

Governance and Public Sector Management Strengthening: Actions to strengthen controls over
public finances included improving the scope, timing and quality of the reporting of budget
execution, with a new monthly report on the budget execution, and quarterly reports on poverty-
related expenditures.     Progress was made on the development and implementation of a
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework.

PRSC-2: Prior to Board presentation of PRSC-2, the Government had completed all planned
actions in the three component areas, as shown in Table 1 below. Progress in the implementation
of the PRSC-2 reform program was broadly satisfactory, as discussed below for each component
area.

Growth, Income, and Employment Promotion: Despite the fact that 2004 was an election year,
overall spending was controlled, annual inflation fell to 12.6 percent (down from 26.7 percent in
2003), and real GDP growth reached 5.6 percent, up from 5.2 percent in the prior year. This
performance was a sharp turnaround from previous election years, when macroeconomic
management slipped sharply. Progress was also achieved in (i) the share of total domestic credit
going to the private sector, which rose to an estimated 54.7 percent by end-2004, up from 47.3
percent at end-2002; and (ii) subsidies to public sector utility companies declined in real terms by
40 percent from 480 billion cedis at end-2002 to an estimated 278 billion cedis (in 2002 prices) at
end-2004.

Private sector development received a further boost with actions taken to remove certain
administrative and regulatory barriers to investment. These efforts included reducing the time


                                                 7

needed to obtain the environment certificate and tax registration and lowering the tax registration
fee, thereby reducing the time required for business registration to 85 days in 2004, down from
129 days in 2002.        Private sector competitiveness was enhanced with the installation of
automated clearance procedures (GCMS/GCNET) at the Tema (July 2003) and Takoradi
(November 2003) seaports, yielding a reduction in the average clearance time at customs by
reducing the number of clearance steps from 11 to 3. Progress in the power sector reform
consisted of: (i) the formation of the Volta River Authority (VRA) holding company, creating the
legal basis for the separation of power transmission, generation and distribution; (ii) the
restructuring of a large share of the debt obligations of the VRA and Electricity Corporation of
Ghana (ECG) to the Government, and (iii) the beginning of the revaluation of assets and the
separation of VRA's balance sheet. Power tariffs were adjusted twice in the year (March and
October 2003), in accordance with the cost recovery formula, yielding an 18 percent increase in
prices for end-users. There were delays, however, in adjusting the price of retail petroleum
products according to the cost recovery formula, leaving prices unchanged from the February
2003 level and leading to an unplanned fiscal gap of around 1.4 percent of GDP in 2004.

Actions taken to broaden access of the rural sector to credit included the review of the National
Framework Paper for Micro-Finance Institutions (MFI), aimed at addressing issues of capacity
building of MFIs; the development of a suitable regulatory mechanism for MFI industry; the
promotion of linkages between the formal and informal institutions; and training for results in
improved portfolio management. Several actions were also taken towards implementation of the
Financial Sector Strategic Plan (FINSSIP), deepening savings mobilization for old age and
housing. In the domain of natural resources management, a SEA was completed to help identify
options to better enforce environmental regulations and standards in areas ranging from land
forestry and water, to housing, health, and transport. Forestry reserve management was also
strengthened with the continuation of a plantation program, the transparent and competitive
allocation of timber rights, and the establishment of a framework for log tracking.

Human Service Delivery Improvement: Improvement in human service delivery resulted from
actions carried out in the areas of education, health, and HIV/AIDS. To redress existing gender
imbalances in educational outcomes, incentive schemes (including scholarships) were established
to enable girls to complete primary school in deprived districts. In the 2003/04 school year, a
total of 5,000 needy pupils, of whom 80 percent were girls, benefited from these schemes. There
was an additional 8.9 billion cedis allocated for scholarships for the same period. As a result of
these efforts national gross primary enrollment rates (GPER) rose from 81 percent in the 2002/03
school year to 86.3 percent in 2003/04 and enrollment rates among female students rose from
78.0 percent to 82.2 percent.

Progress in the health sector was achieved through the implementation of a fee exemption policy
for maternal deliveries in the four deprived regions.       This program was expanded to two
additional regions and adequately funded in the 2004 budget, using HIPC resources. Supervised
deliveries rose to 53 percent by 2004, up from 49 percent in 2002; this increase was particularly
pronounced in the deprived regions. The HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among pregnant women
dropped to 3.1 percent in early 2005, down from 3.6 percent in 2003. Efforts to contain the
spread of HIV/AIDS involved the implementation of Government-sponsored HIV/AIDS
community­based programs, which became fully operational in 200 communities with activities
ranging from awareness creation and advocacy, to support to orphans, vulnerable children, and to
people living with HIV/AIDS. In the area of assisting the poor and vulnerable, a pilot program
targeted at vulnerable street children became operational, reaching 1700 children through
vocation and formal training. A national water policy was also developed and deprived districts
were supported in planning water and sanitation plans. However, although poverty-related



                                                 8

expenditures rose to 7.7 percent of GDP by end-2004, up from 6.5 percent at end-2003, budget
execution was very uneven across sectors, with agriculture, rural electricity, basic education, and
feeder roads programs reporting high execution rates and primary health and rural water reporting
much lower rates.

Governance and Public Sector Management Strengthening. Progress under this component
focused on laying the legislative groundwork for decentralization; developing a strategy for
public sector reform; PEM strengthening; drafting key governance legislation; and upgrading the
M&E system. Progress on the decentralization and public sector reform agenda consisted of the
establishment of the Office of Accountability in the Office of the President; the inauguration of
an in-country Peer Review Council for the Africa Peer Review Mechanism (APRM); and
Government funding for the Electoral Commission's preparation of the 2004 National Elections -
- more specifically the voter registration exercise. Important pieces of legislation -- the Freedom
of Information and the Whistle Blower bills -- were submitted to Cabinet in April 2004 to further
enhance the transparency and accountability of public institutions.

Less progress was made, however, in public sector reform aimed at improving the service
delivery capacity of the civil and public service, including implementing a professional human
resources framework; commencing organizational restructuring of the civil service; and
establishing a regulatory framework for SAs and continuing the restructuring of selected SAs.
Delays in these areas occurred owing to the sensitive nature of the reforms, the resultant need for
extensive consultations with stakeholders, and the fact that the work was carried out by a
relatively small team.

As part of actions aimed at improving public expenditure management, the President signed into
law the Financial Administration Act (FAA), the Internal Audit Agency Act (IAA), and the
Public Procurement Act (PPA). The FAA defined the duties and responsibilities of the Minister
of Finance and the Controller and Account General in managing public resources. The IAA
enabled the establishment of an apex body to coordinate, facilitate and provide quality assurance
for internal audit controls in Government ministries and agencies. The implementation of the
PPA aimed at attaining greater value for public money spent on goods and services. Budget
reporting was strengthened with the help of new computer-based information and accounting
management system (BPEMS), which was installed in the Ministries of Education, Health, Roads
and Transport.     Specific results include (i) monthly (commitment and expenditure) budget
execution reports reconciled with the Bank of Ghana produced with no more than 8 weeks lag;
and (ii) quarterly report on the execution of poverty-related expenditures produced with no more
than 8 weeks lag. Finally, M&E capacity was improved with the completion of the 2003 GPRS
APR, the implementation of the GPRS M&E plan, and several Poverty and Social Impact
Analyses (PSIAs) conducted in 2003 and early 2004.

PRSC-3: Progress under PRSC-3 was broadly satisfactory, but the Government did not meet all
the prior actions in full before Board presentation of PRSC-3. Most, but not all prior actions were
completed without changes to the original triggers, but some actions were moved to subsequent
PRSCs (see Table 1 below on prior actions). The outcomes of PRSC-3 are discussed below by
program component.

Growth, Income, and Employment Promotion: Macroeconomic management remained prudent in
2005, resulting in strong real GDP growth and macroeconomic stability, notwithstanding a sharp
increase in international crude oil prices. Annual real GDP growth reached 5.9 percent in 2005,
up from 5.6 percent in 2004, and the fiscal deficit continued to shrink, falling to 3.0 percent of
GDP by end-year, down from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2004. The 2005 target for the overall fiscal
deficit was surpassed, with the domestic debt-to-GDP ratio declining further to 11 percent by


                                                  9

end-2005, down from 15 percent at end-2004.           Lower levels of domestic public debt and
moderate inflation (which was 15 percent by end-year, and declined to 9.9 percent by March
2006) allowed, in turn, for nominal interest rates on treasury bills to ease to 11.5 percent by end-
2005, down from 16.4 percent at end-2004. Declining public sector deficits enabled an increase in
the share of credit allocated to the private sector to rise to 55 percent by end-2005, up from
around 50 percent in the previous year. Fiscal management maintained its pro-poor orientation,
however, with poverty-related expenditures increasing to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2005, up from
7.7 percent in 2004.

There was also a further decline in the time required for business registration, falling to 81 days in
2005, down from 85 days in 2004. In the area of power sector reform, primary efforts included
progress to reduce ECG system losses in line with the targets envisioned in the draft proposal for
the Management Support Services Agreement; (ii) settling ECG accounts receivable from
Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) and the Ghana Water Company within 90 days;
and (iii) carrying out a comprehensive tariff review, ensuring that VRA and ECG earn an
adequate return on capital and ensuring that transmission service was separated from the bulk
service tariff in the tariff structure. The ECG's system losses declined marginally, reaching 25.47
percent by end-year, down from 26.54 percent at end-2004, but remained high.

Finally, progress was made in the implementation of the petroleum deregulation program, under
which the importation of crude oil and refined products was handled through competitive
tendering under the supervision of an independent agency ­ the National Petroleum Tender Board
(NPTB).     As part of this deregulation process, there was also a re-alignment of domestic
petroleum prices; although the GoG had resisted raising prices in 2004, domestic retail prices for
petroleum products were adjusted three times during 2005 by the NPTB to automatically reflect
the cost of imported oil, thereby beginning the transition away from Government-set prices.

Human Service Delivery Improvement: Outcomes in the areas of primary school enrolment,
supervised maternal deliveries, HIV/AIDS prevalence rates, and under-5 malaria mortality rates
indicated that the policies pursued under the GPRS were yielding positive results. In the area of
education, Government- controlled fees were eliminated and capitation fees were introduced for
all students attending basic education. As a result, there was an increase in GPER, with the
national GPER reaching 87 percent by mid-2005, up from 81 percent in mid-2003, and the
enrollment rate also improved in all three deprived regions and among girls. Over 8,000 trainee
teachers took part in district sponsorship schemes in the 2004-05 year, with the objective of being
posted back in the districts that sponsored them in order to reduce primary pupil-teacher ratios in
poorer districts in the deprived regions. (This program had become increasingly important
because the primary pupil-teacher ratios in some regions had actually worsened, owing to the
higher GPER reported above.) Finally, textbook-primary pupil ratios continued to improve, both
nationally and in the deprived regions.

In the area of health, the share of overall supervised maternal deliveries rose marginally to 54.2
percent by 2005, up from 52.4 percent in 2002, although there were marked increases in some of
the deprived regions. There was also a further decline in the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among
pregnant women remained at 3.1 percent in early 2005, down from 3.6 percent in 2002. In the
area of malaria prevention, the fatality rate from malaria for children under-five declined from 3.7
percent in 2002 to 2.4 percent in 2005, in part due to an increase (from 10 to 25 percent) of
children sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets. Less encouraging, however, was the decline
in investment in water facilities, following the steady increase in new investment in 2003 and
2005. For example the construction of new boreholes and the completion of small town pipe
systems were, respectively, 21 and 50 percent lower in 2005.

Governance and Public Sector Management Strengthening: Progress in this component primarily
occurred in strengthening public financial management, with improvements in budget coverage,
timelier external auditing of the accounts of the consolidated fund, and in the implementation of
new public procurement and internal audit legislation. The budget coverage was broadened to
include more information on internally generated funds and donor grants. External audit reports
became timelier, with the annual report by the Accountant General being submitted to Parliament
within less of 12 months of the closing of the accounts. Beginning in August 2005 monthly
reports on budget execution were generally completed within six weeks. There was progress in
implementing the new public procurement law, with increased coverage provided by the entity
tender committees and the tender review boards, and -- under the auspices of the new internal
audit agency law -- the number of MDAs submitting internal audit reports began rising.

Progress in the public sector reform area was again slow. Most of the progress in the public
sector reform area in 2005 consisted of preparing and setting up institutional arrangements for the
new public sector reform strategy rather than actual policy outcomes. These steps included the
creation of the Ministry for Public Sector Reform; the submission of the Subvented Agencies
Reform Act to Parliament; and the launching of a broad reach-out program to communicate and
ensure the buy-in of stakeholders. The Government's implementation of other public sector
reform measures, however, was less favorable, particularly in the area of civil service reform. As
a result, the public sector reform trigger was not met, even though these measures were largely
technical in nature and had been chosen precisely because ­ as technical measures ­ they would
be less controversial and easier to enact.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

A number of factors contributed to the largely successful implementation and outcome of these
operations.      Some of these were intrinsic to the operations themselves ­ including strong
Government ownership; extensive donor coordination; and extensive analytical work -- while
others were exogenous to the loans' design, including favorable commodity prices and high levels
of remittances.


Strong Government commitment: The GoG had full ownership of the programs supported by the
PRSC 1-3 because these operations (i) were fully aligned with the GPRS ­ for which the
preparation was led by the Government -- and were consequently highly responsive to the
borrower's circumstances and development priorities; and (ii) important reform measures were
adopted as prior actions for each operation. The PSRC program design drew upon the lessons
learned in previous adjustment operationsv -- primarily the need to ensure Government
"ownership" of the reform process, and the need for realism and selectivity in defining the reform
agenda.vi The program document for PRSC-1 underscored the importance of ensuring ownership
of the reform program for the satisfactory implementation of the country's poverty reduction
strategy. By presupposing and building on strong ownership, the PRSCs addressed a major factor
(i.e., lack of ownership) that led to low evaluation ratings on sustainability in the previous lending
portfolio under the FY01-03 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).vii While most of the actions
completed under the program supported by PRSC-1 focused on laying out the groundwork for
legislative changes, and developing strategies for key areas of the reform agenda, achieving the
expected policy outcomes was contingent on follow up actions that, in some instances, would be
supported by subsequent operations. This condition reinforced the importance of ensuring broad
ownership of the program from the onset, and of building in mechanisms for regular consultations
during implementation.

Effectiveness of donor coordination:                Bilateral and multilateral donor assistance played an
important role through the common MDBS framework. The MDBS aided harmonization by
providing a framework for policy dialogue and decisions linked to progress in the GPRS
implementation, including the use of common triggers by the all DPs, the Bank, the EC, and the
AfDB (except for outcome-based triggers, which the Bank and the AfDB chose not to use to
underpin disbursements) as well as the use of common performance indicators for monitoring and
implementation.

This harmonization increased steadily over time. The Bank and the DPs carried out two joint
missions for the preparation of PRSC-2 which resulted in aligned mission schedules and advance


                                                             13

agreement on policy actions and the timing of future development reviews. As a result, there was
achieved an almost complete overlap between the key policy actions agreed under MDBS 2004
and those envisioned under PRSC-2. The DPs and the GoG also agreed on a joint matrix of
policy actions to be supported by PRSC-3 and MDBS-2005, thereby aligning monitoring and
evaluation frameworks.           This close donor harmonization reduced transaction costs for the
Government by reducing the number of visiting missions and reporting requirements, thereby
freeing Government officials to focus more on program implementation. In addition, the timely
and predictable disbursements of budgetary assistance aided macroeconomic planning and
stability.

Soundness of background analysis: The analytical basis for the PRSCs was sound, drawing on
recently completed work on poverty and social analysis, as well as from country economic and
fiduciary work. Although recent poverty data were not available, a poverty analysis had been
carried out jointly with the Government and which drew on the results of the 1998/99 household
expenditure survey, and allowing the program to focus on policy actions that addressed poverty
equity gaps across regions, and age and gender groups. The analytical work also included two
integrative pieces on growth, poverty and public policy, permitting the program to focus on
critical aspects of the interface between these three areas, as well as a variety of work on fiduciary
arrangements to improve public financial management and public procurement (see Box 1
below).


                                     Box 1: PRSCs 1-3 Analytical Basis



  The specific analytical work that informed each operation included:


  PRSC-1: The 1997 CEM entitled "Ghana ­ Growth, Private Sector, and Poverty Reduction", and the 2001 CEM
  entitled "Ghana ­ International Competitiveness, Opportunities and Challenges Facing Non-Traditional Exports;"
  the FY03 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR); the FY03 Poverty Report entitled "Reducing Poverty
  and Improving Human Development;" the FY03 FIAS study on "Regulatory Barriers to Investment in Ghana;" as
  well as analytical work by the GoG and other DPs


  PRSC-2: PRSC-2 was built on the analytical work carried out in previous years, as described above, as well as the
  FY04 CEM on "Public Policy, Growth, and Poverty;" the FY04 Public Expenditure Review (PER) focusing on
  budget design and implementation; the FY04 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) assessing
  fiduciary risks and arrangements; and the Bank-Fund 2004 HIPC Public Expenditure Assessment and Action Plan
  which assessed the capacity of the public expenditure management system to track poverty-reducing expenditures.
  PRSC-2 was also prepared in parallel with, and in close coordination, with the IMF's three-year PRGF (approved
  May 2003).

  PRSC-3: PRSC-3 was built on analytical work carried out in previous years, as described above, as well as on the
  FY05 CFAA; FY05 PER; and findings of the 2005 External Review of the Public Financial Management
  evaluating budget design and execution.



Remittances: Official remittances from Ghanaians living abroad were strong during the three
operations, reaching an estimated US$780 million in 2003 and exceeding US$1 billion in 2004.
(These figures do not include informal remittances, which the Bank of Ghana believes are
substantial.) These remittances helped to fuel Ghana's strong economic growth from 2003-05, as
well as contributed to the growth of specific sectors such as construction.

Favorable commodity prices: Ghana was also the beneficiary of a substantial improvement in the
terms of trade for cocoa, gold, and timber during this period (although this was offset by rising
petroleum prices from end-2004), and had record cocoa crops in 2003 and 2004. These inflows



                                                         14

enabled Ghana to finance its budget deficit and pay down domestic debt, thereby enabling a
reduction in interest rates, a build-up of foreign reserves, and an improvement in the availability
of credit to the private sector. It also enabled increased allocation to social priorities, despite
increases in petroleum prices.

Some factors affected implementation less positively. One, the implementation of the public
sector reform areas of the PRSCs were slower than anticipated, owing to a lack of government
capacity and the political sensitivities associated with this reform area. Two, wages and salaries
accounted for a large share of overall poverty-related spending, equivalent to 55 percent of all
spending in 2005. While this trend was particularly evident in the basic education and primary
health sectors, by 2005 wages and salaries were beginning to account for higher than anticipated
increases in expenditures in agriculture and other sector programs. As a result, poverty-related
programs did not fully benefit from the available external assistance as wage and salary
commitments ended up accounting for over two-thirds of poverty expenditure. In addition, the
execution of the budget across programs was tilted toward programs with high payrolls, such as
education and health, while more investment-intensive programs, such as rural energy and
agriculture, presented lower budget execution rates.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


M&E Design: M&E design and capabilities were weak at the beginning of the GPRS, but did
strengthen over the three operations. As noted in the program document for PRSC-1, the
Government's M&E capability in 2003 was characterized by: (i) the lack of a M&E framework
to provide oversight over the implementation of the GPRS; (ii) problems in using M&E findings
to adjust Government polices; and (iii) gaps in the availability of poverty-related data and
insufficient use of participatory M&E findings. At that time, the last household survey data on
poverty that were available were from 1998/99, providing an inadequate baseline for measuring
progress under the GPRS. In 2003, a Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ) and the
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) were finalized, providing baseline data on a variety of
poverty, health and other indicators; however.

While the GPRS established a variety of indicators for measuring progress,viii data collection for
both the 2003 and 2004 Annual Progress Reports (2003 and 2004) was made difficult owing to
the (i) lack of feedback and incentives to motivate staff in the MDAs, Regions, and Districts to
institutionalize M&E activities; (ii) inconsistencies in data between the regions and districts; (iii)
challenges of addressing the M&E needs of different stakeholders; and (iv) inadequate resources
for M&E at all levels. As a result, there was only inconsistent reporting of district- and regional-
level indicators. Initial data collection efforts were also limited by the lack of participatory M&E
in the initial years of the program; for example, neither civil society nor Parliament were involved
in the preparation of the first APR (2003), although this was improved upon in the 2004 APR
(and is being expanded still further under GPRS II).

M&E Implementation: M&E implementation strengthened each year under PRSC 1-3. PRSC-
1 focused on establishing a M&E system for the GPRS, while PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 focused on
further strengthening this system. As noted, the first APR ­ which provides the key platform for
M&E of progress towards GPRS targets -- was prepared in 2003 by the National Development
and Planning Council (NDPC) to track the monitoring indicators under GPRS-1. APRs have been
completed for subsequent years of the GPRS; the quality of these assessments has improved over
time, and the 2005 APR was considered by donors to be a strong step forward.




                                                  15

Other improvements in M&E implementation include: (i) better dissemination of the APRs to
Parliamentarians, the MDAs, regional planning and operation officers, and rural communities
(including the use of radio programs and video presentations); (ii) better usage of the APRs to
inform the budget process (beginning with the 2005 budget); and (iii) the introduction of
participatory M&E. Participatory M&E, started on a pilot basis in late 2004 to obtain feedback
from citizens about the extent to which enhanced access to basic services was being achieved at
the community level, and also included the development of citizens report cards to assess
satisfaction with the delivery of basic services (water, education, and health). In addition, the
Government has also established numerous institutional structures for the ongoing review of
GPRS indicators, targets, and policies.ix Less positive, however, is the fact that although the
NDPC ­ which is the Government's main M&E agency ­ has chosen not to draw on tools for
social accountability for which training has been provided, such as the citizen report cards.
Furthermore, the NDPC has had a 50 percent turnover in staff in the last two years, hampering its
ability to carryout M&E and to link the outcome of this M&E back to program design. These
factors could create serious implications for future program quality and undermine M&E
sustainability.

To assess the poverty and social impact of selected policy reforms policies on the poor, four
PSIAs were completed under PRSC 1-3, and technical committees ­ representing a cross-cutting
section of Government and in partnership with local research teams ­ were established to oversee
follow-up measures.x     Appropriate criteria were used to select these studies, including (i)
potential size of impact; (ii) prominence of the issue in the GPRS policy agenda; (iii) the timing
and urgency of policy or reform; (iv) the level of national debate surrounding the reform; and (v)
the lack of existing analysis. Preparation of a new series of M&E PSIAs began in 2005, which
will be applied to updating the GPRS, rather than simply focusing on informing short-term policy
making.

M&E Utilization: M&E utilization has been weak and still needs improvement. The Bank-
Fund JSA of the 2003 APR noted that the APR's main weakness was that it did not draw policy
conclusions and concrete recommendations from its comprehensive analysis and did not identify
links to the development outcomes detailed in the GPRS M&E plan. Accordingly, a key focus of
PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 was on improving the link between policies and outcomes and
institutionalizing the use of data and analysis ­ particularly the APRs and PSIAs -- to better
inform policy decisions and budget allocations. As a result, the APRs have become increasingly
central to the domestic dialogue (e.g., guidance on the budget) and the budget support dialogue,
and some of the PSIAs have been used to inform follow-up actions (e.g., the PSIA on the
economic transformation of the agriculture sector informed the revision of the Food and
Agriculture Sector Development Policy -- FASDEP).

Nevertheless, a number of weaknesses still remain. In general, the 2003 CWIQ, the 2003 DHS,
and the PSIAs have been underused.xi While there was an increase in participatory M&E in 2004
and the results were incorporated into the 2004 APR, feedback mechanisms are still needed to
ensure adequate follow-up of these findings. Budget outcomes are not comprehensively reported,
so M&E cannot feed back effectively; however, the ability to close the loop from M&E back to
program design will be critical to the quality of future programs supported by PRSC 4-7 (see
Section 7.4 below). It is in this context that forthcoming PRSC operations appropriately continue
to focus on strengthening M&E capabilities and building the sustainability of M&E capacity and
utilization.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation




                                                  16

PRSCs 1-3 are being followed by a second series of four annual operations covering the period
2006-2009 and supporting the implementation of the GPRS I,, in line with the 2004 CAS
Progress Report. The design of this new series was coordinated with the other DPs that
participated in the MDBS framework supporting the first GPRS, and the MDBS framework will
continue to be used. This new series of operations is focusing on the three broad components of
GPRS II: (i) accelerated private sector-led growth, (ii) vigorous human resources development,
and (iii) strengthened good governance and civic responsibility. A key element of the GPRS II is
a focus on the macroeconomic environment as a platform to generate growth, rather just an area
where performance stability needs to be maintained.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Bank's strategy to progressively increase the share of assistance developed programmatically
through the PRSCs became central to the Bank's FY04-07 CAS and accounted for around 50
percent of overall Bank lending during the CAS period. The CAS itself was firmly rooted in the
Strategic Framework for IDA in Africa (SFIA) and the West Africa Regional Integration
Assistance Strategy. The CAS also included several non-lending activities that provided the
analytical underpinnings for the PRSCs' support to strengthening fiduciary arrangements,
including PERs, CFAAs, and CPARs. The CAS itself was properly driven by the PRSP and was
developed through extensive consultations with Government, stakeholders, and civil society. As
a result, it was closely aligned with the GPRS program and focus.xii The three broad components
of the PRSCs encompassed the five thematic pillars of the GPRS and were compatible with the
MDGs (see Annex 9 for a figurative representation of the close alignment of the CAS, GPRS, and
the PRSCs). xiii The consistency between the CAS, GPRS, and the PRSCs was further reinforced
by the fact that the PRSCs were an integral part of the larger and concerted MDBS effort which
focused on strengthening the complementarity between the GPRS and inflows of development
assistance.

The PRSCs were complemented by a series of specific investment and technical assistance
operations, covering the education sector, HIV/AIDS, public sector reform, and finance and
private sector development. These operations were also consistent with other Bank lending to
support poverty reduction, most particularly the Community Based Rural Development aimed at
reducing rural poverty; the second phase of the Community Water and Sanitation APL to increase
coverage of      improved water and sanitation services; and the Community Based Poverty
Alleviation LIL testing approaches and mechanisms for achieving community-based poverty
reduction through improved nutrition, food security, and support to street children, among others.
Project design was also sound because it maintained a focus on monitoring poverty outcomes to
ensure that sector programs delivered results in terms of human development indicators that are
directly relevant to the MDGs.

Under the PRSCs, disbursements took place at project effectiveness based on the Government's
satisfactory accomplishment of prior actions. This design ensured that key essential reforms
needed to support the goals of each phase of the PRSC program would be enacted up-front,
giving this lending mechanism advantages over structural adjustment credits used previously. As
seen in Table 1 above, the prior actions show a consistent unfolding of a reform package designed
to support the implementation of the GPRS, and ensuring a high level of continuity from
operation to operation. By channeling resources through the budget, instead of through projects
where Government decision-making is limited, the MDBS fostered decision-making by the
Ministry of Finance, Cabinet, and Parliament, giving these entities a greater stake in the pro-poor



                                                17

agenda, sound financial management, and decision-making, thereby enhancing democratic
accountability.xiv

It should be noted, however, that the decision to utilize this type of lending instrument -- rather
than a conditionality-based operation where tranche release(s) were dependent upon the
completion of specified actions ­ was not without risk. Ghana's performance under the two
previous credits (Economic Support Reform Operations II and III) was uneven,                        xv and the
approaching 2004 elections ­ which in previous years had always been accompanied by weak
macroeconomic management ­ augured poorly for the success of the Government program
supported by PRSC-1; and in fact, delays in actions to encourage private sector development and
carry out the public sector reform agenda in 2003 did raise legitimate questions at the time about
the sustainability of the advances under PRSC-1. Nonetheless, the risk of going ahead with this
type of instrument was warranted given that the approach used under ERSO II and III was not
entirely successful in fostering significant or sustained reforms (particularly in the areas of public
sector reform, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reform of the energy sector).

In contrast to typical Bank practice, PRSC-1 was developed ahead of the finalization of the FY04
CAS, (which typically would have provided the strategic context for the PRSC), and the
conclusion of the FY03 CFAA (which would have updated the knowledge required for the
definition of prior actions and triggers in the area of fiduciary safeguards). There were, however,
four rationales for moving forward with the PRSC. One, it was felt that the FY00 CAS and the
upstream work on the FY04 CAS provided enough clarification of the strategic context for the
PRSC-1. Two, on the analytical side, the FY01 CFAA and the mission report of the FY03
CFAA-update provided sufficient inputs for the design of the prior actions and triggers of PRSC-
1. Three, and perhaps most importantly, the Ghanaian authorities requested that the Bank show
its support to the GPRS early, and align that support with the GPRS implementation timeframe in
order to sustain the national enthusiasm that had been built around the program. Finally, the
choice was also influenced by the Bank's need to maintain its key role among the DPs who were
moving ahead with multi-year budgetary assistance. While this approach was not without risks
given the need to keep improving the fiduciary framework, it appears to have succeeded both in
maintaining the momentum built under the GPRS and unifying the Bank's assistance with the
other DPs.

The program document for each PRSC identified a number of risks to each operation, as well as
reasonable mitigating factors offsetting those risks, as shown in Box 2 below. The risk of
electorally-induced economic slippages was correctly identified, incorporating the lessons learned
from previous election cycles in Ghana. Three risks ­ fiduciary risks, capacity limitations, and
exogenous shocks ­ were common to all three operations, but were in fact intrinsically addressed
by the very nature of the actions implemented under the programmatic series (e.g., PEM
strengthening and capacity building), or by the nature of the MDBS framework, which provided a
forum ensuring access to emergency financing (as long as the program remained sound).

                       Box 2: Identified Risks and Mitigating Factors, PRSC 1-3

                                                 in budget management & greater focus on fiscal transparency,
                                                 Parliamentary oversight, & budget account disclosures -- all part of
                                                 GPRS process.

                                                 will make TA necessary if needed.

Finally, program design correctly included the energy sector. This inclusion -- which occurred as
a result of the Bank's urging -- was initially opposed by some DPs who argued that the energy
sector was not a sufficiently cross-cutting issue to be included.                        In retrospect, the Bank's
persuasiveness on including this focus was well advised, as energy issues continue to play a
significant role in the economy. As discussed further below, progress in the energy sector was
slow and the sector is currently in crisis; however, this reflects the political sensitivity of these
reforms, rather than poor program design or insufficient attention by the Bank.

Nonetheless, while the PRSC 1-3 were a well designed and implemented series of operations that
were clearly aligned with both the Bank and the borrower's objectives, program design did suffer
from a number of weaknesses. A principal weakness was the fact that water and sanitation-
related actions were not included under PRSC-1 but were added to the PRSC agenda under
PRSC-3 after the DHS Survey indicated deterioration in infant morality and under-5 mortality
rates between 1997 and 2003. While this omission in part reflected the time needed to better
align DP priorities in this area under the MDBS framework, it is regrettable, given the clear and
direct link between access to safe water and sanitation and positive health outcomes, and that
increasing access to water and sanitation is the most important infrastructure investment for
achieving the human development MDGs.xvi The omission of this area essentially meant that
improvements in human development indicators resulting from water and sanitation interventions
were delayed by two years.

A second weakness in program design is the fact that none of the poverty survey instruments
correspond to the period of time covered by the PRSC operations. While extensive work has
been done on implementing and strengthening the Ghanaian M&E system for tracking poverty-
related trends, there is no survey instrument aligned with this programmatic series of operations.
The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS5) was not completed as originally planned and the
results were not expected to be available until end-2006. The DHS and CWIQ were last
completed in 2003 and will not be carried out again until 2008. Thus, while some poverty-related
impacts are measured (e.g., GPER), there is no measure of poverty headcount or distribution to
inform either the evaluation of PRSC 1-3 or to inform the design and implementation of the next
programmatic series of operations.

Program assessment is also made difficult by the complexity of the program design. While a
policy matrix ­ which set forth the (i) policy objectives; (ii) actions to be completed under each
component in each operation and the two succeeding operations; and (iii) expected outcomes --
was included in the program document for each PRSC, these matrices are inconsistent over the
program period. The extensiveness of the areas covered under the PRSCs ­ as well as the
multiplicity of donors, each with somewhat different priorities resulted in a complex policy
matrix containing multiple monitorable outcomes (e.g., 51 in total in the policy matrix for PRSC-
1). Under PRSC-2, however, 13 of these original outcomes were either eliminated entirely, or
were replaced by new outcomes; in some cases, the outcomes remained the same but the
quantification was removed, which makes performance assessment subjective and difficult.
Finally, for some outcomes the wording was changed so that while still similar, they were not
precisely the same; again, this makes it difficult to assess performance across the range of these
operations.xvii While some of the changes between PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 can be attributed to the
agreement on a harmonized performance framework under the MDBS, not all of them can,
because a number of the outcome indicators that were modified under PRSC-2 were subsequently
eliminated under PRSC-3, when still more new indicators were added. Many of these changes
may have been for sound reasons -- for example, identification of a more representative indicator
­ while others may have been made to accommodate the varying priorities of the DPs and to
ensure harmony under the MDBS. Nonetheless it impedes an effective evaluation of program
progress across the entire programmatic series of operations in accordance with ICR
requirements.xviii


3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The key policy achievements that were achieved under the PRSC operations are discussed below;
additional details can be found in Annex 1 which contains a detailed policy matrix of all the
PRSC 1-3's policy objectives, expected outcomes, and actual outcomes.

Overall Outcomes of PRSC 1-3: In the area of promoting growth, investment, and employment,
accelerated economic growth coincided with macroeconomic stabilization under the PRSC 1-3
series. GDP growth averaged 5.6 percent, rising from 4 percent a year during 2000-02, and real
GDP per capita increased accordingly (see Table 2 below). End-period inflation was nearly
halved to 14.3 percent from an average of 24.3 percent during 2000-02; the cedi stabilized against
the US dollar; gross international reserves were built up; and the goal of halving the stock of
government domestic debt relative to GDP ­ a key anchor in the fiscal program aimed at
"crowding in "private sector access to financial resources ­ was achieved. Domestically financed
public spending on pro-poor services was also increased from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2002 to 8.2
percent in 2005. The business environment was improved through a reduction in clearance
procedures at the seaports and a decrease in the number of days needed to register a business.
Finally, in the area of sectoral reforms, Ghana made strong progress in moving petroleum and



                                                20

electric power prices to reflect world market prices and the costs of production, albeit with some
delays. The Government also established mechanisms for evidence-based adjustments in these
areas, thus reducing political pressures for delays when prices needed to be raised.

Less positively, only limited progress was made in reducing ECG system losses, which declined
only marginally (from 26 percent in 2002 to 25.5 percent at end-2005, far short of the target of 18
percent).xix Likewise, electricity subsidies continue to be high, as VRA supplies energy to the
aluminum smelter (the Volta Aluminum Company -- VALCO) at 2.7 cents per kwh, compared to
its marginal cost of 10 cents per kwh, and continued weaknesses in the energy sector may have
negative implications for future growth and operations (discussed further in Section 9 below).xx
Finally, although the time needed to register a new business was reduced by 48 days (to 81 days)
under PRSC 1-3, this is still among the highest in the region, underscoring the need for continued
progress.

In terms of improved service delivery for human development, there was encouraging progress in
expanding access to education and health services. Gross primary enrollment rates reached 92
percent by the 2005-06, up from 81 percent in mid-2003. The gender parity index narrowed,
although the 2005 MDG of equality appears not to have been achieved. Supervised maternal
deliveries rose slightly at the national level, almost 2 percentage points, to about 54 percent, from
2002 to 2005. In both gross primary enrollment and supervised maternal deliveries, marked
improvements occurred in the four relatively deprived regions. The HIV/AIDS prevalence rate
among pregnant women fell to 3.1 percent in 2005 from 3.6 percent in 2003 (and declined further
to 2.9 percent by 2006). In addition, the under-five mortality rate due to malaria fell from 3.7
percent in 2002 to 2.4 percent in 2005. Other key health indicators, however, have shown little
improvement. The indicators for maternal and infant mortality stagnated and child malnutrition
worsened in a few of the regions. A participatory survey carried out by a group of NGOs in
2004-05 corroborated these findings at the grass-roots level, and the responses in the survey were
extremely critical across a range of services in health and education with respect to the quality of
these services.xxi



In the area of governance and public sector management strengthening, progress has been mixed,
despite clear steps in selected areas. Progress under this component was reported primarily in
strengthening public financial management, with improvements in budget coverage, timelier
external auditing of the accounts of the consolidated fund, and in the implementation of new
public procurement and internal audit legislation.xxii External audit reports became timelier, with
the annual report by the Accountant General being submitted to Parliament within less than 12
months of the closing of the accounts. There was also progress in implementing the new public
procurement law, with increased coverage provided by the entity tender committees and the
tender review boards. Under the new internal audit agency law, the number of MDAs submitting
internal audit reports began rising. Less positively, some actions which seemed like important
reform achievements at the time of implementation have not had a real impact or their impact has
been slow to be realized. For example, while the Freedom of Information Act was submitted to
Cabinet in 2004, it has still not been passed into law. Similarly, while the BPEMS was installed
in the Ministries of Road/Transport and Education under PRSC-2, it was not used for processing
transactions or producing reports until 2006,xxiii and the establishment of Office of Accountability
in the Office of the President still lacks sufficient funding or capacity building to fulfill its
mandate. Progress in public sector reform and on the decentralization agenda was also slow
throughout the PRSCs, and the implementation of approved reform programs needs to be
accelerated to improve productivity in the public sector and empower local authorities.xxiv As
discussed in Section 9 below, these delays in reform may have negative implications for future
operations, as budget support provided through the PRSCs and other MDBS flows was primarily



                                                  21

used to replenish the country's reserves and to reduce domestic debt, rather than going into
service delivery that would have tested the absorptive capacity of the country.           As donor
resources continue to flow to poverty-related areas, however, the effectiveness of this funding
risks being compromised if the capacity, performance, integrity, and efficiency of the public
service is not improved further.xxv

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating


 Rating:


 PRSC-1       Satisfactory
 PRSC-2       Satisfactory
 PRSC-3       Satisfactory


All three of these operations are rated satisfactory. The operations' development objectives were
satisfactorily achieved in an efficient fashion, and, as discussed above, the PRSCs' objectives,
design, implementation, and outcomes were highly relevant to country circumstances and
development priorities and were highly consistent with Bank strategies and goals.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty: A number of measures under the PRSCs reflected more effective targeting of the poor
by removing financial barriers to health and education. These were directly related to the goal of
achieving the MDGs and included: (i) the introduction of scholarships to enable girls to complete
primary school in deprived districts (PRSC-2); (ii) elimination of Government-controlled school
fees for primary school pupils in deprived areas (PRSC-2) and subsequently nationwide (PRSC-
3); (iii) reforming the exemption system to provide health system subsidies for the poorest (PRSC
1-3); and (iv) funding maternal delivery exemptions (PRSC 1-3). In addition, a number of these
policies gave first priority to the three most deprived regions, thereby helping to address regional
disparities in poverty.

In addition, there were a number of broader measures to address non-income dimensions of
poverty, also in accordance with achieving the MDGs. These include: (i) increasing resources for
education going to deprived districts (PRSC 1-3); (ii) implementing Community-based Health



                                                  22

Planning and Services (PRSC-1); (iii) implementing a high impact rapid delivery program for
under-five mortality and maternal mortality rates (PRSC-1); (iv) implementing community
initiatives to prevent HIV transmission and provide care to PLWHAs, AIDS orphans, and
families (PRSC 1-2); (v) implementing a teacher retention scheme (PRSC 2-3); and (vi) ensuring
timely delivery of textbooks for primary schools (PRSC 2-3). All of these measures were also
targeted at the most deprived regions in order address regional disparities in poverty.

The positive outcomes (detailed above in Section 8.2) relating to primary school enrollment,
supervised maternal deliveries, HIV/AIDS prevalence rates, and under-5 malaria fatality rates
indicate that the human development policies supported by the PRSCs were appropriate. Less
progress was shown for the health indicators, however, with targets being missed in the areas of
child malnutrition, under-five mortality rates, maternal mortality, and infant mortality; although
the lack of data subsequent to the 2003 DHS means that a conclusive assessment of these targets
is not yet possible for these operations.xxvi

It is not possible to assess the broader impact of the PRSCs on poverty headcount at this time
owing to the lack of data. Although domestically financed public spending on pro-poor basic
services increased from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2002 to 8.2 percent in 2005, not all such spending
necessarily translates into poverty reduction; for example, wages and salaries accounted for 55
percent of overall poverty-related spending in 2005, and much of the increase in the wage bill
was due to higher salaries, rather than an increase in employment. Notwithstanding the lack of
data, however, Ghana's economic growth during PRSC 1-3 may have had a favorable impact on
poverty. The reduction in poverty that occurred between 1997 and 2003 was primarily due to the
acceleration in economic growth (although a reduction in inequality also contributed). Given
Ghana's strong economic growth during 2003-05, as well as the high level of remittances,xxvii it is
probable that poverty continued to decline under PRSC 1-3; however, the distributional impact of
this growth on poverty may be skewed to the Western, Volta, Ashanti, and Brong Ahafo regions,
where production of cocoa, timber, and gold exports is concentrated, rather than to poverty-
endemic areas.

Gender: To promote gender equity in enrollment and retention, all Government-controlled fees
were eliminated and scholarships were introduced to enable girls to complete primary school in
deprived districts. The resulting improvement in female enrollment clearly had a positive gender
impact. In the longer term, this is likely to have a positive impact on poverty reduction as there is
a strong gender dimension to poverty in Ghana, with gender inequalities reflecting differences in
access to education. The omission of a water focus from PRSC 1-2, however, may have had
negative gender implications, as women are traditionally responsible for water provision for
domestic purposes, and carry heavier burdens in the quest for water. As noted, the gender parity
index is narrowing, but the 2005 MDG of equality may not have been achieved. Finally, there is
no gender-specific budgeting that would ensure budgetary expenditures with specific gender
outcomes.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional development impact of the reform measures implemented under PRSC 1-3 was
substantial. Many of the reforms implemented were the genesis for important institutional
innovations. The latter includes the amendment of the Volta River Authority (VRA) Act, and the
new Financial Administration, Internal Audit Agency and Public Procurement Acts (FAA, IAA
and PPA). The amendment of the VRA established the legal basis for the separation of power
transmission from generation. Similarly, the FAA implied a new framework for the management
of state resources, leading to clearer reporting responsibilities and greater accountability within



                                                 23

the public sector. Finally, the IAA established the legal basis for setting up an apex body to
coordinate, facilitate and provide quality assurance for Internal audit controls in government
ministries and agencies, while the PPA strengthened the public procurement institutions,
including the creation of a Public Procurement Board, aimed at reviewing procurement practices
within the public sector and at increasing accountability throughout the public sector.

An indirect and intangible impact of the MDBS process has been the apparent strengthening of
the MoFEP which is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the MDBS/PRSC program.
The Government led the development of the GPRS and a consequence of the MDBS process has
been a further increase in ownership by the Government and a shift to a greater emphasis on the
national budget process. GoG officials state that the MDBS has led to a greater focus on
improving intra-government coordination and setting priorities.xxviii As a consequence of the
greater focus on the budget process, the MoFEP has emerged as an increasingly important and
active institution and has reportedly found it easier to recruit and retain staff, thereby improving
the Ministry's capacity and capabilities over the course of PRSC 1-3.xxix            In addition, by
strengthening the links between the GPRS and the budgetary process, there has been a greater
involvement of key decision-makers in budget preparation, thereby strengthening the integration
of cross-sectoral issues.

Although the capacity of the MOFEP has strengthened over the course of PRSC 1-3, it is less
certain that the capacity of key poverty-related ministries such as Health and Education have been
significantly improved. The lack of progress on the public sector reform aspects of the PRSCs
means that the capacity of the Ghanaian civil services remains very weak. This weakness may
negatively affect program implementation in subsequent PRSCs as the next phase of reforms will
be more capacity-intensive as greater efforts are spent on expanding and improving core services
and because of the significant debt reduction that has already occurred.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

During the PRSC 1-3, budget allocations to poverty-related programs increased fairly steadily,
rising from 4.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to 8.5 percent of a (larger) GDP in 2005. Spending on
wages and salaries in both 2003 and 2004, however, ended up accounting for a larger-than-
anticipated share of poverty-related expenditures, thereby reducing the amounts available for non-
wage expenditures such as school textbooks and medical drugs which tend to be positively
correlated with the quality of service delivery. The increase in spending on wages and salaries
was particularly pronounced in agriculture, primary health, and feeder roads programs, where the
increases exceeded the overall increase in spending on poverty-related expenditures, reflecting
delays in carrying out investments in these three programs.xxx

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating:


 PRSC-1       Moderate
 PRSC-2       Moderate
 PRSC-3       Moderate


Any assessment of development outcome is necessarily predicated on both the continuation of
sound macroeconomic polices to foster continued economic growth and sustained inflows of
external remittances and official transfers, particularly since domestic resources are insufficient to
finance the GPRS II.         Nonetheless, future sustainability is supported by the fact that



                                                  24

macroeconomic policy-making remains sound.xxxi PRSC-3 took place in the fourth year of
economic expansion, and macroeconomic performance under PRSC-4 remained positive, with
estimated GDP growth of 6 percent; strong expansion in agriculture and mining; a decline in
twelve-month inflation from 14.8 percent at end-2005 to 10.5 percent in June 2006 (despite
significant upward adjustments of domestic petroleum prices); and further narrowing of the
external current account deficit resulting from new gold production, an increase in cocoa exports,
and continued strong remittance flows (which are estimated to increase to 17 percent of GDP in
2006, up from 15 percent in 2005). Moreover, the introduction of a petroleum pricing formula has
addressed what had been a perennial problem with substantial negative macroeconomic impacts
in Ghana ­ i.e., the failure to implement timely petroleum price adjustments ­ and the continued
use of this formula should help shore up future macroeconomic stability.xxxii In addition, donor
commitment remains strong, which augurs well for continued flows of budgetary and other
assistance.

In addition, the institutional creation and strengthening that occurred under the PRSCs will also
aid sustainability. Many of the measures implemented under PRSC 1-3 have created structures
that will not easily be dismantled; for example the audit units, procurement board, and land
registries. A number of legal actions ­ for example, the FAA, the PPB and the IAA ­ cannot be
easily reversed. In addition, improvements in processes such as budget management and external
auditing are self-reinforcing and contribute to good outcomes.

Finally, sustainability is supported by the Government's development of GPRS-II, including a
prioritized result matrix, an aid harmonization and effectiveness action plan, and a support
overview indicating actual and projected disbursements by DPs by sector and pillar. This
indicates the GoG's commitment to moving forward with its poverty reduction agenda and
facilitates the alignment of future DP support with national strategies and the budget, thereby
aiding implementation and increasing the likelihood of continued positive progress. In addition,
the strong involvement of civil society and other groups in the development of GPRS-II, and the
growing use of participatory M&E, makes sustained national commitment to the program more
likely. Implementation of successor programmatic operations (PRSC 4-7), and continuation of
the MDBS framework in support of GPRS II, will help maintain the development outcomes
achieved under PRSC 1-3 by providing continued budget and other assistance.

Notwithstanding these favorable influences, however, several factors remain that could pose a
risk to development outcomes. These include: (i) the continued appreciation of the cedi (which
has increased about 20 percent in trade-weighted terms over the last two years) which would slow
export growth; (ii) remaining fiduciary weaknesses that might limit the impact of the program and
lead to only partial funding from Ghana's DPs; and (iii) as with any country with a narrow
economic base, substantial terms of trade shocks or reductions in remittances that could
undermine macroeconomic performance. There are, however, mitigating factors that lessen the
likelihood of some these risks.       They include (i) the fact that the cedi has been recently
undervalued and the prospect of lower energy import bills in the near future once the investments
in the West African gas pipeline are completed; and (ii) continuing progress on strengthening the
PEM regulatory framework and budget management. Finally, the risk of exogenous shocks is
offset by Ghana's track record of prudent economic management and the excellent relations it
maintains with the MDBS partners, providing access to emergency finance if needed (assuming
positive program progress).

More troubling, however, are the larger threats to sustainability stemming from the energy and
public sectors. The energy sector remains problematic. The introduction of a petroleum pricing
formula was a significant achievement, and similarly, recent initiatives to, inter alia, earmark



                                                 25

budget funds to compensate VRA for the differences in cost of generation and sale of power to
VALCO are addressing the quasi-fiscal deficits stemming delays in adjusting electricity tariffs
and continued sales of power at subsidized rates to VALCO. Continued economic growth,
however is predicated on successfully addressing a myriad of energy sector issues; energy sector
reforms, however, have been a thorny issue for successive Governments since the 1990s, the
reforms that remain to be achieved are complex, and power shortages are expected to depress
GDP in 2007.xxxiii Finally, while the GoG is addressing VALCO's deficits, the Government's
plans to undertake non-concessional borrowing raises questions about future debt sustainability.
xxxiv



Sustainability is also threatened by the slow progress on public sector reforms under PRSC 1-3.
The large size of the public sector continues to constrain economic expansion by limiting private
sector growth and reducing the scope for fiscal management. Many health targets were missed,
and as noted above, the use of external assistance over 2003-05 to pay down debt and replenish
reserves did not test the public sector's ability to spend increased resources effectively, yet such
delivery is essential to ensuring that poverty is attacked comprehensively. Moreover, economic
growth, although strong, is threatened by the large size of the wage bill, which is the fastest
growing expenditure item in the budget, and which increased significantly in the 2007 budget
statement.xxxv High wages and salaries also absorb a large proportion of recurrent expenditures in
education and health, thereby reducing funds available for items such as textbooks,
pharmaceuticals, or clinics.xxxvi Finally, reforms in both the public sector and in the energy area
will have to place in the context of the approaching 2008 election which is likely to slow progress
on politically difficult issues such as wages.

The chief mitigating factors to these more substantive risks include the Government's
considerable commitment to moving forward with the GPRS-II, as discussed above, and the
effectiveness of the policy dialogue between the Government and its MDBS partners.                In
addition, PRSCs 4-7 continue to focus on cross-cutting issues such as public sector reform and
decentralization, and the Bank's Economic Management Capacity Building project (US$25 m.
FY06-11) aims at improving the efficiency of public sector management and enhancing the
quality of service delivery. Notwithstanding the efforts of the Bank and the other DPs to mitigate
these risks, however, realism requires an upfront recognition that reform progress is likely to slow
in the run-up to the 2008 elections.

PRSC- 1:       The overall objectives of the PRSCs were well aligned with Government's
development agenda, priorities, and policies, as set out in the GPRS and they became a central
element of the CAS. As noted, lessons learned from past adjustment operations regarding the
need for government ownership were incorporated in the design of the PRSC program and risk
assessment and mitigating measures were appropriate. Similarly noted above, in preparing



                                                 26

PRSC-1 the Bank built on substantial analytical work already available on the country. In
preparing and supervising the credit, the Bank worked closely with the IMF and the DPs
participating in the MDBS, allowing the program to harmonize with -- rather than duplicate -- the
implementation of ongoing sector programs and projects.           Collaboration and joint support
between the IMF and Bank for implementation of the GPRS is evidenced through joint
assessments of the 2003 APR. Credit disbursement procedures followed the Bank's disbursement
procedures for development policy credits. Finally, the outcomes of PRSC-1 were sustained
through the development and implementation of subsequent operations (PRSC-2 and PRSC-3).

PRSC-2: Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory during credit preparation and appraisal.
PRSC-2 was prepared in parallel and in close coordination with IMF's PRGF, following the
agreed institutional division of labor with the IMF taking the lead on macro-economic sector
issues, and the macroeconomic impact of issues such as public sector reform, while the Bank took
the lead on structural and social issues. Collaboration and joint support for the implementation of
the PRSC is evidenced through the joint assessment of the 2004 APR, the 2004 HIPC
Expenditure Tracking Assessment and Action Plan, and the mid-2004 assessment of progress
toward the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. In the number of areas where
the mandates of the two institutions overlapped, such as energy sector reforms, the work was
coordinated to ensure that consistent advice was provided to the Borrower.

PRSC-2 also further deepened the harmonization of donor practices. In the run up to the
preparation of the program, development partners carried out two joint missions (June and
September 2003) that were important first steps in aligning mission schedules and advancing
agreements on policy actions and on the timing of future assessment reviews. These efforts led to
a better alignment of programs for 2004, with an almost complete overlap between key policy
actions agreed under the MDBS 2004 and those envisioned under PRSC-2. The objectives of the
PRSC-2 were also well aligned with Government's development agenda, priorities and policies,
as set out in the GPRS. Lessons learned from the implementation of the PRSC-1 ­ primarily, the
need for closer coordination with the DPsxxxvii -- were incorporated in the design of the PRSC-2,
allowing the PRSC-2 to draw from work on poverty and social analysis, as well as from country
economic and fiduciary work completed earlier. Finally, the outcomes of PRSC-2 were sustained
through the development and implementation of subsequent operations (PRSC-3).

PRSC-3: The appraisal mission for PRSC-3 was carried out during the joint 2004
supervisory missions which were again conducted in close coordination with the MDBS
partners. (Under the MDBS framework, a minimum of two review and appraisal missions
must take place each year). This joint work further deepened the cooperation among the
DPs, thereby ensuring agreements on policy actions and the timing of future assessment
reviews, and producing a strong alignment of programs for 2005 and 2006. Finally, the
outcomes of PRSC-3 were sustained through the development and implementation of the
subsequent operation (PRSC 4).

PRSC-1: Supervision of progress against the 2003 triggers was conducted through a joint
MDBS/PRSC mission by the Bank and other DPs. Supervision was thorough, and in fact could
not be cursory owing to the nature of the MDBS framework and the number of donors.
Supervisory missions contained an appropriate mixture of expertise in the areas of
macroeconomics, health, agriculture, financial management, natural resources, operations,
procurement, and education. Macroeconomic supervision was exercised through the IMF's
PRGF program (approved May 2003) and the IMF Resident Representative in Accra.

PRSC-2:        Supervision of the credit occurred through joint MDBS/PRSC missions which
included observers from the US, French, and Japanese development agencies, as well as
representatives from multilateral agencies such as UNDP and WHO, as well as a Bank mission.
Bank supervision was therefore aligned with the activities of other donors, focusing on the year-
long verification process that monitored implementation of the policies supported by the
PRSC/MDBS and identified how to best measure the completion of the agreed policy actions.
Supervisory missions also contained an appropriate mixture of personnel relevant to the policy
areas of PRSC-2. Program implementation was also monitored through a series of standardized
reports produced at pre-defined intervals; these reporting requirements were established as part of
the MDBS framework and improved the Bank supervisory capabilities during PRSC-2 and
subsequent operations (see Box 3 below). Finally, macroeconomic supervision was exercised
through the IMF's three-year PRGF) and the IMF Resident Representative.

                             Box 3: GoG Reporting Under the PRSC/MDBS

1. Quarterly reports on macro-economic developments to assess progress on the implementation of the framework
agreed between the Government, the IMF and the World Bank, with a lag of no more than 8 weeks after the end of
each quarter.

2. Quarterly reports on budget expenditures with breakdown by Ministry, Department and Agency with a lag of no
more than 8 weeks after the end of each quarter. These reports will also present the breakdown for Items 1-4 of the
Ghanaian budget.

3. Quarterly reports on domestically financed poverty-related expenditures (including HIPC-financed expenditures),
with a lag of no more than 8 weeks after the end of each quarter. These reports would include a breakdown along main
poverty-related expenditure programs (education, health, etc.) and a breakdown for Items 1-4 of the Ghanaian budget
(personnel, administration, services, investment)

4. A joint Aide-Memoire from the Review and Appraisal sessions reporting on the Progress Assessment Framework
and triggers/targets (completed by the GoG with its DPs)

5. Selected-flows audit (in advance of the first review and appraisal session).

6. Annual report (not later than March) on progress on the implementation of the GPRS.


PRSC-3: Bank supervision was aligned with the activities of other donors, focusing on the year-
long verification process that monitors implementation of the policies supported by the
PRSC/MDBS and identified how to best measure the completion of the agreed policy actions.
Supervisory missions again contained an appropriate mixture of personnel relevant to the policy
areas of PRSC-3. As with PRSC-2, program implementation was also monitored through a series
of standardized reports produced at pre-defined intervals, and macroeconomic supervision was
exercised through the IMF's PRGF and the IMF Resident Representative.

During the joint MDBS-/PRSC review mission from April-June 2005, the GoG agreed that only
four of the six subsets formulated in the 2005 Technical Annex to the MDBS-Framework
Memorandum had been fully achieved. The Bank nevertheless felt that there was sufficient
progress in all the actions envisioned under the PRSC-3 policy matrix, although the bilateral DPs
and the EC decided to release only two-thirds of their performance tranche.xxxviii This action by
the Bank reflected flexibility, in that decisions about tranche release were based on overall

progress, rather than exact compliance with specific trigger indicators, in cases where mitigating
circumstances existed.




(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

As Bank performance for both quality at entry and supervision was rated satisfactory, overall
Bank performance is rated satisfactory in accordance with the ICRR harmonized evaluation
criteria guidelines.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

    Rating: Satisfactory

PRSC-1: Overall Borrower performance was also satisfactory. The joint Bank-IMF staff
assessment of the GPRS had already underscored the soundness of the GPRS framework for
implementing the Government's poverty reduction agenda.            Areas that received particular
mention included: (i) the commitment to ensuring macroeconomic stability, as a necessary
condition for accelerated growth and poverty reduction; (ii) the understanding of the need to
remove obstacles in the access by the poor to basic human services (education, health, social
protection); and (iii) the attention given by the authorities to the significance of improving
transparency and accountability of public institutions, including the upgrading of public financial
management. While some of the other areas of the reform program were less well developed,
including private sector development and public sector reform, actions under the program
supported by the PRSCs aimed at elaborating these elements of the program in a timely fashion.

PRSC-2: Overall Borrower performance was satisfactory. Macroeconomic stabilization was
maintained and considerable progress was achieved in implementing the GPRS and its broad
range of sectoral strategies. In particular, the Borrower set a historical precedent in maintaining
sustained growth and a broadly stable macroeconomic environment during an election year.
Public financial management was improved through several actions: (i) new legislation for
financial administration, internal auditing, and procurement; (ii) practices that helped minimize
the risk of budget slippages and accumulation of arrears; (iii) the prompt reconciliation of
budgetary and banking accounts; (iv) the increase of frequency and timeliness of reporting on
budget execution; and (v) the control of proper use of public resources. To ensure the efficient
use of public funds, as well as greater transparency and accountability, the Public Procurement
Institutions were established after the Procurement Act was signed into law in December 2003.
Also, Ghana maintained a favorable ranking in Transparency's International Corruption
Perception Index, behind only Mauritius, Botswana, and Namibia. To encourage private sector
competitiveness, the Government introduced various initiatives to reduce the cost of doing
business in the country, including the installation of automated clearance procedures at the Tema
and Takoradi seaports, and the steps to reduce the time of registering businesses. It was in this
context that Ghana reached the completion point of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in July 2004.
Funding from HIPC relief amounted to 866 billion cedis, with around 20 percent of the resources
used to pay down domestic debt, while the remaining resources were allocated to programs and
projects for the medium-term priority areas outlined in the GPRS, particularly in the areas
perceived to have greater impact on the poor. These action and activities undertaken by the




                                                 29

Government underscored the country's commitment to the tenets and aspirations of the GPRS
with regard to growth and poverty reduction.

PRSC-3:      Government performance continued to be broadly satisfactory.         Domestic debt
reduction was substantial and economic growth continued to be strong.          Introduction of a
petroleum pricing formula addressed what had been a longstanding weakness in the Ghanaian
macroeconomic environment. Government officials have acknowledged that the greater
ownership fostered by the MDBS framework has sharpened their focus on setting priorities and
on strengthening intra-government coordination. Similarly, Government officials have noted that
the need to identify policy targets and monitor outcomes, while working with external
stakeholders, has increased their commitment to reform design and implementation.xxxix
Government relations with the MDBS partners continue to be excellent, setting the stage for
subsequent operations.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

The Ministry of Economy and Finance was fully responsible for implementing the PRSCs
programs.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance


 Rating:


 PRSC-1       Satisfactory
 PRSC-2       Satisfactory
 PRSC-3       Satisfactory


Government performance is rated satisfactory in accordance with the following criteria (as
identified in the ICRR guidelines): Government ownership and commitment to achieving the
development objectives was strong; stakeholders and civil society were consulted at the
beginning of the GPRS development and this consultation has strengthened over the period
covered by PRSC 1-3; fiduciary requirements were met satisfactorily; the relationships and
coordination with the Bank and other donors through the MDBS were excellent throughout; and
appropriate and supportive enabling environment reforms were largely adopted, albeit sometimes
with delays. In addition, M&E capacity improved over the course of the operations and M&E
data were beginning to be incorporated into decision-making (in the context of the budget) by the
end of this series of operations. Finally, the GPRS II built on the lessons learned during the
implementation of GPRS I and provides a comprehensive framework for growth and poverty
reduction and transition to the next series of operations (PRSC 4-7).

6. Lessons Learned

There are a number of lessons to be learned from this series of operations. They relate to the
impact of the MDBS/PRSC framework on the Government, its institutions, and the Government's
reform progress; the operation, management, benefits, and weaknesses of the MDBS/PRSC
framework; and, more generally, to the design of operations to support poverty reduction.

The lessons relating to the impact of the MDBS/PRSC on the Government include:

    1. There was a clear impact on Government ownership of the reform program. The Bank's
        decision to support country-led reforms through the PRSCs, rather than through structural



                                                 30

       adjustment or other mechanisms, proved effective because it encouraged the GoG to
       "step up" to provide leadership and accountability under PRSC-1.             Subsequently,
       improved donor harmonization and the strengthened predictability of considerable
       budgetary support -- combined with sizeable debt relief -- raised the stakes still further
       and fostered improved decision-making by the Government at various levels. The result
       has been improved Government coordination in budget preparation, with strengthened
       integration of cross-sectoral issues and institutional strengthening of the MoFEP.

    2. The increased harmonization among the DPs under the MDBS framework contributed to
       the successful implementation of PRSC 1-3 and thus had high returns for the GoG.
       These returns are reflected in higher and timely disbursements of budgetary support that
       were well aligned with the budgetary calendar and predictable in their disbursement.xl
       This harmonization also appears to have resulted in reduced transaction costs for the GoG
       in dealing with donors owing to the reduction in the number of visiting missions and
       reporting requirements.xli Additional benefits include greater knowledge dissemination
       among the DPs and strengthened policy dialogue on cross-cutting strategic objectives,
       resulting in better project design.

    3. The PRSCs also -- by enabling Government ownership of the reform program and by not
       relying on prescriptive means to reach the outcomes agreed to by the DPs and the GoG --
       gave the Government greater flexibility and opportunity to experiment with different
       approaches. For example, the use of capitation grants ­ to reach the non-prescriptive
       benchmark to increase national GPER from 80 percent to 88.5 percent -- was a GoG-
       driven approach which succeeded quickly and beyond expectations. This success then
       enabled a focus on additional and related areas such as improving pupil:textbook ratios
       and the recruitment of teachers for deprived areas. It is conceivable that without this
       flexibility the Government may have been less willing to experiment with new
       approaches.

    4. As a way to induce reform, the MDBS framework has an important advantage over a
       conditionality-based mechanism.        Conditionality-based lending pits those favoring
       reform against those opposing it, and enables the non-reformers to assert that the
       reformers are implementing changes because donors are telling them to do so. Use of the
       MDBS, however, enables a government to develop a framework and build support for
       reforms that are manageable and domestically acceptable. As a result, progress on
       politically difficult reforms may be slower, but the resultant reforms are also likely to be
       more sustainable than donor-driven ones.

The lessons learned from the operation and management of the MDBS/PRSC framework
included:

    1. While the MDBS simplifies a government's interactions with donors, it is not a simple
       process to manage. Multiple donors operating through a single framework means that
       multiple interests, priorities, and perspectives have to be accommodated and reconciled.
       This can result ­ as happened with the PRSC 1-3 ­ in a complex performance matrix with
       multiple benchmarks that represents a compromise between the various DPs and the
       Government and reflects a variety of objectives. The balance of power within the MDBS
       is uneven, as donors have unequal weights depending on the amount of resources they are
       providing, but as all the DPs are IDA contributors, the Bank must work to achieve
       compromise among the partners. Finally, the multiplicity of donors also means that it is
       difficult to reconcile different evaluations of Government performance and whether prior



                                                31

   actions have or have not been met. As a result of these factors, the MDBS probably
   results in higher transaction costs for the Bank because managing these diverse interests
   and perspectives is highly staff - and time-intensive. Moreover; these transaction costs
   are probably larger in a high profile country such as Ghana. As such, these transactions
   costs are probably unavoidable but should be acknowledged as a public good provided by
   the Bank on behalf of its members.

2. Another consequence is the difficulty of ensuring that the selection of benchmarks does
   not lead to a performance matrix that is reduced to a least common denominator grouping
   of actions on which every DP can agree. The Bank's preferred approach to this challenge
   was to base the performance matrix on the Government's annual budget statement
   because such statements are typically ambitious, thereby setting higher standards for the
   Government to meet and ensuring that the prior actions and triggers are not too "soft." In
   addition, this approach ensures Government ownership, as well as accountability to civil
   society, thereby addressing a key weakness of structural adjustment lending.           This
   approach is not without weaknesses, however, and was not universally accepted by all
   donors, as many important reforms are not reflected in a budget statement (e.g., BPEMS
   establishment). While a key advantage of the MDBS is the fact that much of the dialogue
   towards establishing appropriate benchmarks can take place between donors, rather than
   between the donors and the government, the MDBS does not eliminate this tension over
   what are appropriate triggers. In addition, the need to identify targets on which all parties
   can agree can lead to an excessive focus on the targets themselves, rather than on broader
   policy issues.xlii

3. In addition to the differences over what are appropriate triggers, there is also an inherent
   tension within a MDBS over whether the respective triggers have been satisfied. Some
   DPs will press for stricter interpretations to ensure that the Government's commitment is
   not slackening, while others will be more flexible, focusing on the overall progress that
   has been made rather than whether an individual trigger had been completed in letter and
   spirit.xliii These differences in interpretation will cause tension between the DPs
   themselves and between the DPs and the Government. All of these approaches have
   implications for future reform efforts.        For example, if DPs are less flexible in
   interpreting whether triggers have been met, Governments may suggest less ambitious
   triggers in the future, making them easier to meet, but undermining overall pace of
   reform. Similarly, rolling an incomplete prior action into the next PRSC may ensure that
   dialogue is continued, while simply rewording a prior action to declare that is achieved
   may not be as effective.

4. There is a learning curve associated with the MDBS, and donors should be realistic about
   what can be achieved under the first year of its operation. The establishment and use of
   the MDBS is an inherently evolving process, particularly in terms of dialogue with the
   Government, identifying key priorities, and developing trust between the Government
   and the DPs. The Ministry of Finance must transition to a new role with a focus on
   overseeing developments in a variety of sectors across the entire poverty reduction
   program, rather than monitoring implementation of specific conditionalities for tranche
   release.    This broader focus requires more sector skills and better communication
   between Government ministries; these are not easily developed, and as a consequence,
   implementation of the first operation of a MDBS is unlikely to be entirely smooth.

5. Similarly, the complexity of initial program design and multiple and complex
   benchmarks may be an inevitable outcome of reconciling the divergent interests of



                                            32

    multiple donors. Simplification of program design is facilitated, however, once a quality
    partnership is consolidated and expanded, and trust between the Government and its DPs
    becomes stronger.

6. Use of a PRSC framework is a step away from the more traditional conditionality-based
    project lending process to one that is linked to a program as whole. Accordingly, it
    requires a higher level of trust by donors in the policies, implementational capacity, and
    good faith of the government being assisted, xliv and therefore may not be appropriate for
    all borrowers. On the other hand, given the greater government ownership that can be
    fostered under the PRSC mechanism, there may be a greater likelihood of
    implementation than there would be under a conditionality-based approach.

7. A MDBS may not be suitable for all countries because the provision of budget-based
    assistance requires that adequate public expenditure management practices and fiduciary
    safeguards are in place.     Concomitantly, a MDBS may not work as effectively in
    countries lacking a reasonably well qualified and capable cadre of government officials.

8. The use of a MDBS is also not without risk because once the first set of prior actions is
    met, continued reform implementation is uncertain.           To a great extent, PRSC 1
    constituted a "leap of faith" by Bank management and staff regarding the GoG's
    commitment to poverty reform. By contrast, however, undertaking such risk may well be
    warranted, particularly ­ as was the case in Ghana ­ the two previous conditionality-
    based lending programs (ERSO II and III) achieved only limited success.

9. While achieving consensus among donors may be more difficult to achieve under the
    MDBS, there are considerable benefits to donors in terms of their ability to move the
    development agenda forward.        When donors are dispersed and acting individually,
    governments have greater leeway to be selective about which reforms they will pursue,
    and the influence of any single donor is reduced because the assistance that can be
    provided by an individual donor is smaller. By contrast, when the resources of donors are
    combined, Governments have greater incentive to proceed with reforms. This greater
    incentive ­ combined with greater ownership of the reform program ­ can create
    sustainable reform momentum. Nonetheless, there continue to be limitations as to how
    much reform can be achieved in politically difficult areas. While the Bank and DPs
    worked hard to achieve greater reform in the energy and public sectors, reform progress
    was slow. Finally, reform progress will slow down (as in developed countries) in the
    period preceding an election, and the Bank and DPs will have to build this realism into
    the performance assessment framework.

10. Although the Bank and a Government may see the MDBS as an improvement over
    donor-led, conditionality-based, structural adjustment lending, this perspective is not
    always shared by the NGO community. A number of NGOs in Ghana view benchmarks
    and prior actions as implied conditionality ("structural adjustment by other means"). As
    a consequence, this perception means extensive consultation with NGOs will still be
    needed.

11. Finally, since a MDBS is closely linked to a program, rather than to a specific sector or
    project, the comprehensiveness and efficacy of program design will play a critical role in
    the subsequent success of any Bank operations linked to a MDBS. This, in turn, places a
    greater emphasis on the need for up-front joint staff assessments that are thorough,




                                           33

        constructive, and candid when examining the design, proposed modes of implementation,
        and potential constraints and obstacles of programs such as Preps.




Finally, the poverty reduction lessons to be learned from these operations are:

   1. Poverty is a multi-faceted phenomenon. Any poverty-focused program design must ­ to
        be successful ­ incorporate cross-cutting interventions from the start that include well-
        coordinated interventions in sectors that are closely linked (e.g., health and water, or
        health and nutrition, public sector reform and health, etc.). The poor outcomes achieved
        in a number of health indicators under PRSC 1-3 indicate that a tighter cross-cutting
        focus is probably necessary to achieve key poverty outcomes, particularly in deprived
        distressed regions.

   2. High degrees of Government ownership of the reform program will translate into
        satisfactory implementation of the country's poverty reduction strategy. Throughout
        PRSC 1-3, the Government increasingly assumed more and more leadership and initiative
        in the dialogue to define the content and focus of the policy matrix. As a result, the
        process of formulating the development agenda has now been fully internalized by the
        Ghanaian Government, thereby increasing the likelihood of its implementation. Since the
        overriding objective of the PRSC is to improve human development indicators, the
        usefulness of the PRSC in fostering this necessary government ownership is a positive
        outcome.

i Ghana: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and JSA, Report No. 25495-GH, March 4, 2003.

ii Ghana was one of the first countries to participate in a joint matrix to underpin the budget support
disbursement of multiple donors. Members of the MDBS included seven bilateral al partners (Canada,
Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), plus the World Bank, EU,
and the AfDB. The United States, France, and Japan participate as observers.

iiiBetween 1997-2003, the average increase in access to safe water sources was just under 9 percent, with
the Greater Accra region experiencing a 12 percent decline (albeit from levels higher than the national
average). Access to safe sanitation also continued to be low, with the national average at just over 50
percent, and access in the three deprived regions was at 20 percent or lower.

iv In fact, the Program Document for PRSC-1 noted that the program associated with the PRSC series of
operations might be subsequently broadened as needed to meet the credit's main objectives.

v  Implementation Completion Report, Third Economic Reform Support Operation, Report No. 26214-GH,
June 27, 2003, and Implementation Completion Report, Second Economic Reform Support Operation,
Report No. 26744-GH, December 15, 2003.

vi The other lessons informing the design of the PRSCs were: (i) flexibility is crucial to respond to evolving
situations; (ii) donor coordination is vital to avoid overstretching the Government; and (iii) quick
disbursing operations should occur in a context where they can add value to other instruments and sector-
specific projects.

vii Discussed at the Board in March 2004 (Report 27838-GH).

viiiThere were initially 52 indicators; they were subsequently increased to 60 as more indicators were
identified.

ix  These include the National Intra-Agency Poverty Monitoring Groups, which are inter-sectoral and
include governmental and non-governmental representatives; the GPRS dissemination committee; the PSIA
Technical and Advisory Committees; and regional poverty monitoring groups.

x   These PSIAs focused on: (i) changes to the electricity tariff structure and the impact of the poor; (ii)
degree to which policies to promote agricultural growth could benefit small landholders; (iii) a
vulnerability mapping exercise to improve the knowledge base for managing targeted interventions for the
extreme poor and vulnerable; and (iv) institutional changes resulting from decentralization that may affect
access to or quality of services or resources.

xi According to the Joint Staff Assessment Note on the GPRS II.

xii The CAS' close alignment with the GPRS and GPRS II is indicated by the CAS Progress Report
(discussed by the Board in June 2006) which confirmed that the strategy laid out in 2004 can continue to
guide the Bank's program for Ghana.

xiiiThese are: ensuring macroeconomic stability; expanding production and employment; improving the
delivery of services for human development; protecting the vulnerable and extremely poor; and promoting
good governance and public sector reform.

xiv According to a study by the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD) and Overseas Development
Institute (ODI) on the MDBS. Lawson, Andrew, et al., "Initial Observations on Immediate Effects and
Recommendations on Future Design and Management of Ghana MDBS," Preliminary Report by the Centre
for Democratic Development (CDD) and Overseas Development Institute (ODI) (hereafter CDD/ODI),
October 2006, p. 17.

xv  During these operations a number of objectives were achieved only partially or only after considerable
delay, and some were not achieved at all. The second tranche under ERSO II had to be restructured,




                                                    50

reflecting a lack of progress on some objectives, and Ghana's Fifth Review (in 2002) under the Fund's
PRGF Arrangement could also not be completed and the final tranche was not disbursed.

xvi  The fact that PRSC-1 preceded the CAS finalization may also have contributed to the omission of a
water and sanitation focus, as the CAS rightly noted that an improved water supply and sanitation were
necessary to meet the human development MDGs.

xvii For example, "reduce number of consignments subjected to physical examination at Customs from
average 60 percent in 2002 to average 10 percent...in 2004" under PRSC-1 was changed to "Clearance
times reduced" under PRSC-2.

xviiiICR guidelines state the measurable indicators for monitoring progress should be "those in the PD of
the first operation of the series." It should be noted that the complexity of the policy matrix is being
addressed in the upcoming PRSC-5, where the Board has endorsed a maximum of 30 triggers and
benchmarks.

xix ECG losses continued to decline slightly in 2006, reaching 23.4 percent by July 2006.

xx Since VALCO came back into operation in September 2005, the VRA's finances have been drained, and
as a result, VRA's preliminary (unaudtited ) financial statement for 2005 show an operating loss of about
300 billion cedis, down from an estimated operating profit of 400 billion cedis one year earlier (when
VALCO was not in operation). VRA's losses compromise its ability to meet its commitment under the
ECOWAS energy protocol.

xxi  In an exercise led by the Institute for Policy Alternatives (IPA) with 10 Ghanaian NGOs. IPA,
"Community Voices: A Civil Society Assessment of Pro-Poor Policies and Programmes in Ghana's
Poverty Reduction Strategy," (2006), cited in Miovic, Peter, "Reflections on Ghana and the Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs)," October 31, 2006, p. 3.

xxii By end-2005, Ghana met 8 out of 16 HIPC public expenditure benchmarks, up from 7 benchmarks in
2004 and only 1 in 2001.

xxiiiThe BPEMS is an example of a reform that has been slower to realize than expected, but not as a result
of government inaction. Its operationalization was delayed by (i) the high costs of installing this new
system; (ii) Ghana's own specific demands, which increased the costs and lengthened the installation time;
and (iii) the transition in project management from a team of consultants to the government itself. As a
consultant-led project, the BPEMS ran for six years with no result, primarily because the consultants had a
vested interest in keeping the project going. When the project came under the umbrella of the budget
support program, however, and the funds were directed to the government's budget, so that they could
define their own priorities. There was as a result an opportunity cost to how they spent the money, rather
than an earmarked fund (with few outside accountability systems) to support whatever the project
management defined as priority.

xxiv Progress in 2006 continued to be slow and public sector reform consisted of preparing and setting up
the institutional arrangements for the new public sector reform strategy, including a submission of the
Subvented Agencies Reform Act to Parliament and launching of a broad reach-out program to
communicate and ensure buy-in from stakeholders.

xxv  CDD/ODI, p. 10.

xxvi In the absence of the DHS data, the Bank monitored several intermediate indicators of improvements in
health outcomes. In addition to the supervised maternal deliveries already noted, the ratio of nurses per
10,000 population and doctors per 10,000 people were monitored. As seen in Annex 1, both of these
showed improvements under these operations.

xxvii A recent study concluded that "remittances have probably reduced poverty by (i) increasing incomes
(by more than 20 percent for the poorest 20 percent of households) and (ii) diversifying income. It appears
that, on the margin, remittances have significantly increased (by 20-30) percent investment in education
and health." R. Adams, "Remittances and Poverty in Ghana," WPS 3838, 2006.

xxviii The CDD/ODI assessment of the MDBS concluded that the MDBS's "contribution to the improved
standing of MoFEP may be one of the most important ways in which the MDBS has contributed to the
quality of policy making and economic management in Ghana." CDD/ODI, pp. 16, 20.

xxix  The improved ability to recruit and retain staff has occurred not "because of improved terms and
conditions but because the ministry was seen as an important and active institution." CDD/ODI, p. 20.

xxx  Spending on wages and salaries reached particularly high rates in agriculture, education, and health
programs, for example, ranging between 57 and 77 percent of total amounts available.

xxxi  In October 2006, the IMF Board positively assessed Ghana's economic performance, noting that the
country continued to improve its performance during the first half of 2006, supported by strong
macroeconomic policy implementation and a favorable external environment.

xxxii Beginning in April 2006, the Government started reviewing petroleum product prices monthly instead
of quarterly to reduce lead-lag effects on pricing. A domestic petroleum retail price was increased over 30
percent in the first seven months of 2006.

xxxiii Power shortages (due to load management and low water levels in the Akosombo dam) are likely to
slowdown mining activities, including new operations, and have a negative impact on manufacturing in
2006-07. The combined effect of lower mining production and manufacturing are expected to lower real
GDP growth in 2007 to 5.7 percent, down from an estimated 6.2 percent in 2006.                 While planned
investments should allow the power supply to be restored to full capacity by 2008, taking advantage of
these investments will require three sets of actions: (i) establishment of an independent system operator for
the power transmission company, a required prior step for hooking up to the West African Gas Pipeline
(WAGP); (ii) realigning electricity tariffs; and (iii) ensuring that the gas from the WAGP is used
productively, including setting up a local gas distribution company, converting oil-based power plants, and
ensuring that the VRA's finances are sufficiently sound so it can             meet its monthly gas payment
obligations.

xxxiv While the Bank currently projects (in the context of MDBS-6/PRSC-5) that Ghana's debt sustainability
is likely to remain positive, this assessment notes that sustainability could be undermined by a slowdown in
either economic growth or reduced concessionality in external borrowing..

xxxv  In the 2007 budget statement, public sector wages and salaries were budgeted to increase by 20 percent
over the projected outturn for 2006 and 32 percent over the budgeted amount for 2006. As a result, the
program document for PRSC-5 projects that wages and salaries will account for an estimated 10 percent of
GDP in 2007, equivalent to more than third of government revenues (excluding grants),.

xxxvi In education, less than 5 percent of all budgeted expenditures in 2006 were for non-salary expenditures.
In the health sector, three-quarters of expenditures are for wages and salaries

xxxvii While there was considerable overlap between the focus of the Bank and the DPs at the time of PRSC-
1, there was not full consultation with the other DPs because PRSC-1 was prepared under a very short
deadline (4 months) so that the Bank could respond to the GoG's request for early support to the GPRS.
This consultation was consequently improved in the context of PRSC 2-3, including better information
sharing; the establishment of a joint chairmanship of the MDBS, with the Bank and a DP serving as co-
chairs; and the up-front submission of PRSC Program Documents to the MDBS partners for their review
and comment.

xxxviiiThe actions in subset one (growth, income, and employment) and two (public sector governance) were
expected to be completed shortly (July/August 2005). The key action remaining to be completed within the
framework of the Bank's PRSC arrangement was the enactment of the VRA Amendment Bill, which was
expected only after July 1, 2005.

xxxix CDD/ODI, pp. 16, 17.

xl The MDBS substantially reduced the unpredictability of annual aid flows. MoFEP data show that the
year-to-year deviations of actual MDBS disbursements were quite limited: only -0.1 percent in 2003, -
2.3% in 2004, and +1.2 percent in 2005. (The deviation was likely to be larger in 2006, however, as the




                                                       52

GOG anticipated that actual MDBS disbursements would be approximately 80 % of what was originally
budgeted, after the MDBS partners concluded that the Government did not satisfy one of the agreed trigger
conditions.) In 2007, predictability will be further strengthened as the MDBS moves to a "year-plus-one"
basis so that any assistance that is withheld owing to non-compliance will take effect in the financial year
after that in which the break occurs. While the MDBS was less successful at reducing within-year
predictability, making day-to-day cash flow management difficult, the strong year-on-year predictability is
a valuable contributor to strengthening macroeconomic management and fiscal planning. CDD/ODI, pp.
12.-13.

xli It should be noted that some officials within the GoG would argue that the reduced transaction costs from
fewer missions and reporting requirements has, in fact, been undermined by donors "preoccupation" with
programmatic details, thereby absorbing the attention of Ministers and senior officials. CDD/ODI, p. 18

xlii The GoG has complained that the 2006 negotiations over the 2007 MDBS were too focused on the
"precise determination of trigger provisions and not about much larger issues of policy. CDD/ODI, p. 18.

xliiiUnder PRSC 1-3, the Bank's approach generally has been to focus on overall progress, as demonstrated
under PRSC-3 (see Section 10.1.b on supervision) and PRSC-2, when the BPEMS trigger (and HIPC
completion trigger) was re-worded because it was deemed that although the BPEMS was not fully
operational, this was not a sufficiently strong enough reason to delay the HIPC completion, particularly as
the GoG had taken other significant actions (e.g., adjustment of gasoline prices and establishment of an
automatic electricity tariff adjustment mechanism).
