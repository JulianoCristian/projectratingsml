The\n            program document of Poverty Reduction Support Credit-1\n            (PRSC-1) underscored the importance of ensuring ownership of\n            the reform program for the satisfactory implementation of\n            the country's poverty reduction strategy. Thus, while\n            most of the actions completed under the program supported by\n            PRSC-1 focused on laying out the groundwork for legislative\n            changes, and developing strategies for key areas of the\n            reform agenda, achieving the expected policy outcomes was\n            contingent on follow-up actions that, in some instances,\n            would be supported by subsequent operations. This condition\n            reinforced the importance of ensuring broad ownership of the\n            program from the onset, and of building in mechanisms for\n            regular consultations during implementation."}, "docdt": "2004-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
