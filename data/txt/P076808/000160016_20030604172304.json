and support the implementation of\n            the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS). PRSC-1 will\n            support the policies and reforms aimed at improving the\n            living conditions of the population by promoting growth,\n            incomes and employment, accelerating human resource\n            development, and strengthening governance and public sector\n            management as spelled out in the country's GPRS. The\n            first PRSC would lay the ground for helping the country to\n            attack poverty in a comprehensive manner. It is envisaged\n            that there will be further single-tranche PRSCs in FY04 and\n            FY05, respectively   PRSC-1 is expected to provide a series\n            of benefits. The main and ultimate benefit is the human\n            progress towards the Millennium Development Goals expected\n            from the growth and service delivery outcomes of the\n            implementation of the program supported by this operation.\n            In addition, there are two intermediate benefits. The first\n            is helping maintain macroeconomic stability by contributing\n            to the closing of the external financing gap. The second is\n            enabling Government to generate the funds required to\n            execute GPRS policies and programs."}, "docdt": "2003-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
