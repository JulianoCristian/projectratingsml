3. ProgramDescription
3.a. Overallprogram
 1.       A series o f three PRSCs was designed in 2003 in line with the policy framework of the Ghana
Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) and focusing on three broad areas: (i)                  the promotion o f growth,
income and employment; (ii)       improvements inthe delivery of services for human development; and (iii)         the
strengthening of governance and public sector management.

2.        The first component of PRSC-1 reflectedthe objectives o f the first and second pillars of the GPRS,
and focused on ensuring progress on macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth by eliminating factors
inhibiting growth. The first set of actions included: (i)         reducing the high public domestic debt, which
crowded out credit to the private sector, kept interest rates high, and limited the scope in the budget for
financing services that are supportive o f development; and (ii)        reducing the cost o f doing business, such
as the unreliable and "high-price" supply o f critical inputs, especially energy, and the administrative costs
o f complying with government regulations, The second set o f actions consisted o f removing constraints
on rural development. The rural sector was selected because: (i)              it includes the bulk of the country's
natural resources; (ii)   it is home to the .largest number of the people; and (iii) embraces the largest
                                                                                             it
proportion o f the poor.

3.        The second component o f PRSC-I was based on the third and fourth pillars o f the GPRS,
incorporating measures aimed at improving service delivery in education, health and social protection. It
focused on: (i)  expanding access to education and health services, with particular attention to the needs o f
underservedareas and populations; and (ii)        improving the efficiency and equity o f financing. By focusing
on these actions, the program aimed at dealing with issues such as: (i)         redressing the unequal regional and
gender outcomes in health and education; and (ii)          attaining sustainable and equitable financing o f these
critical services. The program also aimed at contributing to sharpening the national focus on reaching the
MDGsby 2015, adding value to the support already providedby sector projects.

4.        The third component o f PRSC-1 was based on the fifth pillar o f the GPRS and incorporated actions
designed to: (i)strengthen the institutions of participatory democracy and accountable rule; and
(ii)improve the efficiency o f the public services and the quality o f public expenditure management.
Again, the areas identified for PRSC support were selected with a view o f adding value to the existing

sectoral support by elevating the issues to the center o f Government, where collective interest generated
by the GPRS would facilitate debate, consensusbuilding, and decision-making.

3.b. PRSC-1 description

5.       PRSC-1 - a one-tranche credit o f US$125 million - was the first of a series of three PRSCs
prepared annually within a rolling, three-year horizon. In line with the program envisioned in the three-
year program, PRSC-1 was designed to support the Government in implementing policies and reforms
aimed at improving the living conditions of the population by promoting growth, incomes and
employment, accelerating human resource development, and strengthening governance and public
sector management, as spelled out inthe country's GPRS. The first PRSC aimed therefore at laying
the groundwork for helping the country to attack poverty ina comprehensive manner.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

6.       Prior to Boardpresentation o f PRSC-1, the Government had completed all planned actions aimed
at promoting growth, incomes and employment, accelerating human resource development, and
strengthening governance and public sector management. The detailed actions taken are presented in
Table 1 below. Given the lag between policy actions and outcomes, the latter will be discussed in the
programmatic ICR to be preparedat the completion o f PRSC-3.

7.       The institutional development impact of the reform measures implemented under PRSC-1 was
substantial. Many o f the reforms implemented were the genesis for important institutional innovations.
The latter includes the amendment o f the Volta River Authority ( V U ) act, and the new Financial
Administration and Public Procurement Acts (FAA and PPA). The amendment o f the VR4 established
the legal basis for the separation of power transmission from generation. Similarly, the FAA implied a
new framework for the management o f state resources, leading to clearer reporting responsibilities and
greater accountability within the public sector. Finally, the PPA strengthened the public procurement
institutions, including the creation o f a Public Procurement Board, aimed at reviewing procurement
practices within the public sector and at increasing accountability throughout the public sector.

5. Major FactorsAffectingImplementationandOutcome

8.       The implementation o f PRSC-1 began against the backdrop o f the completion o f the GPRS, and
o f renewed efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability and accelerate growth. In February 2003 the
Government redoubled its reform efforts, raising petroleum prices by around 90 percent to stem losses of
the State-owned oil refinery company. Increases inutility prices followed suit, with the adoption of an
automatic adjustment mechanism for electricity and water tariffs. Other actions to strengthen controls
over public finances included improving the scope, timing and quality o f the reporting o f budget
execution, with a new monthly report on the budget execution, and quarterly reports on poverty related
expenditures. In the meantime, there was a significant improvement in the external environment, with
rising prices for the country's main export commodities (cocoa and gold), and an increase in aid inflows
and debt relief. Political sensitivity, especially as the 2004 electoral process drew nearer, and limited
capacity within the public sector, meant, however, that there were delays in following up on actions
designed to encourage private sector development and carry out the public sector reform agenda. These
delays raised legitimate questions about the sustainability o f the advances under PRSC-1, given the
importance o f these reforms for the implementation o f the country's broader development program. The
macroeconomic management o f the overall program continued, nevertheless, to yield positive results in
terms o f inflation andreal GDP growth, with positive implications for poverty reduction.

6. BankandBorrowerPerformance

9.       Overall Bank performance was satisfactory. The overall objectives o f the PRSCs were well
aligned with Government's development agenda, priorities and policies, as set out in the February 2003
Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), and they became a central element o f the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), discussed at the Board on March 20, 2004 (Report 27838-GH). Lessons learned from



                                                      -4-

 past adjustment operations' were incorporated in the design o f the PRSC program, notably the need to
 ensure `ownership' o f the reform process, and the need for realism and selectivity in definingthe reform
 agenda. In preparing PRSC-1, the Bank built on substantial analytical work already available on the
 country. This work included poverty analysis that had been carried out jointly with the Government,
 drawing on the results of the 1998/99 household expenditure survey, and allowing the program to focus
 on policy actions that addressed poverty equity gaps across regions, and age and gender groups. The
 analytical work also included two integrative pieces on growth, poverty and public policy,2permitting the
 program to focus on critical aspects o f the interface between these three areas. Finally, inpreparing and
 supervisingthe credit, the Bank worked closely with IMF and other developmentpartners participating in
 the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS), allowingthe program to harmonize with rather than duplicate
 the implementation o f ongoing sector programs andprojects.

 10.      Overall Borrower performance was also satisfactory. The joint Bank-IMF staff assessment o f the
 GPRS3 had already underscored the soundness of the GPRS framework for implementing the
 government's poverty reduction agenda.         Areas that received particular mention included: (i)       the
 commitment to ensuring macroeconomic stability, as a necessary condition for accelerated growth and
poverty reduction; (ii) the understandingo f the needto remove obstacles inthe access by the poor to basic
human services (education, health, social protection); and (iii)  the attention givenby the authorities to the
 significance o f improving transparency and accountability o f public institutions, including the upgrading
 o f public financial management. While some o f the other areas o f the reform program were less well
developed, including private sector development and public sector reform, actions under the program
 supported by the PRSCs aimed at elaborating these elements o f the program ina timely fashion.

Environmental Aspects

 1I.     PRSC-1 was a Structural Adjustment Credit, and required compliance with the Operational
Directive (OD) 8.60, as defined in the Interim PRSC guideline^.^ The appraisal mission reviewed
Ghana's environmental policies and practices with the aim o f assessing the strength of the country's
environmental framework.        The appraisal mission also confirmed that there were no negative links
between the reforms proposed under PRSC-1 and environmental outcomes, as the operation focused on
policy level interventions, with no direct physical benchmarks. These findings are reflected in the final
draft o f the program document, which provided a description o f environmental aspects o f the program,
including completed and proposed actions under the energy sector reform program.                 The program
document also identified a follow up poverty and social impact analysis for the energy sector reforms
aimed at assessing the impact o f increased energy tariffs on the poor, and the need for hrther institutional
analysis.

7. FindingsandImplicationsfor Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

12.      The program document of PRSC-1 underscored the importance of ensuring `ownership' of the
reform program for the satisfactory implementation o f the country's poverty reduction strategy. Thus,
while most of the actions completed under the program supported by PRSC-1 focused on laying out the

groundwork for legislative changes, and developing strategies for key areas o f the reform agenda,
achieving the expected policy outcomes was contingent on follow-up actions that, in some instances,
would be supported by subsequent operations. This condition reinforced the importance o f ensuring
broad ownership of the program from the onset, and o f buildinginmechanisms for regular consultations
duringimplementation.
