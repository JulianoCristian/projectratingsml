Some key lessons\n            learned include: Confused thinking about objectives ends up\n            in sub-optimal design. It is important to provide an\n            operational definition for each indicator - to state exactly\n            what data will be collected for it. It is possible to apply\n            design tests to the design of development projects. It is\n            worthwhile to define clearly the minimum requirement at the\n            start of project preparation and to reach agreement with the\n            borrower not to go ahead with a project if this preparatory\n            work has not been completed. It is important to distinguish\n            between core capacity and extended capacity. It is wrong to\n            move from preparation into implementation if core capacity\n            is not in place. It is risky to accept an empty shell as a\n            viable institution, and so is relying on a new institution\n            as an implementing agency, if its role and function in the\n            sector is not clear. Interagency conflicts are hard to\n            settle. Due to frequent losses of motor vehicles and\n            equipment provided to project implementing units, it is\n            advisable to introduce asset management systems, conduct\n            inventories, and report them to the Bank."}, "docdt": "2001-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
