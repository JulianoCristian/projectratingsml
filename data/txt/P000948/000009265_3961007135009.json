In particular, the\n            project will focus on: a) strengthening the capacity of the\n            National Council for Technical and Vocational Education and\n            Training (NACVET) to respond to the short-term training\n            needs of those employed in the informal sector; b) involving\n            indigenous trade associations in designing competency based\n            training programs, in selecting participants for training,\n            and in choosing the tools to be included in equipment kits;\n            c) creating closer links between trade associations, public\n            and private training institutions, and the Government; d)\n            re-orienting the focus of private and public training\n            institutions away from the provision of long pre-employment\n            training to the provision of short post-employment\n            competency-based training for those in the informal sector.\n            To achieve this, the project will include: 1) practical\n            skill training of informal apprentices in five skill areas;\n            2) practical skill training and entrepreneurship training of\n            informal sector master craftsmen and women; 3) ensuring that\n            trainees have access to essential high-quality tools; 4)\n            support to public and private training institutions; and 5)\n            training program development, evaluation, and monitoring."}, "docdt": "1995-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
