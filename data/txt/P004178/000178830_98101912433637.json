families (or nearly a quarter\n            of a million people) by raising their farm production by\n            10-40. The project will improve nutrition by helping\n            increase the production of rice, field grains and vegetables\n            in the Vientiane Province through the provision of improved\n            seeds to about 40,000 smallholders and the development of a\n            state feedgrain farm. Smallholder and cooperative activities\n            will be further supported by an improved technology package\n            provided to about 2,400 farm families. In addition, the\n            project will extend the improved technology package to many\n            more farmers in the Vientiane and other provinces by\n            training agricultural technicians and specialists who will,\n            in turn train extension officers in the future."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
