The lessons\n            learned indicate that building a strong base for family\n            medicine in urban and rural areas is important for\n            addressing many of the challenges facing the Russian health\n            sector. Strong and continuous leadership is critical for the\n            success of health reforms. Improving the quality of care can\n            reap important benefits in terms of improved patient\n            satisfaction as well as cost-containment. Although the\n            project aimed at implementing pilots that could then be used\n            for replication in other oblasts, the project design did not\n            match these intentions. The project has demonstrated that in\n            a relatively short period of time, important steps can be\n            taken in improving prevention and early diagnosis and\n            treatment of key conditions responsible for a large portion\n            of the burden of disease in the country. The Bank is\n            increasingly highlighting the importance of proactive,\n            continuous and flexible supervision and linking project\n            supervision to ongoing policy dialogue of the Bank. The\n            involvement of senior Bank and World Health Organization\n            (WHO) technical experts greatly enhances the value of World\n            Bank assistance for the client. Project development\n            objectives must be realistically selected to match the scope\n            and size of the project components."}, "docdt": "2004-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
