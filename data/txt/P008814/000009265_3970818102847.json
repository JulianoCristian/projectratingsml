The project consists of\n            four parts: two independent sub-projects, each consisting of\n            a package of reform measures to be undertaken in a\n            participating oblast; one component to strengthen national\n            and regional training programs in Family Medicine; and one\n            component to monitor, evaluate, disseminate and replicate\n            project results. Although the underlying principles of\n            reform are the same, each oblast sub-project is unique,\n            having been shaped by local oblast priorities, institutional\n            capacities, and other local conditions."}, "docdt": "1997-01-17T00:00:00Z"}
