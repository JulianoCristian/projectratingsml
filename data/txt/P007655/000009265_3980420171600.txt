MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
FOR A BASIC HEALTH CARE PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Nacional Financiera,
S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$180.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan, which would be guaranteed by the Government of Mexico, would be
repayable over 17 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's variable
interest rate and charges. NAFIN would be the Borrower and the Secretariat of
Health (SSA) and the State Health Authorities would be the executing agencies.
2.        Background. In the 1960s and 1970s, the health status of the
Mexican population improved markedly. Between 1960 and 1986, life expectancy
at birth increased from 58 to 68 years, infant mortality declined by a third
(from 74 to 48 per 1,000 live births), and maternal deaths fell by almost half
(from 140 to 80 per 100,000 births). In the 1980s, however, progress in
public health stagnated. Mexico's National Health Survey of 1988 showed that
21 million of the country's 82 million people, a quarter of the population,
have either chronic diseases or grave illnesses. Among the rural ,oor, the
diseases of underdevelopment (gastroenteritis, acute respiratory diseases,
malnutrition and immuno-communicable diseases) remain the major causes of
death. About 14 percent of children under age five suffer from
undernutrition, as measured by weight for age.
3.        Moreover, inequality in health conditions between regions and
income groups has grown sharply. Today life expectancy is 55 years in rural
areas versus 71 years in urban areas; and 53 years among the poor versus 73
years among the wealthy. The infant mortality rate ranges from less than 20
per 1,000 in the states of Zacatecas, Veracruz, and Quintana Roo, to over 50
in Chiapas, Guerrero, Mexico City (squatters), and Oaxaca. One reason for
this inequality in health conditions is that health services are virtually
inaccessible to many of the 40 million Mexicans who lack health care insurance
and cannot afford private providers. About a third of these uninsured poor
live in the four project states and in the Federal District. Another reason
for the stagnation is that with the collapse of oil prices in 1982, Mexico
launched an austerity program that included severe reductions in public
expenditures for the social sectors. Currently, public health spending on a
per capita basis is still far below pre-crisis levels.
4.        The Government of Mexico has been working to expand basic health
care services to low-income groups. In particular, the government launched
the National Solidarity Program, a poverty alleviation program, with equal
emphasis on community participation projects aimed at improving the living
conditions of the poor. The government spent US$640 million in 1989, and is
expected to spend more than double that amount in 1990. Within this new
social policy framework, the government strengthened the mandate of the SSA to
reset sectoral priorities and coordinate all public health programs and
shifted resources from curative to preventive basic health care. More
specifically, SSA has developed PASSPA (Basic Health Care Program for the
Uninsured Population), a targeted approach to basic health services delivery
for the uninsured poor, that will rationalize basic health care within the



- 2 -
framework of strengthened social programs in collaboration with the National
Solidarity Program.
5.        PASSPA seeks to reduce infant, child, and maternal mortality, as
well as the prevalence and severity of diseases common among the poor. PASSPA
concentrates on improving women's and children's health through education on
health and nutrition, prevention and cure of sexually transmitted diseases,
maternal, prenatal and postpartum care, family planning, and screening for
breast and cervical cancer. It covers immunization, growth monitoring, oral
rehydration therapy, and screening, treatment and referral for other common
diseases in the target population. Health sanitation and nutrition education
programs are conducted with mothers and communities. These activities are
carried out through the basic health service network, which includes health
promoters, rural ambulatory medical units, and health centers backed up by
secondary and tertiary referral hospitals. The government plans to use PASSPA
in the poorer states to address the following sectoral issuest (a) many
Mexicans lack access to basic health care services--about half of the
population is not covered by the national health insurance system; (b) the
services available for uninsured persons in rural Mexico do not meet client
needs, mainly due to service management constraints and physical deterioration
of health network; (c) personnel and human resources available to the State
Health Authorities are inadequate in number and skill to deliver an expanded
basic health care service; (d) financial resources for the sector are
inequitably or inefficiently allocated and are too dependent on federal
budgets; and (e) the severe nutritional deficiencies among the poor need to be
addressed as an integral part of maternal and child health care services
delivery.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in the
proposed project is justified on three grounds: First, the proposed project
is an integral part of Bank assistance strategy for Mexico in support of
structural adjustment and poverty alleviation. Together with the Low-Income
Housing, and Water, Women, and Development Loans, and the proposed
Decentralization and Regional Development and Basic Education Loans, the
proposed project would address the basic needs of the poor in the most
disadvantaged states, supporting the government's national solidarity poverty
alleviation program. Second, the proposed project would help the government
reorient public health expenditures toward basic and preventive health
services, thus improving the efficiency of such expenditures. Third, the
proposed project would facilitate the implementation of the government's
constitutionally mandated decentralization program and strengthen the
institutional and administrative capacity of state and local governments to
improve the equity and efficiency of health service delivery. At present,
there are no other external aid agencies involved in the policy and
institutional reform areas; the Inter-American Development Bank is financing a
health project, but it focuses mainly on construction of health
infrastructure.
7.        Project Obiectives.  The project would:  (a) strengthen and extend
basic health care services and targeted nutrition assistance to about 13
million uninsured poor in 47 health jurisdictions in the four poorest states:
Oaxaca, Chiapas, Guerrero, and Hidalgo, and the Federal District (Project



States); (b) support institutional imprcereiments to strengthen management
capability to enhance the efficiency and the effectiveness of the health care
system; and (c) strengthen the implementation of sectoral reforms to
decentralize budgetary, management, and operational responsibilities from the
federal level to the states.
8.        Pro1ect Description.  The project consists of two major components:
(a) Basic Health Services Development Component (89 percent of total project
cost) would focus on expansion and improvement of delivery of basic health
care and nutrition assistance through PASSPA for the 13 million uninsured
population in the project states. The loan would finance: (i) rehabilitation
and upgrading of about 1,169 health centers, including 28 referral hospitals
and construction of some 267 new health facilities, and development of a
maintenance program for facilities and equipment; (ii) provide equipment,
furniture, ambulances, and basic medical supplies for the rehabilitated and
upgraded health network; (iii) hire, reassign, and regrade some 7,000
personnel for PASSPA; (iv) improve the supervision system and technical
training for health, professional, and auxiliary staff; and (v) produce and
distribute operational manuals and educational materials; and (b)
Institutional Development Component (11 percent of total project cost). The
project would, inter alia, at both federal and state levels: (i) provide
assistance to facilitate the decentralization process; (ii) conduct
operational research and studies to improve services delivery to set policies
and priorities, and to carry out impact evaluations; (iii) strengthen
management information systems to improve planning, analysis, and management
capacities; and (iv) provide training opportunities in management and
administration for managerial staff.
9.        The total project cost is estimated at US$249.8 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$37.9 million (15 percent). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of US$8.0 million would be
granted for expenditures incurred after June 15, 1990. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Mexico
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
8927-ME dated October 31, 1990 is also attached.
10.       Implementation Arrangements.  The borrower would be NAPIN, which
would act as the administrator of the loan. The proceeds of the loan would be
disbursed during a six-year period. The project would be implemented through
the existing organizational structure of the SSA and the State Health
Authorities, but federal and state project coordination units (PCU) have been
established in the SSA and in the project states.
11.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained on
the following: (a) the SSA would review the efficiency and adequacy of the
purchase and distribution of drugs and supplies by the SSA and each of the
Project State Health Authorities, paying particular attention to hospitals and
remote rural centers, and submit to the Bank, for comments, the results,
including the action plan to be carried out by the SSA and the State Health
Authorities in the project states, by no later than July 30, 1992; (b) the SSA



would, no later than March 31, 1991, enter into contracts, satisfactory to the
Bank, with consultants for the preparation of Institutional Development Plans,
satisfactory to the Bank, for each of the project states. Such Plans would be
presented to the Bank no later than December 31, 1991; (c) each of the project
states and the Federal District would review the operation of the management
information system (MIS). prepare plans for its improvement satisfactory tu
the Bank, and submit to the Bank such MIS plans no later than December 31,
1991, and carry out the MIS plans throughout project execution; (d) the SSA
woild maintain a Federal PCU within the SSA, at a level equivalent to that of
an ;:1VA Direcci6n General for the general purpose of coordinating execution of
the project; (e) the SSA, the project states and the Research Unit of the
Hospital Infantil de Mexico and other research institutions, beginning in
September 1991 and again during each month of September throughout project
implementation, would conduct annual reviews jointly with the Bank, SHCP, and
NAFIN in collaboration with IMSS/Solidaridad, SPP/National Solidarity Program,
and COPLADE regarding past and proposed future implementation and budgeting of
the project; (f) a mid-term review would be conducted by the SSA and the
states, jointly with the Bank, after 2 1/2 years of project implementation;
and (g) the SSA would, no later than June 30, 1992, complete the health sector
resovrce allocation and mobilization study, present its results to the Bank
and exchange views with the Bank regarding such results. On the basis of the
study and such exchange of views, the SSA would, by December 31, 1992, prepare
an action plan satisfactory to the Bank and implement it in accordance with
the schedule of the action plan. The following would be conditions for loan
effectiveness: (a) at least three project states would present an
infrastructure and biomedical equipment maintenance plan. Any remaining
s'ates would present the plan by June 30, 1991; (b) at least three project
states would present, satisfactory to the Bank, a Human Resources and Training
Plan (Other project states would comply with these conditions by June 30,
1991.); (c) the SSA would submit the draft contracts and a short list of
consultants, in accordance with the already agreed terms of reference, for
preparation of Institutional Development Plans, for each of the project
states; and (d) the SSA and SPP would have entered into Participation
Agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, with each of the project states.
12.       Project Penefits.  Benefits of the project would include improved
he'.t1 among the 13 million uninsured poor living in the project states
through reduction in the prevalence of infectious and communicable diseases
and malnutrition in the project states. It is expected that the project would
directly benefit about 3.0 million women of childbearing age and 1.7 million
infantr and children under age five, by improving their health and nutritional
status and curbing maternal, infant and child mortality. The project would
contribute to the improvement of the management, administration, client
responsiveness, and overall efficiency of public health services, partly as a
result of system decentralization, and would increase the proportion of
resources going to basic health care and nutrition assistance for vulnerable
groups in the poorest states of Mexico. In addition, the health care
providers at the health centers, most of whom are women, would receive
professional training to enhance their performance and provide opportunities
for career advancement.



13.       Proiect Risks.  Main project risks are associated with:  (a) weak
capacity of State Health Authorities to manage this expanded program of health
care services delivery; and (b) uncertainty about the government's fiscal
capacity to assign sufficient resources to sustain the project's recurrent
spending. These risks are contained to an acceptable level by the high
priority of the project's objectives in government social policy; the
experience gained by the states during project preparation; the concentration
of efforts on key service elements; the provision of loan funds for recurrent
expenditures on a declining basis so that each state would have time to
develop a financing plan, drawing on user fees, state revenues, and federal
contributions; the establishment of data gathering and monitoring mechanisms;
annual implementation and work plan reviews; and the expectation of the
renewed growth of the Mexican economy.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
