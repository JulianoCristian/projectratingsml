basic health\n            care and nutrition assistance for 13 million uninsured\n            people. Specific actions include: (i) rehabilitation,\n            upgrading, and expanding the health network and developing a\n            maintenance program for facilities and biomedical equipment;\n            (ii) providing equipment, furniture, vehicles, and basic\n            medical supply; (iii) hiring, reassigning, and regrading\n            personnel; (iv) improving the supervision system and\n            technical training for professional and auxiliary health\n            staff; and (v) producing and distributing operational\n            manuals and materials. The second component: (b)\n            institutional development will be carried out at federal and\n            state levels. The federal component will: (i) provide\n            assistance to facilitate the decentralization process; (ii)\n            conduct operational research to improve services delivery\n            and to set policies and priorities; and (iii) strengthen\n            management information systems.
