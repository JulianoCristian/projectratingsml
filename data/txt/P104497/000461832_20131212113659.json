Bank's performance\n            rated satisfactory, while the borrower's performance\n            was felt to be moderately satisfactory. The project\n            development objectives and the intermediate outcome\n            indicators were all deemed to have been achieved. The\n            project had undergone restructuring, and the revised\n            objectives and outcomes were also achieved with a moderately\n            satisfactory rating. The significant lessons learned from\n            the implementation of the project are: 1) an emergency\n            operation should be prepared with a view to balancing short\n            and medium-term results and transition to regular\n            operations, 2) multi-sectoral operations are critical to\n            address emergency situations, 3) under emergency situations,\n            financing operating costs of schools in a transparent manner\n            offers a good chance to increase enrollment rates and\n            educational outcomes for children from poorer families, and\n            4) a strong communications strategy should be in place to\n            counter misinformation, which can otherwise quickly put the\n            project at risk and jeopardize outcomes."}, "docdt": "2013-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
