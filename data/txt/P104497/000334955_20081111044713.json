This is expected to\n            help create an environment in which reforms can be sustained\n            and to prevent political and economic regression, which may\n            otherwise result in social instability, civil unrest and\n            possibly reversion to conflict. The project is a major\n            action initiated in the capital and whose principal\n            objective is to level transport system, rehabilitate urban\n            infrastructure and basic services (roads, water and\n            sanitation) and thereby improve the living conditions of the\n            population. Negative impacts are likely to take place during\n            the construction phase. These impacts concern the following\n            aspects: 1) The air emissions, noise and vibration whose\n            consequences will be marked; 2) The disruption of natural or\n            artificial drainage storm water; 3) The disruption and / or\n            displacement of public drinking water supply, electricity or\n            collection of sewage; 4) The risks of accidental spills of\n            chemicals and hence, the contamination of soil and\n            groundwater; 5) The amendment and the disruption of traffic\n            and increased risks for stakeholders, residents and road\n            users in the vicinity of construction sites; 6) The\n            disruption of socio-economic activities; 7) reduction of\n            water flow of the river as a result of pumping large\n            quantities of raw water which could affect: the water needs\n            downstream from the site of capture; the health and\n            sustainability of aquatic ecosystems and areas bordering the\n            Lukaya; the stability of banks."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
