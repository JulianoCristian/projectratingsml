The project achieved many of its\n            objectives, institutional development was modest,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, it is important to\n            establish macroeconomic/sectoral links and balance. Second,\n            it is extremely difficult to operationalize budget\n            understandings. Third, closer linkage is required between\n            financing and disbursement and substantial program issues\n            and objectives. Fourth, sequencing is important. Fifth, it\n            is important to not lose sight of poverty and equity\n            concerns and to keep them in balance in the face of popular\n            trends. Finally, the ownership of the HRDP is critically\n            important to the Borrower and the many Borrower agencies concerned."}, "docdt": "1995-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
