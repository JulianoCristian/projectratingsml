PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA
MEAT INDUSTRY (ONAB) PROJECT (Loan 1739-ALG)
Highlights
The main project objectives were to increase the supply of beef and
mutton in Algeria and to establish a modern and hygienic meat industry. The
project intended to create a sheep purchasing and fattening system based on
buying centers on the northern fringes of the arid steppe and newly created
medicago pastures and sheep handling yards in the up-lands, and to create
three integrated meat complexes in Algiers, Oran and Annaba. An economic rate
of return of 22X for the sheep buying and fattening operation and of over 50%
for the meat complexes was calculated at appraisal; the financial rate of
returns were 15% and 11% respectively. The Borrower and Project Executing
Agency was ONAB, the national agency for animal feed production, egg and
poultry production and red meat marketing, control and distribution.
More than two years were required to meet the two effectiveness
conditions, namely acquisition of sites and employment of consultants. The
Project appeared to be off to a good start after the loan became effective and
BNEDER, with the help of consultants, started preparation of designs and
bidding documents. Nonetheless, the Borrower requested the Bank to cancel the
loan of which only a small fraction has been disbursed. No reasons for this
request were given. Consequently, lessons to be learned by the Bank from this
project must perforce remain conjectural. Some points of interest are:
-    The Project was presented to the Board before the sites for the meat
complexes were acquired by ONAB and before the consulting engineers
needed for preparing bidding documents were recruited. While a usual
practice in the mid-1970s, currently projects of this nature are only
presented to the Board when sites are acquired (PCR para. 5.01).
-    There were fundamental changes in Borrower's structure which occurred
before Loan effectiveness. However, during the period before the
Loan became effective there were continuing reiterations of the
Government's commitment with respect to the main Project component
and to the Project as a whole (PCR para. 5.04).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA
MEAT INDUSTRY (ONAB) PROJECT (Loan 1739-ALG)
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01     Loan 1739-ALG for US042 million which was signed on October 3, 1979,
was cancelled at the request of Office National des Aliments du Betail (ONAB)
on April 1, 1983. Only a fraction of the Loan (US0.1 million) covering an
advance payment to and two invoices of consultants were disbursed. The
Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Revolution (MARA) appeared to be fully
comnitted to the Project as recently as October 1982 and the reasons for
requesting cancellation are not fully understood.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     MARA and ONAB requested the October 1977 Bank identification/sector
preparation mission to consider a meat production, processing and marketing
project for Bank financing. The justification of the proposed project was
that the existing red meat production was increasingly lagging behind demand
with, as a result, continuous meat price increases in real terms, that the
existing slaughtering capacity of about 40,000 tons/year was in many cases
outdated, unhygienic and insufficient for the total needed production of some
60,000 tons/year; that meat processing facilities to valorize abattoir
by-products were almost nonexistent; and that the available meat cold storage
facilities were insufficient to handle present and projected needs,
particularly for imports.
2.02     The Project was prepared by consultants financed by UNDP (Project
ALG/77/030) with the Bank as Executing Agency. The consultants started work
in August 1978. Preparation went slower than expected and at appraisal only a
first draft of the Project feasibility study was ready. Nevertheless,
Government insisted on early appraisal and on Board Presentation in FY79.
2.03     The appraisal mission visited Algeria from November 27 through
December 15, 1978. The consultants' draft feasibility report was found not to
be satisfactory by the mission and substantial modifications to the Project
concept and components were proposed by the mission and accepted by the
Government. No issues requiring management decision were raised by the
mission at its return to headquarters. Negotiations were held from May 12 to
22, 1979.-!  The Board presentation was on June 21, 1979 and the Loan
Agreement and Guarantee Agreement were signed October 3, 1979.
1/ The Algerian negotiating team did not include any ONAB representative.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01     The Project's main objectives were:
(a)  increase in the supply of mutton by instituting a system of buying
centers for sheep from the arid steppe, transfering them to the zone
of the high plateau for fattening on workers' self-managed 1/ farms
and, subsequently transfering them to ONAB abattoirs for slaughter
and distribution;
(b)  reduction of seasonal price fluctuation by the controlled release by
ONAB onto the market of imported or locally acquired meat stored in
appropriate cold storage facilities; and
(c)  establishment of modern, hygienic meat industry under ONAB.
3.02     The components of the Project were;
(a)  construction of sheep buying centers equipped with trucks for sheep
transport;
(b)  establishment of about 60,000 ha of medicago pasture with sheep
handling yards;
(c)  construction of three multispecies abattoirs (in Algiers, Annaba and
Oran) comprising each a meat cutting plant, a meat product plant,
cold storage, a by-product plant, and means of transport (aggregate
capacity of slaughter 13,000 tons), and
(d)  technical assistance for the establishment of medicago pastures and
for preparation of bidding document and supervision of the
construction of meat complexes, and training of ONA3 staff.
The total Project cost was estimated at US$105.2 million, of which foreign
exchange was US$42.3 million. The Project was to be implemented over four
years commencing January 1979. The estimated FRR and ERR was 15Z and 22%
respectively for the sheep purchase-transit-fattening component, and 11% and
over 50% respectively for the meat complexes.
IV. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
4,01     The Borrower and the Project Implementing Agency was to be ONAB.
ONAB was-2/ a financially independent government agency with three distinct
functions: animal feed production, poultry and egg production, and livestock
purchase, slaughter and wholesale.  ONAB's organization evolved haphazardly as              -
the Office developed in many directions since its creation. At the time of
appraisal, a wide ranging reorganization to streamline its operation was
taking place. The total labor force was about 2,450 persons, including 120
professionals. ONAB's total assets amounted (December 31, 1977) to DA 679
million (US$17O million at appraisal exchange rate) and profit before tax
I/ Domaines autoger6s.
2/ Past tense is used as ONAB was subsequently completely restructured (see
para. 5.04).



-3-
(1977) was DA 17 million (US$4.3 million). The Project was to be managed by
ONAB's newly created Department of Marketing which became responsible for all
red meat operations.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.01     The Loan Agreement called for two special conditions of
effectiveness: acquisition by ONAB of acceptable sites for the meat complexes
and appointment of consulting engineers to assist ONAB in the preparation of
bidding documents, in the evaluation of bids and in the supervision of
construction of the complexes. Meeting these conditions was more difficult
and time consuming than expected and the original Loan Effectiveness date of
January 31, 1980 had to be postponed six times. The loan became effective
finally on February 12, 1982, over two years after appraisal.
Reasons for delay in Effectiveness
5.02     Choice and Attribution of Sites.  There were two reasons which
delayed meeting this effectiveness condition: (a) indecision by MARA and ONAB
as to the location of the Oran and Annaba abattoirs. The original project
called for the abattoirs to be located near the above two consumption
centers. MARA/ONAB questioned this choice and for several months searched for
sites in the interior close to the livestock production areas. The Bank
agreed in principle to this solution, but, subsequently, MARA/ONAB reverted to
the original plan in respect of the Oran site. In the case of the eastern
(Annaba) location, a site near Skikda was chosen. The localization of the
sites for Algiers was delayed by the decision of MURA to construct not one
large abattoir, but rather two small ones; and (b) the acquisition of the
sites was delayed by the lengthy formalities required for the transfer (or
purchase) of each site.
5.03     Recruitment of Consultants.  Early in 1980, MARA informed the Bank
that all studies and technical assistance to the agencies of MARA, or
government enterprises under its supervision, must be performed by BNEDER
(Bureau National d'Etudes pour le Developpement Rural), a Government
consulting company attached to the Ministry of Agriculture. As BNEDER had not
the necessary expertise to act in this matter as consultant to ONAB, the Bank
required that BNEDER (instead of ONAB) should employ the consultants needed.
Invitations for proposals were sent by BNEDER to short-listed consultants only
in mid-April 1981 and a contract was signed in October 1981.
5.04     Changes in ONAB Management and Structure.  The delays in meeting the
above condition of effectiveness were also attributable, to a certain extent,
to changes in ONAB's management and, at a later stage, to a fundamental change
r       in the whole structure of ONAB.  Shortly after signature of the loan the
General Director of ONAB was changed and virtually all the staff who were
familiar with the project left ONAB and were not immediately replaced. The
new ONAB management did not seem to be fully committed to the Project.
Moreover, in August 1981 ONAB was split into seven autonomous agencies, three
of which were to be responsible for promotion and development of red meat
production (central, western, and eastern Algeria). Internal transfers of
staff and redistribution of responsibilities made project-related discussions
with ONAB and with the new regional offices virtually impossible. However,



-4-
throughout this two-year period MARA c)aimed to be deeply committed to the
meat complex component of the Project-1 and on many instances it reiterated
that the Project had high national priority. Also, since early 1981 BNEDER
proceeded to review the proposals in the Staff Appraisal Report and the
justifications for the meat complexes component and generally seemed to agree
with them.
5.05     After effectiveness and particularly after consultants started work
in Algiers in March 1982, progress appeared to be satisfactory.  In June 1982
the consultants submitted a preliminary report giving the basic technical
parameters of the meat complexes and in Septesber they submitted a detailed
report with lists of equipment, layouts and cost estimates. This report,
after approval by BNEDER and ONAB, was to constitute the basic document for
the preparation of detailed engineering specifications and bidding documents.
The final version of this document was ready in November 1982 and by the end
of February 1983 work on bidding documents and specifications was nearing
completion. The consultants and BNEDER also prepared reports concerning the
training under the Project, required staffing, organization of each complex
and the first stage of the general red meat marketing and supply study. The
next step, tentatively scheduled for March 1983, was to invite bids for a
turn-key contract for the complexes. A supervision mission was scheduled for
March 1983 to review progress but the mission was called off as the Bank
learned unofficially that Government intended to cancel the loan. The
official request for cancellation was received on May 15, 1983.  No specific
reasons for this request have been given.
VI. BANRK PERFORMANCE
6.01     The Bank's project appraisal appears to have been carried out
thoroughly, in spite of an unsatisfactory project preparation, although more
attention should have been given to the relatively small sheep purchasing and
fattening component which was later dropped because of the subsequently
evaluated risks of creating medicago-based pastures on the high plateau.
However, the Loan was negotiated with the Government in the absence of a
representative from the Borrower, although there were representatives of MARA
and the Ministry of Finance. It would appear that the Bank should have
insisted on representation from ONAB at negotiations.
6.02     The frequency of Bank supervision missions was adequate:  five
missions visited Algeria before the Project became effective to assist the
Borrower to meet the effectiveness conditions, to inspect the meat complexes
sites and to advise on Bank procedures.  Supervision was intensified in 1982
after the Loan became effective to speed up implementation and to help
resolving current issues. The composition of missions reflected more than
usual degree of staff continuity.
1/ The sheep fattening component representing about 8X of project costs was
to be reviewed, as MARA had voiced reservations concerning the use of
medicago pasture at high elevations.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01     The Project appears have been approved too early in the Project
cycle. It is now clear that the two effectiveness conditions, namely
acquisition of sites for the meat complexes and employment of consultants,
should have been rather conditions of negotiations and Board presentation
respectively, as would be the case under present practice. At the time of
appraisal, however, the Algerian authorities appeared to be strongly committed
L'       to rapid project implementation and no undue delays were expected.  The Bank
has had little experience in lending for agriculture in Algeria and no
experience concerning the lengthy administrative procedures inherent to the
Algerian agricultural sector. The changes which took place first in the
management and subsequently in the structure of the Borrower could not have
been foreseen. Present practice for Bank projects in preparation in Algeria
is to require completion of critical steps for Project implementation (e.g.,
signature of major contracts, and recruitment of consultants) before Board
Presentation, so as to avoid subsequent implementation delays.
7.02     A study prepared by BNEDER in April 1981 confirmed the need for the
project and agreed generally with SAR's recommendations concerning the
capacities of the slaughterhouses, and cold storage. Also the evolution of
demand and supply of red meat and of imports of red meat from the time of
project appraisal until 1981 was in line with the projections made during
appraisal. The Government's decision not to proceed with the Project may
reflect a change in policy concerning red meat supply and marketing, rather
than a change of view concerning the original project design and
justifications.
7.03     A final consideration is whether or not the Bank was right in
agreeing to extend the date of effectiveness six times, for an aggregate
period of 28 months from the date of signature until effectiveness. The
justification for doing so was that the project continued to be economically
attractive and MARA's (if not ONAB's) commitment to it appeared still to be
strong. The eventual satisfactory start of implementation in 1982 appeared to
justify the extensions. However, while the unexpected, abrupt decision of the
Government to cancel the loan in 1983 could not have been foreseen, the
repeated extension of the effectiveness date could have been interpreted by
the Bank as a warning of probable major difficulties during the Project
implementation period.
