The project intended to create a sheep purchasing\n            and fattening system based on buying centers on the northern\n            fringes of the arid steppe and newly created medicago\n            pastures and sheep handling yards in the up-lands, and to\n            create three integrated meat complexes in Algiers, Oran and\n            Annaba. An economic rate of return of 22 percent for the\n            sheep buying and fattening operation and of over 50 percent\n            for the meat complexes was calculated at appraisal; the\n            financial rate of returns were 15 percent and 11 percent\n            respectively. The Borrower and Project Executing Agency was\n            ONAB, the national agency for animal feed production, egg\n            and poultry production and red meat marketing, control, and distribution."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
