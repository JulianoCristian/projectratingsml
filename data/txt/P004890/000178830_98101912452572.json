ensuring\n            an adequate supply of red meat in Algeria, both through\n            long-term efforts to increase domestic livestock production\n            and fattening, as well as by providing ONAB with increased\n            capacity to import, process and distribute meat. ONAB would\n            be better able to stabilize the meat prices which presently\n            experience erratic fluctuations, and provide for the needs\n            of its buyers, including factories, schools, hospitals,\n            administrations, etc. The Project includes: (a)\n            establishment of 12 sheep buying centers on the fringes of\n            the Steppe on the High Plateau, and provision of vehicles\n            for animal transportation; (b) cultivation of medic pastures\n            and land now left fallow in rotation with cereals on 60,000\n            ha in 120 selected self-managed farms to be used for sheep\n            fattening; (c) construction of 3 meat complexes, the largest\n            being in Algiers and the two other in Oran and Annaba\n            provinces; (d) technical and financial assistance to\n            implement the scheme would be provided within a new ONAB\n            division; the meat complexes would include a multi-species\n            abattoir with parallel lines for cattle and sheep, a meat\n            cutting plant with associated chilled storage, a meat\n            products and a by-products plant, and storage capacity for\n            frozen meat."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
