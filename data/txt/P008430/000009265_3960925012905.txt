PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GREECE
EVROS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LN. 1457-GR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Evros Development
Project in Greece for which Loan 1457-GR in the amount of US$35.0 milliun was
approved on June 14, 1977. The Loan was closed on December 31, 1985, three
years behind schedule; an unused balance of US$3.9 million was cancelled. The
date of final disbursement was July 22, 1985.
The PCR was prepared by the Borrower's Ministry of National Ec:onomy.
A Project Performance Overview Memorandum was prepared by the Europe, Middle
East and North Africa Regional Office (following a mission to Greece in May of
1986). The PCR and Overview Memorandum are based in part on a reviev of the
Staff Appraisal Report (No. 1547-GR) dated May 20, 1977, the President's
Report (No. P-2096-GR) dated June 1, 1977, the Loan Agreement of June 27,
1977, correspondence with the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda on project
issues as contained in relevant Bank files, as well as interviews with
officials both in the Bank and in Greece who have be3en associated with the
project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on July 15, 1987
for comments. Comments received from Regional Development Service of Central
Macedonia have been incorporated and are attached as Annex 2 of the Project
Completion Overview Memorandum.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GREECE
EVROS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1457-GR)
Evaluation Summnar
Introduction
1.       The Evros Development Project was the thirteenth loan to Greece by
the Bank and the fourth in the agricultural sector--the other three were for
irrigation development. Greece graduated from Bank borrowing in 1979.
Objectives
2.       The Evros Development Project, which is located in the north-east
corner of the country, was the first occasion that the Bank had funded a
regional development project in Greece. The project, which was multisectoral,
was designed to complement and coordinate Government's on-going development in
the region and provide a model for integrated development which could be
replicated elsewhere in the country. The project was broadly focused on
improving the quality of life, raising incomes of beneficiaries to reduce
regional income disparities, and upgrading the institutional framework.
Project components included financing the expansion of a sugar beet factory,
irrigation, flood control, roads, support for extension and research, forest
exploitation and reforestation, technical schools and social infrastructure.
linplementation Experience
3.       The project, estimated to cost about US81.0 million was appraised in
March 1977, and the Bank loan for US35.0 million signed on June 27, 1977
became effective on October 19, 1978--the delays being caused by a change in
Government, which occurred in late 1977, resulting in delays in ratification
of the Loan Agreement. Despite these early delays and the effect of inflation
and fall in the value of the drachma (Drs) relative to the US dollar, the
project has successfully achieved its objectives. The project closing date
was extended four times to December 31, 1984. Although the loan account was
left open until June 30, 1985, US$3.8 million of the Loan had to be
cancelled. Most sub component objectives had, however, been either attained
or exceeded by then. Internal inflation substantially exceeded appraisal
expectations and as a result total project costs were Drs 6,091 million as
against appraisal expectations of Drs 2,960 million--i.e., an increase of
106%, exacerbated by delays in executing the flood protection works, the
largest project component. However, on account of the drachma falling against
the dollar over tue life of the project, total costs in dollar terms were 122
less than appraisal expectations.



(iv)
Results
4.       The economic rate of return of all the directly productive components
is 18% compared to an appraisal estimate of 16%; inclusive of social
infrastructure components and all other project costs, the rate of return is
131 compared to the appraisal estimate of 121. The flood protection and
irrigation component shows a rate of return of only 3% as against 14X
estimated at appraisal. This is attributable to delays in land consolidation,
cost overruns and lower benefits from irrigation which only reached two thirds
of targets. In all other components very satisfactory rates of return were
attained, leading to a satisfactory overall project rate of return on
investment.
F!p4!M and Lessons
5.       The project may be regarded as a successful first venture by the Bank
into financing integrated regional development in Greece. The project was
soundly conceived by both Government and the Bank. The principle that tle
project could lead the way, if successful, to other regional developments in
Greece has been demonstrated in practice since Government confirmed, in March
1985, its intention "to apply the Evros experience in other regions through
the implementation of integrated programs of regional development." The
project has succeeded in mobilizing a planning, implementing and management
capability within the region; it has improved the agricultural production base
and supporting facilities and reduced the risk factor related to flooding;
increased forestry production and addressed environmental issues; enhanced
technical training availability and raised the standard of living and social
services of both rural and urban people living in the region, thus stemming
emigration. Government has fully supported the project, thus making the
three-tiered system for organization and management very effective. The
Bank/Government relationships have been constructive and effective throughout
project implementation. Three principal issues which arose during project
implementation were speedily and effectively resolved by Bank/Government
interaction and decision making--these were: the change from expansion of the
sugar beet factory to construction of grain silos; the change in disbursement
rates or account of drachma/dolJ.ar exchange rates; and the extensions of
closing date to allow fuller utilization of available loan funds.
6.       Lessons learned are:
-    A lead-in time of at least a year is required to permit a region
to mobilize its resources preparatory to project implementation.
-    More detailed appreciation is needed at appraisal of procurement
processing arrangements so that adequate time is allowed both in
the context of the implementation program and in relation to
funding availability.



(v)
Implementation capacity--particularly in regard to the
construction of major irrigation and flood control works, within
a region that was relatively undeveloped, should have been more
realistically assessed and a longer period allowed for project
implementation.
An evaluation mechanism should have been built into the project
to assess project impact, in particular the socio economic
benefits.
Close attention should have been given to issues of fauna and
flora as was done in respect of environmental issues, such as
the effects of proposed flood control and irrigation works, and
international riparian rights of neighboring states 'Bulgaria
and Turkey).
Land consolidation should have been undertaken prior to
construction of flood protection and irrigation works.

EVROS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Completion Overview Memorandum
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Regional Development.  Historically, most of the development of the
Greek economy has taken place in the Greater Athens area, and to a lesser
extent in Salonika, which have availability of finance, personnel, service
industries, market and other administrative facilities. Such a concentration
of development has resulted in the underutilization of resources in other
parts of the country and in social and economic problems in Athens itself.
Regional disparities in incomes and living standards have increased, with per
capita GDP in Athens being about thrice that of Evros prefecture; the rural
population has continued to migrate to the urban centers; and the concentra-
tion of almost all new industry in Athens and Salonika has prevented any
significant resource development in the rest of the country. Decision making
has been centralized in Athens.
1.02     Agriculture in the Economy.  Agriculture plays an important role in
the Greek economy. It employs about 30% of the active working population,
generates 18% of GDP, contributes substantially to export earnings and
supplies industrial raw materials. Of the 3.9 million ha of productive land,
about 3.4 million ha are cultivated, the remainder being fallow land. Farms
are small and scattered, and farmers lack the resources to develop and
intensify production. The fragmentation of land continues to be a major
structural problem in agriculture. About 232 of the landholdings are under 1
ha, and about 952 of the holdings under 10 ha. This pattern has not changed
since 1961.
1.03     Bank Involvement in the Agricultural and Irrigation Subsectors.  The
Evros Development Project focuses principally on integrated regional
development but, within the project, agriculture is the principal productive
sector.  It is the fourth project financed by the World Bank Group in these
subsectors. The first loan of $25 million was made in June 1971 for the
Groundwater Development Project (Ln. 754-GR). This project was the first
large-scale public tubewell program in Greece and was part of the Government's
program for utilization of the groundwater resource of the Thessaly Plain to
irrigate 40,000 ha of cultivable land. Project implementation was
considerably delayed, primarily due to the lack of experience of the Land
Reclamation Service, which was not fully equipped to deal with a project of
such magnitude and complexity. The studies on network design and operation
were inadequate, and the performance of some of the well-drilling contractors
was poor. The loan was closed in May 1982, four years later than originally
planned, when the revised construction program was only partially completed.
Despite the large cost overruns and project implementation delays, the change
0037r



-2-
from dry farming to irrigated farming has brought to the Thessaly region
increased yields and high-value crops generating higher farm incomes. I'
1.04     The Groundwater Development Project was followed by the Nestos and
Yannitsa Irrization Prolect (Ln. 991-GR), which the Bank assisted with a
US$30.0 million loan in June 1974. The loan was fully disbursed by July
1983. This project also encountered substantial implementation delays due
to: (i) shift in the responsibility of the preparation of the final designs
of the modified irrigation system to a relatively inexperienced team of
consultants, (4i) changes in contractual arrangements together with cumbersome
procedures for the review and approval of documents; and (iii) lack of a clear
definition of the project's design at the feasibility stage which caused
substantial, initial delays and necessitated changes in project scope.1'
1.05     A more recent project, on which costruction is yet to be completed,
was that of East Vermion Irrigation (Ln. 1165-GR). This project, also
experienced extensive delays due to time-consuming procedures of Government
ratification and appointments of project manager and steering committee. The
project experienced severe problems related to contractors, changes in project
design and land acquisition. As a result, implementation required about 11
years rather than 5 years expected at appraisal. Nevertheless, despite the
above, the project achieved cropping patterns and yields expected at
appraisal .-'

U. PROJECT PROCESSING
2.01     Project Idenitification.  The Evros Development Project was identified
by a Bank mission in March, 1975, followed by a FAO/CP mission in September of
that year. A FAO/CP mission assisted Government in the preparation of the
project.   The preparation report, issued in June 1976, was well prepared.
The Bank was closely involved throughout, contributing in particular,
regarding organizational structure since this was an especially innovative
feature of the project. The project was appraised in November 1976, following
a pre-appraisal in September of that year.
2.02     Project Objectives and Description.  The main objective was to
support Government's intentions to accelerate national development on a
regional basis, raise incomes, reduce interregional income disparities, reduce
emigration and improve the quality of life. Evros Region was selected as
being particularly suitable to test integrated, regional development
principles because it was a relatively underdeveloped region which
nevertheless had good agricultural potential. It was intended that Evros
should serve as a model for integrated development in other areas of Greece.
To achieve these objectives, the project was designed to provide, besides
complementary investment funds, an organization capable of efficiently
coordinating the public investment program. In addition, it would monitor
implementation progress and, through delegation of financial authority,
produce new projects and programs for financing by the private and public
sectors.
2.03     Project Components.  The main components of the project were:
-    flood protection works on the Erythropotamos River and
installation of about 75 tubewells;
-    development of forestry, includirg roads, reforestation and
infrastructure;
-    doubling the processing capacity of the Orestias sugar factory;
-    construction of paved connection roads and rural roads, and
supply of maintenance eqdipment;
-    supply of vehicles and equipment for the extension, research and
veterinary services;
-    construction of a technical secondary school and purchase of
school equipment;
-    paving of community streets and improvement of drainage and
street lighting, construction of community centers, construction
of retail markets, and replacement of water supply sources for
10 villages; and
0037z



-4-
-    establishment of an Evros Special Development Fund to finance
feasibility studies and pilot projects.
2.04     Project Area, Topography, Climete and Population.  Evros is the most
easterly of the three prefectures (nomos) that make up the region of Thrace.
It covers 420,000 ha and lies in the extreme northeast of Greece, bounded to
the east by Turkey, to the north by Bulgaria and to the south by the Aegean
Sea. The nomos is divided into two flat and gently rolling plains by a large,
central, mountainous range which reaches a height of about 1,000 m. The 3,000
ha proposed for irrigation under the project have deep, r.ch, well drained
alluvial soils. The climate in the south can be classified as eastern
Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool to cold, moist winters. In the
north and west, the climate is more continental with precipitation frequently
occurring as snow in the late autumn and winter. The mean annual
precipitation for the entire Evros area amounts to about 690 mm but only
30-40% falls in the period from April to September--the crucial months for
agriculture. In 1981, the population of the prefecture was 148,000 and, the
cultivable land--of 160,000 ha, was divided into about 29,000 properties.
2.05     Project Costs and Financing.  The total estimated cost of the project
was about US$81.0 million, with a foreign exchange component about US$35
million. Of this, the proposed sugar factory was estimated to cost US$26.8
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$14.0 million. The financing
plan was as follows:

2.06     Negotiations.  The principal issue raised during negotiations was the
size of the Bank's proposed loan. It was proposed that the loan should be
increased from US$35 million to US$43 million in view of the long period
before the project's full benefits could be derived to alleviate pressure on
the country's balance of payments and in view of Government's own proposed
substantial investments in Evros development during the project period.
However, it did not prove possible for the Bank to meet this request.

2.07     The loan was approved on June 14, 1977, signed on June 27, 1977, and
became effective on October 19, 1978. The project effectiveness date had to
be extended five times from the original date of October 25, 1977, due to a
change in Government which resulted in delayed ratification of the Loan
Agreement by the Greek Parliament. Consequently, implementation was delayed,
and project costs also rose beyond expectations.

m. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     Administration.  The Project Office (Office for the Development of
Evros Prefecture) was established informally in Alexandroupolis in October
1977 when four of the personnel were appointed--project manager, civil
engineer, architect and administrative economist. Remaining personnel joined
following parliamentary ratification of the loan agreement. Ultimatcly, the
officc had a total staff of 25 which is a larger unit than envisaged at
appraisal.
3.02     Flood Protection and Irriaation Works.  Historically, riparian
farmers situated along the Erythropotamos River have operated in a high risk
situation from periodic flooding, late spring entry on to their lands and a
rainfed agriculture. By remodeling the river's central channels, constructing
levees and drains and sinking a number of tubewells, the project would provide
security and increased productivity through irrigation of riparian farmland.
3.03     Completion of the flood protection and irrigation program has been
considerably delayed due to a number of factors:
-    the contract was signed, after delays in preparation of designs
and contract award, in January 1980 with completion stipulated
as January 1983;
-    in 1981 there was extreme flooding (1 in 60 year expectancy)
which seriously damaged those works which had been completed;
-    during 1981 the performance of the contractor was less than
satisfactory in logistical build-up and, thus, in pace of
construction. This was subsequently resolved following closer
supervision by the Ministry of Public Works;
-    by the end of 1982, satisfactory progress could be recorded in
constriction of works, an estimated 55S being completed;
-    in 1984, the Spring floods were, once again, excessive causing
damage and delays in recommencement of construction works at the
end of winter. Construction of gabions and riprapping was
necessary to protect works; and
-    in 1985 work could not commence until quite late in the Spring
due to an exceptionally heavy winter.
3.04     Despite the foregoing shortcomings, the construction program was
satisfactorily completed. Three thousand five hundred hectares of riparian
land has been protected from flood damage, meeting appraisal targets, and 42.6
km of levees were constructed, exceeding appraisal estimates of 30 km.
However, out of 107 tubewells drilled, only 71 were found to be successful
yielding 70b of appraisal estimates (105m3 against 150m3); therefore only
oes7g



-7-
2,100 ha of riparian land was brought under irrigation which is 30% below the
appraisal estimate of 3,000 ha. Shortfall in irrigated area was also due to
inappropriate design of civil works which were completed before land
consolidation could commence and hence irrigation water could not be fully
utilizcd. The ex-post ERR was estimated to be 3% against a 141 estimated at
appraisal. It would have been more effective if the land consolidation
program, which ultimately included 4,620 ha, had been initiated right from the
start.
3.05     Forestry.  The forestry component of the project was, in general,
successfully completed on time. One hundred and eighty-five kilometers of
road were constructed as against 285 km estimated at appraisal. This
under-achievement was due to the acknowledgement, early in the implementation
of this component, that there was an area of forest, proposed for development,
which provided an important, internationally recognized habitat for birds of
prey and other species. It was concluded that the area should be preserved as
a wildlife refuge; consequently, the proposed road construction program
through the area was halted. In retrospect, this environment issue might have
been more thoroughly examined at preparation and appraisal stages since the
existence of the area in question as a refugee of birds of prey was well
documented. Nevertheless, the ERR for the forest roads sub-component was
estimated at 17%. Reforestation of 3,000 ha was satisfactorily completed,
yielding an estimated ERR of 33X.
3.06     Sugar Factory Expansion/Grain Silo Construction.  The original
project provided for the expansion of the sugar processing factory at Orestias
from 3,000 to 6,000 tons per day, processing sugar beets grown on the 40,000
ha of irrigated lands in the Evros Region, which was in part, to be developed
under the project. In October, 1980, Government proposed not to expand the
sugar factory for the following reasons:
-    Greece's accession to the EEC which already had a sugar surplus;
-    the existence of large international sugsr reserves; and
-    increases in the cost of production.
3.07     Following the preparation of a feasibility study by Government in
February, 1980, the Bank reappraised this component in May 1980, concluding
that the proposed expansion to the sugar factory should not be pursued and
should instead be substituted by the construction of 11 corn drying plants
having a capacity of 165 tons/hour; 12 warehouses having a captcity of 65,000
tons; and five mobile small drying plants having a capacity of 30 tons/hour
which would provide immediate drying facilities pending construction of the
permanent plants. KYDEP was designated as the management agency for these
grain drying and storage centers.
3.08     Justification for the construction of grain drying and storage
centers included the following considerations:
-    there had been a rapid increase in maize production in Evros as
a result of the introduction of high yielding hybrid varieties
and improved cultural practices;
0037:



-8-
-    farmers had suffered severe losses as a result of inadequate
on-farm storage facilities with spoilt grain due to storage at
high moisture contents;
-    grain could not be moved rapidly to areas of need in Greece as a
result of the dispersed and unsatisfactory on-farm storage
arrangements.
3.09     The component has been successfully implemented, though with some
delays. All drying and storage facilities are being fully utilized and have
contributed to exceed (by 1984) appraisal estimated targets for maize
production. Maize cropped area increased from 5,600 ha before the project to
21,100 in 1984 while total production increased from 34,000 tons to 237,000
tons. The -AR on this component has been calculated as 34%.
3.10     Construction of Paved Connection Roads and Rural Roads.  The project
provided for the construction of 50 km of paved roads to link 13 villages to
the paved road network and about 250 km of gravel roads to service
agricultural production areas. The program has been successfully completed as
follows: constructed 163 km of major roads as against 152 km estimated at
appraisal; 100 km of minor roads against 101 km at appraisal; 59 km connectio'.
roads against 50 km at appraisal. All equipment for the construction, as
envisaged at appraisal, was satisfactorily procured. The roads serve 37
villages in 25 locations and have resulted in much increased traffic and
development growth in the area. The ERR for this component has been
calculated as 24% for the rural roads and 17% for the connection roads.
3.11     Construction of Technical Secondary School.  The technical lycee at
Didimotichon was constructed to satisfactory standards and is now in full
use. However, works were much delayed and the building was not complete until
1985 as against appraisal expectations of 1979. The area of the lycee is
somewhat larger than estimated at appraisal. Equipment was also provided in
line with appraisal estimates for the technical lycee at Orestias. Benefits
have not been quantified but are expected to be positive and significant.
Enrollment at Didimotichon increased from 120 in 1981 to 230 in 1985, and at
Orestias from 250 to 360 for the same period.
3.12     Community Streets, Centers and Markets.  Targets for this component
were fully achieved or exceeded. Benefits were not calculated but the
component benefitted 98,400 people. The standards of living of the
communities, has improved and these improvements have encouraged outsiders to
bring in wealth, for instance through the construction of houses. In
addition, it has almost certainly reduced emigration from these rural areas,
though in the absence of a project evaluation this cannot be quantified.
3.13     Equipment for Extension and Veterinary Services.  Targets for this
component were fully achieved. The efficiency of both extension and
veterinary services has increased substantially, in terms of number and
frequency of farm visits, as a result of the provision of vehicles under the
project.

3.14     Evros Special Development Fund.  The special fund was established to
support the identification, preparation and funding of regional development
projects. Fourteen studies were carried out on a wide range of potential
investment opportunities including such areas as: tourism, small scale
industry (for instance broom manufacture), livestock development, port,
fishing and mining development and miscellaneous civil works.
Project Costs
3.15     Appraisal Estimate.  The total project cost estimated at appraisal
was US$81.1 million including physical and price contingencies. The foreign
exchange component was estimated at US$35.0 million (43%) which included the
direct cost of foreign purchases of equipment and materials.
3.16     Revised Cost Estimates.  In May 1980, the Bank appraised a maize
drying and storage component to substitute for the originally proposed
expansion of the Orestias sugar factory which was found to be no longer
justified (para. 3.07). The substitution of the sugar factory expansion for
the maize drying/storage facilities was approved in December 1980. The latter
was estimated to cost US$17.2 million of which US$10.7 million was foreign
exchange cost (62%) compared to the US$20.0 million estimated for the
erstwhile sugar factor expansion. Total project costs were also revised in
1980 using an exchange rate of US$1 = Dr 43.0 as against appraisal estimates
of US$1 = Dr 36.5 and were estimated at US$83.7 million of which US$35.2
million (42b) was foreign exchange component.
3.17     Actual Costs.  Annex 1, Table 1 shows the actual project costs for
the various components compared with appraisal estimates. By project
completion, in 1986, the actual project costs were estimated at Dr 6,091
million, a cost which was Dr 3,420 million (1162) higher than appraisal
estimates. Total project costs in US$ terms was, however, US$71.2 million
against US$81.1 million estimated at appraisal, i.e., a dollar cost underrun
of 12% against appraisal estimate. The additional cost in Drachmas was mainly
due to the higher than entlcipated internal inflOtion during pro!ect
implementation (about 20% per year compared with a ra.e lower than 10X per
annum estimated at appraisal) coupled with delays in implementation due to
slow start-up, delay procurement and less than satisfactor- contractor
performance, while the lower than estimated total project cost in US$ was due
mainly to a devaluation of the Drachma of over 250% during project
implementation.
Disbursements
3.18     Actual pace of disbursements fell considerably short of appraisal
expectations. A comparison of the actual disbursements versus appraisal
estimates is presented in Annex 1, Table 3. Disbursements actually commenced
in the tnlird quarter of 1979--one year later than appraisal expectations, and
continued rather slowly until the fourth quarter of 1980 when there was quite
a rapid pick up at which point actual disbursements were 70% of estimates. By
003?7



-10-
December 1983 (the original closing date of the project), actual disbursements
were 431 of estimates. The project was finally closed on June 30, 1986 by
when 891 of the loan had been disbursed--US$3.8 million having been
cancelled. It took eight years for actual disbursements to be completed
compared to five years estimated at appraisal.
3.19     A comparison of actual disbursements versus appraisal (amended
version substituting maize dryers/storage for sugar plant) by categories is
provided in Annex 1, Table 4. Category I, consisting of civil works,
accounted for US$15.1 million of the total amount disbursed and exceeded
appraisal estimates by about US$3.7 million despite the fall in the value of
the drachma against the dollar. This reflects the delayed start of the civil
works construction programs, the inflationary factors and the need to carry
out works in addition to those planned at appraisal, due to exceptional
climatic circumstances. Disbursement under Category 2, for equipment,
m.terials and supplies, was 74% of estimates and reflects efficient
procurement and the exchange devaluation factor. Disbursement under Category
3 for the maize silo complexes and stationary dryers was 70% of estimates,
also reflecting efficient procurement and the devaluation factor. The
allocation for portable dryers under Category 3 (ii) proved to be
overgenerous; disbursement was only 282 of appraisal estimates although all
the items were procured as planned. Overall provision for goods and setvices
for studies and pilot projects was a relatively small amount (US$1.0 million
allocated) and actual disbursements were 210% of estimates reflecting
additional activity under this category.
3.20     Progress reporting under the project has generally been of a good
standard, with delays in submission not being excessive. A format was
designed early in project life which provided a clear picture of
implementation progress on the various sub components. This format also
formed the basis to routine and annual progress reports. The audited accounts
for KYDEP were satisfactorily submitted.

appraisal-an increase of 23%; 500 against 400 for forestry--an increase of
252; 17,400 from the grain silos; and 8,300 against 5,000 for roads--an
increase of 66%. As shown in Annex 6, net farm incomes (in constant. 1977
currency prices) have risen from 79,000 drachmas to 130,000--an increase of
64%.
4.06     Benefits.  The project components for which benefits can be
calculated are: flood protection and irrigation; maize drying and storage;
forest roads; reforestation; rural roads; and connection roads. The total
incremental benefit of the project valued at 1977 currency prices has been
estimated at Dr 390.2 million (US$2.60 million) and the net incremental
benefit at Dr 302.9 million (US$2.01 million) at full development in 1987.
4.07     Economic Evaluation.  The economic rate of return (ERR) has been
recalculated taking into account the actual performance of the project and is
shown in Annex 1, Table 8. The rate of return of all the directly productive
components is 181 as against 16% estimated at appraisal. Inclusive of all
project costs (i.e., including extension and social infrastructure components)
the ex post rate is 132 as against 121 estimated at appraisal. Whilst, in
general, information provided by Government has been satisfactory, data on
individual farmgate prices have not been made available. Rates of return are
as calculated in the Government PCR and may be subject to change if such
information requested from the Government warrants recalculation.L'
4.08     For flood control and irrigation, the 31 rate of return is much lower
than the 14' estimated at appraisal.  The reasons for this poor return have
been discussed in paras. 3.03 and 3.04. The 34% return on the maize drying
and storage component is higher than the appraisal estimate of 301. Seventeen
percent for forest roads is a satisfactory return but is, nevertheless, much
lower than appraisal estimates of 551. This is due, as explained in para 3e05
to the road construction program having been reduced on account of the need to
preserve a wildlife sanctuary, not envisaged at appraisal. Reforestation has
a 331 ERR--considerably higher than the appraisal estimate of 121, even though
only direct benefits have been included; the return would be even higher if
some of the social benefits were quantified. Rural and connection roads both
have satisfactory rates of return--24% and 172 respectively--though both are
lower than appraisal estimates of 33% and 22%.

Wv. PROJECT IMPACT
Agricultural M-pact
4.01     Because of the late completion of flood protection works on the
Erythropctamos river and consequent delayed installation of irrigation
facilities, it is not possible to measure the precise impact that these
investments have made on agricultural production in the area. However, the
impact is certain to be very considerable on riparian farmers since risk has
now been minimized, and production potential greatly increased with the
provision of irrigation facilities.
4.02     The most significant crop ))roduction impact has been on maize where
it has been considerable. As showr in para 3.09, the area grown to maize has
increased nearly three times while total productAion increased by about 6
times. Average yields per ha compared with appraisal estimates are given in
Annex 1, Table 2. Potatoes and sugar beets have exceeded appraisal estimates
(132% and 1042 respectively); however, yields for other crops are mostly lower
than estimated which may be attributed partly to overestimation at appraisal,
and partly to the fact that farmers are only just becoming familiar with the
newly intensified production system.
4.03     In the absence of a baseline study and impact evaluation, it has also
not been possible to evaluate with precision the agricultural impact of the
installation of the grain silos and drying facilities--which, in any case,
were not completed until after the loan closing date. However, now there will
clearly be a reduction in grain losses on-farm and during marketing and with
much reduced rejections of grain. Whilst, therefore, crop value per ton has
not increased, the overall return to the farmer has increased considerably due
to reduced lossea and with this higher profitability increased arAin
production can be expected.
4.04     Prices.  Farmgate prices increased substantially in current terms
from the time of appraisal between 1976 and 1984 prices, in current terms,
increased from 220% (sugarbeet) to over 1000% (vegetables) mainly attributable
to the very high rate of domestic inflation in Greece during this period.
However, in real terms, prices have remained constant or declined. Annex 1,
Table 7 shows the price indices of Public Investment goods and prices received
by farmers for 1977-1985.
Economic Impact
4.05     Project Beneficiaries.  A large proportion of the 148,500 people
living in Evros prefecture, as recorded in the 1981 census, will have
benefited through increased income as a result of the project. At appraisal,
it was estimated that 34,500 families would benefit under the project. Family
units may vary between 3.12 (the national average) and 4 (an estimated local
average). Thus, there may be between 37,000 and 47,000 families who have
benefited under the project. Within subsectors: actual benefitting families
from the Erythropotamos Scheme are about 4,300 as against 3,500 estimated at
0037s

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     The project has been administered by a Project Manager through the
Evros Development Project Office (EDPO). EDPO has been effectively managed
throughout, with competent and adequate numbers of technical and support staff
(25) and independent and adequate project offices situated at
Alexandroupolis. There have been two project managers--the first serving from
October 1977 until late 1984. Thus there was good continuity of management
and a close i-ivolvement by management from the processing stages of the
project through to subsequent implementation. This has been an important
contributory factor to successful implementation.
5.02     The second tier of project administration has been the Regional
Coordinating Committee of Evros, chaired by the Nomarch and having
representatives of all ministries and agencies concerned with the project.
The Committee has worked well, though there could have been greater
participation from KYDEP.
5.03     In the Ministry of National Economy in Athens, the Central
Coordinating Committee of Evros represents the third tier of project
administration, having been established in 1978. All ministries and agencies
concerned with the project have been represented on this committee. A small
staff has operated the office, having responsibility for: coordination of
meetings; issue of the annual Program of Public Investments; project financing
arrangements; correspondence with the Bank; preparation of withdrawal
applications under the loan; and preparation and processing of international
tender documents. This administrative tier has also operated effectively by
representing the project iA dealings with Central Government in Athens and
generally reducing delays as far as possible in regard to financial and
afministrative matters.  It has, nevertheless, had to grapple with time
consuming procedures in dealing with such issues as procurement and government
financing.
5.04     Operation and Maintenance.  Responsible bodies for operation and
maintenance have been as follows: for irrigation works and rural roads--the
Land Reclamation Service; for flood control--the construction supervision
service of the Department of Public Works; for the grain silos and
dryers--KYDEP (The Central Organization for the Management of Agricultural
Products); for roads--the Evros Prefectural Technical Service; for forest
works--the Evros Forest Service; and for urban works--Local Organizations of
Self Administration. No conclusion can be drawn on the effectiveness of these
bodies in maintaining the works constructed at this stage, though all have
functioned soundly and implemented their components satisfactorily.
5.05     Cost Recovery.  At appraisal it was estimated that full operating and
maintenance costs and a small contribution towards depreciation would be
recovered through a charge of Dr 572 (US$16) per stremma. The Erythropotamos
Local Organization of Land Reclamation was established on January 1984 by
Nomarchial Decree and its financial statements published for 1984 and 1985
0037z

which showed that water users paid Dr 300/stremma in 1984 and Dr 948/stremma
in 1985. At an exchange rate of US$l=Dr 85.6 the cost recovery is equivalent
to US$11.07 per stremma.
Performance of the Bank
5.06     There were 17 project supervision missions between September 1977 and
March 1985 (i.e., an average interval of 5 months); missions have included
staff of the following specializations: economist, road engineer, procurement
specialist, irrigation engineer, forester and agriculturalist.   Continuity of
supervision has suffered somewhat but, on the other hand, frequency of
missions and specialization spread have been good.
5.07     The project, appraised by the Bank, was thorough in regard to:
project concept (an integra;ed regional development project was a novel
conception at the time); the three tiered organizational structure which has
worked well; and the several components included in the project. The Bank and
Government interacted positively and effectively when i. was recognized early
in project implementation that the proposed expansion of the Orestias sugar
factory was no longer a viable proposition. Substitution of maize drying and
storage facilities was soundly and speedily appraised and in implementation
has proved a very successful component.
5.08     The Bank gave very careful consideration, prior to appraisal, to
environmental issues regarding the international (as it might affect Turkey
and Bulgaria) riparian issues involved in the construction works proposed for
the Erythropotamos River. However, inadequate attention was given to the
effect of the proposed road construction program on wildlife in the forests.
During project implementation, the importance of the refuge was recognized and
the proposed road program much reduced to allow for a wildlife preserve to be
created.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
6.01     The project was approved in June 1977 and was expected to be
completed by June 30, 1982. Whilst this project can be regarded as a
generally successful operation in establishing the means to carry out, and in
actually implementing integrated regional development, there have been
problems and these are described in the following paragraphs.
6.02     Land Consolidation.  Land consolidation was a necessary feature in
the developmen% of the reclaimed areas because the existing state was one of
severe fragmentation. However, due to faulty design the land consolidation
work was not initiated until after the completion of the civil works of flood
protection and irrigation. Experience has shown that there was no need to
delay the land consolidation process, which in any event tends to be time
consuming, until after civil works had been constructed. As a result of this
fault in critical path design, the benefits arising from the flood protection
and irrigation works have been reduced and delayed.
6.03     Lead Time.  The project was located in the far north eastern part of
Greece, Thrace, in an area which, historically has been relatively
underdeveloped. Consequently, prior to the project there did not exist a
strong base for planning, executing and monitoring regional development
projects. This rather weak, human resource base in the region made
mobilization of implementation effort difficult and this has contributed to
the delays in executing the program. The project was planned to be completed
over five years, whereas it took seven. More realistic planning would have
allowed a lead-in time of at least one year to build up resources, train
personnel and prepare thoroughly for what was quite an extensive development
program.
6.04     Evaluation.  The nature of the project was exploratory--to test
concepts and practices of integrated regional development in Greece. A number
of aspects were novel, in the Greek context, such as the three tiered system
of administration; and the socio economic, agro .ultural and industrial
developments within the context of overall regional development . It was
therefore all the more important that the impact of the project should be
measured so that a guide could be available to Government when considering its
future plans for similar regional development exercises. However, the project
did not include provision for a base line survey to be carried out or for
evaluation over the life of the project. Thus, no evaluation has been carried
out on such critical issues as, for instance, the improvement in standard of
living that may have been provided to rural people or of any impact that the
project may have made on re!ucing emigration. Government has, in its PCR,
recognized the appropriateness of replicating similar integrated regional
development projects elsewhere in Greece. Nevertheless, had the project
included detailed socio economic evaluation, it would have provided a much
stronger guideline to Government in considering its regional development
alternatives.

6.05     Procurement.  Procurement procedures in Greece are time consuming
and, in the case of the project, have led to delays in implementation. A
better recognition of this problem could have been made at appraisal and
appropriate, more realistic critical path timetables could have been prepared
which would have led to a longer lead-in period to implementationk (see para
6.03 above).
6.06     Environment Issues.  As stated in para 3.05 a number of environmental
issues were identified early in the project process and appropriate measures
taken to ensure that the project was not detrimental in this regard. However,
in the case of the forest road program, inadequate attention was given early
in the project cycle, and during appraisal, to knowledge which already existed
on the wildlife habitat of areas through which the proposed forest road
program was scheduled to pass. It was only during implementation that the
importance of these areas, particularly for birds of prey, became fully
recognized. As a result, part of the forest road construction program was
halted and a game reserve established in mid project.

Mr. Graham Donaldson, Chief
Agriculture, Infrastructure
and Human Resources Division,
Operation Evaluation Opt.
I.B.R.O., I8I8 H Street, N.W.,
WASHINGTON,O.C., 20433
U.S.A.-
Dear Mr. Donaldson:
Re:Overview oo the P.C.R. of
Evros Development Project
(Loan 1475-GR )
Thank you for your letter from July 15, which just reached
'me     in August I7.
First of all i'll like to inform you that, since April I987,
i am no longer on service by the Evros Development Project Office.
Mv present official postis in the Regiohal Development Service (R.D.S.)
of Central Macedonia, in Thessaloniki* The E.D.P, Office is, after
the Project completion, no longer on activ Service. One employee, staying
in Alexandroupolis, is handling the proceedures for transfering recods
and equipment to the R.D.S, of Thrace in Komotini.
With reference to the Overviei on the P.C.R. for the Evros De-
velopment Project (prepared by the E.Mh.E.N.A.- Regional Office of
I.8.R.D.),which you kindly sent to-me, i would like to formulate some
remarks, as followed:
- I am standing harmoniously to the general annotiations, this overview
makes, concerning the economic and social evaluation of E.D.P., in
the same manner as the experiances and lessons learned of the Project
implementation. The E.D.P. can be, realy, regarded as a succesfull
first venture, by the Greek Goverment and the Bank, into financing
intergrated regional development projects.
- For the particular activities and efforts, the E.D.P.O. was responsible
for,i'd like to make the following correcting notes:
(i)Loan's Disbursmentst to the level of $ 31,2 Mi. (instead of the
expected $ 32,0 Mi.), have suceeded at end of June, I985; not at
June, I986, asin the overview is refering for.

(ii) The Project- Closing Oate was finally extented to Oec. 31, 1984.
(iii)All the Project items have been totaly implemented (physical
Ouantities) uotil the end of December 1985 (with one exception:The
Land Consolidation Works in Erythropotamos Ualley).
(iv) An  initial evaluatioi; o. t-ae Projct impacts, during the imple-
mentation period, nave been drown up In Lhe components zopletion
report (volume 2 or P.C.H.), as well in chapter V. of P.C.R. (
although in a shorter way).
(v)  The P.C.R. writing up was planed and realized by the EeD.P.O.-
Staff in a, relativly,short time on the basis to be needfull
both, to the Greek State (Goverment and Local Administration Ser-
vices) and to the Bank. The E.D.P.O.-Staff undertook this responni-
bility contrary to the, existing, reality, that there was neither
former experience nor any other  special preparation. In the same
time  the management team settled all the others Project's - Cloo-
sing proceedurers, as, for exablet arranging final Payments or
fulfiling administrativ matters, concerning project-items activa-
tion and maintenance.
At last, responding to an overview's remark (see chapter IV, para. 4.
07), i would like.to give you a table with figures C-oncernin3 individual
farmgate prices for 1985. Those data have' been surveyed and calculated
by Mr. F. Tsifoukis, an Agriculturalist E.D.P.O. Officer, until the late
days of April,1987.

EVROS   DEVELOPMENT   PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
O.PREFACE
The completion Report for the Evros Development Project has as  its    main,
target to approach and / or to evaluate, originaly, the result and the effectivness
from the "Evros Special Development Project" implementation.
According to Mr Michael Pease's (World Bank's special officer for Evros Development
Project)proposal,made during his visit,from Sept.15,-Okt.3,1904in Evros,it was decide
at a meeting of Regional Coordination Comittee of Evros, held on April 30,1985,
that Project completion Report's (P.C.R.) writing up must be operated on the Evros
Development Project Office  (E.D.P.O.).This. with the complemntary proposition,
an experianced economist must be provided, by the Ministry of Nat. Economy,
to assist the Project Management team in the calculations of an Economic Rate of
Return ( EeRoR.) of the-Project.

EVROS  SPECIAL   DEVELOPMENT   PROJECT
PROJECT   COMPLETION  REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1i  The " Plan for the Agricultural Development of Evros ".(EVROS Development
ProJect)is an integrated Program of Regional Development which complements
thmse for Regional Develdpment in the Prefecture (Regional investment
Program, SANT, National Program, Program  for the development of Public
Sector agencies - parallel Investments - , programs for the support of
Industrial growth through development laws ).
The checking and supporting of the population of the Greek provinces is
established as the main objective of the Greek regional policy and all
Governmental measures are aiming towards this directior.
In oreder to succeed, this policy should continue and complete an entire
series of economic, institutional and organizing measures which have alre-
ady been taken and are presently applied at a general panhellenic scale.
These measures are progressively becoming a part of the Dec*3ntralization
procedure and the Oemocratic Programming. The full use of hsman potential,
the programming and the transfer of incentives to Local Government assure
the social control of the development procedure and the electives of Regional
Policy.
The special programs of general development at a prefecture level, consti-
tute a pioneering effort for a systematic, integrated and quick hauling
of the special problems of certain prefectures of our country and require
that the state increase its care and attention fron the point of view of
resource distribution and organization, At the same time these proyranis
offer a new approach to the policy of regional develumpent of Greece, and
aim to its becoming more specific and applicable for the different sectors
of the Greek area and its specific population.
This approach to regional development is in absolute accord with the rerqui-
rements and conditions of the participation of Greece in the regional policy
of the community and the drawing of resources from the Special Fund for
Regional Development of the EEC. Notice should be given to the fact that
the regional approach followed has b?en discussed with EEC higher officiajs
and that it has been discussed with CEC higher officials and that it has
been ascertained that the recent Greek experience is not only in accortd



-m2-
with today"'a orientations of the community, but eoincides with future prospects
of presenting the regional policy before the EECI this consists of the financing
of entire programs - at a prefectural or even lower geographical level instead
of the financing of individual projects followed to date. The Integrated Madi-
torranoen Program (IMP) financed by the Community constitute a recent implementa
tion of those prospects.
ln order to fulfill its objectivo the Program anticipate4.. in addition to the
complementary sums for Public investmnts that a decentralized organization
be established and operated, able to. efficiently coordinate the Public Investment
Programs (including those which are not financod by the World Bank) and follow
its progrmss, to implement the Program, to produce new program and studies
for the financing by other agencies of the Public or Private sector, at the
location where the Plan is being implemented.
This organization would consist of the Central Coordinating Committee of Evros
(CCCE) in Athens, the Regional Coordinating Committee of Evros (RCCE) and the
Office for the Development of Evros in Alexandroupolis (EDPo)
1.3 Specifically the administrative organization for the implementation of the
S.D.P.E. (special program for the development of Evros) includes:
(a)     The Office for the Development of the Evros Prefecture run by
a staff (scientific and auxilliary) with special qualifications
(post graduate studies, experience in the construction of works etc.)
with central offices in Alexandroupolis.
(b)   '4ne Regional Coordinating Committee of Evros (RCCE) consisting
of representatives from all Ministries presided on by the Prefect
of Evros, with head offices in Alexandroupolis.
(c)     The Central Coordinating  Committee  of Evros, established in Athens,
consisting of representatives of the Central Services of the Ministriae
and constituting the link with the agencies - Ministries executing
the project and the World Bank. The Secretariat of the Cent:al
Coordinating Committee in Athens has undertaken responsibly all the
items of the Project which are effected in Athens  such as preparation
of the meetings of the CCCE9 the issue of tile yearly program of Public
Investments, the financing of the Program, correspondence with the
World Bank, preparation of the documents and submittal of the petitions
for the withdrawal of the loan, preparation and expediting of all the
details concerning international call for bids etc.
1.4 The Project consists as applied of the following particular parts
(a)     Works for flood Protection  irr  ation, buildinq of a compete drainae-



.3-
nd road network  d  land reartion.nt at th  Valle  of  rt             ta
Through these works the Erythropotamos valley which is flooded almost every
year, will be protected with a flood frequency  factor of 1/50 years. The
protection achieved includes an area of 3,500 ha through the formatidn of a
now river channel for a length of 30 Km. The drainage network provides pro-
tection for the are by quiding the gravity flow of surface waters during
tht. periods. of normal flow and by pumping during  the period of . flood.
The.-irrigation in the area. to be thus protected shall be achieved by pumping
from the 67 sucesful borings and the creation of a main surface line for
the irrigation networks leading to water intak.iinlets to be usd by portable
systems of artificial rain for the irrigation, of fields.
The land reapportinm t which will include an area of 4,620 ha, shall ensure
the formation of field lots each of an area of 400 ha for a better distribu-
tion of the irrigation water balance. This land reapportionment shall make
use of a system of proportional compensation for existing fields. A complete
rural road network has boen designed. The managemont of the Irrigation Works
is to be under the Local Organization of Land Reclamation T.O.E.V. under the
spervision of the Direction of Land Reclamtion Service,(D.E.V.)
(b)  Warehouss and Drying Plants for maize
This sector of the Project was included following the final cancellation of
the Sugfir Factory extension of the Final letter H S I to I.B*R-Pft 13117/24.2,.8)
The works include the building of vertical metal warehouses of A total capacity
of 92,000 tons with automatic scales at 12 locations all over the Prefecture,
In addition at 11 of these locations dyring plants were built of a 15 ton/hour
drying capacity, In parallel five (5) portable dryers were obtained that were
made available to the Associations in order to cover the needs of the interim
period before the operation of the permanent drying plants.
(G) Works for Forest Devlomt s These include
(1) The building of forest roads of A, B, type and accesses of a total length
of 404.00 Km, at the Forest complexs (Derio - Dadia - Esimi) and (Dadia-
Lefkimi - Soufli) in order to serve 8500 ha of forest.
(2). Reforestation of 3,000 ha at the complexes Kirki - Sikorrahi, Drimos -
Esimi, Derio   Dadia  with three varieties of pine   trees.
(3) Mechanical equipment necessasry for the above works,



4-
(d)  Rural Road Construction s Includes the (a) works for rural road construction
at 25 Communities outside the Erythropotamos area. A total of 253 Km have
been built and (b) the supply of mechanical equipment of a 73,3409000 Dre.
Value for their construction and maintenance. The determination of the spe-
cific roads already built was effected by the Local Government Organizations,
(e) Works for urban and Social infrastructure i Include
(1) rho building of Urban roads at 19 Communitiss of the Prefecture of a 55
KM total length with the necssary infrastructure for the removal of
rain water and the construction and supply of light fixtures for c1ectric
lighting.
(2) The building of twelve Community Centers at Prefecture Communities which
see to be "centers " for the activities of that region. The Centers
will include facilities for a future installation of the Local Government$
Libraries, Hall for multiple uses or Theatre, areas that can house edu-
cational manifestations. The types of Social Centers already built vary
acowrding to the population, the views of the Local government concerning
their operation and the characteristics of the particular region.
(3) M4nicipal Market plaes, covered, were built at Soufli, Didimoticho,
Oreetiada in order to replace and improve the ones alreody there and
to take care of the weekly farmers'markets. These marketplaces were buflt
in such a way as.to become regional marketplaces in the future according
to the specifications of the Community. They can, in addition to shops,
also house a auction gallery, professional organizations and show rooms
for local products.
(4) Water supply of Communities t Improvements of the indoor and open water
reservoirs were effected at 11 Settlements for the improvement of the
quality and the quantity of drinking water.
(f) SUTec                 lgmnts of Services:
This sector includes mechanical and technical equipment to assist the Farming
and Veterinary Services as well as the Prefectural Fund for the improvement
of services rendered to Agricultural Research, the control and protection
of cattle - breeding not only of Evros but of the entire Thrace area, and the
maintenance of the Prefectural network in excellent condition through the cor-
responding Technical Services of the Prefecture, the management of the credits
for which the Prefectural Fund is responsible.
Thus , each department will receive the following :
(1) The Agricultural Service. Equipping the Agricultural research of the
Orestioda (Orestiade) Agricultural Administration with additional



construction means (8 automobiles type jeep). The Orestiada Agricultural Research
Center will be equipped with the proper field experimental equipment in order
that it become a "model " and take care of the increasing demands of the area,
The Station will handle the local problems of improvement and development and
will influence directly the greater part of the Agrarian population.
(2) Equipping the veterinary service of the Prefecture with transportation means
(21 j@p automobiles) and its researh center at Komatini (outside the program
area) with full laboratory equipment in order that it saerve ell three Pre-
fecturee of Thrace.
(3) Equipping fully the Prefectural Fund in order to secure the required assistance
by the Prefecture'a Technical Services for the maintenance in good condition
and readiness of the rural network of the Prefecture.

Financing the necessary equipment for the installation and operation of the
Agency, the Project management as well as the expenses for personnel salaries.
1.5   The Plan was financed entirely through the Program of Public Investments, to
which World Bank has contributed US $ 32,000,000 for the purpose of mainly
financing expenses in foreign currency. The original assessment of the total
cost for the execution of the plan was 2,958,640,000 drs or US $ 81,100,000
and the participation of W.B. 1,275,840,000 Drs. or US $ 35,000,000 in that
coat, that is a mean participation of approximately 43%. The conditions of the
Loan are described in the Agreement of the Greek State with the Word Bank of
June 1977 ratified through L. 770/78,



The loan mut be repaid in full within fifteen years and pay off will
be effected through the payment of US 1,460,000 on the first day of
March and September starting from 1981 and until 1992. The interest
-rate was set at 8.2 % per year on the amount of the loan received.
The unfavourable developments re : par values between the drschnia
and the dollar against the firstg made the cancellation of part
of the loan, consisting of $ 3,000,000 on the part of the Bank ne-
cssary. The proposal was accepted by the bank in 1984.

II. SELECTION OF PLAN - PRELIMINARY WORK - PROGRAMMING
2.1     Oriqin
2.l,l.The Greek government in order to (a) accelerate of the rate of regional
development, (b) to increase the incom.  and reduce the income dispa.
rities between regions, (c) to reduce migration and (d) to improve the
quality of life at the Evros region, has decided to implement the Special
Program for the Development of Evros.
Evros was selected because this Prefecture is one of the poorer regions
(mean per capital Income is half of that of the country ) but which
however offers excellent Agricultural resources.
For the development of these resources, the Government finances Works
amounting to approximately 3.5 billion Ors. (24.0 million dollars) each
year, for Agriculture, irrigatiovi, flood control and land improvement
works, transportation, education and social infrastructure,
The Special Evros Program's objective was to complete works in dif-
ferent sectors in order to present a model of intergrated development
to other also regions of Greece.



-74
2.1.2.  The Government  asked for a Loan from the World Bank in order to parti-
ally finance the multifaceted Program for the Development of Evros.
While completing the continuing development works, this program will
be the initial effort of the Government to develop a region of Greece
which is relatively thriving lose than others, through state reform,
within legal fra  orks, for the decentralization of decision - taking,
coordination and following of public investmonts.
The.-Government hopes-that this program-will form an original model for
an Interated investment in Greece.
This Program was drafted and prepared by experienced employees of the
Government , thea World Bank, assisted by employees of the program for
mutual.assistance of the F.A,D. of the Agricultural Bank. Irrigation
and flood control works associated with shore problems, were studied
by special consultants in order that shoreline and beach rights be
secured.
The Programming of the Plan was completed in March 1977 by a mission
whose members were Messrs Altaff Hussain, Masud Mian, D. Powrie,
1. Porter MrsP  Fukuda - Parr and Messrs i. Allan, J. C. Jones and
J. Storms (consultants).
Mesars B, Kanchanalach, G. Schumacher and U. Kiermayr were also
consultants assesing respectively the hydrological, organizing and
financing aspects of the Program.
2.2     Preliminar   work and Programming
2.2.1   Region Characteristics
(a) Location
Out of the three prefectures constituting Thrace, Evros is the
one located further to the east. It covers 42,000 ha and is at
the north - eastern end of Greece, boundaring to the east with
Turkey, to the North with Bulgaria and to the south with the
Aegean Sea.
(b)  Climate
South of Evros, the climate fay be classified as eastern medi-
terranean with watm, dry summers and cool to cold, humid winters.
In the north ar.d south the climate is more continental with a
rainfall which often becomes snow around the end of Fall and in
the Winter. The mean yearly rainfall for the entire area of the
Evros prefecture amounts to 690 mm approximately, but only 30X
to 40 falls during the period from April to September, the six



critical months for agriculture.
(c) Topoqueht and Soil
The Evros prefecture is divided into two flat and slightly inclined
plains /divided by a large, central  mountain range which reaches the
height of 1,000 m.
The north plain sroung Orestiads is divided by the rivers Ards and
Erythropotmuos while at the south the shore plain of Alexanfroupolis
joins the delta of the River Evros.
The 3000 ha proposed for irrigation by the Program financed by the Banks,
have deep rich soils, of sandstone and earth.
The waters do not contain salt and the land is good for irrigation.
(d) Water . resources and Hyrology
The surface water resources of the Evros prefecture are the River Evros
and its main tributariest Ardes and Erythropotamos, Th irrigation sector
of the present program was assigned to the Erythropotamo plain.
Erythropotamo  has a water surfae of 19560 sq. or. out of which 40a
are in Bulgaria and the remaining in Grce, Thuse is no dataT on the
yearly rate of flow. Howevr there are date concerning rainfall in the
river'a.  region which show that the river fills witN slot of water in
mid - winter while during the driv months from July to September the river-
waters decreasor
As a result of this occurance, in the wintertime the fertile fields
flood while in the summr there is no water for irrigation,
Recent research by the Greek Government, showed that there is a water
reservoir of 350 mm3 for the irrigation of 3,000 ha in the plain.
(e)      tion  1andownershirm size
In 1961 the Evros Prefecture population was 158,000. Many young people
during thw 1960's migrated either to large urban centers of Greece
or to Western Europe. As of 1971 migration dropped and the population
was stabilized to 138,000 approximately. It has presently risen to
148,000 (1981)
The cultivable land is divided into 29,000 properties approximately,
each one of a 4.6 ha approximate size and is divided into 8 separate
field sections. Properties are larger than in other parts of.Greece
and are farmed by their owner. The following table gives related
information s

(f)    Farminq and Cattle Breedin2
Farming and cattle breeding are the main activities in the Evros
Prefecture and approximately 70% of the population are still occu-
pied actively with forests. Loe than 10X are covered by houses,
roads, rivers and other uses.
In Evros, a rotation of crops is usually effected for feed and
animal foods, mainly of medick. The farming of corn and other sum-
'mor crops is prevented due to lack of irrigation.
Consequentity, at approximately 120,000 ha or 75% of the oultivable
land winter cereals and medick are farmed.
The industrial cultivations are inconsequential excepting sugar beets
whose cultivation began when the sugar factory was bu Ut at Orestiada,
The present day crops which are watered with rainwater present the
following average yield : 6 tons/ha of medick, 3.5 tons/ha of corn,
while sugarbeets which are inadequately watered yield 55 tons/ha
Improved seed variety, better farming with the help of the state
services also assist the Program for the Development of Evros,
Cattle breeding is also considerable at Evros. This is noted for meat
production. However, cattle breeding returns cannot be improved due
to the poor grazing lands, the lack of irrigation for the growing
of hay, the lack of young people able to care for the animals and
the small size of the properties.



*            ~~~~-10-
(g) Irrifation
The irrigated area of thw prefecture was at the time the Project was
drafted approximately 16,000 ha; irrigation was effected mainly by
state organization and partially froim small private wells. An increase
of this ares was estimated of at least 40,000 he by 1983 and 50,000 ha
by the end of the program. The major irrigation programs bdigg exe-
cuted or which have been planned include the north snd south river
Arde, Neohori, Orestiads and the plain of Erythropotamos. Thie expansion
is important for production and even more for the sugar industry,
,because presently irrigatiun is limited to sugar - beet crops.
(h) A!faian Credit System, Aaricultural Research and Applications
TKe Agricultural Bank of Greece   manages almost all of the farmer's
financing business. It also grants subsidies to farmers and assists
in the distribution of seeds, fertilizers and chemical substances.
There are seven (7) Agricultural Bank of Greece Branches in the Evros
Prefecture, all staffed adequately with good management. In 1976 24,5O0
loans were given of 940 million drachmae. The Agricultural Bank does
not stipulate  restrictions in the size of the forms. Short-terms
loans for production mainly are granted with a 7 - 1/2% interest
per year for farmers and 6 - 1/2" for cooperatives, while medium-and
long-term loans are granted w ith a 6-1/2% interest to farmers and 6%
to cooperatives.
Within the prefecture no provisions exist for agricultural research
due to the lack of laboratories and the great distances from the main
reseerch centers. The Institute for the Cultivation of Hay in Larissa
and the Research Centers near Thessaloniki. These centers as well
as the research centers of Xanthi and Komotini help the Evros services
with experiments, mainly within the farmers'farms, However the need
fore alocal station of agricultural research is great.
(i)  Forestr
The forest resources of Evros are considerable. The fully forest
covered area is 88,700 ha while the less dense forest area with
good potential covers 56,000 ha. The ruturns of the thick forest
area are presently 94,000 m3n, but many areas had difficult access
and their present yield was only 75,000 m3. The most productive
forest areas are at Derio - Dadia, Esimi and the area of Dadis-
Lefkimi - Soufli which covers 51,000 ha.



-11-
In order to assure continuous and improved production,
The Forest Service reforests the prefecture's bald and scantly planted
areas, and builds access roads to the already reforested areas. the
felling of the trees was executed by 15 cooperatives of forest -workers
which were under worked. The Forest Service sells the timber and the
buyers are responsible  for its transportation.
(j)    Indust!X
Within the prefecture the most important industry is the Orestiada Sugar
Factory s which is presently equipped for a sugarbeet cutting capacity
if 3,000 tons per dayfor a duration of 100 days.Other important industries
are s a new meat complex at Ferres, a dairy plant at Alexandroupolis,
a silk factory at Soufli and a number of food factories, refrigerators
and warehouses.
°         Most handcraft work in Evros is effected  by small scale businesses based
on the family or cooperative. There exists approximately 1,300 business
which offer work to more than 3,000 people. One 1/3 have 10 or more workers.
The most important manufactured farming utensilst processed the wood,
engineering offices, electrical work and clothing. Their expansion is
prevented due to the lack of capital.
(k)    Roads
The prefecture's major centers are linked through good paved roads but
most smaller centers have dirt or gravel roads. The condition of many of
those roads was not satisfactory and the constantly increasing traffic
requires urgent asphalt paving of all roads. Improvements to rural roads
are also necessary because many of them are rough during the winter and
farming activities are impeded.
(1)    Markets
Most fruits and vegetables are sold by the farmers themselves at local
markets. The existing marketplaces are traditional without any facilities
and are usually located on main roads cuasing traffic and public health
problems . It was necessary to improve marketplaces in larger cities where
there is a market only once a week.
(m)    Education and social Infrastructure
_ea ----- c- -----_- ----_-- ------
The level of the social services at Evros cannot be compared with the
national average. Illiteracy is high and public health facilities are



-12 -
less whi'Le fewer than half of the houses have running water. The education
infrastructure has been improved during the last years but many schools
are housed in leased buildingse. In the sector of health, the problem has
become very acute due to the communities bad guality of water supplied.
Most communities have inadequate recreational activities and municipal
buildings. There were very few social centers and even fewer Libraries
with very little entertainment.
Such sharp contrasts with the more developed areas of Greece encourage
migration.
(n') Income and Standardof LivinL
There exist great income disperities between the large urban centers and
other areas, Evros agricultural areas are mainly isolated. Seventy percent
(70%) of the population, approximately double of the nation's average,
lives ata the prefecture's agricultural areas. The average per capita income
varies, prior to the implementation of the Project, between US $ 750 and
800 $ .- in comparison to the national agrarian average income of $ 90O.-
but was only one third of the total national average of $ 2,100.-
More than half of the agrarian population is estimated to have income
less than one third of the national average. The farmers of the Erythropo-
tamos plain are the poorest of Evros as a whole, mainly because yearly
flqods drove them to late or seasonable crops with a considerably low
yield and great production "risks
2.3       Tar2ets and Coals
2.3.1. As has already been mentioned the nature of the program designed was
suck as (a) to establish, through its intervention, the conditions neces-
sary to improve the standard of living of all the Prefecture's inhabi-
tants and (b) to increase their income decreasing the disparities that
exist with the country's other regions, in order to first check migration
at home and abroad and to assist in the resettlement of repatriates
The special regional development programs, are programs of intensive
and fast integrated intervention by the public sector in order to handle
the special regional  problems through more than average financing of
each region of the country. They are special because they refer exactly
to the handiling of special curtailing factors , and integrated because
they integrate within an average period of timet the intervention of
the regional agency whose objective is to extend the existing regional
returns of the area through the exploitation of the existing natural
resources.



-13-
Thus the choices of improving irrigation cultivations while protecting them
at the same time, of supporting cattle breeding, and the ability of increasin';
the production of wood pulp, together witn the changes attempted by the
program in the sevtor for the promotion of services, education and the impro-
vemant of the Urban life quality granted are within the objectives of the
Regional Policy to be practiced by the Stae. The characteristics of the special
prograam according to prefecture (or region) are that they are programs of
action and application, whose priorities are to face the urgent problems of
the prefecture with specific means and measures and therfore effctively, while
at the sam. time establishing the conditions for a dynamic and proper long -
term growth.
Special objectives of regional policy which are applicable immediately are
(a)   Te economic and administrative decentralization.
(b)   The immediate application of the regulatory policy of land usages
for housing, industrial and tourist development as well as the pro-
tection of the environment in areas where the corresponding development
exists.
(c)   The severely controlled, according to priority, tourism development
in areas lacking important agricultural means and do not have the
comparative benefits of industrial dayelopment as well as the suppoi.
and expansion of autonomous services particularly in the sector of
education.
(d)   The improvement and reform of the housing environment in rural areas,
(e)   The social and cultural development of the provinces.
In addition to the aboce objectives which project as present day as well as
future necessities for   drastic intervention in the provinces greater emphasip
should be given to the policy for followed to this date for the development
of natural resources (farming and cattle breeding, fishing, forests, subsoil)
as well as the industrial development of the provinces through which will be
solved the employment program of labor force surplus and at the same time the
demographical problem of the country.
On these grounds the Special Development Project of Evros intervenes not only
through financial assistance (credit) but also in actual project work, in the
total of the State's activities and in the Local Government for the development
of the region, related to the following sectors
- Land improvement by 45%
- Rural roads by 80%
- Connecting roads by 50%
- Community streets by 60%



-1-
- The supply of project equipment 90X
- Silos and Dryer for Maize by 60%
In parallel it assures, at socio - cultural level, a special contribution
to the inhabitants through the construction of infrastructure(Community
centers and municipal marketplaces ) for the perfect housing of Local
Governments Education, and cultural activities as well for the operation

prices )-
111.  Project mlementation
3.1  Start - up
The Loan Agreement signed by the Greek State and the World Bank in June
1977 for the " Special Agricultural Program for the Development of Evros "
was retified by Greek Parliament in April 1978.
The great delay between the signing and the ratification of the agreement
was due to the dissolution of Parliament in the Fall of 1977, and the procla-
mation of elections in the Fall of 1977. The Loan Agreement was ratified
through L. 770/78.
Thus 1978 was the first year of the program 'a implementation, and it is
as of that date that the real and administrative items of the Project had
to be faced.
3*1.1.   The following are mentioned in order that the conditions and problems faced
to begin with may be assessed:
(a) The project's Office (Office for the Development of the Evros Prefecture)
was established informally in Alexandroupolis in October 1977, with a
personnel of four (Project Manager, one Civil Engineer, one Architect
Regional clammes and one administrative - economists). .Appointed of the
remaining personnel recuired began in July 1978 following the passing
of the law for the ratification of the Agreement.
(b) The Works Collective Resolution 7826 (SAE) was issued in April 1978 but
the resolutions for the determination were effected in August 1978
(resolutions PA 217/220) with the result that the available time appropri-
ate for the execution of works expired (works of civil Engineer).
(c) There are no full technical studiese tehcnical specifications and tender
documents for the execution of the works with the result that the staff
was mainly occupied in collecting d6ta, the preparation of studies,
Technical Specifications and Tender documents.



-15_.
(d)  The provisions in force for the procedures of work execution were time-
wasting. The problem is even greater in cases International Call for
Bids are required particularly if the project are small. (Urban Roads,
connecting roads). Discussions with World Bank representatives resulted
in the amendment of the Agreement at this point.
(e)  Because the procedures for the activation of the Loan were not yet
completed, adequate time and activity was coent for the preparation of
all the procedures.
(f) At the same time, with talks and discussions in housings (Municipalities
and Communities), local officials (heads of local councils, Secretaries,
Agriculturists, heads of services) are informed about the program, its
objectives, purposes and procedures of its implementation.
Following the above, the problems that had to be handled at the beginning of work
implementation can be described as follows:
(I.)   Personnel problems
For the preparation of the studies and tender documents, the call for
bids, the awarding of the works as well as their supervision, an adequate
number of personnel with special qualifications is necesary:
3 At Evros many unoccupied personnel positions existed in the Services.
However Employees showed no interest in being appointed or .:remaining
there due to its location which is close to the bordsrs and quite removed.
- The implementation of the Special Program for Evros required in many
instance the tripling or quadrupling of the total financing of the
regional programs of the Prefecture. This resulted to an immediate
and necessary   (1) increase in the number of employees and particu-
larly of those of Technical and Geotechnical specialization, (2)
overtime employment which was not authorized by law 754/77 and therefore
prohibited.
(II.)   Problems of hi2h cost of the works
From the first work cost assessment it was obvious that a serious devia-
tion was evident from the Plan Appraisals, as was presented following
the preparation of the Technical and Economic studies of the works.
This deviation seemed right away to exceed 50% without taking into
consideration further revisions due to inflation and the delay in
construction time.



-16-
(III.) Procedural problems
In this respect we have the following basic problems :
(1) The procedures of international call for bids (preparation of tender
documents, submittal to the World Bank, authorization and announcement
by the competent minister, awarding, signing of agreement, receipt
and equipping of works) is time consuming.
The problem was evident as of the first year with the proceudres
for the works (flood prevention works of Erythropotamos, drillings)
and the supply of equipment. The problem was partially taken care of
through a proposal by the ODE, to Bank representatives which resulted
to limiting considerably the number of the works subject to Interna-
tional Call for Bids to those whose budget exceeds                  Drs.
(2) The travelling orders for employees have been curtailed and therefore
the already small number of employees is not in a position to supervise
the works because their distance from the seat of the services is
great. The problem was solved by including in the total budget of the
works part of the cost for compensation away from residence, to be
acknowledged through the resolutions of WCR (Works Collective Resolution
of each y;ear
3.2 Pro2rsm Revisions
As of 1979 the Hellenic Sugar Industry (HSI) was considering whether the imple-
mentation of its Orestiada Plant extension stipulated by the original Agreement
was advisable.
The reasons invoked were the following :
-    The cost of production  increase
-    The existance of great international sugar reserves
-    Our country's accession to the EEC, which already had a sugar production
suprlus.
-    The Greek Sugar Industry had to propose that the extension be cancelled.
(Letter by the GSI to the W.B. AE 1317/24.l0.80)6
This proposal was approved by the CCCE and the following procedures were
followed for the substitution of a part of that Project with the t3nstructior
of vertical metal warehouses (SILOS) and the installation of corn drying
apparatus.
The following were the Yactors that indicated the nature of the works
replacing the sugar factory extension, as well as the procedures for their
approval by the W.B.



- 17-
On the basis of the agriculture - economic conditions prevailing in the Evros
Prefecture (increase of irrigated areas, nature of crops and their competitivensa
etc.' it is absolutely essential that a great part of the irrigated areas be
allotted to the growing of corn.
- It was calculated that during 1982, 20,000 ha will be cultivated with corn crops.
Already by 1980 the corn cultivated area amounted to approximately 10,000 ha and
it was estimated that during the same year production will amount to 80,000 tons.
- A decisive role in corn cultivation expansion is played by the existance of the
necessary equipment which decreases the humidity of the harvested product (30%)
at levels (14%) allowing for its long term conservatirn.
The equipment includes dryers and warehouses in different locations of the
Evros Prefecture. For the implementation of that program the following were
effected.
(a)    A preliminary study was drafted an economic advisability in February
1980 by a group of officials from different agencies (Ministry of
Coordination, Agriculture, KYDEP) which was submitted to the World
Bank for evaluation.
(b)    From 27 May to 30 Mcy a Group of Experts of the World Bank (Messrs
Heidhues, Hodges, Schertz) visited the Evroa prefecture area and
talked to the Prefect, the Project Manager officials of the Agricultu-
ral Administrations and representatives of the Agricultural Cooperative
Associations. Messrs G. Giasimakopoulos, General Director - Head of
the Regional Development Service of the Ministry of Coordination,
N, Stathakopou.loa, Director of the Ministry of Coordination and
D. Goumenidis Director of the KYDEP accompanied the Group.
(c)    From 30.5. to  2.6 the Group of experts visited and discussed matters
with officials of the Ministry of Coordination and the representatives
of KYDEP (President of the Board of Directors, General Director and
other members of the Organization).
(d)    The results of these discussions were the following :
(1) KYDEP is nominated as the agency for the production and the opera-
tion of the proposed installations, and will be the owner of those
installations. KYDEP is a cooperative organization occupied with the
collection of domestic agricultural products.
It has the necessary personnel and experience, as well as Technical
Services which have already studied and build similar installations
all over the country.



-18-
(2) Twelve warehouses of a total capacity of 65,000 tons will be built
in different locations of the Prefecture as well as 11 corn drying
plants of a total capacity of 165 tons per hour, within the years
1981 and 1982. In addition five mobile small drying plants of a
total capacity of 30 tons per hour will be supplied for the needs
of the current year.
(3) The total cost of the above installations was originally assessed
and allotted as follows 8
1980                       1981              1982
5 mobile dryinq sheds                6 units            5 units
Financed by World Bank      20,000,000    336,000,000  194,000,000
KYDEP Capital               i4000,000       39,000,000   32,000,000
State Contribution (PI)          -         117,000,000   95,000,000
TOTAL :           22,000,000    392,000,000  321,000,000
According to the above, the World Bank will participate by 60%
the State by 30% and KYDEP by 10% in permanent installations,
while in the mobile units participation will be 90% by the W.B.
and 10% by KYDEP.
(4) In order to activate this section of the Loan, an additional
lo..n contract is signed between the Greek State and KYDEP, for
the amount of 450,000,000 with an interest rate of ll%, payable
in 12 years with a three - year period of grace.
KYDEP accepts the signing of this agreement subject to the
understanding that these investment will be part of the incentives,
stipulated by the laws in force, for regional industrial development
(region E)
The implementation of this program will result:
(I)   In the possibility of expanding the cultivation of corn in
Evros.
(1I)  The ftill exploitation with high income crops of the irrigated a
(III) In avoiding losses of corn crops due to the high humidity level
of harvested crops.
(IV)  In avoiding the payment of inactivity interest for the unused
section of the loan (105,000 dollars per year) for the extensio
of the Orestiada sugar factory,

3,3 Imnlementation Schedule
3.3.1  The original  time table for the implementation of the EDP (Special
Program for the Deielopment of Evros) anticipated its beginning in the
Fall of 1977 and its completion in June 1982, the final disbursement
of the Loan having been effected on the basis of the rqquired documents,
by the end of 1982. In 1982, the Bank approved , resting on thi objective
data for the implementation of the program, an extension for the date
of completion to the end of 1983, with the prospect of a further extension
to the end of 1984. In each case the date of final disbursement of the
loan extended by six (6) months. The Bank in 1984, unper the prism of the
economic development for the implementation of the Program, (withdrawals
up to 31.12.1983 amounted to $ 14,900,000) approved as a closing date that
of 31.12.1984 and as thw final date for withdrawals that of 31.6,1985.
It should be noted that already by the end of 1983, the expenses for the
works reached 5,500,000,000 Dre, as against the 2,190,900,000 Drs. of the
Appraisal, In spite-of this , the loan repayment was significantly eased
because of the relation of the coat in drachmae and the parity between
the dollar and drachmae, even through there was.a significant increase
in the amount of work being produced (increase in the capacity of the
corn Warehouse, longer forest - roads, improvement in the accessibility
of the Tyhero - Lagina road, expansion in the project for Social Centers,
with structures in surrounding -areas and indoor of much greater importance
than the ones anticipated,
The works of tye sectors of the project which were still going on in 1985
(Flood Control and works for the Development of the Erythropotamos plain,
Model Projects, Irrigation Works of Tihero - Filakto, Lyra- Lagina, Social
Center of Orestiada) were completed prior to December 1985e All the works
of the project were delibered in operation while the economic settlements
with contractors are still being effected through 1986. It did not become
possible to complete the land approtioning work at the Erythropotamos
valley because the topographical service was not able to organize the neces-
sary work shifts in spite of the constant notices by ODE.
Thus the time table for the execution of the it Special Project for the
Agricultural Development of Evros " appears to be the following (See relative
Annex I, table 2)
(a)   Date  for the commencement of the construction works Fall(October 1978)
(b)   Eytended duration  for the construction of the works and implementa-
tion of activities five (5) years (fall - Winter 1983)



-20-
(c) Extended duration for the completion of Loan Withdrawls 6 (aix) months
following the completion of the construction of the works (Spring 1984)
(d) Actual (qxecuted) duration for the implementation of the Project
(completion of works Fall - Winter 1985) 7 years.
(e) Time for the realization of Loan withdrawls (30 June 1985)
(f) Deviation from the expected time of Plan execution : 26 months
(g) Deviation from the original expected time of withdrawal completion
20 months.
3J3.2. The deviation from the original assessment of the total time needed for
the completion of the Plan are mainly due (a) to reasons of actual appli-
cation of the works planned, such as delays in the procedures of call for
bids  and awardings (mainly for cases of international tenders), serious
deviation from the assessed studies and programming with regard to the
actual size of the works involved (Flood Prevention works of Erythropotamos),
(b) the Appraisal's non - realistic assessment of the prevailing conditions
for the implementation of.-the program within the area of the works, mainly
in whaterever concerned the very average condition of the construction
force and the relatively small period allotted for construction.
Additional problems in the development of the works were caused at the
start, by the conditions prevailing upon the beginning of the Plan's
works as described in paragraph 3.3.1.
It should be noted that the interventions by the project Office in the
procedures and the occasional procedural problems faced by the Plan's
works, contributed in the actual continuation and success of the works
in such cases where the program of SPDE cudd have been greatly-impeded
(for example : the case of the substitution of the project for the extension
of the Orestiada Sugar Factory, expediting the procedures required for
the establishment of the DEN (Public Power Corporation) contractors at
Erythropotamos for the supply of power to Drillings etc.)
3,4    The Development Office drafted and delivered Progress Reports for the
implemented years of the EDP (1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 19829 1983, 1984)
as well as the corresponding detailed lists - tables - for the progress
of the works, quarterly, for the period of the 4th quarter of 1978 until
the second quarter of 1985. These reports as well as the progress tables
assisted in assessing the yearly course of the works and activities on
the part ofEDPO and also in informing extensively the State Authorities
of the Ministry of Coordination and the World Bank of the procedures and
progress of the Project.



-21-
3.5   supplies
The procedures for the dupply of equipment materials and the construction
of the works followed the general instructions of the World Bank and the
execution program was implemented quantitativ as stipulated *in the Appraisal.
In volu.e 1 Department 6 the special problems for each kind  of item
supplied are described and tables are given of the items and their cost
in comparison with the program.
In addition, in Annex I - table 2 gives the entire course and the total
cost by sector and kind of items supplied.
3.5.1 The basic problems which arose during the procedures followed, mainly
in the cases of International Tenders, were :
Time consuming procedures commencing from the announcement of the call
for bids, the holding of the bidding , the evaluation of the tender
documents and ending with the clearing through customs and the delivery
of the goods, many times exceeded 12 months.
-    Time consuming procedures for the issue of duty exemption,
wherever necessary, in clearing goods through customs directly
-    The need for repeating certain call for bids because specification
were not adequate or because a major deviation had occurred from
the estimated cost.
3.5.2 These problems were handled through the intervention of the Project Office
and through a series of resolutions by the RCCE, the CCCE and the advice
of the Bank (cases when Call for Bids were changed from International
to local in order to cut down on dates, establishment of committees
on location for the works ).
3.5.3 In such cases (supply of the equipment needed for the irrigation of
Erythropotamos, supply of Technical Education equipment) where delivery
of the goods, their receipt and their installation, as determined in the
supply agreement, would follow the expiration of the disbursement date of
the corresponding loan by the World Bank, through a proposal by the ODE
and Resolutions of the RCCE and CCCE as well as the assistance of the
Vank, payment of the suppliers was effected through their submittal of
Bond Securities.
In this manner, the Loan's serious disbursement problem of a total
amount of 320,000,000 Drs, was taken care of within the disbursement's
expiration date (30 June 1985)
3.5.4 The choice of supplies obtained having been dependent on their price,
in et least one case, was detrimental both qualitatively and quantita-
tively - case of ROMAN type trucks which were not used as much as expected,



-22-
In parallel spare parts for this vehicles were hard to find due to the
lack of a representative of that firm in Greece. This was also handled
directly through the  etbsesy of Rumania.;
35,5   No foreign consultant's or technical firms were used for the exocution
of the works and supplies during the entire period of the program's
implementation.
3.6   Coat
The calculation of the actual expense effected by category and item is,
given in table 3b of Annex I. These were calculated on the basis of the
systems observed of "additive calculation by category and project n
through the submittal, of each bill  and attestation forwarded to the
Office for the Development of Evros by the executing agencies, Public
Works Service, ERS, OTA, lst DEKE, Forestry Service , Ministry of Trade)
The calculation of the costs for the Silos and Dryers of Maize was ef-
fected on the basis of the yearly disbursement by the Public Investment
Program and the D.T. of KYDEP.
Expenses, as given analytically according to sector. - work and activities
in the "final table with EDP implementation data of Annex I Table 1 as
well as in the corresponding tables of each sector of the Plan are exact
and absolutely true.
Specialized scientists of the EDPO according to their particular field,
undertook the supervision and coordination of the works without the use
of computers.
In general expienses were comensurate to the occasional needs, local and
technical, of each particular work and adjusted to is requirements.
An assessment of the deviations from the original study and the results
of the call for bids (contract), of the final cost of each sector is
shown in some detail in the completion reports of the Activities of the
Project, (see bolume 2)
In general the following should be stated:
_ The positive (increase in cost) deviations in the final cost of the
works did not exceed the average of those noticed in similar constructions
at a national and local level and are mostly smaller. These were due
(a) to the special circumestances at the location of the works (for
example , short yearly construction periods resulting in delays and
the burden of revised construction costs, intervention of unforeseen



-23-
events such as damages due to storms or bad weather conditions ) (b) the
more general problems in the composing of studies and their observation
by constructing agencies as well as the response to cosntruction demands
by the local work force (see relat. chapt. III par. 3.1.1 sect. I and 1II),
(c) the need of adjustin, the actual structures and the usage og the works
to the wishes of  the prospective users (Local Government organization )
positive increase in production costs.
The negative deviations (decrease in cost) were noticeable in the cases
were work and supplies were effected through the supervision and detailed
accounting by the local services themeselves (YEB, Forest Directorate,EDPO)
assisted technically by the Office for the Development of Evros which sup-
plied personnel and equipment (see sectors : "Forest development, rural
roads, equipment of technical education, equipment for the irrigation of
Erythropotamos ").
3.6.1.   In the entire implementation of the Plan the comparison  of implementation
costs of the plan's sectors between the Greek and Foreign expenditures as
related to those foreseen in the Appraisal, is effected on the basis of
tables 3a and 3b of Annex I by sector and nature of the works and activities.
,On the basis of those two tables the following can be noted and remarked upon:
The anticipated increase due to the increase in size of the works in
the Appraisal was calculated at an 8% of the basic cost.
-    The anticipated increase of the cost of the works due to the  normal
increase in prices (inflation) was calculated to a total of 2Z6% for
the duration of the Program's implementation (five years).
-    The actual increase due to the increase in the size of the works was
higher because of the needs of the work and its users (see analytical
related " Reports on the completion  of the project's sectors " in
uolumell) and reached 30%.
The actual increase in the prices of the units for work  cosntruction
was comensurate for the period from 1978 to 1984 to the rate of
inflation for that period which is assessed as average, that is 20%
per year.
Finally the total cost in national currency involved for the imple-
mentation of the Plan : amounted to 6,091,200,000 Drs. against
2,958,640,000 Drs. which had been anticipated originally. The same
cost.iin dollars amounts to US $ 71,180,000 against US $ 81,100,000
which had been originally anticipated.

That is, for the entire period of the Plan's implementaffion we have, for
the entire works, an increase by 103% in the construction cost calcula-
ted in drachmas, while in USA dollar prices, this cost decreased by 9.92
million dollars (12% reduction),
3.6.2.The reasons for the above deviations have already been examined in general
above and are specifically analyzed by sector and job in the repors of Volume
2. It is. a fact however, that the evidenced total increase in drachmas of
the entire Program is lower, and naturally expected, due to the high yearly
inflation  index (20% year approximately) for the seven years of the program's
implementat ion.
On the contracy, the parity between the drachma and dollar , as well as
the conttol over an increase of expenses of the project through various
mecnanisms of control and choice of an "optimum critical construction path
and cost ", have resulted in a decrease of the total expense in the imple-
mentation of the Plan in terms of US dollars.
3.7 Financing sources :
3.7.1. According to the loan agreement between the Greek State and  World Bank, the
financing of the Plan with a total amount  of US $35,000,000 was anticipated
for the total cost of the program of US $ 81,000,000 e This financing covered
43% approximately of the total cost of the program and was analyzed as follower
Category  (1) Civil Engineering Works                       13,500,000 $
(W.B. participation : 32%)
(2) Equipment supplies                           19,000,000 $
(90% W.B. participation for
supplies from domestic sources
and 100 R' for supplies from abroad)
(3) Corn Warehouses and Dryers                   10,200,000 $
(60% WB participation for
Civil Engineering Works)                      9,700,000 $
90% for the supply of mobile Dryers)            500,000 $
(4) Experts                                       10ooo,OOO $
(W.B. participation 50%)
(5) Undistributed amount                          3,000,000 $
TOTAL :           35,oon0ooo $
During the implementation of the plan re - destributions of the above
amounts and percentages were effected mainly after the proposal by the ODE
and the Bank's agreement in order to a achieve better Loan absobption and
for better service of the works,



-25-
The final Status agreed upon in December 1984, was the following :
Category      (1)                    15,400,000 $
(2)                    7,400,000 $
"I         (3)  - (1)              7,200,000 $
Is         (3)  - (II)               100,000 $
nS         (4)                   _,0S O_S4
TOTAL s    32,000000 $
On the basis of the above distribution a disbursement, according to
category and project was effected from the total Loan of up to an amount
of US  $ 31t180,000. The amount which was not absorded (820,000 US dollars)
was due to the inability of disbursing the balance to civil engineering works
for Erythropotamos and the Pilot irrigRtion projects "Lyra - Lagina "
"Filaktou - Tiherou " whose construction was still continuing after 30.6.1985
and until the end of 1985.
3.7.2   As was already mantioned, during the course of the Project's implementation,
the need became evident, originally, for the.readjustment of the amounts menti-
oned for each category, mainly due to the increase in the cost of civil
engineering works as compared to those originally estimated, and the decrease
in the cost of equipment  supplies which had been  anticipated as being
much higher-.
A simple example : the supply of equipment for the Technical Lyceums had
been anticipated to cost 390,000,000 Drs. approximately , and actually cost
177,000,000 Drs. approximately, without having deviated from the original
specificatians.
Because of this, the bank proceeded to re - determine the amounts on the
basis of the total financing amount of $ 35,000,000
The drachmae - dollar par value development caused serous difficulties in
the full disbursement of the entire Loan (35,000,000 $) . Thus following
a proposal by the E.P.D.0 the Bank accepted the following adjustments as
of the end of 1982.
-    Increased the participation percentage in the civil engineering
works from 32% to 50%.
-    Accepted the increase of the actual construction in  miscellaneous
work sectors (Silo - Dryers, Pilot Projects, Connecting roads)
-    Redetermined the financing amounts according to each category,
in order that they be serviced by the work under construction.
Accepted that the amount of the Loan be reduced by the undistri-
buted sum of (S 3,000,000) in drder to avoid future payments of



-26-
interest on the unused portion.
- Accepted the request that the final disbursement date be etended twice, one
for the end (December) 1984 and later for the end of June 1985, for reasons'
leading to the service of a successful course of the Plan.
I V. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
The implementation of the Plan followed the general specifications stipulted in the
-Appraisal and the Loan agreement of the Greek State with the World Bank(Loan No.
1957 GR 17.6.1977) ratifed through L. 770/78 and L. 1307/82 for the complementary
agreement with KYDEP,
The possibility of facing directly the more general problems for the implementation
of the Plan (substitution of the Sector " Extension of the Oreatiada Sugar Factory"
with the building of a Warehouse and Drying Network "Protype Irrigation Works
of Lyra - Lagina, Filakto - Tyhero") at the level of feasibility and technical
studies by the same agency as the one used for the implementation of the project
(RCCE, E.D.P.03offered flexibility in the selection of the "critical path "' for
Plan implementation leading to a successful production of the Actual Units of the
work executed within the required time (see rel. chapters III , 3.1, 1, 3.2, 3.3)
The causes for any deviation as well as the measures taken in each particular sector
and project are described in detail in the relevant completion reports of Annex II.
4.1 Over-all Assessment
For the construction of the works and the supply of mechanical equipment of the
F.D.P the loan agreement stipulated that the responsible agencies would be the
following s
-    KYDEP for the  section of the loan  referred to the construction of the
corn warehouses and dryers,
-    The Greek State with its miscellaneous Services for the balance of the loan,
Another existing distinction was that the SPDE included :
-    Work executed through direct supervision.
-    Work executed through International Call for Bids (in these participated
membeT - countries of the World Bank and Switzerland).
-    Supply of equipment through domestic procedures.
-    Supply of equipment through International Call for Bids procedures.
As mentioned above, problems occurred in cases of projects and supplies
through international call for bids. These procedures were proven to be very
time consuming; As an example we shall mention the civil engineering works of
the flood prevention works of Erythropotamos (total budget : 1,900,000,000 Drs.)
'where :
-    The study was assigned in 1976 to a private technical office.



27-
- The final study was delivered in December 1977.
- The September 1979 the international call for bidds was effected (the cntirt
time, 2 years. was used for authorizations, ministerial resolutions,
time limits etc.)
In January 1980 the establishment of the contractor was completed.
- The contractor's work started in July  1980.
In the above case, it is possible, that the delay was unjustifiable.
Hawever moat of the time we refer to a delay of six to twelve months which
ould have been avoided (this matter is of particular importance with regard to
case  of works or supplies  with   small  budgets, which could have been executed
without any problem by locam builders).
It is true, that with regard to the E.D.P there is a lot of specul.ation as to
its effectiveness and its planning ° the selection of the locations of the
different activities, or even as to the final selections. The fact is that upon
the designing of the program, many errouneous assessments were made with regard
to the above which however were corrected during the implementation phase.
Certain erros were due to local interventions or the strong localization spirt,
while other to erroneous assesaments of market development.
The following procedure were followed during the program's implementation:
The Technical Studies were forwarded to the Local Government prior to
their approval,
- Certain works were executed directly by the Local Government (water,
supplies, model tourism plans etc.)
- Certain works were designed - proposed by the LG (irrigation model designs)
- Certain works whose execution was supervised by LG (Erythropotamos works,
carn warehouses, Tyhero - Lagina irrigation)
The LG participation in the supervision of the works executed for E.D.P. assisted
in timely handling of problems and solved certain problems which appeared
unsolvable,
Of particular importance is the help given by LG to the implementation of the
works at the areas of Filakto, Tihero, Lira and Lagina, by persuading the
inhabitants to cede farming areas - properties.
The Program was implemented through a production in actual units larger than
the oneoriginally assessed, according to percentage, which in many sectors
(Erythropotamos works, maize Sil.Dserban and Social Infrastructure Works, Model
Designs, Connecting Roads) exceeded 30 covering thus the immediate needs of
the areas and inhabitants wherever it intervened.



-28-
(See Volume 2 "Reports on Components completion). In spite of this, the extensio..
of the date for the completion of the works effected (end 1984) was more than
20% of the original five year period and the total cost in dollars was less by
approximately i0 million of the one originally assessed. In local currency the
total cost amounted to 6.1 billion Dr. approximately against 3.0 billion Drs.
approximately of the original estimate, with a total anticipated cost increase
however, as has been already mentioned, of 34% within the five years of the
Plan's implementation (26% from inflation  + 8% from increase in the amount
of the actual  work executed). Instead of this, inflation increased by 20%
per year approximately during the years 1978   1985 (total 140% ) while the
increase in the amount of the actual work executed was discussed above,
From the above , the macroeconomic benefit resulted from the entire management
and the implementation of the Project as a whole is quite obvious.
In assessing the Plan in general, it is of interest to note, that the State
has expressed its views by resolving "to aaell  the Evros exprience in other
¢roions throgLh _the i  lementation of integrated programs of regional Deve1opmen

CHAPTER  V. ..RQJECT RHEVEMENTS ECOSTS EBENEFITS  AND iRArE Or RETURN
5.1  Achievements of tar2ets
The project achieved almost all of its ovjectives in the constructior,
of productive and social infrastructure. In several cases project achievements
exceeded targets stated in the appraisal . Overall, the project had a very
good performance with details by component given next.
(i)    Flood Protection and Irri2ation
Appraisal targets and achievements in flood protection and irrigation
works are shown below :
ProJect                                Unit        Target     Actual    Achieved

Land Consolidation                      ha            -       4,620          -
Note : There were drilled 107 tubewells of which 71 were successful.
The objective of protection of 3,500 ha (gross) against a 50-year



flood is fully achieved. This objective has been realized with the construction
of levees (42.6 Km instead of 3000 planned) to the main river and the remodeling
and reshaping of the central channels of the Erythropotamos river and its
tributaries. Drains  have been constructed that discharge the water into the
river. The substantial increase in the volume of civil works points to either
inadequate preparation or supervis.on of the project.
The-project included in its activities land consolidation of the recleime'
areas because of the severe fragmentation of agricultural holdings in the area.
In addition, the project included construction of field roads for proper
access to, and  field drains for drainage, of the reclaimed land. Drainage
works have been completed. Land consolidation works have been delayed consi-
derably because they started after the completion of civil works if flood
protection and irrigation, The delay was caused by an inappropriate project
design which planned completion of civil works before land consolidation
could start, Experience during the construction phase of the project shows that
this w,.s not necessary and consolidation works could have proceeded right.
from the beginning. Further activities to complete land consolidation in 1986
and beyond are financed by the Greek Covernment (Public Investment Program)
so that project 3enefits will be fully realized, albeit with some delay.
Irrigation works that included the insjtallation of 71 tubewells
and a sprinkler system are complete. The actually irrigated area.is about
2,100 ha instead of 3,000 ha as planned in the appraisal. Actual use of
irrigation water, however, has not been fully realized because of delayed
progress of land consolidation works.
(ii)       Maize Dryinq and Storage
The construction of maize drying and storage facilities in Evros
was proposed by the Greek Government and was accepted by the Bank following
the cancolation of the sugar factory expansion. Details on targets and
achievemants are given below :
Proiect Output                  Unit       Tar.et     Actual    Achieved
Storage facilities                    tons     62,000       92,000       150

The construction of silos and the procurement of dryers has been
completed as planned and all units are in operation. The storage facilities
were increased by 50 percent when it was realized that maize production
:iin the area far exceeded estimates at the appraisal stage.

Tbere were constructed only 185 Km of forest road instead of 285 Km
planned in the appraisal . the deviation  was caused by the cancelation  of
road construction in one of the forest complex (DLS) was declared a wild bird
santuary. It is unlikely. however, that such action was not known far in
advance to the forest authorities, hence, project preparation was inadequate
on this point. Problems were also caused by delays Jn the procurement of
road construction equipment and the lack or non - availability in time of
spre  parts.of equipment. Reforestation works were completed as  plamed.
(iv)    Rural Roads
The objective of the rural roads component was the construction
of 253 Km of rural roads in 25 locations throughout Evros as well as the
purchase of equipment for rural road construction and maintenance. Targets
and achievements are shown below :

(v)    Connection Roads and Paved Road Maintenance
The objective of this component was the construction of 50 Km of
paved connection roads to several villages in Evros and the purchase of
road maintenance equipment. Targets and achievemnea are shown below :

(vi)      EtLfr Extension and Veterinary Service
The project had the following two objectives : (a) to purchase eight
vehicles for the extension services and 11 vehicles for the veterinary srvice;
wad (b) to purchaes field equipment and laboratory equipment for the Orest is
resarch  farm and equipment for the veterinary diagnostic  laboratory.
All targets have been achieved and purchase of vehicles and equipment has
bown copleted as planned,
(vii      Technical Education
The project included in Its objectives the construct In of a school
to be used as a technical lycee in the morning and as a vocational secondary
school in the afternoon. Also, the purchase of equ *sent for this school and
another similar  school in another location. Construction targets and achieve-
ments are shown below . As shown, targets have been achieved fully. However,
contruct in of buildings t*ve been severely  delayed with actual completion
in 1985 instead of 1979 as  planned, Siuilar delays were experienced in the
procurement of equipment.

The addition to the creation of physical infrastructure the project
provided for the establishment of a three-.tier coordination and management
system for the project. The project provided, also, for the creation of a
fund for financing of further studies and pilot projects. The organization
is charged with the implementation of the project. and with the assessment
of further resource potential of the area. Both targets have been achieved,
The Evros project office (the third tier) had at certain periods staff of
up to 31 instead of 4 as planned in the appraisal. The Evros Development
Fund financed activities within its mandate.
5.2    ProJect Cost
Project costs by component, appraised and actual, are given in Table
5.(l). Acttsl cost is higher than appraisal cost (even when we account for
contigencies) by 127 percent. Total cost reached 6.11 billion drs. instead
of 2.67 billion at appraisal. Cost overruns by component are also given in
Table 5. (1). The most important cost overrun is that of the Flood Protection
and Irrigation component which had an actual cost of 2.6 billion drs instead
of 0.6 billion dra as in the appraisal which almost doubled the components
share in total cost from 23 to 42,7 percent. Most of cost overrun in this
component is accounted by expenditure in civil Works for flood protection.
This is partly due to delays in the construction scheuule (expected completion
by end of 1980, actual completion end of 1985). A substantial part, however,
is attributable  to amch higher volume of civil works. For instance, the
number of trees cut 4ere 25,000 instead of 1,000 as in the appraisal. Simila'y
there was a substantial increase in the volume and distance of earthmoving
works. This points out problems either in the appraisal or in the supervision
of the project. Cost overruns for all other components reflect inflation and
higher project output. The expenditure by eomponent and by year is qiven in

5i3     *Pro  etBenefits
Project benefits by component are rather different from benefits
estimated in tha appraisal. Details by component are given next.
ti)       Flool Protection and Irriat ion
The Jevelopment of the Erythropotemae valley with flood protection,
irrigation works and consolidation of fragmented land holdings provides adi-
tional income tc farmers   protecting existing crops from flooding. In addi-
tion the project  allows a change in the cropping pattern and cropping intensi-
ty and also higher productivity through irrigation and consolidation of fragments(
land holdings. Flood protection has fully achieved its objectives and, hence,
complete realisaztion of expected benefits. For irrigation works, however,
objectives were only partially achieved (about 70 percent of target) with
result similarly lower ex post benefits. The delay in the coMilettion.of conso-
lidation works futher reduced the benefits of this component of the project.
The change in the design of the project (cancelation of the expansior
of the Orestias sugar factory and replacement with maize storege and drying
facilities ) had, also, adverse effects on the Erythropotamoe valley. Most of
the new capacity in storage and drying facilities was installed in other arese
(Ardas ) with higher maize production,
After the completion of the project works there is a discernible
change in emigration patterns and an increase in living standards, Whereas
such observations are fairly evident to those with knowledge of the area, lack
of a baseline survey or other statistical data precludes substantiation of such
observations with statistical evidence.
(ii)       Maize storage and Dryin2 Facilities
The development of maize production in the area is an indication
of the success of the uhoice for including maize storage and drying facilities
to replace the canceled expansion of the sugar factory. Maize production in
the area increased in 1984,to 222,000 stremmas with a total output of 237,000
tons, Such achievements exceed appraisal estimates for maize output of
150,000 to 200,000 tons in the area at full project development. Wheat production
has not, most probably, been affected by the introduction of the project as
land allocation data show and since most of the increase is maize output is
due to higher yields.
(iii)      Forestry
Thh objectives in Forest Road construction tore achieved by 65
pereant while those in Reforestation by 100 percent. The benefits of this



-36-
component are affected similarly. There was an increase in road density of
the forest from 340 streimi'5per KM oF road after the project compared to. 285
stremas per Km of road before the project. Road construction resuJted in an
increase in the productive forest area by 2.5 percent which implies an increase
in yield by 13,500 cubic meters per year (or the equivalent of 15 million drs.)
Also a reduction in cost by 16 percent in 1977 prices due to lower transporta-
tion coets. There were also benefits from an increase in the volume of fuelwood
for village residents, The following benefits are related to higher road divert,-
(a) Forest Service
increase in forest productive capacity (ha)                       1,250
increase  in annual yield (mt)                                   13,500
decrease in cort of transportation (dr/m3)                           60
(b) Forest  workers
increase in empoloyment per annum (hr)                           16,500
increase in income per annum (dr)                               43,200
(c) Village residents
fueleood production per annum (m3)                               9,500
The following benefits are related to the component of forest
workers transportation
(a) Forest Service
increase in productivity per annum (m3/worker)                      170
(b) Forest Workers
increase in income per annum (dr /worker)                       56,000
decrease inwalking time (and corresponding
increase in available time for farming)(hr Annum)                2,500
In addition to the above, the benefits that result from the
reforestation of 3.000 ha are :
(a) Forest Service
increase in forest stock  (m3)                                 750,000
invrease in annual yield (m 3/year)                             60,000
protertion from soil errosion (ha)                                  500
(b) Forest workers
increase in employement (hr/worker)                             90,000
increase in income per annum (drs/worker)                      48O,000
We can conclude, then, that the forestry component of the project
achieved its objectives and brought a substantial increase in the forest
output, income and productivity of forest workers and of village residents,



-37-
(iv)    Rural Roads
The objectives of rural road construction component were achieved
completely. The benefits accrue to 37 villages of the area (21,750 ha or about
40 percent of the agricultural area of those villages ) with population of
33,723 employed.' in 8,300 farms, An ex post (uatificstion of projqct benefits
in this component would require baseline and ox post surveys. of beneficiaries.
In the-absence of such information participant observations should suffice.
Such obsetrvations indicate a decrease in time and cost of transportation of
agricultural produce and agricultural outputs. Also it has been observed that
the indtroduction of mechanical cultivation has increased because of increased
land accessibility to tractors. Mechanical cultivation reduces labor demand
and relaxes seasonal labor constraints, hence, allows introduction of multiple-
cropping  and of higher value crops. The impact of rurai road constructiont
thus , is positive and significant on agricultural output, agricultural incomes,
and on standards of living for village residents.
(v)      Connection Roads and Paved Road  Maintenance
The objectives of this component were fully achieved with project output
about 20 percent higher than in the appraisal. The benefits of this component
were calculated at appraisal over an expected lifespan of 20 years from time
saved and lower use - cost for vehicles. An annual incresase of 6 percent
in road use for the period 1977 - 1987 and of 5 percent there - after was assurt,d
in the appraisal. Despite lack of statistical daLa, the increase in road is
estimated to be much highier than 6 percent and it is expected to increase even
more in later years in particular as a result fo the completion of flood pro-
tection projects of Sterna - Valtos - Neochorion and Lagina - Tycheron - Fylacton.
Hence, projects benefits for this component as estimated at appraisal represer,t.
the lower bound of expected future benefits and in fact they will be much
higher because of higher project output and higher use of the constructed roads.
(vi)     E uigment  for Extension and Veterinary Services
Targets for this component were fully achieved. The efficiency of both
the Extension and the Veterinary Services has increased substantially because
of the vehicles obtained, in terms of number of farms covered and in terms of
frequency of visits.



-38-
In this sense the benefits from this component are indirect and are
expected to be realised from increased output and productivity in crop and
livestock production in the irea. Such benefits have not been quantified in
the appraisal due to the difficulty in obtaining relevant data. We did not
attempt to quantify those benefits either. Ex post, however, we expect that
benefits will be realised since project output targets have been fully achieved.-
(vii)    Technical Education
Targets in this component were also achieved fully. Benefits from
workers with better education will be realised through higher productivity
in primary and secondary sectors. The interest of young students for technical
education in the area is increasing in response to the availability of the faci-
lities. The Didimotichon School increased its enrollment from 120 in 19Q1 to
230 in 1985 and the Orestias School from 250 in 1982 to 360 in 1985. Again
benefits from this component were not quantified at appraisal but are expected
to be positive and   significant.
(viii)   Conityreets, Centers  Markets and Water Suen x
Targets in this comonent were fully achieved with degree of achievement
ranging from 100 to 145 percent. This project component benefited 98t400 people
in 24 villages with construction of village roads,. community centers, retail
markets, 'and water supply systems. Benefits from this component were not quanti-
fied at appraiseal Nevertheless we know that project output was much higher
than planned, and also that the target population has been reached. Hence,
pr e jt benefits  are expected to be even higher than in the appraisal.
5a4     Ex 2ost Evaluatinn
The aggregate economic rate of return of the project based on major
project costs and benefits is 18 percent. The rate of return in the appraisal
was 16 percent. Including in the evaluation all project cost (adding the.cost
of the social infrastructure components ) the ex post rate ia 13 percent9
slightly higher than the rate in the appraisal. It can be concluded from the
aggregate ex post rate that the project had a very good performance. There are9
however , differences in performance between components. A detailed examination
of project performance by component shows their contribution to the aggr'egate
economic rate of return . The economic evaluation of the various component of
the project carried out separately with details given in Appendix II.



139-
The Internal Rate of Return for the Flood Control and Irrrigation compo-
fnet is 3 percent , much lower than the basic estimate of 14 percent in the
sapraisal0 The major reason responsible for the decrease in the ex post economic
rate is. cost overruns mainly in civil works for the flood protection component.
A second equally important reason is the lower realised benefits from irrigation
(actual irrigated land is only two thirds of appraisal targets.) A third reason
is the  substantial delay in civil works and the delay in the completion  of
land consolidation that postponed full use of irrigation.
The ex post economic rate of return of maize drying and storage component
is.34 percent, The economic rate of return at appraisal was 30 percent. The bene-
fits have been conservatively estimated (aee Appendix It) and, hance, the actua.l
returns may be even higher. The reaeons.of such success are several. First there
wore no substantial cost overruns if one accounts for the substantial increase
in the volume of project output (increase of storage facilities by 50 percent).
Second,.the component had a well defined objective given the trends in the
conamy of the area. Third, the construction of the. facilities did not experience
any serious delay.
The construction of forest roads had an economic rate of return of 17
poeent which is lower  than the rate of 55 percent at appraisal, however, it
is still considerably high. The decrease is explained by the lower achievement
in the construction of forest roads (185 Km constructed road instead of 285 km
planned 'at appraisal). However , only direct benefits were included in the ana-
lysis, hence, if one takes into account other benefits as well, for instance
walking time saved for forest workers, will lead to a much higher rate of return.
Reforestation has very high economic rate of return (33 percent) much
higher than in the appraisal (12 percent). This is probably due to the way hene-
fits were calculated (see Appendix II for details) or to the lower realised
cost (deflated) when inflation is taken into account. However, this component
is very small (about 15 percent) and its impact on the overall economic rate
of return is also very small.
The Rural roads component had an ex post rate of return of 24 percent
compared to 33 percent at appraisal.
The   Connection roads component had an ex post rate of return of 17
percert compared to 22 percent at appraisal.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL ORGANIZATION MEASURES AND DEVELOPMENT
6.1    Institutuional - Organiization
6.1.1  The Special Program for the Development of Evros was part of the catholic
Program of Regional Development implemented in the Region of the Evros
Prefecture.
The Program's main objectives wore s
(a) To improve the standard of living of the Prefecture's inhabitants,
(b) To increase the income of the Prefecture's inhabitants and the reduce
the disparities existing between regions which lead to the Prefecture's
desertion by its inhabitants,
The prticipation of the EDP in the total effort for works of infrastructu-
in thp Prefecture was the following:
-    in 1978 it represented      5%
-    in 1979  "                 30%
*  X    in 1980  "              35%
-    in 1981  "                 40%'
-    in 1982          "         40%
-    in 1983  n                 40%
in 1984  n                45% of the acailable credit as compared
to the total credit
-.   in 1985  "       "3   in the Prefecture
With regard to the total a,ailable credit for Public Investments in the
Prefecture the EDP finally represented s
-    47% of the land improvement construction works
-    50% of the forest improvement works (reforestation and forest roads)
_    80% of the rural roads construction
-    55% of the connection roads construction
-    60% of the community ctreetc construction
-    90% of the equipment supplied for the construction of the works.
-    65% for Silos construction
An important contribution by the E.D.P were the activities concerning
socio - cultura] infrastructure works. Such projects were :
-    The community  Centers which consisted of building complexes with
areas for libraries, meetings and theatrical presentations, for
the housing of the Local Government Services, the cultural agencies etc.
Twelve such centers have been and are being built from Samouthrace
to Dikes.



41-
Community Markets at Soufli, Didimoticho and Oreatiada, which close the
gap between the producer and the consumer and contribute to the improvement
of the products at smaller prices.
6.2. Administration and Or2anization
6.2,1 In order to implement the Evros Development Program and to coordinate the
different measures and actions taken to avoid delays, a major change was
effected in the sector of administrative- organization. Basically, a decentra-
lization of the administration was effected and most ites and problems which
concerned the implementation of the Program were handled locally, given the
fact that for tha first time, an authority which was redponsible for the neces-
sary procedures was installed at the area of the projects implementation.
Thus the administrative organization Includes
a, An Office  for the Development of the Evros staffed with qualified personnel
both scientific and auxilliary (post graduatL education, experience in the
eonstruction of works etc.) with head offices in Alexandroupolis.
b. The Regional Coordinating Committee of Evros, consisting of representatives
of all the.Ministries and. agencies within the Prefecture and Chaired
by the Evros Prefeet, with head offices in Alexandroupolis. Representatives
of the Local Government could also participated in this Committee at the
invitation of the Chairman.
c. The Central Coordinating Committee of Evros with head offices in Athens,
consisting of representatives of the Central Services and Ministries and
constituting a liaison with the agencies - Ministries effecting the works
and the World Bank, The secretariat of the Central Coordinating Committee
in Athens, which operates as a department of the Regional Policy and
Development of the Ministry of National Economy, has undertaken all the
sectors of the Plan prepared in Athens )preparation of the CCCE meetings,
issue of the yearly Program of Public Investments, Financing of the Program,.
correspondence with the World Bank, preparation of the certificates and
submittal of tys petitions for the withdrawal of the loan, preparation
and expediting of all the details of international call for bids etc.)
The Evros Development Project Office F.D.P.O was established legislatively
through L. 770/78, with competency that of implementing thw Evros Development
Project E.D.P. in cooperation with thw competent Public Services of Evros.
The composition of the office wee aJlso legislated by the same law and
consists of the following twenty five ( 25) employees holding the
corresapnding   positions:)                       *

- seven (7) positions for graduates of Higher Eduostion- Technical Schools
- one   (1) position  for Agriculture - Economist
- two   (2) positions Tor School of Economica'graduates
- two   (2) positions for Agriculturalists
six   (6) positioni for B'category Technicians

- tn   (1) position  for an accountant
- two   (2) position  for automobile driveFrs
one   (1) position  for a-clerk
one   (1) position  for a cleaning woman
Out of the above positions two were not filled during the entire priod
of the Program : one (1) for a Graduate of a Higher Technical School
and one (1) for a School of Economics' graduate.
The following were required from the Office established in Alexandroupolis:
- The preparation and approval of technical studies of the works.
- The preparation and approval of the technical specifications for
mechanical. eq-ipment.
The activation of all the'agencies for the program'a implementation
The preparation of specifications for the-assignment of the studjis.
With the personnel serving ODE, the imploentation of all the above
work began and the SPDE was put into effect. Thus s
It began  in 1978 with works aJready completed (rural roads, forest
roads) and continued with all simple works (conection roads, community
renter, Conmunity Streets , Water Supply, etc.) while in parallel
trying to activate all the components of the E.D.P.
- 1979 was the year for the program's development, wile 1980 was the
year for final implementation, during which (a) projects were completed
(connecting roads, urban roads, water supply etc.),.(b) equipment was
delivered (c! works that are still being carried out and (d) very few
works and supplies that have not yet begun.
1981 is the year for the full activation of ths program, as well as
the year during which thw completion of the works. began.
- In 1982 Call for Bids for the final works were effected and 50m of
the works was completed.
- In 1983 - 1984 one after the other the particular works of the
sectors of the Plan wer& completed and delivered in operation.
In short, the projects on which the ODE personnel mainly worked are
the followings

There were some problems in the wystem of observation and evaluation of
the E.D.P which were solved with the help of the World Bank's specialised
staff.
The purpose for the system of observation of the E.D.P. is to obtain infor-
mation to be used for correct decision taking by the program's administration.
Therefore, any system of observation of the E.DOPo would be incomplete if
during its organization, the needs of the program's administration were not
taken into consideration ~or information related to the organization pattern
of the program's administration as well as to the objectives served by the
specific organization pattern*
The CEDoP. administration was organized in two decision-taking levels t



-44-
The first decision-taking level consists of the Evros DeveloMn ProJect
Office nd of th  Rionsai Coordinating  Committee of Evros (RCCE) esta-
blished xt Alexsndroupol4 a and thaeco         decision-making  level
consists of the central coordination commitee of Evros (C.C.C.E) establi-
shed at the Ministry of Coordination in Athens.
The competencies of the first concerned the implementation of the E.D.P.
and its coordination with other program (Public Investmant Program,
Prefectural Programs, Program for Frontier Areas) effected in the Pre-
fecture. The competencies of the second included the observation of the
execution of the RCCE and its coordination at a national level with the
national and regional development programs.
The Organization of the oyetem for Monitoring of the E.D.P. was based on
the same organization principles of the E.D.P. Administration, that is
through distribution of the competencies of collecting, analyzing, assem-
bling of conclusions and the distribution of information accordingly.
The observation system of the E.D.P. consists of the following :
1. A Civil Engineering Works Progress Table. This table includes data
collected from miscellaneous Services and is submitted following the
approval by RCCE to the Ministry nf Coordination (CCE) and the World
Bank quarterly. The data contained in the table, provides the possibi-
lity of intervention when this is required, for the acceleration of
the SPOE works.
2. A Mechanical Equipment Supplies Progress Table. This table is ajec
completed as above and following the approval by the RCCE is submitted
quarterly to the Ministry of Coordination and the World Bank.
The collection of the data and the observation and coordination of the
implementation of the miscellaneous activities of the EDP , has been
assigned to the employees of the E.D.P.O. as described in detail in
the next chapter.
3. Yearly Progress Reports, which include further details on the implementa-
tion of the EDP. . These reports are discussed and approved also by
the CCCE before they are sent to the World Bank.
In addition to the above data, and in order to follow the progress of the
SPOE, the following are also kept :
- Tables of Economic Observation of the Program's Implementation.
This tables are used to follow the financing of thw program's projects
in order to avoid difficult situatione such as the in the  payment of
expenses.
- Memorandums for the course of the worka and the program's activities

as well as of the occuring problems.
Map showing thw movement of thw mechanical etc. equipment of the E.D.P.
For the evaluation of the Special Development  Project of Evros, our only
activities  have been the ctllection of data. Thus to this date, data  has
been collected on the following:
1.   Cultivations cost (yearly data) through the case of the Agriculture
Administrations.
2,   Economic data of agricultural exploitations (yearly data) throu.gh
the case- of the Agriculture Administrations.
3,   Areas and the- Production, of Agriculture and  Cattle   bkiding,
(ESYE, yearly data)
4,   Forest and fishing'product.on (yearly data)
5,,  Traffic (periodical data whith sampling research)
6.   Building activitieq, loans from Banks, automobile permits, investment
coats etc.
6.2.2.This organization, that is the-existance of Committees with the Office in
Alexandroupolis and the Secretariat in Athens, within an organizing unit
(the Regional Policy and Development Service of the Ministry of National
Economy)9 .reulted:
in avoiding red tape, as deliberations were.intra- service.
the direct communication with all the agencies executing thw works,
given the fact that they all participate in the management of the
project,
the propert planning for the construction of the works
_    the minimization of the period and cost required for the implementation
of the Program.
This organization for the Program's administration, had been proposed by the
Ministry of Coordination in 1976, during the Program's-preparatory period.
It was approved by the WB, included in the Loan Agreement (LOAN No 1457 GR
27 June 1977) and was ratified by Greek parliament through LAW 770/78
During the same period, instead of the adopted form for administrative orga-
nization, the establishment of a "Organization for the Agricultural Development
of Evros " had been proposed having as main shareholder the Agricultural
Bank of Greece and main object:
Regional Programming,
-    The preparation of technico - economic  feasibility studies.



- The implementation of the program and
- The publicity of the Program.
This independent Organizatien, would have faced very serious problems during
the Program"'s implementation, because s
(a)    It would be impossible for the planning and implementation procedures
not to depend on the State agency, The developrnt procedure is de-
pndent on each region. Daner would exist th&n local policy would
be applied without taking into consideration the more general objective
of regional policy.
(b)    It tee imposible for an independent Orgaization to exist without
other incom   sources then the eta. budget.
Experience an  logic have shown that exclusive depndence  from the
state badget would result finally, to the complete  quiding - leading
of the Organization by the State, without the latter being responsible
for the implementation of the works.
(c)    The cost for the implementation would be higher, given the fact that
all technical and administrative economic services would have to be
established to this effect.
Therefore , oxperience gained from the implmntation itself and the results
brought about from the operation of the E.D.P .Oo RCCE and CCE during the
Plan's. implementation have justified, in our opinion, the applied tactics
with regard to the Organization and Developmet of the Program's administrative
system.

7.1  The acceptance of Greece into the E.E.C. in 1981, and the development of
sugar prices  internationally created the need, as mentioned above, ,n G.S.1
to request the withdrawal of the Project's section which conserved the extensior
and improvement of production for the sugar factory at Orestias. This sector
was the only one that created a problem for the implementation of the Special
Program as a whole.
The flexibility ad adaptability of the actions of the agent for implementation
through the system of Monitoring
Implementation - Estimation of the Project allowed where ever was mentioned
in other parts of this Report (see chapt. III 3.2 of the General Copmletion
Report and volume 2d8, " Completion report of section "SILOS and ORYERS f),

In the remaining sectors, the planning of E.D.P. (priorities, profit possi-
bilities, consequenses) is considered absolutely seccesful sincet objecti-
vely, materialized promptly and effectively the Basic Goals of the Program h5
sewuring comfortable conditions for cultivation and production in the
valley of Erythropotawo through (a) the protection of 3,500 ha of land
for crops (msize, augarbeats, garden crop.) from the floods of tte river
'(pr.vious emergenav coefficiant for-floods 7:1, today's 1:50 years), (b)
' the cnstrution of a complete network of Rural roads and drainage system
over the whole aboWve   ntioned ares (c) the creation of an irrigation sy-
stem for 2,100 Ha with sprinklers (d) the creation of land redistribution,
for all farum of the Communities and settlements of the region.
The imv_mntt of transprtation for products and personnel by (a) the
construction and improvement of rural roads in adjacent areas of the Project,
(b) the cnstruction asphalt - paving of connection roads for the project
and settlements, where the &ccesS to the paved Provincial arnd National
network' was problemtic and impossible during the various seasons of the
yer, (c) the improvement of Forest production through reforestrations
and the construction of Forest roads in the Basic Forest groups.
The important improvement of the quality of living for the total popula-
tian of the Perfecture through works of Civil Soial substructure of the
project likes (a) the construction (Asphalt paving, concrete paving, elec.
trid lighting and ewage of rain waters) of city streets and community
streets, who appeared, indications of a egradation and.aerious deviation
from the accepted limits in this sector, (b) the construction of suitable
buildings to serve the need of Local Self - Administration and the deve-
lopment of the cultural and the activities of Public Education in the ba-
sic settlements of the perfecture,'(c) the constfuction of  enclosed
Weekly Local Markets in the (3) main towns of the perfecture which improved
theinfrsstructuredf concentration and transportation of Local products.
(d) the construction of external and internal water statious and networks
for the improvement of quality and the increase of quantity of drinking
water,
. The reinforcing of good function of Services for the sector of Primary
production (Forest Service, L,R.S. and Veterinary Service) by securing
proper equipment for laboratories, machines for Agricultural research,
construction of works for infrastructure.
- The significant support in the effort of conserving - storing for crops
of Maize, Sunflower and other cereals through the construction of a
network of Dryers and Silos,

- The function of Special Fund for the study of possibilities for the
Developmunt of Tourism, lodustry, mineral wealth, the developmen of the
harbour of Alexandroupolis and the undertaking for materialization of
Pilot Project3 for development. (Works for Touristic development of
Samothraki, Pilit Irrigation works for the area of Tychero - Phylacto,
Lyre, Laginea development of silk worm industry etc.)
- The support of efforts for rearticulation of Technical Education in the
Perfecture through the construction and equipment of the Technical Ly-
ceum and Vocational School at Didymotichon and the securing of proper
equipment for the Techni6al Lyceum and Vocational School at Orestias.
The creation of suitable institution (Evros Development Office) for the
implementation of Special Program in the total Regional Development and
the coordination of Regional Policy An the Perfecture,
7.2. The implementation of the Evros Special Development Program can be conside-
red as absolutely successful by taking into account the size of accompli-
shed Natural Units and the time - period that. their realized required.
The works and activities were many and intricate, however their realization
eas secured through the support and accomplishment of a new - radical frm  -
work of an instritution called "Special Program for total and intergrated
Regional Development" which appeared for the first time in Greece.
On the other hand the efficiency of the works contributed to the energizing
and participation of the reclers and the people of the region for the suc-
cessful meterialization of the Project.
703. From the above mentioned facts it is whown that the following factors contri-
buted to the successful materialization of the Project :
(a) The design of the works as a total grouping of Goals, Works and activi-
ties, made possible the facing of every problem and bad function during its
implementation according to the Regional Policy, which is : (1) Improvement
of the conditions of living and production in the area (II) No immigration
took place.(III) the reduction of inequalities in relation to the other
.egions of the country (IV) the ereation of advantages for the needs of tIase
retuming  to Greece from abvosd.
(b) The regulation of the Organization of the Special Institution for
Implementation as a whole (Central Coordinating Committee, Evros Regional
Committee, Evros Development Project, Secretariat of Central Coordination
Committee), surceded leterally to decentralize the administration. Most
issues and problems were faced locally during the prjgram, since for the
first time was installed in tho region of wotrJ  an grnan res,r naible for

them, which :
- coordinated the activities and avoided bureaucracy through interservice
comminications,
- cooidinated the efforts of alls concerned with the construction of works
through their participation in the Administration of the Projects,
- came to terms with the users of the works (O.T.A.) during the process of
design and construction of works in which they participated themselves,
- planned rationally the construction of works and the execution of other
activities of the Programt each year contributed to save time and make
less expensive the construction of the works by direct under - taking
the construction of the works by direct under - taking of the design
and supervision and incidental supplies where they were required.
(c) The functional forcasts for the implementation of the Project, which
have been proved rational, and the degree of flexibility for decisions of
adaptations for "crucial course" during its execution, that decreased the
possibilities of failure which could come from the existing local condi-
tions of constructional potential, the lack of specifications, the lack of
studies for implemention for-several sectors of the projects, and the suitable
personnel for supervision.
(d) The participation of Special Employees of World Bank in restituting the
functional problems of implementation (readgustment of the proqram of
Works, increase of physical quantities for separate works of the sectors of
the Program) and its financing (readjustment of participation percentages,
extention of time) has been a postive contribution to its general inter-
gration. The periodical inspections of the works through "on th spot
visits" as well as the exchange of correspondence with the Institution for
Implementation has been a "unigue" change for "direct" exchange of views and
ideas concerning the construction of works and the activities of the Project.
7,4. There are some basic "indicators" which reveal the positive importance which
the implementation of Evros Special Development Program had.
These are :
- The direct output of "basic works of infrastructure"and the high indicator
of their "internal Rate of Return" (see chapt.V)
- The  effect of the degree of output in the increase of production and pro-
ductivity, through the accelerated 4thm of rearticulation of crops and
the means for production (technology), mainly of the primary sector (see
Appendix II)
t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



50 -
- The creation of confidence and optimistic perspective for the future
of the region for the inhabitants and public services. A direct demon.
stration of this condition is (a) the trend for repatriation and set.
tlement of those returning from abroad (the increase of population was
in 1981 0.7X per year in front of yearlydiminution-rate of -1.25 in
the years 1961-1971) (b) the demand Mr.3 of local Self - Administration
Organisations in November 11,1984 on the following 8
e *o e"     o2. To propose tb the Government the establishment of an Orga.
nization for the Development of Evros with the participa.
tion of local functionaries from the self -administration,
the Cooperatives and the Public Services.
This organization must be a
a. To intergrate and make clear the Evros Development pro.
gram for sectors and branches, in cooperation with all
the proper state 6ervices
b, To draw up the necessary technical - economic studies
for the materialization of investments
c. To play the part of coordinator in planning the invest.
ments.
de To be on "Information Bank" for every sector and branch
for the development .of Evros, thus supporting the invest.
men of 'institutions and citizens.
e. To be the Secretariat of the Perfecture Council and con-
cultmnt for Technical Development. ......."
from the above it is clear that :
(t) The total successful outcome is more significant in quantity and also in
quality then any omissions and carelessnesses of the Planning and imple-
mentation as they were marked out and reported already in other sections
of this Report (see chapt. IV)
(It) The combination of goals that were set by the strategy for implementation
and execution of the total plan, has proved the correcness and attaina-
bility for the issues of the study, as well as the possibility of their
execution by the institution and particularly by its members.
(III) The great attention for integrating   of the purpose of the program within
the goals, did not permit the deviation of its "crucial course" towards
an easier course for the selection of" isolated works" but it gave through
the "actiona" qind tr execution of works and activitiep, J'an,inbtgzsted

model for implementation of the Development Project".
Generally this successfuloutcome., has strengthened the critical censide-
ration of its implementation and has persuated the "loca: factor" about
the necessity of its continuation on the eamr basis - idealistic, methodo-
loqical and technocratical - more rmanently         lonjeudurance.(see bove
decree.6f T.E.D.K.), according to the kJnd of attempted interference and
the source of its financing.
A good chance towards this direction, would be the "five years Regional
Program" for the perfecture of Evros and the implen.rnetion of thw "Mmdi-
teranean Integrated Programs" for the same region.

Flood Protection and irrigation
Incremental investmet is given in Table 5.2. This
was deflated to 1977 prices using the dotator of Public Invest-
met f=n the National Acounts of Greece. Opration and main-
tae for irrigation was.charged (9.S million drs per year
starting in 1986) using appraisal estimates of operation costs
adjusted for irrigated area.
Flood protection benefits were assumed to be realised
fully (44.6 million drs per year starting in 1987). Benefits
from irrigation were calCulated using a representative farm
model which gives increamental output by crop. Increamental
quantities of crops were valued at 1977 economic prices (as in
appraisal) and an aunual increamental crop output was obtained
(71.9 million dra). This benefits was reduced by the annual
cost of production using appraisal economic costs and actual
acreage by crop (20.7 million dra). Irrigation banefits were
assumed to start in 1987. Project benefits were assumed to
accrue until 2016 as in the appraisal.
M4aize Dryers and Storag
Incrmemntal investment is given in Table 5.2. Invest-
ment was deflated to 1977 prices. The operating cost (55.5
million dra per year) was estimated using appraisal cost esti-
mates o a typical unit. We. used a 10 percent higher number
of units than in the appraisal to reflect the increase in the
storage facilities. Given the nature of the project it is dif-
ficull% to stimate incremntal output. The following procedure



-72-
*is used. 14aize pro4istion before the project covered 56,000
stromas giving 34,000 tons of output with an average yield oi
0.6 tons per stremma (averages of the 1974-78 period). In 1984
maize production covered 211,000 stremmas giving'237,000 tons
output with an average yield of 1.07 tons per stremma. The
incrase, in area under maize is assumed to be the result of
charges in- relative pr±ice  follwing the accession of Greece-
to MCC, the completion of several irrigation projects in the
area, and the introduction of high yielding varieties. The
introduction of the high yielding varieties, however, would
have beeui uneconomical without investment in drying facilities
because of their extented growing period by 45 days compared
to traditional varieties. Hence, even if increase in area under
maize was achieved without the project (i.e. 211,000 stremmas)
the change from traditional to high yielding varieties was
made possible only with the existence of drying facilities.
Assuming that private drying facilities are also present in
the area we arrived at an incremantal output due to the project
around 62,000 tons (higher than the quantity dried but lower
than the quantity stored KYDEP). This incremental output was
valued with the economic price used at appraisal (281.7 million
drs per year) and was reduced by, the cost of production
(119,2 million drs per year). Cost of production was calculated
from an estimate of land required to produce the incremental
output of 62,000 tons. Project benefits were assumed to accrue
for 40 years.

Forest Roads and f)eforestation
Incremental investment is shown in Table 5.2. Incre-
mental yield is calculated as 15 million drs per year. This
accounts only for incrmental annual yield of the forest due
to the increase in the exploited forest area ignoring other
benefits. Harvesting costs were assumed 3.4 million drs per
year. Project benefits were assumed to continue to 2021.
Incremental investmnt is reforestation is given in
Table 5.2. Zncremeital yield was assumed to be the same as the
one used in the appraisal.
