The sub-projects will include such social sector\n            projects as the rehabilitation and construction of schools,\n            health stations and clinics, water supply sources, and\n            sanitation equipment.

The implementation of the\n            rehabilitation works will be carried out in a decentralized,\n            pragmatic, and flexible way, and will give a large\n            responsibility to the community for preparation and supervision."}, "docdt": "1996-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
