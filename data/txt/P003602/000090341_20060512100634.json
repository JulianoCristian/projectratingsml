Lessons learned from the project:\n            When new project agencies and implementing units are being\n            established in conjunction with a project, and related\n            institutional and financial sector reforms are to be\n            advanced, this project demonstrated the importance of\n            setting the corresponding reform targets. While the\n            monitoring indicators provided in the SAR, and subsequently\n            enhanced in conjunction with the additional works, were\n            overall comprehensive in the Chinese context. Project\n            agencies and implementing units should in future similar\n            projects include to the extent possible.
