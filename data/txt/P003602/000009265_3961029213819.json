The project will\n            support policy and institutional innovation, and provide\n            physical works for wastewater handling, air pollution\n            control, and solid waste management. Its components are the\n            following: 1) Wastewater management in Huangshi, Wuhan and\n            Xiangfan, comprising sewer systems, pump stations, and\n            wastewater treatment facilities; 2) municipal wastes\n            management in Huangshi, Wuhan, Xiangfan and Yichang,\n            comprising sanitary landfill development, waste transfer\n            facilities, vehicles and equipment; 3) industrial pollution\n            control; 4) Hubei environmental pollution control fund; 5)\n            water quality monitoring and management in Hubei and Wuhan\n            environmental monitoring centers, comprising water quality\n            monitoring technology, data management equipment, and\n            institutional development; and 6) institutional\n            strengthening through technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1995-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
