Lithuania implement the\n            structural reform program, aiming at reducing poverty,\n            through a rapid economic growth, within a macro-financial\n            stability setting. The reform program will correct\n            macroeconomic imbalances, and implement reforms in budget\n            management, pensions, and social assistance, private sector\n            development, and in the energy, and agricultural sectors.\n            The project will contribute to positive private foreign\n            borrowing, as well as to the country's eventual\n            accession to the European Union. However, given the\n            macroeconomic scenario, the lack of creditor confidence\n            would raise real interest rates, placing added pressure on\n            enterprise financing, and, public debt difficulties would\n            threaten further increases in budgetary arrears, risking\n            recovery growth, macro financial vulnerability, and poverty\n            increases. In addition, political risks are associated with\n            the upcoming parliamentary elections. Nonetheless,\n            widespread perception, and commitment by all political\n            parties to reforms, seem substantial, and risks will be\n            mitigated through regular consultation by the Bank, with a\n            broader group of civil society outside the government, donor\n            coordination, and regular supervision."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
