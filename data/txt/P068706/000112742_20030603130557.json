a satisfactory outcome with a\n            substantial development impact.  Project sustainability is\n            highly likely, with satisfactory performances by both the\n            Bank and the Borrower. The main objectives of SAL-II were\n            achieved, although problems arose in the implementation of\n            some second tranche reforms, resulting in delays in second\n            tranche release.  The operation was cancelled in June 2002\n            upon request of the Government, with the second tranche\n            undisbursed.  Lessons learned include the following.  The\n            traditional two-tranche structure of SAL-II worked well to\n            anchor reforms across governments.  Very strong initial\n            ownership, combined with a broad consensus across political\n            parties was important.  The comprehensive and ambitious\n            scope and content of SAL-II worked well.  High quality\n            supervision is important for any operation with continuity\n            as one component of quality supervision; and conscientious\n            efforts made to maintain continuity in the task team.  There\n            is a high payoff to analytic work.  In view of the\n            difficulties in implementing the privatization of Lithuania\n            Gas, a systematic review of privatization of infrastructure\n            and other enterprises operating in highly imperfect markets\n            is needed, drawing on the Bank's recent experience.\n            SAL-II had an important impact on the institutional\n            development agenda, by drawing on on-going technical\n            assistance, and supporting subsequent institutional reforms.\n            Where relevant projects are in place, there can be strong\n            synergies between the project and a SAL.  Finally, the\n            financial terms and structure of this loan (a\n            Euro-denominated, fixed spread loan, payable in 11 years\n            with a bullet principal repayment) reflect the wider range\n            of financing options that the Bank began offering clients in\n            the mid-1990s."}, "docdt": "2003-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
