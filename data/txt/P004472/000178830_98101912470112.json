"1772", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The proposed project seeks to promote\n            the accelerated development of the island of Samar, chosen\n            because of its poverty, low level of infrastructure and\n            development potential. It would include road and port\n            rehabilitation, irrigation construction, provision and\n            improvement of water supply facilities, schistosomiasis\n            control and consulting services for a feasibility study of\n            development in Northern Samar. The project would: (a) reduce\n            transport costs for farmers and improve road access to\n            markets and health and education facilities for some 40,500\n            rural families; (b) improve port facilities for travel,\n            import of food and construction materials, and export of\n            agricultural products; (c) provide irrigation facilities\n            which would benefit some 1,000 farm families and 500\n            landless laborers' families through increased\n            production and employment; (d) provide safe water for about\n            118,000 rural families, resulting in a reduction in\n            waterborne disease, and (e) provide chemotherapy for about\n            41,000 people suffering from schistosomiasis and lay the\n            groundwork for a wider control program. No unusual\n            implementation problems are expected since most of the works\n            are standard and would be carried out by agencies having\n            considerable experience in similar works."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
