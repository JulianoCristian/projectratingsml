The most appropriate rating to assign is\n            \"moderately satisfactory\". The project's\n            achievements on the policy reform and institutional side\n            have a high likelihood of being sustainable. The technical\n            capacity in the area of public health, health information,\n            licensing and accreditation, equipment planning and\n            maintenance, pharmaceutical regulation and contracting for\n            health services has substantially improved as a result of\n            the project and will thus have lasting effects. However,\n            many of the project's achievements will not be able to\n            bear their full fruit unless public resources flowing into\n            the sector will increase and the Government will make an\n            increased commitment towards using these resources in a\n            cost-effective manner. The Bank's overall performance\n            is rated moderately satisfactory. Considering the complexity\n            of the project and the fact that this was the first Bank\n            project in the health sector in Georgia, the Borrower's\n            overall performance is rated satisfactory. The key issue was\n            the inadequate financing of the health sector, a problem\n            well beyond the control of the implementing agencies.\n            Briefly, these are some of the other lessons learned: 1)\n            Align expectations with available resources. 2) Adapt\n            project complexity to local conditions. 3) Payment reform\n            alone is insufficient to bring about rationalization in the\n            hospital sector, nor is it realistic to expect market forces\n            alone to bring about the necessary hospital rationalization.\n            4) Continuous dialogue with stakeholders is critical to\n            assure support for reforms. 5)  Investment projects can\n            support but seldom bring about policy reform. 6) Provide for\n            adequate resources to fully implement activities initiated\n            under projects. 7) Draw on international expertise to\n            support complicated procurements. 8) Use long term\n            fellowship training with caution and link it to an\n            obligation of beneficiaries to return to their sponsoring\n            institution for a minimum period of time. 9) Clearly outline\n            expectations and roles of all involved in project\n            implementation and establish a mechanism to assure regular\n            communication and coordination across project components.\n            10) An important lesson pertaining to technical assistance\n            also is that terms of reference for consulting assignments\n            should be developed in close collaboration with the\n            beneficiary agency, but also be supported by relevant policy\n            makers to assure that outputs will be adequately utilized.\n            11) Support investments in public health and health\n            promotion with an adequate monitoring system."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
