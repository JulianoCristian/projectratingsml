     Borrower in improving the maintenance of the rapidly\n            deteriorating primary and secondary road network by\n            strengthening the responsible institutions through the\n            provision of equipment and technical assistance. The project\n            will also include a pilot rural road maintenance program, a\n            feasibility study and, if justified, detailed engineering of\n            either the Mansa-Kawambwa-Nchelenge road, or such other road\n            or roads as may be agreed. The main beneficiaries will be\n            the direct road users and the Borrower (through cost savings\n            on restoration of bitumen roads). Two risks could affect the\n            project's progress. The first is the possibility of\n            delay in recruiting the requisite technical assistance for\n            the institutions involved in road maintenance and the second\n            is the possibility that the performance of the organization\n            responsible for maintenance of plant and equipment may\n            improve more slowly than expected."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
