                         The supervision mission confirmed the project's progress in the last 15 months of operation on the backdrop of a somewhat more favorable political context, the strong commitment
                         from management of the Ministry of Finance and the focus on the strengthening its core functions and systems. After a change in project management last August, the project
                         benefited from a renewed momentum and improved prospects.

                         The sustainability of the project's development outcomes has improved thanks to the institutional strengthening of the MoF, through the adoption in March 2012 of the decree
                         establishing a macro fiscal unit in the budget directorate and the implementation of the public debt directorate decree. Strengthening these new units' leadership, staffing and
                         systems remains a priority.

                         Another key priority is the strengthening of the Ministry's financial management information systems (IFMIS) in view of the important weaknesses and risks identified by the functional
                         IT review carried out under the project. The Bank shared a policy note specifying the existing system's key weaknesses and recommending short and medium term improvements,
                         taking into account the lessons learned from a recent Bank wide evaluation of 30 years IFMIS projects. Authorities have expressed the desire to move towards an integrated IFMIS.

                         Aid management: (i) institutionalizing the Aid Management System and (ii) implementing the new procedure to open accounts at BdL for externally funded projects.

                         Training and capacity building: (i) the development of a training policy for the MoF and (ii) the development training modules and on the job trainings focusing on the Ministry's core
                         functions and revised procedures; (iii) the development of an electronic library to improve knowledge sharing and ensure wide and lasting access by MoF staff to the new procedures
                         and guidelines developed during the project.

                         While this project remains high risk, the focus on the above mentioned core systems and institutional strengthening somewhat improves the prospect of the project's development
                         outcomes.
